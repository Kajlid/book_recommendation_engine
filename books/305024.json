  "description": "I wasn't made to fall in love. I was drawn to drugs and alcohol the way people were drawn to relationships. I craved them. Yearned for them. Depended on them. Men were fun for one night at a time, no long term. Until him. His hazel eyes bore into my soul and see through my tough exterior. His pain mirrored mine even though he was fiteen years older than me with a vastly different life. He taught me who I am, helped me discover long-buried secrets, and ultimately heal from the wreckage. But that was his job. I paid him to fix me, but I never expected him to fix my heart. Liam Whitmore is more than my therapist. He's my savior. The one man I can depend on...as long as our relationship doesn't go up in flames.",
