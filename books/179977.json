  "description": "‘Love is mightier than the sword’ The Warming has caused turmoil on Earth. Seeking vengeance against Random Knight and the exiles for taking his castle, power obsessed Zacharias Azazel enlists a grotesque accomplice, Chaos the Navigator, and his ghost ship, The Morvydd, to help him commit a crime that will make every parent shudder with fear. As Lord Azazel grooms the Scion of the Knights as his heir, and prepares his soldiers to retake Castle Firamodor, Random and her companions run a gauntlet of obstacles in The Compendium, while Chaos forms Les Marionnettes, an army of children stolen from a century past and turned to stone. Set against a tale of sibling rivalry, time travel, and a war of angels between the Sachiel and the Marceline, past and future collide to create a heart-rending story of loss, discovery...and the most wonderful love of all.",
