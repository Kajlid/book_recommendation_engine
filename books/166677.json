  "description": "Bounty hunter Falon Harris is asked to go after outlaw biker Tom Kellen and tracks him to where he's hiding out in Stags Leap, KY, laying low and waiting for the heat to pass. Rita James operates a busy tavern/grill and occasionally rents out the little camper trailer on her back lot. Figuring the tavern is the most logical place to watch for Kellen, Falon rents the trailer for a week. The first night, while he's having dinner and watching everything, Kellen shows up and starts giving Rita a hard time. The bartender puts a stop to it, but Falon gets the idea it's happened before. Knowing Kellen's past, he knows the biker won't take no for an answer for long.",
