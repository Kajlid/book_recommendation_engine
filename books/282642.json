  "description": "A tale of the political, economic and social struggle between the generations, Young and Old. The battle line has been drawn as new legislation is drawn up by a social justice movement campaigning for equality between the generations. This story follows the struggles of the Older generation as they are pushed aside in employment, housing and, ultimately, life. The book is full of drama and political manipulation as the discrimination of the Older generation unfurls. Bill, a very ordinary widower, find himself with his neighbors, Hank and Jane, in the maelstrom of political events. The dramatic story follows the effects that the push for ‘equality’ had on their quiet life. They find themselves betrayed and pushed aside by the politics, society and eventually, even family.",
