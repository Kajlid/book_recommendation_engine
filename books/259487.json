As Kendig reveals more of him throughout the novel, readers are at times both sympathetic and frustrated with his choices. Fast-moving, surprising and engaging, Falcon is a must-read. – RT Book Reviews  Dramatic military adventures with all the heart-stopping adrenaline and details is what Ronie Kendig is known for, and Falcon delivers it all. Ronie Kendig is a master storyteller. This reviewer does not normally talk to her books, but I found myself yelling “NO” into the pages! Ronie’s sense of humor is such a breath of fresh air in the midst of all of the intensity that I laughed so hard. There were even a few out-loud gasps. Falcon is a must read. Guaranteed, the only reason you will want to put it down is to catch your breath! – Cristel Phelps, CBA Retailers",
