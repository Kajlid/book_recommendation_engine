  "description": "The sexy biker, Reefer, gave Sarah an hour's worth of sex in a kiss that lasted no more than ten seconds. He knocked her world off kilter; but little did he know, he'd set directly on target for his heart.Sarah always dreamed of joining a motorcycle gang and hitting the open road. What better way to escape a troubled childhood filled with poverty and alcoholism than to ride out and live a gypsy lifestyle? Her life changed the morning a biker stopped in the middle of the road and asked if she wanted a ride.Reefer had two rules: don’t mess around with women who didn’t grow up riding the road, and his biker family always came first. Nothing prepared him for the woman who hopped onto the back of his Harley with the ease of a born rider and peeled back the layers of his sealed heart.Two people running from a world full of hurt. Can they escape to find happiness or will they have to first revisit the past?",
