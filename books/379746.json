  "title": "Liberwocky: What Liberals Say and What They Really Mean",
  "description": "Laid out like a dictionary A-to-Z (much like Ambrose Bierce's Devil's Dictionary ), Liberwocky takes a close and comedic look at how liberals use and abuse language to manipulate the citizenry and their attitudes. Having forty years of political and media experience, Gold sees through the trickery of today's political rhetoric. And in this book, he exposes their techniques, their verbal twists and devious turns of phrase, in a way that is both provocative and hilarious. Including sections such \"Truly Stupid Liberal Ideas\" (poking fun at the U.N., Peurto Rican statehood, and voting rights for felons) and \"The American Liberal's All Time Enemies List\" (fifty conservatives liberals love to hate), this book-both mocking and informative-is an enjoyable romp through the language of modern politics.",
