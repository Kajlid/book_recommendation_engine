  "description": "What happens to disfigured actors? Where do they go once truth overwhelms beauty's lie? The Ensemble of Monsters was built for them -- the misbegotten souls still longing to reflect. Inside its walls, upon its stage, their light survives, and with it a blindingreflection of humanity's truth. In the Path of Monsters  is a story about what corrupts us; what the spirit can endure; the lengths to which we'll go in pursuit of love and friendship, purpose and plight, and the envy that steers us.This is the story of them -- the monsters, the others, the hooded and shadowed. Come see what they see.",
