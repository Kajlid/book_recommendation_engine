  "description": "Eric Quinn Stanton has never let pleasure interfere with business--until now. His practice is to arrive early and incognito at a job, to see firsthand what's working, and what's not. But he can't seem to see past Cindy's beautiful green eyes or her other generous assets. And he can't stop himself from testing the general manager's skills--on the job, and in the bedroom. But what will she think when she learns his true identity?",
