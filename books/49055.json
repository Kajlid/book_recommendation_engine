  "description": "In Depression-era America, U.S. Route 66 beckoned to those who yearned for a better life. Now beloved author Dorothy Garlock celebrates the dreamers who rode westward on... HOPE'S HIGHWAY Margie Kinnard is thrilled when the father she barely knows agrees to take her to California. For years, she's yearned to try her luck in Hollywood. But her troubles start the moment she steps into his truck. Ornery and embittered, Elmer Kinnard couldn't care less about his daughter or the families driving with them: the parents whose blind son longs for a radio career; the husband whose wife will flirt with anything in pants; the brother and sister united by fierce loyalty and hope. But Margie is intensely interested in everyone-especially the rough-hewn rancher who later joins their little caravan with his niece. Brady Hoyt, who knows all about heartbreak, has no intention of getting within ten feet of Margie, just as Margie has no intention of sacrificing her movie star dreams for a man with a ready-made family. Until tragedy strikes, someone turns traitor, and a dangerous piece of Brady's past threatens them all on the highway they call Route 66.",
