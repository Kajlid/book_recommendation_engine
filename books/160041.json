  "description": "That day on the road took everything from Alice Montgomery. Her beautiful face, her father’s keen mind, and her precious horse. One tiny moment, one horrible accident that left her trapped in a burning truck. They say she was lucky to survive. They lied. Nearly a year later, Alice feels the pain and sadness from that day just as fresh as if it had happened yesterday. Her surviving is barely hanging on. How do you live when all you once lived for is dead and gone? Then one day opportunity knocks on the door. It’s the chance to heal, to move on. Finally, Alice feels something besides the familiar, aching pain. And it’s time to leave the fire behind.",
