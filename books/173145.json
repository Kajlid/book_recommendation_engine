  "title": "Timeless",
  "description": "Timeless is an ambitious and challenging undertaking for me. It is a “combination sequel,” meaning it is a sequel to both the Blue Fire Saga books and to my Anomaly book, mixing characters and storylines from both. I’ve made every effort to write the book so that it can be enjoyed by Blue Fire fans without reading Anomaly first. Even so, you will almost certainly enjoy Timeless much more if you do read Anomaly prior to embarking on your journey in Timeless.",
