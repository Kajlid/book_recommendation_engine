  "title": "Pink Poodle Pie: Other Tales of How Women Get Even",
  "description": "Packed with humor, angst, and that get-even quality women are born with, this collection offers an insight into the workings of the heart and devious mind when \"done wrong.\" These stories stitch a quilt of fun and mayhem that prove the inner strength of women. Amanda and Lori dish up poison. Randy sends her beloved to the same psych ward he had planned to confine her to. Mama uses her computer to move money out of reach. Marylou, with help from an aunt with a generation-old grievance, seeks revenge against a lawman who thought he ruled the women in his county henhouse. Gathered here are women from across the country who have never met but who offer a glimpse of a hidden-until-needed attribute they all shareâ”€the willingness, the capability, and the joy, to seek revenge.",
