  "title": "Lady Gaga (Blue Banner Biographies)",
  "description": "At age four, Lady Gaga was learning to play piano without formal instruction. By age fifteen, she was already starting to live her musical dream by performing in New York nightclubs. At age seventeen, she entered into one of the world s most prestigious art schools. And before the age of twenty-five, she had multiple music awards in her pocket, singles that topped the charts, performed before royalty and world leaders, and was even named one of Barbara Walters Most Fascinating People of 2009. Lady Gaga didn t rise to the top by blending in. Her unique style sometimes risqu√© and controversial reveals her personality, her love of art, and her belief that it is important to be comfortable with who you are. While others are trying to find their spot in the world, Lady Gaga is proof that you can make your own, that persistence pays off, and that you can live your biggest dream!",
