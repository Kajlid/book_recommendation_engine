  "description": "Disavowed spy Charlie Muffin wages war against his former employers. Charlie Muffin has come back to England. The ex-spy, a veteran of 25 years' service to the Crown, was last seen in Berlin, where an attempt on his life by his own organization led to international embarrassment. They had expected Charlie - a disheveled, middle-aged survivor of every double cross in the book - to die easily. Instead, he disappeared. But after months on the run, dulling his instincts with alcohol and laziness, the strain of life in the shadows finally gets to Charlie. By now the heat back home must have died down, and he shouldn't have any trouble sneaking across the Channel. Now, he expects, he can finally be safe in England. Charlie Muffin is dead wrong.",
