  "description": "After a year of traveling abroad, my parents finally trap my free-spirit into college. Even worse, my dad’s former-stepbrother has a room with my name on it.The only thing I remember about Uncle Willem is his boring button-down shirts and quiet demeanor.Except the rugged man who opens his home to me—filling out his t-shirt better than any person should—is not the man I remember. Standing here drooling over his easy dimpled smile, I wonder if I really looked at him at all.Because Willem is anything but boring and, based on the way his eyes linger on my ripped jeans and thin shirt, he is anything but bored by me.Add in that he’s a professor at my college and my major went from ‘undecided’ to ‘him’. He tries to hold back, but I have other plans in mind.College can’t start soon enough. I can’t wait to misbehave and get sent to the professor's office.One touch. One kiss. Each starts with a simple promise: Just for a little while.*Previously published in the USA Today Bestselling anthology, Stories of September. Now with bonus chapters and an extended epilogue.",
