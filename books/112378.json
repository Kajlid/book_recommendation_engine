  "description": "England's most famous witch trial took place in Lancashire in 1612. Ten of the so-called Pendle Witches were hanged at Lancaster Castle after being deemed guilty of witchcraft. Their ghosts reputedly haunt the village of New church which is where one of the witches is said to be buried. The Winter children can't pass up a good troublesome mystery while traveling with their Archeological/Librarian Scholar father. On this trip, they travel to New Castle, England to solve the mystery of the Pendleton Witches. Is this just plain hocus pocus or something real?",
