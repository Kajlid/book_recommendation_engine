  "description": "Fifteen-year-old Ever is blind. Only able to see what her boyfriend, Fox, looks at, which is most often herself. But sometimes it’s also the muscled men who kidnapped Ever and Fox, and sometimes it’s an unused mall in New York City where the two teens are locked up until they’ll come into the paranormal gifts for which they were stolen. Having spent years in this mall, Ever is ready to do anything to escape. Not so with Fox. Yes, he longs to escape too, but there’s one thing that he values above his freedom. It’s Ever’s love. So when the two try to break out of their prison and Fox imagines he is losing Ever’s affections because of it, he begins to sabotage their escape, and it’s up to Ever to stop him and get them both out of the mall. There is just one catch: because of the mess Fox created, Ever can salvage only one thing—either her love for him or freedom for them both.",
