Elizabeth and her friends are there to help bride Haven with last minute details for her destination wedding.

But handsome Max Sullivan is something she vaguely remembers–fun. Her friends encourage her to indulge herself in a week-long fling. But when she gives into desire, will she also give up her heart?",
