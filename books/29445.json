  "description": "Behind everyone's official life lies the unofficial, secret and perhaps ultimately more real existence. The Hidden Life of Humans, an outrageously hilarious novel, lays bare the entirely comic disparity between our private and public selves, as seen through two very different points of view; human and canine. Dana Jaeger, a single woman in her early 40s with an unswerving allegiance to a state of arrested adolescence and Murphy, the opinionated canine for whom she is sitting for an ex-lover tell a charming tale of relationships and understanding. Often hilarious, full of colorful and compelling characters and laced with humor and romance, The Hidden Life of Humans exposes a world of hidden truths, equivocating realities and parallel galaxies.",
