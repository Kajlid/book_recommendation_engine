  "title": "Bellies and Bullseyes: The Outrageous True Story of Darts",
  "description": "Covering everything from the early days of hustling in pubs and the 1960s money race pub competitions that spawned the likes of John Lowe and Eric Bristow, to the glory days of ITV’s brilliantly daft Indoor League; this book moves from the bling of Bobby George and the belly of Jocky Wilson to Sid’s part in the schism between the BDO and newly formed PDC. It mixes Sid's own \"I was there\" story with the entire story of darts—a kind of comic Darts Babylon that features every event and every character to walk the oche from Eric \"The Crafty Cockney\" Bristow to Phil \"The Power\" Taylor. The whole thing has a distinct whiff of cigarettes, alcohol, hot tungsten, and moist polyester. Sid knows all the stars as intimate friends and has been instrumental in the game's progress himself and his writing is as colorful as his commentary. Sid is something of a legend and since he started in the 1970s has had more column inches than Richie Benaud and John Motson combined.",
