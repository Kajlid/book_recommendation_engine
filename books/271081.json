  "description": "When a secret from Holly Weldon’s past threatens to consume everything she values, she must find the strength to fight for those she loves.  Holly has just relocated to an idyllic suburb with her loving husband Mike and baby daughter Clare. The quiet, peaceful street is the farthest thing imaginable from the aftermath of violence Holly encountered in her work as a forensic pathologist in the city.  But as the family settles into their new home, a strange sense of foreboding moves in with them. At first, Holly dismisses this as new parent jitters. However, soon the unusual—and dangerous—occurrences on Holly’s tree-lined block become impossible to ignore.  As her days and nights grow more isolated and filled with paranoia, Holly struggles to convince others that the threat isn’t just in her imagination. In the end, when Holly’s sanity is questioned and the violence around her escalates, she’s forced to take a stand to save her newborn daughter, and herself.",
