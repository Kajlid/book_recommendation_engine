  "description": "As Liar’s Edge records a new album, goes on their second tour in six months and brings a new manager into the fold, the lasting power of the band will be tested. As the front man of the group, Zack Easton is the one left holding it all together. But when Zack’s relationship with his fiancée, Emily Cole, is tested, he needs his band mates more than ever as he prepares to fight to keep her in his life. Of course Zack knows that sometimes it doesn’t matter how hard you fight if the other person isn’t willing to fight for the same cause. A year ago Andrew Bryce made a huge mistake when he met Cole Stephenson, and after letting his guard down for one night, he vowed to forget about Cole and move forward with his life. He never planned that what happened between him and Cole would come back to haunt him. When he sees Cole at a Liar’s Edge show, everything he felt, everything he tried to bury comes rushing back. But Cole isn’t who Andrew wants. He’s not gay. He can’t have feelings for another man. But he does, and they’re strong feelings. Sometimes you can’t help who you fall in love with, and what Andrew soon realizes is that he never had any control over the course his life would take, especially when it came to Cole. Shattered Crowns is the third book in the Broken Fairytales series. It’s the story of two relationships, one band and what it takes to make it, not only in the music world, but also in life and love. And sometimes it’s the people you bring with you along the way who make it all matter.",
