  "description": "Childhood Friends Reunite to Rendezvous!All giggles and wiggles, Lisa and Amy sealed their friendship under the pink ruffles of a canopy bed, promising to be friends forever. They remained inseparable until an argument over Lisa’s prom date divides them. In a plan that could only be devised by their heavenly Father, Amy and Lisa end up in the same hospital emergency room years later. With their promise to always be there for each other unexpectedly fulfilled, the two friends grow close again. Amy reminds Lisa of one of their childhood promises yet to be realized—their plan to rendezvous in Paris. Amy and Lisa find a way to make good on their Parisian promise from thirty years ago and pack their bags for the adventure of a lifetime. From becoming unexpected counselors for a rocky marriage to scaling the Eiffel Tower to winking at Mona Lisa in the Louvre, these two Sisterchicks find the treasures of Europe can’t compare with the gems of a friendship renewed for eternity!Story Behind the Book“Each of the Sisterchicks books portrays the reality of how a close friendship between two women can draw them closer to God, and reveal clear direction for their futures. In Sisterchicks Say Ooh-La-La! , readers discover the value of rekindling an old friendship and replacing old, incorrect assumptions with new truth. I hope readers will take away a sense of God’s immense plan for His children and His unending grace in every season of life.”—Robin Jones Gunn",
