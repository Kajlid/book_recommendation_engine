  "description": "Bri's uncertain of whether she finds it more unnerving or thrilling that Kole, a warrior well over six feet in height and built like the hulk, watches her with hungry, covetous eyes, until the slavers who captured her toss her into his habitat with him for breeding. Then she knows it's both, but it's even more unsettling to find herself the object of desire of two six and a half foot males-particularly since Kole and Dansk seem perfectly willing fight to the death to settle which of them gets to breed her.",
