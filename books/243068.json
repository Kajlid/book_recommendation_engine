Ten Vampire Vignettes, including five brand new stories and five reader favorites from her blog, all in print for the first time. They range from the wild and dusty streets of post-Gold Rush San Francisco, to the vicious halls of the U.S. Capitol today, and every place along the way.These are the stories in between the books, the slices of life that happen as the vampires of North America defend their lives, uncover secrets, and sometimes, simply take a moment to romance the women they love.As always, be forewarned, there is sex in these stories. But Reynolds’s readers wouldn’t have it any other way!",
