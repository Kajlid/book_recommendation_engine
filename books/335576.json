Amid the chaos and debauchery, two visiting graduate students, Langston and Azaril, search for a friend who suddenly goes missing — Damian, a charismatic seducer who has drawn the two of them into his orbit in the past. Frustrated in their initial attempts to trace Damian's whereabouts, the two seek help from Langston's aunt, a renowned psychic, whose cryptic warnings and unexpected hunches guide them on a quest that takes them to New Haven and New York City and entangles them in the investigation of Damian's family history — and draws the hostile attention of powerful and apparently supernatural forces.",
