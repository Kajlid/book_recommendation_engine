  "description": "Sometimes, survival depends on not being seen.I should know. That’s the only way I’ve survived. Getting accepted into a prestigious university was my chance at freedom; to escape and live without fear and resentment.And with no emotional attachments--or at least that was the plan.Until I see Egan.He’s sexy, mysterious, and has muscles in all the right places. He invokes feelings I don’t want or understand.The more he shows up, the harder of a time I have remembering why staying away from him was a good idea. But he brings deep, dark secrets that alter my entire world.Monsters exist. Witches cast spells. And animals may be human after all.I either embrace fate and enter a strange new world full of risks like never before or walk away.Maybe, I'm destined for heartache because sometimes, love isn't worth what it costs to fall.If you can't get enough of books by Patricia Briggs, Ilona Andrews, K.F. Breene, Kelly St. Claire, Shannon Mayer, Leia Stone, and Jaymin Eve, then you'll love this paranormal romance.",
