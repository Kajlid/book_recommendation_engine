  "description": "Although Arthur Rimbaud stopped writing at the age of 19, he possessed the most revolutionary talent of the century. His poetry & prose have increasingly influenced major writers. To his masterpiece A Season in Hell is here added Rimbaud's longest & possibly greatest single poem The Drunken Boat, with the original French en face Illuminations, Rimbaud's major works are available as bilingual New Directions Paperbooks. The reputation of A Season in Hell, which is a poetic record of a man's examination of his own depths, has steadily increased over the years. Upon the 1st publication of Varese's translation by New Directions, the Saturday Review wrote: \"One may at last suggest that the translation of A Season in Hell has reached a conclusive point...\" Concerning the 25-stanza The Drunken Boat, Dr Enid Starkie of Oxford University has written: \"(It's) an anthology of separate lines of astonishing evocative magic which linger in the mind like isolated jewels.\" Rimbaud's life was so extraordinary that it has taken on the quality of a myth. A biographical chronology is included.",
