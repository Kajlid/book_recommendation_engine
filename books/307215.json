  "description": "Born a Sidhe princess, Star has done everything in her power to leave her heritage behind her. She's carved out a life for herself in the bustle of New York City, content with her books, her coffee and her few friends. But the past is about to catch up with her. The time has come for her to fulfill her duty and Queen Luna is determined to see the matter accomplished. Centauri is a warrior of the Tuatha de'. It is his task to see the reluctant princess wed to maintain the balance of the Fae kingdoms. But he is going to need all of his legendary control to deal with the impulsive woman who seems intent on unraveling all of his plans. But there are plots afoot in the Fae kingdoms, plans that go deeper than either of them realize. Only by learning to trust in one another can they avert disaster. In the magic of the Fae realms, one thing is for certain - happily ever after is never assured and true love is a prize above dragon's treasure.",
