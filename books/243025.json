  "description": "A month ago, Margaret Haart’s husband left her for a college girl. A week ago, her father died in a car crash near his coastal Maine home. She has come to retrieve his dog and belongings, before deciding what to do with his house. In the morning light, Margaret is drawn to a looming structure nearby: a decrepit mansion, where she finds Esther Brandt living alone, terrorized by local children who throw rocks at her windows, and thinking she hears dead family members walking the halls at night. Sixty years a lonely and frightened woman, Esther is the last surviving member of her once-great family. Esther doesn’t use electric lights, telephone or television because she believes herself to be an EMF hypersensitive, one who suffers pain in the presence of electromagnetic fields. And, she tells Margaret, she is under nightly attack by searing radiation of an unknown source. Horrified by the old woman's mental state and plight, Margaret turns for help to the townspeople, only to find they have been ground to dust by Esther’s long-dead father and his long-closed mill. The only person stepping up to help is Ruth, a brassy school teacher and the only local who drove to Massachusetts for Margaret's father’s wake. Esther may be crazed, Ruth tells Margaret, but she is not crazy. Atop the hill behind the Brandt estate, a 21st century robber-baron has begun night flights from a reactivated World War II airfield. High Ground Technologies is perfecting an airborne laser weapon, launching test flights that pass almost directly over the Brandt mansion on their way out into the skies above the North Atlantic.",
