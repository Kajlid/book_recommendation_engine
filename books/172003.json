With the Empress’ health failing and rumors of a change in the line of succession, her place in the royal line is once more in jeopardy.

In the ultimate battle for the crown, new alliances will be forged, loyalties will be tested, and blood will be shed. Don’t miss this breathtaking conclusion to the Stolen Empire series! Queen of Tomorrow is a YA historical fiction based on the life of young Catherine the Great.
