  "description": "In Shaman Gurl, the infamous mentat Dr. Drea Burbank delivers an irreverent take on spiritual awakening, yoga, and coming-of-age as a high-IQ female from the wrong side of the tracks. A roller-coaster tale spanning a kundalini awakening in medical school, a nine-year career fighting wildfires, and life as a reluctant spiritual teacher. Drea transitions from an off-the-grid childhood to a high-tech consulting career in the Ivy leagues, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley.Along the way Burbank uses her unique perspective to dissect modern issues of class, gender, spirituality, and intellect. She answers contemporary What is a good life? What are meaningful relationships? How do I regain the magic in my life? Why do all the spiritual teachers seem to come from other cultures, other times? What is spirituality anyway?Modern life is divorced from spirituality, modern adults are divorced from their inner wildness, and modern cultures are struggling to integrate technological change with what it truly means to be human. Westerners mistakenly believe that shamans only originate from other lineages. They fail to recognize the spiritual resources that sprout, and grow in their midst, speaking their language, wearing their clothes, and using their metaphors. Standing beside them with a wink, a grin, and a well-timed emoticon :)Drea’s story is a cold splash of water in the face of our collective anomie. \"Waking up is a human right, anyone can do it. From any culture, any place and time. If I can do it, you can too. This book is to help you decide if you really want to.\" — Drea Burbank MD, Shaman Gurl",
