  "description": "I’m a monster.The Boogeyman.The thing you fear in the dark.I’ve killed countless men and women, and I have no plans to stop.They locked me up. Called me insane.Until I escaped.Raven’s Vale is mine. Well, partially mine.Crash and Kane help me rule over this small town.I’ve never wanted anything other than watching the life fade from someone’s eyes after I’ve taken my knives to them.Until Hollis.She makes me question whether there’s still a heart beating in my chest.For some reason, I want her… and I don’t want to kill her.I want her under me. Submitting to my every whim.But I crave her fear too.She’s my obsession…And I’ll stop at nothing to make her mine. If you have triggers, please proceed with caution. This is not a sweet romance. The Raven's Vale Psychos series contains very dark content, including a true anti-hero. For everyone who enjoys twisted tales, morally gray to totally depraved characters, and lots of adult action in your books -- this one is for you! There's no cheating. No cliffhanger. And a rather twisted version of happily-ever-after.",
