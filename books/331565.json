Cordell must return home to England, but to do so, she is forced to take safe passage as the bride of the arrogantly handsome courtier Roger Allington. It is to be a marriage in name only.Although Roger was her father's friend, Cordell fears he is a traitor to the Crown. And Roger, honor-bound to protect Sir Anthony's daughter, has no liking for her reckless ways. Yet his heart tells him he must pursue this mettlesome beauty - through a maze of plots and into the shadow of the Tower - to win her love and ignite their smoldering passion.",
