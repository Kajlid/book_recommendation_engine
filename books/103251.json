  "description": "Ashkii Fisher is a bear shifter, and he has no place within the pack of luna werewolves. They are welcoming and kind, however, and after the death of his mate so many months ago, he cannot help but stay, even if he is somewhat disappointed they haven’t killed him.Then he meets his mate, another omega luna werewolf who is running away from something. Ash thought he would have only one mate in life, so he is stunned to learn that he has another, and he won’t let anything happen to this one.David Austen did something that very few omega luna wolves survive. He broke off his mating with the alpha that he’d spent years of his life with. Tired of being abused, he was willing to risk death to get away. Severing the connection didn’t kill him, however, but his former mate just might if he finds David.",
