  "description": "What happens when a smoking hot, but grouchy vet meets a sunny and sassy optimist? An opposites attract, grumpy boss, small town romance that’s otterly irresistible. \nBroody wildlife veterinarian Griffin Foster is done. Done trying to save the world. Done getting attached. He’s been fired twice for standing his ground and now he’s going to be content — by God — in small-town Louisiana, in a small veterinary practice, where there will only be small problems.  Quiet and boring, though? Um, no. He’s been adopted by a loud, crazy Cajun family with a tiny petting zoo for him to care for. Hey, it’s not endangered tigers at a nationally renowned zoo, but a family of otters — and all the gumbo he can eat — isn’t a bad deal.  Until she shows up. Again.  The sunny, gorgeous optimist who stole his heart — and his favorite shirt — two months ago. Who clearly hasn’t heard the word “no” enough in her life. And who is the first woman to put even a tiny crack in his don’t-get-attached wall.Charlotte “Charlie” Landry is the new marketing consultant for the family swamp-boat tour company and petting zoo. It might not have been her plan, but she is all in, ready to grow the business. Whether the hot, grumpy vet likes it or not.  He doesn’t.  Worse, sparring with his unforgettable one-night stand is more fun than he’s had in a long time.  But watching wears-designer-dresses Charlie find her dream job amongst a bunch of goats, alpacas, and otters is a surprise.  And her helping him find his passion again is... well, irresistible. Dammit.",
