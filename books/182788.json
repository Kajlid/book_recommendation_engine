  "title": "Frankly Kellie: Becoming a Woman in a Manâ€™s World",
  "description": "Exploring the highs and lows of an esteemed career in professional boxing, Frank's autobiography is truly enthralling and packed with wonderful insight and anecdotes about himself and the who's who of the boxing fraternity. But this is a story with another dimension - an identity kept secret for decades. With honesty and integrity, this is the story of how Frank Maloney overcame his inner turmoil to stop living as Frank and become Kellie. Insightful and astute, Kellie talks openly about the years of anguish and torment, recounting extracts from her diary and explaining in unflinching detail the emotional rollercoaster she endured over the years, from childhood through to telling loved ones the truth. With humour and humility this book takes the reader on a journey through the transgender process - the physicality and the emotion - and celebrates the life of an incredible individual.",
