  "description": "It’s a Cow’s World might best be described as a new take on the classic, Animal Farm – but for vegans, vegetarians, raw foodists, environmentalists, and ethical thinkers generally. However, Nick Sage has taken things a step or two further; his story takes place in a world where even humans are ruled by cows. This action-packed satire combines farm animal exploitation, nutrition, junk-food propaganda, environmental issues and clandestine societies … with kidnapping, activism, and a love story in the most bizarre of circumstances. It’s a Cow’s World is an engaging and darkly humorous read which will both entertain, as well as nourish your mind and soul, with thought-provoking content about the controversial hot topics it dives headlong into.10% of all proceeds from It’s a Cow’s World will go directly to Mercy For Animals (MFA), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting compassionate food choices and policies, and preventing cruelty to farmed animals.",
