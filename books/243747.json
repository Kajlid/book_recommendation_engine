  "description": "So, I've checked off some life goals and added a few new ones to my list.  Goal #5: Get out of hell's belly without letting my ungrateful charges die.  Goal #6: Get a new name that's more badass.  Goal #7: Stop wasting my breath on lectures and start annoying the quad hell squad every time they annoy me. Fight fire with fire. Ha! Another hell pun.  Goal 8: Find out who the hell killed me.  I'll add more. I don't want to overwhelm myself before I even finish checking off my old goals. But seriously, I really do need a more badass name, considering how much I have to keep saving my damsels in distress.  I probably shouldn't call them damsels, since they're a little murderous and all.  Maybe I should add seeing a hell-certified psychologist to my list of goals.   **Sexual situations/content **Reverse Harem **Dark humor galore **Language warning",
