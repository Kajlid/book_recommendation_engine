  "description": "What readers are 'The author has saved the best for last. I could not put it down!' 'A thrilling and thought-provoking book.definitely the best of the three.' 'One of the best books I have ever read.' 'The story is like a fine-cut diamond; the deeper you look into it, the more mesmerized you become.' 'All books have a last page, but we know the story goes on. Hopefully, this one will.' Gaelen of the Greatwood has taken a desperate chance in placing Gorgon's ring on her own finger. Now there begins a tale of deceit and promise, of courage, betrayal, dark plans and poisonous alliances. Gaelen and Nelwyn have ventured farther from their homeland than any two Wood-elves in reckoning, but their journey now takes them deeper into desolation, forcing a confrontation that may well end in the downfall of the World that Is. At the heart of it all is the Stone of LÃ©ir, and the mighty but forlorn spirit trapped within.",
