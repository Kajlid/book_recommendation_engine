What secrets are hidden in the bowels of the Dusk? And what connection does the apparently sleazy Bermondsey casino have to a long- buried government initiative known as Project: Twilight?The Doctor must form uneasy alliances where the line between friend and enemy is blurred, playing games of chance...But are the stakes too high?",
