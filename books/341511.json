  "title": "The Book of Mary",
  "description": "In a society where adulterous women and unmarried mothers can be stoned, Mary must do some quick thinking when she finds herself with child. To save her own life and that of her child, she weaves a rapturous tale of immaculate conception. Little does she know that the story will spread like wildfire, with unforeseen consequences.Through diary entries, Sobat's Mary gives us an unfettered view of the life of women in a solidly patriarchal society, repudiating traditional stereotypes and breaking the boundaries of time and place. Provocative and irreverent, author Gail Sidonie Sobat employs a daring blend of contemporary and historical voice to bring an ancient tale into the realm of the wholly original.",
