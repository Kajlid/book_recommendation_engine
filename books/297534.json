  "description": "Ninth Circle. Treachery. Also known as Tanner Caine. He is a temptation with cold, dark eyes. A man with a seductive smirk and a body built for pure sin. The linchpin of a group of wealthy bad boys known as the Inferno. A dark presence that repels as much as he attracts, Tanner is the poisoned apple I want to bite even when I know it will destroy me. Our story started in college, but I ran from him so far I believed I was safe. I should have known he’d find me eventually. I should have known that nobody escapes. He has me in his sights again with an offer I can’t pass up. I know better than to make a deal with the Devil. Not unless I’m willing to pay his sensual price. ***Book One now INCLUDES the Prequel previously published.***  ***Each novel in the series depicts a unique romance, but the plots through each book connect in one world. For the best experience, read the series in order. Nine Standalone novels. Nine dangerous men. Nine unrepentant sinners you’ll hate to love.",
