  "description": "Librarian Note: This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN: B0082FVQ6C.A romantic short story.Cori Spencer doesn’t particularly mind being stuck in a refuge hut three feet above the rising tide in the middle of the night. She’s fallen in love with Lindisfarne, the tiny island off the north-east coast of England that’s isolated from the mainland by the sea twice a day. The problem is that she’s not alone. She’s stranded in a ten-by-four-foot wooden box for four hours with Ewan Macbeth, and that’s not going to end well. She’s either going to kill him or kiss him—and she’s not sure which option is the most likely.Ewan flew back from the States when his sister told him Cori had become engaged to a man she didn’t love just to please her father. The Earl once threw Ewan out when he found him kissing his daughter, prompting her to end their relationship. Ewan’s never forgotten her, and even though he’s certain there can never be anything between them again, he’s damned if he’s going to let her marry a man who doesn’t appreciate her.With only a bottle of Lindisfarne mead, a crab sandwich, and Angry Birds to keep them company, the two of them end up playing a game of Truth or Dare that forces Cori to accept the truth about her relationship with her fiancé, and Ewan to push her to the very limits to admit her feelings for him.This sweet-ish romance contains some adult language and is therefore suitable for mature readers.",
