  "description": "All Charlene \"Charley\" Lemain wants in the world is to play softball well enough to get into UT and to hang with her bestie Kaylee.That’s why it sucks so hard when she tears her rotator cuff and has to spend most of her senior year not playing, not practicing, not doing much of anything but watching Kaylee cheer and flirt with her quarterback boyfriend. As with besties, Kaylee sets Charley up for homecoming. It’s a nice enough date until Brant confides in her that he’s glad Charley’s \"like him.\"Like him? What the hell does that mean?Charley needs to figure out what’s going on in her body, in her life, and most importantly, in her heart.",
