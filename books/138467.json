  "title": "Know Thyself: An Autobiographical Manual for Designing a Successful Life",
  "description": "DEAR reader, thank you very much for choosing to read this short manual! Right from the start I would like to ask you to come quietly and thoughtfully as you enter the sanctuary of my inner world. Here, within these pages, you will embark on a journey into the depths of my soul, a pilgrimage to the sacred center of the self. Each step forward is a reverential gesture akin to entering a temple where thoughts and feelings echo ancient truths. Allow the silence to envelop you and allow my vulnerability to touch you, like the embrace of a beloved friend, as you venture into the inner sanctuary of your own being. My memory, inherently subjective and prone to distortion, often fragments my autobiographical recollections, blurring the line between truth and perception. Yet each fleeting moment, however brief or obscure, contributes to the tapestry of my existence, woven with threads of joy, sorrow and resilience. May the contents of this book enrich you and give you wise guidance on your own voyage of self-discovery.",
