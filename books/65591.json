  "description": "Preston Randall isn't trying to rewrite Twilight to suck up some of the left over teen money. He's not pumping out that sequel to The Illiad that everyone is beating down the bookstore doors to get - heck he's not even trying to concoct the great American novel. He's just got his Fruit-Of-The-Looms in a twist and wants to spew out a few dozen pages about it. And what is he on about? Commercials, flyers, adverts of all kinds and just the general detritus we all must wade through every single day to live in a modern global economy. That's all. And, well, he's had it. He takes on one dimwitted advertiser after another - with the most moronic of claims - and feeds them a heaping helping of their own blather. Praising their absolute ineffectiveness and ineptitude - while offering delightful testimonials that only their detractors could enjoy. It makes for a work that is simple, witty, silly and yet oddly cordial and illuminating... certainly a really fun read. No great investment required, just leaf through until Preston starts in on one of the dolts you really wish you'd sent a letter to - and enjoy his take on it. Please read 'em and weep - with tears of lol-ing.",
