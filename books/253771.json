  "description": "This heart-felt story tells of a little girl and her nanny, the fun times they have together, and their ways of coping when one of them moves away. ...The life of a nanny/babysitter is a delicate balance of love and professionalism, attachment and relinquishment. As adults, we know and understand that love is not bound by physical location, but does the child being separated from someone who they have grown to trust and perhaps see as part of the family, understand and believe that fact? And even if we know facts with our heads, that doesn't necessarily mean our hearts still can't hurt when the separation happens. Join Meggo and Caroline as they find ways to keep in touch and prove that the bond of a caretaker and child is not easily broken....Nanny; Childcare; Babysitter; Family; Alternative Family; Childhood; Goodbye; Separation JUV013090 \tJuvenile Fiction : Family - Alternative FamilyJUV057000 \tJuvenile Fiction : Stories in VerseJUV039050 \tJuvenile Fiction : Social Issues - Emotions & FeelingsY - Childrenâ€™s, Teenage & Educational YBCS - Picture storybooks YBLB - Early years: verse, rhymes & wordplay",
