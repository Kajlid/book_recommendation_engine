  "description": "\"\"The Girl With The Golden Eyes\"\" is a novel by French author Honore De Balzac, originally published in 1835. The book tells the story of a young Parisian named Henri de Marsay, who becomes infatuated with a mysterious woman known only as \"\"the girl with the golden eyes.\"\" Despite her enigmatic nature and the disapproval of his friends, Henri pursues her relentlessly, eventually discovering her dark secrets and the tragic circumstances of her life. Along the way, the novel explores themes of love, desire, power, and the corrupting influence of wealth and social status. With its vivid characters, complex plot, and insightful commentary on French society, \"\"The Girl With The Golden Eyes\"\" is considered one of Balzac's most important works and a classic of 19th-century literature.She belongs to that feminine variety which the Romans call fulva, flava--the woman of fire. And in chief, what struck me the most, what I am still taken with, are her two yellow eyes, like a tiger's, a golden yellow that gleams, living gold, gold which thinks, gold which loves, and is determined to take refuge in your pocket.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations. Because we believe this work is culturally important, we have made it available as part of our commitment for protecting, preserving, and promoting the world's literature in affordable, high quality, modern editions, that are true to their original work.",
