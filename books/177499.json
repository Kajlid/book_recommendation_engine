  "title": "Money Connection: Clarity, Release and Connection",
  "description": "This book is a manual, it is effective and easy to apply. I am not providing long stories and have you going in circles with wishful or hopeful concepts that only touch the surface on this subject. This book is clear and with insight on what money really is and how to create it, so that you are in full control. The economy has changed and these teachings are designed to move you forward in what is going to be one of the greatest shifts ever. We are no longer just working to survive, we are embracing our potential and turning it into a service that provides authentic quality and freedom of expression. I dedicate this book to all who have allowed me to be in their lives as a teacher, mentor and friend. You are each part of this journey as well.",
