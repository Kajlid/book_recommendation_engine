  "description": "NEW YORK TIMES and USA TODAY BESTSELLING AUTHOR, ELLE CASEY, brings readers PART 5 in the 6-part contemporary romance serial novel, JUST ONE NIGHT.[This book is PART 5. Readers should begin by reading PARTS 1-4 first.] Jennifer thought they had everything figured out. She and William were going to start over from scratch and take a chance on a real relationship. But then he doesn't call, and she wonders if she somehow managed to misinterpret everything. Further investigation puts her on William's doorstep, walking into a hell of a mess. William is at loose ends, no longer part of the family fold and suffering the fallout in the form of take-out and hagfish. Will he find inspiration and meaning again or will he crash and burn? This ebook is Part 5 of the contemporary romance serial novel, JUST ONE NIGHT, approximately 23,000 words or 93 paper pages long. The story concludes with Part 6.A note from Elle about this series: Hello readers! I had such a great time writing this serial. Like you, I had no idea what was going to happen from one part to the next. I didn't even know how many parts there would be. It was great having all the feedback from my readers as each part was released; it definitely influenced the end result. Edward's story, JUST ONE WEEK, is coming soon in 2016. Add it to your Goodreads shelf today!",
