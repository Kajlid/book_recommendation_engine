  "description": "Jack Seal is a typical guy. He smokes. He drinks. The only difference is his day job. He’s a ghost hunter. Using state-of-the-art equipment, Jack hunts down the paranormal world, searching for a way to save her. One day, he gets a call from a bed and breakfast in Indiana. He doesn’t think anything is out of the ordinary (well ordinary for Jack), even when an attractive reporter asks to tag along. But the longer he investigates, the more things seem out of place. It doesn’t take long before Jack is forced to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to save the day. Yet he can’t help asking, is it enough?",
