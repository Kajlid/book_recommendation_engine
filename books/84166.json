But when she runs into the majorly hunky model for the painting—in the flesh, in the middle of the night—she learns first-hand all about masterful strokes when she shares a night of medieval passion with him.Lockhart Munro has been cursed inside the portrait until he meets Hannah Keys. For four hundred years, no one has heard him or seen him, let alone touched him. The one woman who can do all these things may be the key to his long-awaited freedom.But if Hannah sets Lockhart free from his prison, will she be cursed to spend the rest of her lifetime without him?Or perhaps freeing Lockhart will be just the beginning…HK CarltonAbout the H-K lives in Canada with her hard-working hubby.
