  "description": "Getting shot again isn’t on top of Alyssa’s list of favorite things, but if it means saving Finn Kelly, she’s more than willing to take the risk. Now, if she can only convince him to quit being so overbearing, they might stand a chance at starting some sort of relationship. Being the head of an Irish mob family is a dangerous line of work, even if they are trying to move away from illegal activities. The last thing Finn wants is to drag Alyssa into his world, but he isn’t given much choice. With a crazy Russian mobster out for blood and his own brother fracturing the family, Alyssa and Finn will need to learn to trust one another to survive. This book follows KACE of the Allen Securities series. Although it can be read as a stand-alone book, some characters and plot elements will have stronger impact if you have read KACE.",
