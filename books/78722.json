  "title": "The Strange Cases of Dr. Stanchon",
  "description": "Clairvoyant dreams, ghosts, murder, and intrigue abound in this short story collection! Dr. Stanchon might be a brilliant diagnostician, but the oddity of his cases more often involves the paranormal undercurrents of late nineteenth-century New York than curious illnesses. Whether he’s counseling his patients to break free of their compulsions, keeping family secrets, or tending to his haunted house and its ill-fated tenants, Dr. Stanchon always seems to be in the middle of something mere science just can’t explain!",
