  "description": "The renegades of time past- walk through corridors that house the evil of many years. Time bandits one might say, yet those gangsters who ran amuck in history, are now running around behind closed doors alive still. Prohibition, gambling, robbing banks, murder, the crime syndicate ran things that took over the country and are still here. Times of the tough and those who wanted to survive, survived the best way they knew how, or they just ended up dead! The speakeasy’s, grand hotels, and gambling houses lined the boulevards of many vast cities. Gangs formed taking cuts in territory, money and even in prostitution rings. Many of the notorious left their trademarks on many lives throughout the early parts of the twentieth century, only to create one of the most read about historical times ever. Fast forward to modern times, as news stories carry interest still in the public eye. Who were these felons, these sophisticated, well dressed and yes even at times, well-mannered men and women, who called themselves Gangsters? The whispers of yesteryear still are somewhat ignored, but there’s one place that speaks volumes as the echoes linger…The Rendezvous Hotel-Register won’t you!",
