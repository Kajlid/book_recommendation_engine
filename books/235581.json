  "description": "Pyro has been incorporated as Part III of \"Born of Fire\".Will she give up her greatest secret for the greatest opportunity?  Saxony has barely stepped off the plane from her life-altering summer in Venice when friction in her family rises up to meet her. Someone seems to be lighting fires in Saltford, and Saxony's little brother Jack suspects her - thing is, she's never told anyone that she's a fire magus, so where is Jack getting this idea from?  When she calls Basil Chaplin, the number on the business card Enzo gave her in the previous story 'Born of Fire', she learns that he runs a secret school for magi. It's the perfect next step for Saxony, and she wants nothing more than to visit Basil's school and learn more. But there's a catch...  She has to tell her family what she is, and she has no idea how they're going to take it.",
