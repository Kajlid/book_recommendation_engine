  "description": "A harrowing, action-packed account of the author's series of audacious escapes from the Nazis' Final Solution--\"riveting...a fascinating and moving piece of history\" ( Library Journal ).Young Leo Bretholz survived the Holocaust by escaping from the Nazis (and others) not once, but seven times during his almost seven-year ordeal crisscrossing war-torn Europe. He leaped from trains, outran police, and hid in attics, cellars, anywhere that offered a few more seconds of safety. First he swam the River Sauer at the German-Belgian border. Later he climbed the Alps on feet so battered they froze to his socks--only to be turned back at the Swiss border. He crawled out from under the barbed wire of a French holding camp, and hid in a village in the Pyrenees while gendarmes searched it. And in the dark hours of one November morning, he escaped from a train bound for Auschwitz.Leap into Darkness is the sweeping memoir of one Jewish boy's survival, and of the family and the world he left behind.",
