  "title": "Credible Signs of Christ Alive: Case Studies from the Catholic Campaign for Human Development",
  "description": "This accessible and stirring book not only introduces readers to the work of the Catholic Campaign for Human Development (CCHD), the domestic antipoverty and social justice program sponsored by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, but also inspires us to service. With John P. Hogan as our guide, we are invited to walk with those who serve and those who are served in confronting the daily reality of poverty as well as the root causes and structures that cause it. Written with the skill of a journalist and the passion of a social justice reformer, Credible Signs of Christ Alive highlights six exemplary CCHD-funded projects that represent successful joint efforts between the working poor―including whites, African-Americans, Latin Americans, and a variety of immigrant groups including, Africans, Asians, Hispanics, and Russians―and the non-poor. Complete with case studies, reflection questions, suggested actions, contacts, and optional further reading, this book tells the story behind the poverty statistics, mines the hope behind the headlines, and makes real the power of faith to transform the world.",
