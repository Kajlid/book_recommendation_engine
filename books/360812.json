  "title": "Georgina's Dragon",
  "description": "There's an old curse which goes something like this: \"may you live in interesting times.\" Most days, Georgina (call her Gina, or else) thinks life is out to get her. Other times, she knows it for sure. Thing is: superheroes are real. Gina? She happens to be one of them--damn it! All she thinks she wants is to settle down in a normal life with nothing that goes bump in the night disturbing her. Too bad for her. Karma's got other plans in store for Gina. When a dragon starts a citywide rampage, this unwilling superheroine has to save the day. Luckily, she finds a couple hunka-hunka-hunks to help out. Problem? She's fallen for the both of them, then finds out they're both falling for her too ... and, incidentally, each other. Publisher's Notice: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: anal sex, homoerotic sex (m/m), menage (m/m/f), and voyeurism.",
