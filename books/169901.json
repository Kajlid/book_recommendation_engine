  "description": "“No. It’s okay. I’ve read about this,” Ozzie replied excitedly. “We must have fallen into a rip in the space-time continuum and gotten dropped here into an alternate universe.”“That’s fiction, you idiot!” Taryn hissed. “Science fiction. Stuff like that doesn’t happen in real life. We are obviously still dreaming or hallucinating or something.”Traveling through a fantastical realm of mythical creatures and battling an egomaniacal shape-shifter can really test a person. Too bad for Taryn Kelly, she and her former best friend, Ozzie Thomason, are not dreaming or hallucinating. Worse, they’re stuck together until they can figure out a way to get back home. On the way, they’ll have to fend off bandit attacks, discover an ancient power, pick a fight or eight, seek counsel from dragons, and save everyone. Most of all, though, they’ll need to put their tragic history aside in order to avoid dying…or worse. Thankfully, they’ve got an insecure half-elf and an enormous mix-matched guard dog to help them. What could go wrong?Colorful and vivid descriptions set the stage for a wry yet thrilling tale that entertains and moves all at once. Laugh one minute and cry the next as Taryn and Ozzie’s quest takes them not only through the heart of the magical land of Leleplar, but also through the heart of their broken relationship and into a place of renewal.",
