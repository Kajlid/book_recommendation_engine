  "description": "Another unusual creature has been delivered to the vast estate at 1313 Road to Nowhere in Foggy Point, Maine to add to the collection of odd, rare, or thought to be extinct species. This is a place where the magical is real and the bizarre is normal. Welcome to the Monsterjunkie Manor. Ah, but all is not well in the quirky, gothic Monsterjunkie world. Outside forces are scheming to rid them from the area while the teens and their friends cope with harassment for being different. Of course, the name itself brings suspicion and rumors about what goes on at this mysterious residence. Will their private world be exposed? And how will Crow Monsterjunkie come to grips with his name, his family legacy, and the masks that people wear to hide their true selves?",
