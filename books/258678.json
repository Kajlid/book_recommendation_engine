Lucy, like all the other children, frequents the Spirit School, where children are taught to control their inner spiritual energy. When they reach 15 years of age, they befriend spirits that reside in the vast Spirit Forest in East Land and receive the Bond Item - an object from them which permits them to summon their friends whenever they're in need.
