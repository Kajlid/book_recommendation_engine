  "description": "If you're expecting profound confessions of love, unfounded drama for the sake of drama, or a happily ever after with rainbows and unicorns, stay far away from this fucking book... Last summer, I felt things I'd never felt before. I finally realized what it meant to live, to laugh, to (almost) love...Despite those new found emotions, I had to leave behind the only friends I'd ever known, and the first man who'd ever genuinely cared about me. Carter Black. At least, I 'thought' I'd left him...He's back in my life in a role I'd never imagined--slowly revealing layers of himself and showing me who he really is, but I'm not sure if it's enough. Being with him will always be a challenge--a struggle, and now that I'm seeing the possibility of a new type of life, I'm not sure if he and I should be together.Besides, old habits die hard, and new ways die even harder. You knew I was going to fuck this up... #BeautifulTemptation",
