  "description": "Jim and Karen's group have escaped the horrors of Vancouver and are travelling north, toward his parents home, in hopes that the remote location will allow them some measure of safety. What they encounter on the road is far more dangerous than anything the city had to offer. The defenses at Brother Paul's survivalist church are at a breaking point and a drastic choice must be made. As he shepherds his congregation north to a massive, secluded church compound, he learns that faith alone won't save his followers. It's going to take a hell of a lot of bullets and all the luck in the world. As they are besieged by both the living and the dead, these desperate groups find that the road to sanctuary is paved with bodies and painted in blood.",
