No matter how smoking hot he is. Former shark lawyer Gabe returns to Clover Park for the stress-free lifestyle only to corner the market on ridiculous “legal” cases. When Zoe comes to him asking for legal advice, Gabe’s solution is a shock even to him.Gabe’s got good reason to avoid anything permanent, and Zoe is done with temporary. But when passion flares this high, some things are beyond good intentions. Some things are out of control.",
