  "title": "When the World Will Be As One: The Coming New World Order",
  "description": "Today the pieces are falling into place for a worldwide transformation. In the not too distant future a New World Order, unlike anything the world has ever seen, could appear almost overnight. There is an emerging global consciousness that is either an incredible historical coincidence or is, in fact, part of a sophisticated plan whose beginnings can be traced to antiquity. Could this be the global reality predicted 2,000 years ago by a prophet on the Isle of Patmos?In recent years the New Age Movement has been touted by many as the spiritual rebirth of modern man. But this popular movement is just one phase of a broad agenda which is only now coming fully into view. The pieces have been shifting into place for a quantum leap more radical than the one that replaced the Dark Ages with the Age of Reason. A momentous global event is upon us--the birth of a New World Order.",
