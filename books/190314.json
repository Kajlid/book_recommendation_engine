  "description": "Alternate-cover for this ASIN can be found hereIris Appleby had two axioms in her life. One, she loved colors and wanted to be a painter as long as she could remember. Two, she fell in love with her best friend, James Gardner the moment she first laid eyes on him. Too bad this love would never be reciprocated. James Gardner loved the stars mainly because they're surrounded by the dark. He knew he could never be with a girl like Iris as much as he ached for her. His past was too tainted with sins and he had so many secrets waiting to be discovered, love would never be in the cards for him. When those two come inevitably together, what unfolds will be beyond their wilder expectations. But will Iris succeed in coloring James's world?",
