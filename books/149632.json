  "description": "This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: B00LF4TWPE Book 2 in the New York Times and USA Today Bestselling Dark Romance Trilogy  Abducted at eighteen. Held captive for 15 months.  It reads like one of those headlines. And yes, I did it. I stole her. Nora, with her long dark hair and silky skin. She’s my weakness, my obsession.  I’m not a good man. I never pretended to be one. She can love me, but she can’t change me.  I can, however, change her.  My name is Julian Esguerra, and Nora is mine to keep.  ***Keep Me is the sequel to Twist Me, told from Nora & Julian’s POV. Hold Me (book 3) is now available everywhere. No cliffhanger.***",
