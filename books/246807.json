  "description": "Being a fighter is in my blood. My grandfather was a fighter, my father was a fighter, and I'm a fighter. I live for the rush of adrenaline and sensation of victory. When I fight, I give it my all. I step into the octagon and I fight until there's nothing left to fight for.  He's been my best friend for most of my life. I've fought with him, fought against him, and for the longest time I fought for him, for us. Until he pushed me away, leaving me no choice but to tap-out.  ***  Fighting is what saved me. It shed the old me and I became a newer shinier version of myself. Until it took away everything I loved. I gave up and tapped out.  Then one day, she came back into my life and reminded me that some things in life are worth fighting for. Now I'm fighting for us, day by day, proving to her that our happily ever after is worth fighting for.  This book is a stand-alone MMA romance.",
