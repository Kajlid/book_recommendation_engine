  "description": "Abhi Kowaski likes adventure and was too curious for his own good. He didn't realize that his inquisitiveness would land him in a whole new world from where it is almost impossible to return. No one seemed to know anything about his world and how to send him back home. Oh, how he wished he had listened to his friends when they asked him to stay away from the secret tunnel. Now that he is in this new world, he has to make the best of it. There were many things that swept him off his feet, like flying on wild eagles through neverbeforeseen heavenly places, winning races, and surfing on high waves. Although fighting with a serpent headed monster is not something he looked forward to. Will he survive this deadly adventure?",
