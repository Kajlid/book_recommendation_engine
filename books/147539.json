On the private plane of Runway Entertainment, the debauchery starts as Virginia is the naked focus of attention as she is initiated, and the blonde beauty wants to pass the test with flying colors.  Mason Dixon is the painter and virile ringleader of the secret sexual services his bevy of beautiful women provide, but Ginny Maines adds a few brushstrokes he wasnâ€™t ready for, and as they are drawn together they might produce a work of art as they paint a private picture.",
