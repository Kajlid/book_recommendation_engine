  "description": "We Make Computer Programming and Math FUN for Kids! Meet Scratch. A brand new, FREE computer programming application that allows children 10 and up to express themselves creatively by developing their own stories, cartoons, games, and more—all while learning computer programming! Created by Mitchel Resnick, and the “Lifelong Kindergarten” group in the MIT Media Lab, Scratch is a self-study program that teaches children all about computers and programming, in some of the most fun ways possible. Complete with cartoon animation, Scratch allows children to interact and play with various objects on the screen and then develop forms of interaction between them. Think digital, multi-colored blocks kind of like Lego. Each chapter consists of 20-30 minutes of study, and covers topics like how to make funny cartoons and games. Give your child an insight into one of the fastest growing fields in the world, and let them have fun at the same. Choose Scratch today!

The operational mode of each script has a lot of in detail. After the creation of such a game, a child can spend some time playing and simultaneously changing it, either simplifying or complicating it. In the end, there are questions and tasks. It is desirable to place the answers in the group",
