It's a lot less idyllic than it sounds.On arrival, the new chief finds himself in between corrupt town leaders, a local militia group, and a murderer on the loose.This is an exciting departure for the creator of Spenser. Renowned author Robert B. Parker, \"the reigning champion of the American tough-guy detective novel,\" (Entertainment Weekly), has landed on the 'New York Times' bestseller list once again but this time with Jesse Stone. Both readers and critics are thrilled.",
