  "description": "You are not alone.  Poetry and art that covers many social topics like body issues, depression, suicide, abuse, infidelity, and so on--but the one key element is HOPE.  My words have meaning. I became a one man online teen suicide hotline. I always said, \"Tell me why you want to kill yourself.\" Then I would listen to what they had to say, possibly the first person in their entire lives who actually listened to them. Then I would say, \"Now tell me why you don't.\"  And by their own admission, because of my words, they chose not to kill themselves that night. My \"art\" saved dozens of people's lives. There is no higher achievement than that.  Accompanying illustrations are by the incredibly talented by mostly unknown artist Alfred Kubin. Noted for his macabre and fantasy imagery, he also suffered from bouts of depression and suicidal thought.  I choose to live.",
