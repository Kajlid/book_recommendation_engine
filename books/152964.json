  "description": "Faith Martin, AM-UK!'s face of the morning weather, is used to delivering the forecast. But this surprisingly unglam celeb is not used to being told the forecast—especially when it concerns her own marriage. After years of wedded bliss, there isn't much about her husband, Peter, that this thirty-five-year-old doesn't know. In fact, her quiet family life seems a little too comfy...until a casual remark from Faith's ultraglam best friend plants a seed of doubt that changes Faith's perspective. Faith begins to question everything about her humble life—conversations, Peter's new look and attentions from a handsome new acquaintance. This book is for every woman who has let a breeze of doubt turn into a full-blown hurricane.",
