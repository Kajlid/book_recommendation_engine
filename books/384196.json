  "description": "It was very early Christmas morning and in the stillness of the dawn, with the soft snow falling' on the housetops, a little child was born in the Bird household. They had intended to name the baby Lucy, if it were a girl; but they had not expected her on Christmas morning, and a real Christmas baby was not to be lightly named - the whole family agreed in that.",
