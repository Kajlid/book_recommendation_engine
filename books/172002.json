  "description": "One year ago, Gia Torella made a huge mistake. After several glasses of champagne at her sister’s wedding she hooked up with Patrick Dubois, the most imposing hockey player on the Pittsburgh Renegades professional hockey team — both on the ice and off. But she vowed to forget that brief encounter, even if her body remembers all the wild and incredible things they did that night. She’s moved on from Patrick, and her solid, dependable boyfriend is proof of that.But Patrick has never forgotten their one night of passion. Even though she’s the girlfriend of Tyler Kidd, his team’s captain and therefore completely off-limits, all he can think about is her curvy body, her bubbly personality, and the way she screamed out his name during the best sex he’s ever had. Since their night together, he’s given up on the puck bunnies, the partying, and the random hook-ups, and he’s willing to become the man she needs.They both know it’s wrong, but they’re drawn to each other in a whirlwind of passion. Can Patrick convince Gia that he has really changed into someone she could depend upon… and that sometimes love is worth the penalty for Unsportsmanlike Conduct?",
