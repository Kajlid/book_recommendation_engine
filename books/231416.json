  "description": "The night walker shrieked, and slashed at him with clawed fingers. The claws ripped his flesh, burning as if the fires of hell themselves had etched the four-inch gashes across his skin.  Demon hunter and magician, Demetri Risk, lives a life on the edge, and the Order of the Craft has noticed.  On the most dangerous night of the year, Demetri is summoned to the manor house of Brosnan Cage. Unwittingly, Demetri enters into a dangerous hunt that leads the Order to the brink of extinction. Will the Order survive in the light of the blood moon?  Editorial   This story opens fast and never lets you catch your breath. I can't wait until the next episode! --Lynn Nodima",
