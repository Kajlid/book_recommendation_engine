  "description": "If Cam’s first trip to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally was an awakening, her second trip could only be called eye-opening. Even though she knows better, Cam just can’t help chasing her libido – right into hell. But relying on Dylan to save her every time she finds trouble isn’t fair to him. Is it?Cam starts her second trip to Sturgis with a bang. A gang bang, that is. Even though she’s fantasized about it for years, her first shot at group sex dies an embarrassing death. Her second shot is even worse. Will the third time be the charm, or will Cam run out of chances with her gang of rowdy bikers? While she might just pull it off, it could also be the one thing that pushes Dylan away, for good.",
