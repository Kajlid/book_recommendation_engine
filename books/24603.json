His wife, Sumi, returns with their three daughters to the shelter of the Big House, where her parents live in oppressive they have not spoken to each other in thirty-five years. As the mystery of this long silence is unraveled, a horrifying story of loss and pain is laid bare - a story that seems to be repeating itself in Sumi's life.Set in present-day Karnataka, A Matter of Time explores the intricate relationships within an extended family, encompassing three generations. Images from Hindu religion, myth, and local history intertwine delicately with images of contemporary India as the women of this family face and accept the changes that have suddenly become part of their lives.",
