  "title": "Sean & David's Long Drive",
  "description": "Sean Condon is a 29-year-old city boy and a connoisseur of hair wax. He can't drive, and he doesn't really travel well. So when Sean and his friend David set out to explore Australia in a 1966 Ford Falcon, the result is a decidedly off-beat look at life on the road. Over 14,000 death-defying kilometres, our heroes check out the re-runs on TV, get fabulously drunk (again), listen to Neil Young (again) and wonder why they ever left home. Read it out loud.",
