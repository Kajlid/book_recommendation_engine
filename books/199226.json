  "description": "The Catholic Church and the Jews concentrates on the key issues addressed in E. Michael Jones's extensive 2008 book The Jewish Revolutionary Spirit and explores relevant matters that have occurred since its publication. The Catholic Church and the Jews compares the approaches of Christianity, Islam, and the Jews, delineating the essential nature of each. It introduces the Jewish revolutionary spirit, illustrated by the evidence from history, analyzes the key modern document, the Vatican II Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions, known as Nostra Aetate, and then addresses whether the Gospels are anti-Semitic; the Jewish contribution to the rise of Bolshevism and Communism; the question of the Holocaust, notably the policy adopted by Pope Pius XII; the role of the Jews in the development of modern media, notably Hollywood; the attitude of Jews toward abortion; the approach of the Jews to \"gay marriage;\" and the Vatican's 2015 document The Gifts and Calling of God Are Irrevocable.",
