  "title": "The Killing Code",
  "description": "The apparent suicide of Helen Benson, a cutting edge neuropsychiatrist with no reason to take her own life, raises suspicion with homicide detective Alan Beach. Intuition, combined with some unusual security footage, and the fact that the victim spoke the name of a notorious serial killer, Bryan Adler, with her dying breath, tell Beach her death was no suicide. Beach discovers a tenuous connection between Dr. Benson’s apparent suicide and the assassinations of a powerful US Congressman and a well known consumer rights advocate. As he struggles to uncover the truth, he’s being watched by a team of brutal mercenaries, who have been sent to permanently silence Beach, but before they can complete their mission, a mysterious and very dangerous figure intervenes. Together with Equilibrium, an enigmatic computer hacker, Beach and his new protector discover a dangerous conspiracy which runs far deeper than they could have imagined. The race is on to stop one of the most powerful business moguls in America from assuming the role of puppet-master over the entire nation.",
