The deceased had, it appeared, no enemies. The discovery of her battered body and the ear splitting scream that accompanies the find causes consternation amongst the residents.Enter DI Giles Fricker; a misunderstood man with many problems who constantly seeks the approval of his Germanic psychologist and is haunted by long subdued feelings of inadequacy along with painful memories of his fatherâ€™s infidelity. Fricker is also obsessed with his shapely subordinate WPC Cole; she is in turn obsessed with the Oxford English dictionary. Confusion, misunderstandings and inept investigation are the order of the day for DI Fricker and his dysfunctional team, as murder follows murder. Distracted by his fumbling attempts to find romance our deficient detective stumbles helplessly towards solving the crime; however the identity of the killer remains hidden in a complex maze of sub plots. Fricker is led of the beaten track and close to the edge of disaster as inadvertently he gets closer to solving the mystery; the murderer tries to get him off the scent and Fricker himself becomes a target.",
