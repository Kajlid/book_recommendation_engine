  "description": "Product Fantasy author Martin Sharlow starts a new series here with book one. He shows us a land of magic, where casters summon stories from works of fiction then use these story constructs for work, or for battle.Thousands of years ago, the great Sage Montok Waynew signed the Book Accords, in which it was declared that all books must edify and instruct for the good of all mankind. Created in the hope to end the tyranny that had come into existence in their time, it was widely received and ratified by all living Sages as a good thing in the wake of the last great Story wars. So it went, that those books that were not found desirable were burned or destroyed, to protect all future generations. Gailen, Alena and Targ find this peace is about to end. In a world where Sages can summon stories to life to do their bidding, these three apprentices must find where they belong, when the laws of the past seem to no longer exist. Apprentice, is a 72,000 word count Young Adult Fantasy, which combines myth and legend with popular fantasy and a unique magic system. It is the first of a three part trilogy. That sets up future books and introduces the reader to the power of stories, and how they can be used for good and doesn't love a good story? Sharlow's Story Tellers is an intriguing book of fiction and fantasy. Story Tellers is brought to life by the excellent prose, engaging characters, magical plot, and overall fine writing.Perhaps one of the best fantasy novels I have viewed in quite some time, we hear the story of three heroes, magical creations through the use of stories, and self-discovery. A highly recommended, delightful read of its genre. -----The Book Shelf",
