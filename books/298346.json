  "description": "Tucked into one corner of the little-known City of Sparks, Nevada is a place called the Narrow Gate, where flowers and butterflies flourish in the winter; a dragon is kept at bay with a song; and an angel watches over its inhabitants. As natural disasters continue to affect every city across the earth, hundreds of thousands are forced from their homes and way of life. On a mission to find a safe place to begin again, the lives of eight complete strangers collide. They find themselves at The Narrow Gate B&B simply by chance…or is it? Having to endure the sting of loss, they each grow and heal together. They discover that The Narrow Gate is not just any old bed & breakfast, but a place that holds secrets within its walls—literally; a place they were each meant to find. In this Supernatural adventure love story, miracles await Lee, Rachel, Fox, Aliza, East, Everly, Journey, and Pilot, as the spiritual realm comes to life, and unseen forces compel them forward towards freedom, redemption, and love at The Narrow Gate.",
