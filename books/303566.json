  "description": "How many times have I stood on the bank of this river feeling the weight of the things I’ve done?After all these years, I don’t know if I come here for you, if I come here looking for forgiveness, or if I come here trying to find myself.I’ve told so many lies, kept so much of myself hidden that I feel like an imposter in this life I’ve built. I’ve got my dream job, I’ve got family—even got myself a good man. But it’s all wrong. It’s like living in a house of cards with a hurricane bearing down on you.Without you, I’m nothing more than a ghost on the shore.The January wind whips my hair and freezes the stray tears on my cheeks. The rock I’m standing on is icy, and this isn’t the first time I’ve been tempted to let myself go, to slip and sink under. But I won’t do that because someday you might come looking for me.Reaching up to touch that spot on the back of my neck, I know I’ll never forget you.I made sure of that, little blackbird.The Blackbird series by Lily Foster is intended for readers 18 and older due to mature language and sexual content.",
