  "description": "Seattle investigator J. P. Beaumont investigates a dark and deadly conspiracy At first glance, the video appears to be showing a a teenage girl with dark wavy hair smiles for the camera, a blue scarf tied around her neck. All of a sudden things turn murderous, and the girl ends up dead. It’s as bad as a snuff film can get, and what’s worse, the clip has been discovered on a phone that belongs to the governor of Washington State’s grandson. Fortunately, the governor is able to turn to an old friend, J. P. Beaumont, for help. Along with Mel Soames, Beaumont soon discovers that what initially appears to be a childish prank gone wrong has much deeper implications, reaching into the halls of state government itself. But Mel and Beau must follow this path of corruption to its very end, before more innocent young lives are lost.",
