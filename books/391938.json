  "description": "Penrhos Bay was a quiet seaside town, until the demons came. No fairgrounds, no loud blaring music, no tacky tourist shops, or boozy backstreet bars and seedy nightclubs. A place where nothing significant ever happened. It was a nice, picturesque, safe place beside the sea. Now murder, violence, kidnap and drunkenness on the streets despoil this once genial and delightful place.So why did a local Curate jump to his death off a church tower? Why did the Vicar scatter his ashes in unconsecrated ground? Why did the thief steal the church offerings and then put it all back? Do the new Curate and his young wife fully realize just what they are getting into in coming to Penrhos Bay?Despite the clean appearance of whitewashed villas and neat Victorian hotels on the esplanade, the quaintness of Saturday deckchair concerts and the traditional Punch and Judy shows on the old wooden pier, pure wickedness abounds. Unseen by the town's people, a dire struggle is being fought between the forces of good and evil. A struggle which will soon impact every one of the inhabitants, including the angels and demons.About the Author Fred Hurr was born and raised in London and currently resides in Conwy, North Wales.
