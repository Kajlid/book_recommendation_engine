  "description": "This is the year Emily learns how to deliberately shape the future. She gets the courage to walk away from her safe routine and takes a job at the fabulous curio shop owned by Henry Paradis, an occult scholar. Recognizing her psychic talents as the valuable gifts they are, Henry teaches Emily to accept her magical nature and “look forward.” She chooses the path to light, finds lifelong friends, falls in love with an incredibly sexy man, learns the power of desire and intention, faces her worst fears and is swept toward awakening. The mystical images of the Tarot’s archetypal trump cards chart the way, 22 sequential steps along the path to success known as “The Fool’s Journey.” Illustrated by images from the Payen Tarot of Marseilles (1713), which is the oldest surviving Tarot deck.\"Cleare's narrative follows Emily, a young woman on a path of self-realization and awakening...The novel is well plotted...offers a little bit of self-help and a little bit of chick lit, packaged together with a positive, make-your-own-destiny message: a pleasant, comforting read.\" - Publishers Weekly\"A thoughtful and much recommended novel of tarot. Through the unknown, we can find something magnificent. \"Destined\" tells the story of Emily, who takes a job at a curio shop and delves into the occult and mystery. A novel of romance and the life of the occult and the tarot, it's a fascinating break into this culture and the belief in mysticism.\" - Midwest Book Review",
