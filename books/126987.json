  "description": "Meet Zandor Steel. He's spent the past year in Italy acting out just about every sexual fantasy he could dream up. But it wasn't all fun and games. Zandor was there to oversee construction on a posh casino resort playground for the rich and famous. But rumors of trouble with this brothers has him worried, and Zandor heads home to help out. It's the least he can do. Jase and Cyrus had been Zandor's mentors. When it came to women, they taught him to avoid attachments and to know the difference between lust and love. So when word of at least one of his brothers being ready to settle down arrives, Zandor hopes he can talk some sense into him before it's too late. Until he runs smack into resistance. Southern Bell, Bekah George may just be the match Zandor has been looking for in the bedroom. She's neither intimidated by, nor afraid of his preferences. But as he starts to let his guard down, and consider the possibility of there being more to life than mind-blowing, non-committal sex, Bekah reveals a side of herself Zandor doesn't want to see. Was he right to avoid entanglements, or has he already fallen to hard to let her go?",
