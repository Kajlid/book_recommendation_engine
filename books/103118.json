Having a permanent house guest isn’t his idea of fun, however, the press would have a field day if they found he and his new wife weren’t residing together.On paper, their ‘fake’ marriage fits both their needs, giving Nicholas a wife and Julia the security she's always dreamed of having. In reality, every moment Nicholas and Julia spend together brings them closer to falling for each other.NOTE: This version listed on Goodreads is not the version available for purchase.",
