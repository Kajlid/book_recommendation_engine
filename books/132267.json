  "description": "Eva Matthews hates chaos. She worked hard as a high school teacher and prided herself on the life she had made. After a secret from her past sent her well-ordered existence spiraling out of control, all she wanted was answers. Her search led her to Highland Creek and into the arms of the elusive Aaron Sawyer.Aaron was born a fixer. Every injured person or animal from miles around was treated to his personal attention, and he thrived on putting out fires as the local lawyer at Highland Creek. He never found a problem he couldn’t solve until Eva and although misconceptions led to instant dislike, he couldn’t stop himself from trying to heal her battered soul.Although Eva is more than willing to engage in a summer fling, she isn’t interested in seeking Aaron’s help or complicating her life with anything long-term. How can the man who lives to fix things stay away? Could Aaron and Eva turn a summer fling into a serious relationship?",
