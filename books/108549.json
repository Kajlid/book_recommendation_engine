  "description": "HONEST LOVE, DISHONEST LUST...Years ago, young Robert Fenner was forced into marriage with Lady Blaunche. Now, in 1442, he is being forced toward warfare over the property to which she wrongfully claims ownership. To make matters worse, a wealthy young heiress has captured hearts on both sides of the feud - including his - and it is up to Robert to decide whom she will marry.Drawn from her nunnery's contemplative quiet by Lady Blaunche's need, Dame Frevisse is caught up among the passions of a man desperate for what he cannot have; a powerful knight blocked from what is rightfully his; and a young woman trapped in the eye of the storm.Who will see that justice is done after honest love and dishonest lust spawn anger, greed, and finally... murder?\"As exquisitely woven as a medieval tapestry... Frazer's research is dazzling.\" - The Cleveland Plain Dealer\"Written with the graceful rhythms that have garnered her two Edgar nominations... transports the reader to a medieval England made vivid and a world of emotions as familiar then as now.\" - Publishers Weekly (starred review)",
