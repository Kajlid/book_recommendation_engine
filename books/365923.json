  "title": "A Penis Manologue: One Man's Response to The Vagina Monologues",
  "description": "Content in this book was banned from a college classroom that required reading \"The Vagina Monologues.\" After reading Eve Ensler's book and attending a local production of her play, Joe DiBuduo wanted to respond with a male point of view. He planned to write a play or screenplay and call it \"The Penis Chronicles.\"After handing out a questionnaire to a multitude of people who said they would participate, Joe received only one response. The Penis Chronicles couldn't be written with only his and another man's responses. Realizing how reticent most men and even a college instructor were to talk about penises, he felt obligated to write about his own interests and experiences with the male appendage. So he ended up with one monologue - a manologue - his distinctly creative, male point of view. Read free sample chapters at http: //www.apenismanologue.com,",
