  "description": "In this outstanding seventh Dr. Siri Paiboun mystery, things are looking pretty grim for Laos' one and only national coroner.Three young Laotian women have died from fencing-sword wounds. Each of them had studied abroad in an Eastern bloc country. Before he can complete his investigation, Dr. Siri is lured to Cambodia by an all-expenses-paid trip. Accused of spying for the Vietnamese, he is imprisoned, beaten, and threatened with death. The Khmer Rouge is relentless, and it is touch and go for the dauntless, seventy-four-year-old national--and only--coroner of Laos.",
