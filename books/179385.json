  "title": "Tying Down the Lion",
  "description": "It is the summer of 1967 and the Bishop family are departing their UK home for a continental road trip. Their destination: Berlin, a gritty city recovering from the bombs of 1939—45 and now sliced in two by the Cold War. Will the journey unite the Anglo-German family, or forever rip them apart? Grandma Nell loathes foreigners, especially German daughter-in-law Bridget. She’s none too pleased about son Roy jamming the whole family into an ageing Morris Traveller car for the duration. Granddaughter Jacqueline observes the trip–and the resultant spillage of family secrets–with a keen eye and a notepad in which to pen it all.  This is a story of ordinary people in an extraordinary situation, and the discovery of how something divided can be more revealing than a perfect whole. It is a quest for a family who build walls in their minds as they try to discover who they are and where they belong.",
