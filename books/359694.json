It’s what we’ve always wanted—what we have always dreamed of—and nothing will stand in the way of achieving success.Except maybe me.As soon as we sign with our new record label, our producer gives us one rule; stay away from his daughter. I thought it would be easy to resist her, but Mia Hayes is under my skin. She is everything I never knew I wanted or needed.But falling for Mia might cost us everything we’ve worked so hard for.Do I sacrifice my band member’s dreams and chase her, or will Mia be the one thing that is more important than any stage I have ever dreamed of?",
