The gates are also essential to the empire’s survival, and a monk turned con-artist may hold the key to unlocking them.What they discover will change them and the Annurian Empire forever – if they survive. For deep within the southern reaches of the land, a malevolent force is stirring . . .The Empire's Ruin is the first book in the epic Ashes of the Unhewn Throne trilogy by Brian Staveley.",
