  "title": "Rules for the Perpetual Diet",
  "description": "An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here.A suspenseful, moving and at times hilarious novel about love, loss, Paris, food and finding yourself. Amy is 29 and tired of living in her hometown of Phoenix. She's also perpetually hungry, because she's on a \"perpetual diet.\" When Amy's best friend dies she picks up and runs away to Paris, her dream destination (though maybe not the best place to avoid carbs). In France she is robbed, stalked, arrested, kidnapped (almost) and--worse--finds that her numerous issues have come right along with her. Grab a croissant and settle in for a decidedly non-touristy trip to the City of Light. P.S. This novel is great for book groups.",
