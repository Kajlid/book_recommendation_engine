  "description": "IT’S HARD FOR Elissa to comprehend everything that has happened to her. In Elissa’s Quest , she discovered the truth about her father, and she and her new friend, Maya, just barely escaped a madman’s clutches. And Elissa’s Gift is not only growing in power . . . it’s changing. Elissa could always speak to animals, but now she’s able to control other things in the natural world. But when Elissa becomes separated from her friend and her faithful donkey, she embarks on a perilous voyage that introduces her to others who have special Gifts, too. It’s almost as if an unseen hand is guiding her to the pieces of the prophecy . . . the Prophecy of the Phoenix. The climax is building! In Book 2 of the Phoenix Rising trilogy, Erica Verrillo manages to make us laugh while falling even more deeply in love with a fabulous, strong, girl coming of age.",
