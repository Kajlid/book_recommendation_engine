  "description": "Sex and the sea... Desperate to win back his ex, billionaire playboy Jeb Whitcomb spent a year in self-discipline and (mostly) celibacy. He's a new man. But when she decides to marry someone else, Jeb immediately sets sail. He has only four days to stop the wedding and, worse still, he has a stowaway...the only woman who can make a newly good man behave very, very badly! R.N. Haley French is furious. For one night, she lets go of her usual boring routine, and the next she knows she's accidentally off to Florida with Mr. Sexy Superficiality, and desperately trying to forget the steamy encounter they almost shared. And in the boat, there's no escape from each other...or the unfurling lust that threatens to send their self-control overboard!",
