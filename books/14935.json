  "description": "A nun. A dead baby. An arrest. And now, if the court-appointed psychiatrist found her sane, a long, sensational trial. But Dr. Martha Livingston knew it was more complicated than that. How did you judge a twenty-one-year-old girl who wasn't sure where babies came from? Who didn't even remember having one . . . or what happened to him? Especially when a strong-willed Mother Superior is battling you every step of the way - and your own searing memories of a similar tragedy threaten to make you lose whatever objectivity you still possess.",
