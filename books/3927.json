As if that weren't enough, Veronica and Richard must flee gunmen in the middle of their honeymoon, convincing Veronica she got more than she bargained for when she said, \"I do.\"Thrown into a world of espionage, seduction, and human trafficking, Veronica must fight for the life and husband she thought she had - and she must discover whether they are the life and husband she truly wants.Don't miss Heather Huffman's other books: Throwaway, Jailbird, Ring of Fire, Ties That Bind, Tumbleweed,Â and the newly-released Devil in Disguise!",
