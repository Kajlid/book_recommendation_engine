  "description": "Warning: Mr. Tucker is hot and sexy smut at its finest. Mr. Tucker is recommended for mature readers 18+ due to subject matter and sexual content.A senior bet.Almost every school has one–a tradition that's passed down from year to year. My small school in Tennessee is no different. While some seniors at schools all across the country have senior pranks or senior ditch days, our school has the senior bet. Lose your virginity by spring break–have proof–and you're in the running for prom queen.Does it sound ridiculous?It absolutely is, but ridiculousness won't stop me from getting my prom queen nomination. I've had plenty of opportunities to lose my V-card to one of the boys at my school, but I don't want to sleep with a high school boy. I want a man with experience. I want the man that's been starring in my wet dreams at night. I want my history teacher. I want Mr. Tucker.",
