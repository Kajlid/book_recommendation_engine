  "title": "Dance on My Grave",
  "description": "In this revelatory, groundbreaking novel, the love of sixteen-year-old Hal Robinson for self-confident Barry Gorman is revealed through Hal’s own observations, press clippings, and the scattered notes of a social worker. These various perspectives contribute to an extraordinarily sensitive portrait of the intensity of first love. The Horn Book writes, The author is marvelously gifted at suggesting the ecstasy and insecurity that accompany new love, including its emotional and physical, social and spiritual aspects. A major strength of the book, the central conflict hinges not on the lovers being gay, but on their having two idiosyncratic and contradictory personalities.”\nAmulet Books is the home of Aidan Chambers, one of young-adult literature’s greatest living writers.”*\n With profound respect for readers, Chambers again stretches the YA genre to its edges and beyond. . . . Ambitious, imperfect, challenging, and powerfully affecting.” Kirkus Reviews, starred review",
