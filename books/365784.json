It made him something more than human--eternally young, eternally beautiful . . . but not immortal. When he dies on a mission against the Strangers, he is lost to the darkness . . . until a miracle lady brings him back.  Born during the apocalyptic storms and earthquakes that left the world in ruins, Selena has dedicated her life to easing the pain of others as they slip into death. But Theo is different. He is the first in her care ever to survive.  Responding to Selena's tender touch, Theo starts to live again--to feel and desire again. But joined in a world of terrors, the secrets they can never share make them targets....and love could be the ultimate betrayal.",
