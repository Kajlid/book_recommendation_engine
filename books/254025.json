  "description": "For 50 years, Eleanor Ritter’s mother Rose has refused to talk about how she survived the Holocaust in Poland and ended up in New Jersey. But now – just as Rose breaks her hip and starts speaking in long-forgotten Polish – Eleanor learns that the parents of her nine-year-old son’s new friend are Polish Catholics, born and raised in that country. Eleanor starts digging into both families’ stories, jeopardizing her already shaky relationships with her mother, her husband, and her children, even as her obsession pushes her to confront the existential questions of American Jews – indeed, of any group that has faced historical persecution: How many generations does guilt carry on? What did your grandparents do to my grandparents?",
