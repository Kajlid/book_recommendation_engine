  "description": "Horse  Years ago I lost the one woman who’s ever been able to rock my world. When she disappeared into thin air I stopped caring, fucking whoever, whenever. The one thing I didn’t plan for was seeing her face in all of these women. No one could ever compare to her and here she is, her ghost haunting me every day. I thought that relocating with the club to start our new charter would be the change I needed to move on, but what happens when I see her again. Only this time, she isn’t a ghost. She’s real.",
