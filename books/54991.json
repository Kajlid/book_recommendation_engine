  "title": "Morgan and the Martians: A Comedy Play-Script for Children",
  "description": "Morgan is a bad boy. A VERY bad boy. When a bunch of Martians give him a Shimmer Suit that makes him invisible, he wastes no time in wearing it to school and creating havoc. Well, wouldn't you? This English comedy drama will amuse and encourage the most reluctant of readers, and will fire fertile young imaginations. Teachers will find the accompanying assignments and activities a godsend, both as part of a syllabus or an end-of-term filler. Suitable for KS2 or ages 7 to 11. FREE printable worksheets are offered. Victoria Twead is better known for 'Chickens, Mules and Two Old Fools', but, as always, her sense of humour is evident in this, her first book for children.",
