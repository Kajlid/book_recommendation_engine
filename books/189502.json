  "description": "AMANDINA HAD EVERY TALENT MADE FOR THE STAGE, EXCEPT Confidence. She dances, sings, acts, and performs acrobatics, but no one knows because Amandina is terribly shy. Determined to change that, she rents a run-down theater and prepares to give the show of her life. She builds the sets, makes the costumes, and, most importantly, invites everyone in town. When the night of the big performance comes, Amandina nervously opens the curtains…to find all of the chairs empty. Disheartened, she performs anyway, not realizing that she does have an audience member—a very tiny one—who is about to make a big difference in Amandina’s life.",
