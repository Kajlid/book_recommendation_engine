  "description": "Creamy Bullets is a new book of short stories by Kevin Sampsell. \"With Creamy Bullets , Kevin Sampsell has created a weirdly sexual but wholly believable universe in just the briefest bursts of words. Each story is a savory gem, capturing the gripping little deviant moments of life. Get off on his characters, those working class anti-heroes that roam the Pacific Northwest, or get off on his tight-like-your-uncle's-wallet prose-you can't lose with this book\" --Jami Attenberg.",
