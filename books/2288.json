There's also a young girl, Sally Lumb, who seems to know more than she lets on. Her knowledge could lead her into danger.Watch as this second Banks case unearths disturbing secrets behind a bucolic fa√ßade.\"The novels of Peter Robinson are chilling, evocative, deeply nuanced works of art.\" - Dennis Lehane. \"If you haven't encountered Chief Inspector Alan Banks before, prepare for a crash course in taut, clean writing and subtle psychology.
