  "description": "I thought our love was infinite, unbreakable.After six years together, butterflies would still take flight in my stomach every time he walked into a room. With just one smile I was putty in his hands. He promised me forever with every touch of his lips. Too late, I realized that I was being kept in an illusion made of glass; only to have him smash it apart and disappear before he could see it shatter around me in perfect ruins.With a tiny life held in the palm of my hands, I'm haunted by the man who abandoned us.And then there was him.Immersing himself within the dust and debris as I was slowly opening my eyes to this new reality. He says he wants forever, but how can I believe him when love lies and forevers don't truly exist.",
