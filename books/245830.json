  "description": "In the rhyme and meter of Clark Clement Moore’s classic Christmas poem, Sherlock Holmes tracks clues through his familiar haunts to “eliminate the impossible.” When he discovers the jolly old gent with the white beard dipping his hand into a bag full of toys, Sherlock surmises that “whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” Or is it? This little holiday mystery will delight Sherlock fans of all ages.",
