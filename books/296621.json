  "description": "Ethan Lloyd, a bright prep school student with perfect grades, shows great promise when he chooses to leave the remaining shreds of his family and move to New York City where he plans to go to college in the fall. Immersed in the world of the 1980’s “club kids”, he does his best to navigate the social world of the celebutante. The colorful characters that polka dot Ethan’s life are a new family, but not always a safe one. Mental illness, money, and low self-esteem gain the upper hand, forcing him to drop out of Columbia University and return home to San Francisco to face his demons.7th Avenue South is a highly-demanded prequel to the 4-book Psychotic Break Series which documents Ethan’s struggles with drugs, psychosis and hospitalization. 7th Ave South lays the foundation and gives context to the circumstances that lead six months later to Ethan’s 5150 transfer to the mental hospital from jail.",
