  "description": "Sometimes love can be found in the most unlikely places, or so Danny discovers once he finds himself in a bar brawl. With a life of abuse behind him, he's more than ready for a new, happier start and Mike seems to be exactly what his damaged soul needs. With a completely different background, Mike is close to a ray of sunshine. Always optimistic and happy, he anchors Danny and shows him life can be about love instead of hate. But chapters of the past are rarely completely closed, and once Danny's nightmares come back into his life he has to make a choiceâ€”to fight or to save the one who showed him life is worth living.CONTENT ADVISORY: This title contains a HFN ending, violence and explicit rape scenes.",
