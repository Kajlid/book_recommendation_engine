  "description": "The Class We Never Had Isn't it a bit odd that we went from Science to Math to History but somehow missed the class on how to live? For some wacky reason \"Optimal Living 101\" didn't make the schedule... But imagine if that class did exist and the teachers included everyone from the old school philosophers like Socrates, Marcus Aurelius, Emerson, Nietzsche and Buddha to modern sages like Joseph Campbell, Paulo Coelho, Dan Millman, Deepak Chopra, Byron Katie, Eckhart Tolle and Wayne Dyer plus the world's leading positive psychologists like Sonja Lyubomirsky, Tal Ben-Shahar and Martin Seligman who are *scientifically* establishing how we can live with more happiness, meaning and mojo. Think of this book as a Philosopher's notes on that awesome class. From \"Spiritual Farts\" and \"110-Year Old You\"s to \"The Tolle Trap\" and \"Blissipline,\" you'll have fun getting your wisdom on in this inspiring, playful, wise and practical little book as Brian Johnson shares one hundred of his favorite Big Ideas on how to create a life brimming with a radiant enthusiasm only discovered when we align with the fundamentals of Optimal Living.",
