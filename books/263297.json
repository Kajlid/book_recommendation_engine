  "description": "Looking for a unique paranormal cozy mystery series that's lighthearted and fun?  Settle into the cozy countryside of Moss Hill, where house-elves rent rooms, sprites live in gardens, a leprechaun is the best tailor in town, and a half-elf/half human named Carissa Shea owns a pharmacy known as The Seelie Tree Apothecary shop. Life couldn't be more idyllic for Cari, but healing humans and fae folk proves challenging at times, especially when secrets unfold in The Faerie Apothecary Mysteries.  About Chaos in the Countryside The quiet town of Moss Hill would be in trouble if not for one daring nature faerie: a sprite known as Chaos. Though she is little, she is...fierce isn't the right word. Spirited is more accurate. She's traveled far and wide to warn the half-human, half-elf Carissa Shae about a danger that's coming to the countryside. Carissa's Seelie Tree Apothecary shop is no stranger to faeries, but with this new arrival, its owner, and Moss Hill, will never be the same. Is this cozy town ready for a little Chaos?",
