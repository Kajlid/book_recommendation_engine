  "description": "The world is covered in darkness and all of the Gods but one has fallen. The power of the world now lies in the hands on the one remaining God and his undead minions. Wraiths and other undead cover the lands looking to kill whatever little life is still remaining. The only thing now standing in the way of their plan is the few people left behind with the ability or the lack of sanity to try to stand in their way. Can an unlikely band of outcast heroesâ€™ band together to find the one relic that can return the sun and Athyx to the way it was before or will their fights and losses all be in vain?",
