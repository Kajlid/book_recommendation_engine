  "description": "\"Lost souls, found again.... Lyrical and lovely: a standout Christmas story.\"— \nKirkus Reviews\n“Rice’s romanticized vision of Manhattan is sharpened by local detail, and her heartwarming Christmas story will please readers.”— \nPublishers Weekly\n“Destined to become an enchanting Christmas classic… Pick up this book and let its magic work wonders as it enlivens your soul.”— \nBest Reviews\nEvery year on the first day of December, Christopher Byrne traveled from his farm in Nova Scotia to sell his Christmas trees on the streets of Manhattan. But this year there'd be no cheer for the widower and his twelve-year-old daughter, Bridget. For New York City had taken Christy's only son, headstrong sixteen-year-old Danny, who'd run off without a trace.Librarian Catherine Tierney used to love the holidays: the lights, the carols, the nip in the air. But after her husband's death on Christmas Eve three years ago, the festivities seemed to start too early and last too long. Just before he died, Brian told his wife that he'd never leave her, that every Christmas he'd send Catherine a sign. On the quaint Chelsea street where she lives, Catherine will meet the tree seller from Novia Scotia. Both figured the world had forgotten the true meaning of Christmas. But they hadn't counted on finding each other, on fate, on second chances. . . and on a holiday gift of new love and new hope to last a lifetime.From the Hardcover edition.",
