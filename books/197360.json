And a vicar's younger sister with a meager dowry and unruly red hair has no hope of landing a gentleman of the ton...at least, not without her Aunt Honore's determined meddling... ...BUT CUPID'S AIM IS TRUE Alexander Braeburn is having a most agreeable dream while he dozes in his brother's orchard. A shapely young beauty is insisting on a kiss, and he obliges her...several times. But soon Willa Linnet has intruded on his reality in a way that is both delightful and disconcerting. Women like Willa are made for marriage and family, and Alex has little interest in either. And yet, as others begin to vie for her affections, Alex realizes that losing his lovely, spirited Willa would be the greatest mistake of all...",
