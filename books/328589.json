  "description": "Poetry Unrequited is Ron Smalec's first collection, sharing the highs and lows of the Almost Was, the Maybe Just Maybe, and the Never Will Be (depending on who you ask). Whether you are helplessly hoping or the victim of a missed connection, these poems commiserate one simple truth - we've all been there. But don't worry... it's not you, it's them.",
