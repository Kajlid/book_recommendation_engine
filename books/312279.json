  "description": "Intricate plotting, whirlwind pacing and behind-the-scenes authenticity made John Grisham's legal thriller The Firm a runaway best seller. Now he presents us with a masterfully drawn, fever-pitched courtroom drama of vengeance and retribution.On a spring afternoon in Clanton, Mississippi, when 10-year-old Tonya Hailey should have been attending to childlike things, two rednecks subjected her to a rape and beating so savage it would leave her scarred forever. Days later, unable to contain his grief and rage, her father, Carl Lee Hailey, took revenge against Tonya's attackers. Armed with an M-16 rifle, he pumped them full of bullets in a bloody courthouse massacre. To some, it was justice; to others, murder.Faced with the grim prospect of the gas chamber, Carl Lee sought help from Jake Brigance, a young, ambitious attorney whose adrenaline surged as he took on Carl Lee's defense. It was a case that was attracting national attention , a case that could mean fame and fortune. In short, a trial lawyer's dream.For Carl Lee Hailey was black; his politically ambitious prosecutor and judge--as well as his victims--were white.Before long, the case would transform a quiet Southern town into a battlefield, swarming with journalists and camera crews, marching Klansmen and singing civil rights groups, presided over by the National Guard. Soon, Jake Brigance would have more on his plate than he ever bargained for: a case that would shatter his life personally and professionally. In short, a trial lawyer's nightmare.(jacket description)",
