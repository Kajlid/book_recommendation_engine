  "title": "Twilight Tours: An Illustrated Guide to the Real Forks",
  "description": "Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series has become a genuine phenomenon in pop culture, approaching the popularity of the Harry Potter series. In 2008, 10,000 pilgrims descended on Forks, WA, the town of 3,100 people that is the setting for the books. After the fall 2008 release of the record-setting Twilight movie (which made more than $70 million in its opening weekend alone), many more fans are expected to arrive in Forks in 2009. Twilight Tours is a photographic guide to this mystical place. Included are 90 photos composed by noted photographer George Beahm, who also contributes the accompanying text. The pictures range from moody scenic shots of the rain forest and nearby tribal lands described in the four novels to photographs of the actual high school, police station, saltwater beach, and a certain vintage red pickup truck.",
