  "description": "After eight years of self-imposed exile, shy bombshell Cara O'Shea returns to her hometown to create her art in peace. Big city living has left her craving the quiet only a small town can offer. Bitter over the wreckage of her father's infidelity, she risks town gossip, and her heart, when she enlists the town's football hero to help renovate her studio and mend a decade-old rift.A career-ending injury and a failed marriage leave Michael \"Finn\" Finnegan questioning his worth and avoiding anything smacking of permanence. A playboy lifestyle soothes his battered ego, but lately the pretense has lost its appeal. However, one look at Cara, with her expressive green eyes and bunny-of-the-month body, and he's hell-bent on proving his worth with the shy artist--and himself.As old truths are revealed, will Cara and Finn overcome the mistakes of the past, trust their hearts at last, and take a chance on love?",
