  "description": "Everyone knows that magic and trouble go hand in hand...A dangerous spell cast over an unsuspecting village. An enchanted painting locked in a hidden room.A desperate race against time to break the spell before it's too late...It should have been a fresh start for the Widdershins. Finally free from the misty gloom of Crowstone and beginning a new life. But all is not as it seems in their postcard-pretty village. Their neighbours are acting strangely, and why do they flinch at the mere mention of magic?The Widdershins sisters have their own secret: a set of enchanted nesting dolls with the power to render their user invisible. The sisters must use their wits - and their magic - if they're to break the dark hold over the village, and save one of their own . . . but have they met their match this time?",
