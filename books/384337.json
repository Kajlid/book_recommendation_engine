Your immortality has a price; you have free interaction only with those of your \"generation\"; you see settlers from ten years before as blurred outlines. And a settler from fifty years before can walk right through you!IMAGINE... yourself as a tourist, struck by the wonder of the shimmering planet, yet careful to heed the date of the next predicted veilfall, knowing that to be on Azlaroc at veilfall is to be there forever.IMAGINE... yourself as the one man on Azlaroc who knows for a certainty that, this time, veilfall will come early, and without warning!",
