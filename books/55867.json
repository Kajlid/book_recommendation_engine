  "description": "The science fiction stories of Michael K. Rose can most accurately be described as eclectic. He is best known for his science fiction adventure series Sullivan’s War and in this collection you will find stories that adhere to the strongest expectations of the genre, such as “Sergeant Riley’s Account,” “Sleep” and “A Random Selection.”But you will also find stories that, while speculative in nature, owe more to literary fiction than anything else. Works such as “Main & Church,” “Inner Life” and “Pedro X.” explore the psyche as opposed to the outer reaches of the galaxy.Whatever your tastes, you are bound to discover many favorites amongst these ten stories. The first five have been previously available. The last five are new to this collection.Contents:\"Sergeant Riley's Account\"\"Sleep\"\"Inner Life\"\"Mahler's Tenth\"\"If I Profane with My Unworthiest Hand\"\"A Random Selection\"\"Main & Church\"\"The Tunnel\"\"Pedro X.\"\"The Vast Expanse Beyond\"\"Michael K. Rose is an insightful, compelling writer with a talent for nuance and timing. He is able to make the impossible seem perfectly plausible and the unlikely seem as natural as summer rain. Short Stories is not only fiction for the deep thinker but grand entertainment for the rest of us, too. The tales are thought-provoking, intriguing, and have a tendency to stay with the reader long after the last page is turned. Prepare to be immersed!\" - K. Wodke, co-author of Betrayed",
