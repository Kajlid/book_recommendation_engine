  "title": "Louis the Well Beloved",
  "description": "First volume in the French Revolution series; the people wanted to see their Louis as king in his own right, bringing back glory to France and prosperity to their hearths, but Louis cared only for the thrills of hunting and gambling, the excitements of war, until even these paled before the sensual delights offered by a succession of mistresses from beautiful waiting women to the celebrated Marquise de Pompadour: the early years of Louis XV and the women who ruled him.",
