  "description": "The author's commentary on the humor found in everyday events ranging from marriage to parenthood, dog ownership, health issues, and more. Kirkland is a master at finding the small hidden bits of humor in events that the rest of us might just as easily overlook. His goal with his writing has always been to let his readers laugh with him and at him, and by doing so, finding a way to laugh at themselves. His previous books have been called \"a must-have for all of us who love to just sit back and laugh.\" This book follows that tradition.",
