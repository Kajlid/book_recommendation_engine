Running around like a chicken with her head cut off, she's got a laundry-list of things to do. ZZ is hosting yet another one of her famous salons. Her nutty guests have more than their fair share of odd requests and strange demands. And now, friend Ben's estranged sister has been found dead in Zelda's pool, an apparent suicide, with a hairdryer floating beside her.Yet Foxtrot doesn't buy it.

And if it's the weather expert, what could the motive possibly be? It's a tall task, but with her fuzzy, slinky sleuths and a little bit of luck, Foxtrot might just solve her biggest mystery yetâ€¦",
