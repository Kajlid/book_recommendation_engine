  "description": "Hunters are a special breed, dedicated to tracking down treasures, magical beasts, and even other men. But such pursuits require a license, and less than one in a hundred thousand can pass the grueling qualification exam. Those who do pass gain access to restricted areas, amazing stores of information, and the right to call themselves Hunters.THE SECRET OF GREED ISLANDThe multi-trillionaire Battera hires Gon and Killua to play the Greed Island video game for him, just as the two had hoped. But when they enter the game and head to a nearby town, they stumble onto one of the game's dark secrets. Greed Island isn't just a game--it has real-life consequences that can spell life or death for the players involved. And it isn't long before the Spiders enter the game themselves!",
