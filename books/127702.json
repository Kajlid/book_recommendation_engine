  "description": "Recovering from addiction and a lonely childhood, Zander Grace resented his physicist father for years. But as he delves deeper into the man's insane experiments, he finds much more than he ever knew was possible. A discovery that reveals the science behind psychics, ghosts and soulmates, the source of our most powerful emotions and closest relationships.Overwhelmed by fear and doubt, Zander must grow into an unlikely hero, one who fights to protect millions of lives caught in an eternal war we can't see. Overwhelmed by love and longing, he fights for the heart of Bryn Sansa, a spirited Japanese dancer who won't let go of the wounds from her past. But Zander can't fight what he doesn't know. His uncle, a beloved priest, feels compelled to bring the discovery under the control of the Catholic Church. Even if he must trade Zander's life. Yet the greatest threat looms on the horizon. An island lies hidden in the South Pacific, a place where invisible creatures roam and kill, where emotions are passed through touch, and where bizarre experiments toy with the fabric of reality. Lynch Katlan is a psychopath beyond mercy, a man who drenches the island's tunnels in screams and blood. He hunts Zander Grace, determined to find the route to this vulnerable new world.Similar to The Passage, this book combines rich spirituality with the thrill of an adventure story. From the first page, the reader is nearly devoured by an island paradise that's not what it seems, then drawn even further into a scientific discovery that will make you question the very nature of the human soul.*Note* This book contains some violence. Reader discretion advised.",
