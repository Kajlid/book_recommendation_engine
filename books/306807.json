Before I didn't care about much, but now I have her and I’m not sure if I’ll be able to keep her protected from the inferno we’re about to face. She came into my life at the worst possible time.Danger's surrounding the club and I'm not sure what to do.My pride only reaches so far and so does my trust. Will she be able to snag them both and hold on, or will she be taken out with the bloodshed?",
