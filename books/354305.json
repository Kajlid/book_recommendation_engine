  "description": "A House on the Ocean, A House on the Bay spans the heyday of Picano's life in the Pines and Manhattan during the 1960s and 1970s. He chronicles his love affairs and the tortuous intricacies of a longtime love triangle, his hilarious misadventures as a bookstore employee (arranging a book party hosted by Jackie Onassis, lunchtime rendezvous in secret tunnels below Grand Central Station, getting framed for embezzlement!), and the thrills and agonies involved in the writing and publishing of his first novels, including Smart as the Devil and Eyes. Picano also regales us with stories about the legendary \"Class of 1975, \" the \"Gay 2,000\" - hip, political, talented, beautiful young men who formed and molded gay culture as it exists today. AIDS eventually spread through the Pines like wildfire and about 98 percent of the \"Gay 2,000\" are now dead, but Felice Picano has lived through it all, and he gives voice to those times with humor, candor, and wistfulness.",
