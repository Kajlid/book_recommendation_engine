  "title": "Devotions From The Earth - Skies: How Big is Our God",
  "description": "Our God is truly an artist. All of planet Earth has its beauty to behold, but the skies are the cherry on top. Just as in all of nature, the skies have lessons to teach us too. God uses all of it to tutor us along in our walk through life and our spiritual journey as well. The stunning images will bring to life the vastness and beauty of the skies and encourage you in your daily walk. The journaling pages give you space to write down your reflections on what the Lord is saying to you. I hope this 30 day devotional will help you slow down a bit and take another look at how the skies reflect the creator. He has so much to say to us through His creation!",
