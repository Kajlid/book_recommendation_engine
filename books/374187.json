  "description": "DO YOU DOUBT THE DAFFODIL is a bouquet of delightful and thoughtful bits of spiritual wisdom through the gardener's eye accompanied by engaging drawings and photographs. Belonging on the bedside table so you can go to sleep with it at night and awaken with it in the morning, this book is not a page-turner it's a book you want to get cozy with and revisit over a period of time. Each page is a spiritual journey of wisdom, play, challenges, quirky humor, and comfort that weaves a personal and uniquely different path for the reader. Written in garden metaphor, one walks through a garden and the garden of one's heart by reawakening to spring via newly sprouted seeds, grounding while smelling the tangy fragrance of pine, and experiencing the transformation in consciousness when an enclosure is held sacred. Bobbi Junod allows the reader to glimpse an inner landscape by witnessing her journey. If you are looking for a prize rose along your garden path, DO YOU DOUBT THE DAFFODIL provides the beauty and mystery that nature and spirit creates.",
