  "description": "\"When eight people go on a cruise in the Bahamas, they plan to swim, sunbathe, and relax. Getting shipwrecked is definitely not in the script. But after the yacht blows up they're stranded on a deserted island. Luckily for them, their beach camp location has fresh water and fire wood, and there's enough food to last them out. Just one problem remains as they wait to be rescued--they are not alone. In the jungle behind the beach there's a maniac on the loose with murder in his heart. And he's plotting to kill them all, one by one...\"--taken from the back cover",
