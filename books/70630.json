  "description": "Senator William Goulding is deeply enmeshed in the final stages of the 2012 Presidential election, but that is far from being the only thing that he is caught up in. As the election date draws nearer, his dubious past is catching up with him and people and circumstances that he had thought were long buried, are rising up again to threaten him with far more than just scandal and disgrace. With career ambitions hanging in the balance, powerful men looking to make good their threats and even a rogue reporter to worry about, where on earth can he turn for solace and security? Salvation comes in many forms, but perhaps none as unlikely as Charlotte ‘Charlie’ Turner, his young, virginal, personal assistant who at present sees him as little more than an asshole to be tolerated in order to receive her pay cheque! Can a leopard really change its spots? Can a politician really live a life of considered sense and propriety? Can Goulding ever be seen as anything other than a domineering bully by his colleagues and co-workers? Never underestimate the power of a woman’s touch, however inexperienced it might be. Charlie could very well hold all of the answers, and with her at his side, Goulding could very well accomplish anything.",
