  "title": "Darwin's Nemesis: Phillip Johnson and the Intelligent Design Movement",
  "description": "With the publication of Darwin on Trial in 1991, Cal Berkeley legal scholar Phillip Johnson became the leading figure in the intelligent design movement. Exposing and calling into question the philosophical foundations of Darwinism, Johnson led the charge against this largely unquestioned philosophy of materialistic reductionism and its purported basis in scientific research. This book reviews and celebrates the life and thought of Phillip Johnson and the movement for which he has served as chief architect. Editor William A. Dembski presents eighteen essays by those who have known and worked with Johnson for more than a decade. They provide personal and in-depth insight into the man, his convictions and his leadership of the intellectual movement that called into question the hegemony of Darwinian theory. Contributors include Stephen Meyer Michael Behe Jay Wesley Richards Thomas Woodward Francis Beckwith Timothy Standish David Berlinski Michael Ruse David Keller Jonathan Wells Scott Minnich Nancy Pearcey Jay Budziszewski Marcus Ross Paul Nelson Henry Schaefer III Wesley Allen Walter Bradley Phillip E.
