  "description": "Shy Stanley wanted desperately to touch his beautiful neighbor, Kelly, but he was awkward around women. Kelly befriended her timid neighbor and invited him over each night to watch TV and have a cup of tea. Stanley found a way to Kelly’s body, when he began drugging her each night. She thought the vivid sexual encounters were dreams, and didn’t know Stanley had turned her into his sex toy.It was only supposed to happen one night, and he wasn’t going to hurt her. She would never have to know he had been in her bedroom.The drug would keep her out for hours, regardless of what he might do to her. What he didn’t know, she was consciously aware of everything that was happening to her, trapped in a sensual fog, unable to resist and forced to submit.Stanley couldn’t stay away, but kept returning each night, finding new ways to use and claim her body.One morning, when Kelly awoke with an especially sore bottom, she began to think there was something funny about her dreams.",
