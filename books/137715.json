  "description": "It's where everyone knows your business—and remembers everything you'd rather forget. But somehow the little Catskills town of Marsden draws the most unlikely people back home, turns their lives every which way, and helps them finally figure out what—and who—they want most. . .As a celebrity photographer's assistant, Celia Marshall is used to seeing all kinds of weird antics. But subbing as the model in irrepressible movie star Niall Crenshaw's latest endorsement ad—while wearing his silk boxers, no less—is definitely not in her job description. Neither is falling for him, especially since he's dating his latest co-star. To complicate things further, Celia is returning to Marsden to keep an eye on her eccentric grandmother—and Niall is driving her there, then staying to judge a talent contest. . . Soon Celia is pulled in a dozen different directions, trying to get her grandmother to act her age, placating her frantic former boss who's organizing the contest—and attempting to stay away from funny, sexy Niall. Celia's always been level headed, but suddenly she's wishing she could get reckless right along with him. Has the time come for sensible Celia to cut loose?. . .96,500 Words",
