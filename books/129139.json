  "description": "What do you do when everything you've ever known is taken away from you? Do you throw your hands up and just let it be and fade away to nothing or do you fight?I may have technically died but Iâ€™m not dead and I refuse to give up everything I used to be or the woman who keeps my memory alive, even if it takes me tag teaming with some unlikely allies to do it. I may not be a human anymore but I am still me; Dylan Williams, a man of substance.",
