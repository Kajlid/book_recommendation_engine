  "description": "Entering the world of the dead, the detective discovers the [T R U T H] of what happened the night the Ainsworth Mansion burned down. With only victims and no witnesses, the souls of the dead commence the game. As the mystery unravels, the detective navigates a multiverse of shattering possibilities. A world with fireflies of soul and gargling demon butlers where the line between fantasy and reality blurs.AuthorÂ´s Note:This is my first piece of writing. Despite being happy with the story, I since realised the errors I made in editing. Although plentiful, I have chosen to keep this book permanently in the state it was first published to serve as an honest representation of what I first produced. It is imperfect, but I am still proud.",
