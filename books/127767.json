  "description": "Will Suze Sleepwalk Into The Arms Of Her Dream Man?Chronic sleepwalker Suze Charles's nocturnal rambles were legendary among her friends and family. But then she was up for a promotion in her career as an insurance adjuster. And it was anyone's guess whether her sleep would prevent her from thriving in a new work environment—or from finding a husband. During a business trip to Chicago, Suze met sleep disorder specialist David Grant—while she was in a sleepwalking trance! She was sure Grant was the man of her dreams—he was even unfazed by her Terror Twin nephews! But does the independent bachelor's interest in Suze go beyond a mere case study?",
