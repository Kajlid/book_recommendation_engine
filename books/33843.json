  "description": "In Hala El Badry s prize-winning and controversial novel, A Certain Woman, Nahid is a woman searching for liberation, not from a repressive society or a male-dominated world, but from self-imposed taboos that inhibit a woman s ability to find fulfillment. In a narrative much excoriated by conservative critics, Nahid s adulterous affair becomes an occasion to explore the subtleties and contradictions that surround sexuality, desire and love. A Certain Woman was awarded the Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature.",
