  "description": "The prince and the pauper...  After serving four years for a murder he didn’t commit, ex-cop River tries to avoid the human race. He runs street cons to make enough money for the dilapidated room he rents and the booze he drinks to stay numb. But when he tries to scam a gorgeous stranger who’s robbing an ATM, he soon realizes he’s tangled with the wrong man.  Braelan is the prince of the Seelie Fae, just arrived in the human realm to avoid becoming King. He also has unfinished business with his half-brother, who he owes a debt that may be impossible to repay. When a scruffy, unkempt human attempts to take the money he’s stealing, Braelan offers to pay him in exchange for spending the night with him -- though he has no idea why he’s attracted to the man.  Despite himself, River agrees to one night only -- and after the most incredible sex of his life, he realizes there’ll be no getting over Braelan anytime soon. But River doesn’t want to feel anything, and Braelan feels too much. While neither can deny what might be love, River’s past is coming back to haunt him ... and it will drag Braelan down with him.",
