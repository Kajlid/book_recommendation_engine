  "title": "The King's Druidess",
  "description": "Chiomara Ruadh, Druidess of Ulster, will not be swayed from prophecy. If the Gods of Ireland request that she couple with the king, so be it. If it is also their wish that he marry another woman, who is Chiomara, a simple Druid, to stand in their way? Erc Breac, king of the Dalriada, can only think of Chiomara. Her beauty is surreal and the tales that follow her across the land unsurpassed. But that is not enough when faced with the obligations of a king. His people must come first. His future wife and queen, Macha, must come first. Yet, fate is a slippery thing. Will Erc risk the whole of his kingdom for what lays in his heart? This story contains strong sexual content and is recommended for a mature audience. The King’s Druidess is the lead-in tale to The MacLomain Series. While The King’s Druidess is a short Celtic story, Fate’s Monolith (The MacLomain Series- Book 1), Destiny’s Denial (The MacLomain Series- Book 2) and Sylvan Mist (The MacLomain Series- Book 3) are full length novels. “Purington weaves an enchanted tale of love, magic, and sacrifice that will leave you wanting more!” ~Rynne Raines, author of The Awakening “This story is suggestive, and haunting. It is carried by the power of desire, the power of passion, and the power of desperation. There is a richness here that is hard to convey.” ~Nancy A. Lindley- Gauthier Please This is a re-launch of titles published years ago. The stories have been revised and tightened. And as aforementioned, the sensual heat level for all four has been turned way up.",
