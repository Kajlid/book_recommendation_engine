  "description": "A TOP 100 INTERNATIONAL AMAZON BESTSELLERObsession is the deadliest vice.ValentinAs the heir to the devil himself, my name is whispered in fear and respect. I take no prisoners and leave no witnesses. Mercy doesn't exist in my world until one mouthy bartender turns it upside down. Chaos forces me to kidnap her, but insanity compels me to cross a dangerous line.My obsession with her risks both my empire and our lives, but now that I have Eden beside me, I won't let her go. If we burn, we burn together. EdenMy life has always been riddled with bad decisions, but one night of being in the wrong place at the wrong time changes it forever. Abducted and held against my will, I find myself thrust into a long-standing cartel war as an involuntary pawn. I'll make it out of here, and when I do, the guilty will fall one by one. As long as I can stop myself from falling for the kingpin. The one who takes everything and promises nothing. I should hate him. He holds me prisoner, but I'm the one who refuses to leave.*The Carreras are not good men. They commit crimes to line their pockets and sin to warm their beds. They use foul language, wield weapons like utensils, and every single character's morals are questionable at best. This is a dark romance. There may be triggers, so if you are easily offended, this story may be too much for you.If you're still here, bienvenidos! The cartel is waiting...**The Carrera Cartel books are all standalones and can be read out of sequence. However, if you prefer to avoid spoilers, it's highly recommended that you read them in order.",
