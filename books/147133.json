Lately, those dreams have taken on a dark and tantalizing twist, but when the opportunity to visit the Emerald Isle comes at last, Lacey doesn’t hesitate. What—and who—she finds on her journey will change her life, and maybe end it entirely. Ronan Fitzpatrick is a man both blessed and cursed. Blessed with a loving and close-knit family and cursed with a crushing burden no man should have to bear. For centuries out of mind, Ronan has been faoladh, the werewolf. Ronan may fight on the side of light, but he lives with a darkness threatening to swallow him whole. Only his family keeps him from crossing over and he would do anything to protect them. Anything. When his dreams show him an American woman, a woman who can shift the balance within him and possibly destroy everything he holds dear, Ronan knows what he must do. Could you kill an innocent to save your family?",
