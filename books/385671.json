  "description": "Never venture out of bounds without a buddy preferably two.Dara s past four incredible years have been lived to the fullest. Along with her best friends, Kane and Jack, she s left no local wilderness unexplored, no ski slope unchallenged. Yet lately she wonders why they ve never seen her as more than a buddy with breasts. When or if either man will cross that unspoken line.It s a line Kane eyes harder every day. Since high school, he and Jack have shared everything. A condo, vacations and their best girl. Kane s ready to get serious about his wilderness school and outfitter business, and that includes putting down roots. Preferably with Dara.Wary of the men who ve recently been sniffing around Dara, Jack has a growing sense that he or Kane better make a move soon, or they re going to lose out on their perfect match. Question is, who does she prefer and who s going to bring their easygoing trio to an end?Overhearing the boys arguing over her, Dara s floored and torn. Choose between them? No way. Drastic measures are called for, a plan for their annual holiday getaway that will clarify her feelings once and for all or lose everything in a sexual storm of whiteout proportions.Warning: Old friends turned lovers can get into the most trouble exhibitionism, bondage, spanking. Anal sex, oral sex, unauthorized use of ski safety harnesses, icicles in the hot tub The author apologizes in advance for any melted monitors.\"",
