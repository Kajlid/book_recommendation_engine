  "description": "Brimming with New England magic, charming mystery and adventure infused with ‘90s nostalgia.When three young cousins experience an explosion of nature-infused magic at their Grandma Lydia's orchard, their parents whisk them off to opposite corners of New England. But distance cannot contain their witchy destiny forever and in 1995 - one fateful October night - tenacious dreamer, Raven, now 18 years old, has a near death experience that ignites mystical forces from within. Soon after, her hilarious bestie of a cousin, the vivacious and ever-so snappy Killian, has his own shocking encounter. But will the third and final member of their cousinly trifecta, the bubbly, bi-racial Adelaide be down to ride this supernatural rollercoaster? Sweet, eccentric Grandma Lydia is waiting at Cider Mill with bated breath and a mountain-high pile of fresh-baked confections. She's been a coven of one for far too long and is eager to immerse the teenage trio in the \"Green Witch Way.\" But her unconventional methods aren't always as sweet as cider. Magic and mischief collide as the cousins soon begin to unspool a thread of family secrets so disenchanting it might send 'em running (or flying) for the hills. Cider Mill Coven is full of twists at every turn. It's a story of family and forgiveness, friendship… and forbidden love. From a magical treetop retreat to a spellbinding elixir that serves to protect a secret society of nature-loving covens from discovery, this '90s coven tale is sure to conjure up a hypnotizing blend of spookiness and delight.",
