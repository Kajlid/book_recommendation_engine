  "title": "Fifty Shades of Brown: Thoughts excreted from an ER brain",
  "description": "Surviving a decade in the ER requires a sense of humor and some personal spirituality. This book has both in plenty. What is this book?This book can't be put in a box! Well, actually it can, but it’s difficult. It’s like a person. Sometimes it’s comedic, sometimes substantive. Sometimes cute and occasionally repulsive. Sometimes moral, sometimes less so. Sometimes Christian, sometimes agnostic, sometimes Jewish, just like your college roommate. Finding this book in a library should be simple. You can find it under fiction, nonfiction, religious, novels, historical, futuristic, philosophical, scientific, comedic, and stupid. I think that’s about it. That covers it. Now that we’ve succinctly summed up the content category, you may continue.",
