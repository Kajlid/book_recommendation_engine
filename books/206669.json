  "description": "Life is good for lodge owner and sometime hitwoman Nadia Stafford — a couple of dogs, a job she takes satisfaction in and the man she loves at her side as they literally build a home together. It’s as close to normal as a pair of contract killers can get.  Jack knows that sometimes being very, very good at what you do can be very, very bad — for those around him. He’s gone to great lengths to keep his past from catching up with Nadia. He also knows it’s only a matter of time …  Jack is halfway around the world when the trap is triggered. They’re coming for Nadia. And he has no way to warn her.  Note: This is a novella, not a full-length novel.",
