  "description": "The Wind on the Heath is a novel about talent. More specifically, it is about the talent of an actress: Annie Jeynor, one of the most prominent actresses of the twentieth-century stage. Commissioned to help Dame Anne (as she now is) to write her memoirs in her graceful house overlooking the Firth of Clyde, the narrator Bill Thompson at once comes up against the actress's ability to electrify an audience with a performance - and to conceal her true self. In establishing certain facts about Annie's life - her rise in the Twenties from dance-hall hostess to her first straight role as Viola in Twelfth Night, her disgrace as a collaborator in Berlin and her subsequent rehabilitation as a double agent and popular heroine after the War - Bill finds that Annie not only shrugs off all attempts to label her, but is also curiously reticent about her childhood. Only much later, after Bill's chronicle has taken to all the locations - London, Berlin, Hollywood, Scotland - and Annie's best performances onstage and off, and the stories of all her lovers (who provide the one reliable guide to her career), does Annie reveal her bizarre start in life and the seeds of her extraordinary talent.",
