  "description": "The year is 1943, and Andy Gledhill’s months of training as a paratrooper have culminated in his being assigned to the 89th Airborne. But he soon learns that the government has other plans for him. The newly formed Office of Strategic Services needs soldiers with language talents like Andy’s to drop into Europe behind enemy lines and help fight the war from the inside out. Andy’s new life of deception and sabotage is worlds away from his upbringing in sleepy little Delta, Utah. But even that town is changing, as the nearby Topaz relocation camp ignites racial tensions. And Whisper Harris, the girl Andy left behind, is caught in a maelstrom of conflicting emotions brought on by the war. Should she release Andy from the promises they’ve made, as he seems to have released her? Or should she keep on hoping?",
