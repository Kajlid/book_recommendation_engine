  "description": "The defense ministers of three enemy countries, China, USA, and Russia, have been murdered simultaneously on the same night. The countries suspect each other and are preparing for war without a defense minister, a war which would inevitably lead to a world war. Wilston Sebastian, a mastermind criminal who operates from the the most secure jail, is accused to be the cause of the global unrest. The popular opinion is to put him, forth the victim counties and delay the war. But the judge, being an old friend of Wilston, doesn't go with the popular opinion. He, instead, gives Wilston three days to solve three continental murders from his cell. He sends out his trusted friend and a warden of the jail, to further investigate the murders. But that doesn't prove to be of any help. Instead, they fall deeper into the dark plots of their antagonists. The tables of odds turn against them every time they seem to progress. Will Wilston Sebastian be able to prove his innocence and stop the war that would be the end of humanity?",
