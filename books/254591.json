  "description": "When Mike discovers a message directing him to an abandoned car, he has no way of knowing his life is about to fall off a precipice. After losing everything he cares about, very nearly including his mind and his life, he decides to fight back against the forces that are intent on destroying him. Mr Clarke, a loner with a terrifying past, lives his life according to a chart. A chart on which he logs every insult, slight and perceived attack upon himself. A chart he uses to redress the balance. And also a chart that could end up destroying the lives of everyone its owner comes into contact with. Spoon has a dream. To leave his dead-end existence, to get out of the filthy squat he shares with his so-called friends and to finally make a life for himself. The only problem is, the world and those in it seem determined to rise up and thwart his every move. Set over a three-week period, The Drowners is a tale about revenge. It is an account of how lives are consumed, twisted and ultimately destroyed by hatred and the desire for retaliation. It is also the tale of how from seemingly impossible odds, people can overcome all obstacles in their path to achieve their dreams. By turns shocking, poignant and laugh out loud funny, the Drowners could be the life of the Count of Monte Cristo, if he had been brought up on cheap drugs and alcohol in 1980's Britain.",
