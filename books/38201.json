  "description": "Former event planner Nicole Riley lost not only her job, but part of her humanity when a concert in L.A. fails catastrophically and the band attacks a rival werewolf pack. Now Nicky keeps her \"inner beast\" subdued by taking wolfsbane and refuses to become a monster. She's trying to rebuild her reputation and manages the Bitter Black nightclub where Brody Dunn is the dee-jay. Brody Dunn, a former special crimes detective, turned private investigator, plays on Nicole's sympathy by claiming to have just suffered a wolf bite. He keeps his past, careers, agenda and just about everything else from Nicole - except for his attraction. They have bigger problems than Brody's lies. Nicole's boss is a ruthless drug lord, determined to have Nicole for himself. The danger increases for everyone when he challenges the local Alpha. If they survive, and she can forgive Brody's betrayal, will she accept what they've become?",
