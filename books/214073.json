  "description": "Nobody knows me. Not my neighbors, not people I go to school with, not even my family. Somedays I am convinced that I don’t even know myself. How could I? I haven’t experienced anything to know if I like it. But here is what I know so far.First, I love the color orange. Like the color of the sky, right as the sun is setting. It is absolutely my favorite thing in the entire world. And I wonder, do all sunsets look like they do in Florida? Or is it different in other parts of the world.Second, I love the smell of salt water. Even though I live in Florida, I have never been to the beach, but sometimes, when the wind is blowing, I smell the salt water. I try to imagine what it’s like to walk on the sand and feel the waves crash around my ankles. I think it would be nice.And third, this one I’m not sure about, but I think I’m a people person. I love watching people to see how they interact with each other. I always wonder what it would be like to be them… to have friends. I wonder what makes each person who they are. I wonder what they are thinking. I’m not sure that I will ever truly know.But then I meet them.My world is turned upside down and I am introduced to a new world—a world I didn’t know existed.Finding Me is book 1 in The Spy Chronicles.Book 1: Finding MeBook 2: Keeping Me (coming soon)",
