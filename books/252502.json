  "description": "It's time to face the magic.I like my life—hunt down dangerous magic, stay alive. Two really simple goals. Except I’m a FireSoul, a dangerous supernatural whose power comes from dragons, and nothing is simple. Staying alive means keeping my secret, but when a little snafu lands me in hell, I run into the Warden of the Underworld. He’s a one of a kind demon shifter—the sexiest, most powerful one I’ve ever met—and when I escape hell, he follows me, determined to drag me back. Obviously I’m not keen on going, and helping him catch an escaped demon gives me an opportunity to win my freedom. But I have to team up with him to do it. I'll have to use my forbidden magic to get the job done. It's a recipe for discovery… and disaster.This boxed set contains all five books in the Dragon's Gift: The Seeker series. They're fast-paced urban fantasy adventures starring a kick butt heroine, a powerful hero, and otherworldly adventure.",
