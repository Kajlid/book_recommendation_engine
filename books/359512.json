  "description": "They say the blues tells a story, but legendary blues guitarist, Nathan Gale, has run out of words. Fifteen years ago, he had the world at his feet--- his first platinum record, a sold-out tour, and the girl of his dreams by his side. Then everything changed. Fame swallowed him whole. His passion for music faded. And a love that felt eternal couldn’t survive the demands of his celebrity. Without Lucinda, his music has no soul. Without her, he’s a man without a heart.Five years ago, Nathan Gale lost his world. This year, he’s going home to Texas--- and he's getting her back.",
