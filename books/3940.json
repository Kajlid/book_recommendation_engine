  "description": "Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found hereEvery jury has a leader, and the verdict belongs  to him. In Biloxi, Mississippi, a landmark tobacco  trial with hundreds of millions of dollars at  stake begins routinely, then swerves mysteriously off  course. The jury is behaving strangely, and at  least one juror is convinced he's being watched. Soon  they have to be sequestered. Then a tip from an  anonymous young woman suggests she is able to predict  the jurors' increasingly odd behavior. Is the jury  somehow being manipulated, or even controlled? If  so, by whom? And, more important, why?",
