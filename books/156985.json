  "description": "Life's going well for Steven Borgia. Sure, he may not be a famous professional wrestler like his father, the legendary Deathslayer, but he has carved out a niche for himself as a Kindergarten teacher in New York City. There's only one thing missing; Someone special to share his life with. When Steve meets the sharp-tongued Autumn--a big wrestling fan--he's mesmerized by her sarcastic and bold personality. Feisty and foul-mouthed, she seizes life by the throat and refuses to let it go. Though they may seem like opposites, they compliment each other very well. After all, differences make good sparks, and there are plenty of sparks both in and out of the bedroom... Steve's new happiness is threatened when Autumn's life is in jeapordy, and the only one who can save her is the estranged father she hasn't seen in fifteen years.   Hilarious and heartwarming, Forever Autumn takes you on a journey that will tickle you in more ways than one.",
