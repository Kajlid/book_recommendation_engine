Quint Reagan hung up his badge, sold his ranch, and with a Smith and Wesson Russian, two Colt's, a Winchester and a coach gun went on the hunt. The Triple R had a hundred riders...but he only wanted to tack the hide of seven to the outhouse wall but the powerful owner was one of them. Sometimes revenge is the best medicine for a broken heart.",
