  "description": "“I’m not an ordinary child. I’m the daughter of Ian McRae – an assassin. That alone is big. But a hit-man who can read minds and can make you do and forget things by the touch of his hand? The word ordinary will never apply. Not in a million years. Especially, since I have the same ability.”In general, Elle’s main concern is to keep her secret life a secret. Act normal. Live as normal. Blend in.But when a boy saves her from a near mishap, Elle has no idea that this boy will unravel her, she has no idea that she will make decisions that are unheard of, she has no idea that she will be pulled in the middle of a dangerous hunt – between her own father and the boy who saved her.",
