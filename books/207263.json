  "description": "Alicia Parson has no memory of who she was before she was found alone and unconscious on a beach in North Wales by Wulfric Stansfield. A year later, and still struggling to remember her past, whilst living with Wulfric on his family's farm, she is confronted by a strange and fiery woman by the name of Cassandra, who claims to have known her in the past and warns her that the old danger that she had mortally fought have returned. The Shadows, a parasitic entity that claims the lives and bodies of those touched by them have escaped their prison from inside a black mirror. Cassandra instructs Alicia that she must follow her back into the Eárie; a parallel world where hill tribes live in wooden forts in the mountains and return to her own people, the Færignites, people blessed with control over the energies of the earth, to continue their fight against the Shadows. They must travel on foot, against the dangers of the land, while the Shadows grow in strength. Meanwhile, Nathan O'Hara, haunted by his father's suicide takes refuge in the solitude he finds in the rugged mountains of the Eárie until he sent on his own mission by a siren to find the mysterious \"party of three...\" he must learn to bear the burden of company again of two playful sprites, Passer and Lamprey.",
