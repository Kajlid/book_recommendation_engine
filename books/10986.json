  "description": "There’s a double robbery in two identical apartments, rented but hardly ever used by a Pittsburg drug dealer who’s clean with the law. A young woman is found shot dead on the street. She can’t be identified, but her murder has all the appearances of a professional hit. The mayor is near hysteria, and he smears the case all over Balzic, who not only has to solve the murder but teach his nosy new boss the not-so-plain facts of police work.",
