  "title": "The House of Three Murders",
  "description": "In the fall of 1960, the lives of four young people collide at The House of Three Murders in the middle of the vast Mojave Desert. The encounter alters all of their lives in different ways, but none of them will ever be the same. The novel follows the four: three white teenagers and a young Mojave Indian, as their lives spin off in different directions. A deputy sheriff, a liquor store owner and a woman living a marginalized life are part of the unfolding story. The narrative provides a look into small-town life in an isolated desert railroad town. A member of the Mojave Tribal Council, her wheelchair-bound son, a politically ambitious school superintendent, a lonely man grieving his wife, and a mysterious, wealthy family play prominent roles in the novel.",
