In truth, she was not quite thirteen—and poor Dean was soon off to prison, a convicted sex offender, still smitten with his adolescent lover.Now he’s finally free again, only to be ensnared by two crimes that have Chief Detective Inspector Lloyd pulling out what’s left of his hair. One is an infant kidnapping; the other is the murder of Kayleigh’s mother on the very eve of the family’s sudden move to Australia. Lloyd thinks he hears the ring of truth in Dean’s declarations of innocence. But with his partner Judy out on maternity leave, he’ll have to pick his way alone through this minefield of birth, death, murder, and domestic evil.",
