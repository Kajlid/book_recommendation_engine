Now he's a famous commander and has returned to ask the King for permission to court his beautiful daughter, a Princess who has a reputation for being difficult and reckless. But there is danger lurking, and when Larian tries to foil an evil plot Lizbett's defiant nature puts them both in danger. With the ominous threat still looming, he must find a way to stop her foolishness. If you enjoy adult fairytales in fanciful realms, and hunky heroes who know how to deal with difficult damsels, venture into Verdana.
