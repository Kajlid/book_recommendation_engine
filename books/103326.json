Promising actor Martin Stevens drinks and drugs himself from Hollywood to the streets. Extraterrestrials benignly dominate the earth until they suddenly demand humans make Bakersfield the world’s greatest city. A shy teacher becomes an obsessive art collector and then his favorite painters start to die. The author of a biographical novel with portions critical of French behavior before and during World War II goes to Paris to promote his book. A lonely Nebraska farmer learns Spanish so he can visit Mexico City and pursue the beautiful women he sees on television. A scholarly couple time travel back to the Battle of Stalingrad and find they can’t return. General MacArthur speaks about matters personal and historical. A family is ravaged by colon cancer. A beautiful, bestselling female author enrages three male writers in New York City. Ernest Hemingway visits Frida Kahlo in her Blue House. Thomas Jefferson is prosecuted for mistreatment of slaves. A bold investor should have been more careful. So should many other characters in this collection.",
