  "title": "Serial Killers",
  "description": "A well-liked, respected, caring pillar of the community – or an outsider, socially inept and with a frightening appearance? Wearing many different masks, serial killers are among the most disturbing and dangerous violent criminals in existence.They are individuals who have a history of multiple murders, normally committed over a long period of time and often with periods of apparent normality in between.With their different appearances and motives serial killers are hard to identify and often much harder to understand. Yet they must be caught because the one unifying characteristic all serial killers share is their inability to feel remorse for their actions, and consequently their need to keep on killing...Some profilers believe that serial killers don’t learn from their mistakes. This book explores the greed-factor that sets in and explains how killers come to think that the more they kill and get away with it, the easier it will become.",
