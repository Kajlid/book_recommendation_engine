  "title": "Guises of Guyana",
  "description": "Away from the Atlantic coastal belt where the majority of Guyana's citizens dwell, deep in the country's interior, lies a very different reality - an intoxicating mix of both dense virgin rainforest bordering on the claustrophobic and vividly contrasting open savannas as far as the eye can see. This is home to an eclectic bunch of mammals, reptiles, birds and various Amerindian tribes, whose lives and customs have remained surprisingly intact for hundreds of years despite the pervasive onslaught of globalisation. It may not always remain this way however if a much mooted road improvement project between northern Brazil and Guyana gets the go-ahead.Guyana in many ways now finds itself at a geopolitical watershed mirroring its geographic location, the mighty Essequibo River, the continent's third largest, sandwiched in between the Orinoco in Venezuela and the Amazon in Brazil.This is a place difficult to penetrate but where persistence and dogged resilience pay off handsomely.\"Guises of Guyana - Peering into the Interior\" lifts the lid on some of the more remarkable people, places, flora & fauna found within this wondrous country's heartland.",
