  "description": "Julie's best friend, Ashleigh, is an enthusiast. Julie never knows what new obsession will catch Ashleighs fancy, but she does know she's likely to be drawn into the madness.Ashleighs latest craze is Julies own passion, Pride and Prejudice. But Ashleigh can't just appreciate it as a great read; she insists on emulating the novel's heroines, in speech, dress, and the most important element of all finding True Love. And so Julie finds herself with Ashleigh, dressed in vintage frocks, sneaking into a dance at the local all-boys prep school, where they discover some likely candidates.The problem with Ashleigh's craze this time, however, is that there is only one Mr. Darcy. So when the girls get a part in the boys school musical, what follows is naturally equal parts comedy and romance, as a series of misinterpreted and missed signals, dating mishaps, and awkward incidents make Julie wonder if she has the heart for True Love.",
