  "description": "Amity is a disillusioned angel. For countless millennia, she's helped her assignments find truth in their experiences and improve their lives. Once, she'd been tender and caring, but humanity's misuse of free will and her own missteps have left her jaded. Now, all Amity allows is the truth. Get in, get out, and never let them know that she’s there. That’s the motto she's lived by for years. She considers her latest assignment nothing more than the next in a long line of jilted lovers that she’s had to help. When her presence exposes more than either of them was ready for, will they be able to find the truths hidden deep within the other? Or will the fallout leave them both in tatters? The truth will set them free. Won’t it?",
