  "description": "Danny Wormwood is the Anti-Christ, his father is Satan, and his demonic powers help him fit right into New York's slimy television entertainment business. Danny's best friend is Jesus, the savior of humanity whose brain damage -- a tragedy of mob violence -- keeps him from performing miracles these days. There's a scheduled Armageddon coming right up, and an insane Pope out for Danny's blood. Can this reluctant Anti-Christ avert the apocalypse, withstand the forces of Heaven and Hell aligned against him, and keep his girlfriend blissfully in the dark from his true heritage? A tale of Armageddon and the Anti-Christ from Garth Ennis, the creator of PREACHER!",
