Depression, red wine and no future, or so Suzie Ivy thought.An advertisement on a drugstore bulletin board changed Suzie’s thinking and lands her in the police academy. Was she out of her mind? No, and she decided to live up to the challenge. The biggest question; is the Police Academy ready for Suzie Ivy?This story is filled with determination, full body muscle pain and laughter. Did you know, to pass the new polygraph testing, you sit on butt plates because your butt cheeks clench when you lie? Or how a normal person feels after being administered the rigorous psychological testing with the end result for passing being low pay, enormous amounts of stress, and the pleasure of working graveyard shifts? The advertisement should have read, “Crazy People Wanted.”",
