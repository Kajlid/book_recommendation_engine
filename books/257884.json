  "description": "Simone Yang is afraid of heights. Like, REALLY afraid of heights. Even flying alone on an airplane to visit her grandma for the summer freaks her out. So when a creepy old broken-down carnival comes to town, only the idea of impressing her new friends is enough to get Simone to ride the Ferris wheel. But as the ride creaks slowly toward the sky, can Simone keep her cool, or is her worst fear about to come true?",
