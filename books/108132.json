  "description": "What does it mean to be a Kick-Ass Fairy? Looking for a fairy tale to make into a musical? Look somewhere else. Linda Zercoe offers up a series of unfortunate events in a memoir that rivals the stories of the Brothers Grimm. Life can be capricious and cruel. In this memoir, the author-heroine faces family tragedy and battles multiple forms of cancer. Through one trial after another, Zercoe learns to harness her talents and powers and develop the strength, gumption and resilience to make a life worth living. Attitude is a potent charm against all forms of adversity, and this particular kick-ass fairy proves it’s not what you’ve got, but what you do with it that counts.",
