  "description": "Stuck With Me is a stand alone novel set in Kristen Proby’s With Me in Seattle Universe. Dev Modi is the most irritating man Lyra Castillo has ever known. He’s overly flirty, makes inappropriate jokes and knows exactly how to push her buttons to keep her in a perpetual state of annoyance. If only he didn’t look like he belonged on the cover of a magazine. And if only his confidence didn’t match his unbelievably good looks.Lyra is sexy as hell, but that doesn’t mean Dev is wasting another minute trying to pursue her, or even get in her good graces. No, that ship has sailed. Instead, the one he has dubbed “The Mistress of Evil” is now someone he has to tolerate for his best friend’s sake, but that doesn’t mean he’ll ever stop messing with her. That’s just way too much fun.Dev and Lyra both agree to go on a ski trip to ring in the new year with their best friends. But, when a snow storm keeps their friends from reaching the resort, Dev and Lyra have to figure out a way to get through four days together in isolation without killing each other…or falling in love.",
