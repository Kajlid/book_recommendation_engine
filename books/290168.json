  "description": "A note from Audrey: Some series can be read out of order - this isn’t one of them. Start with Alpha and welcome to Ghost Mountain!  That day when a polar bear shifter arrives in a plane full of purple yarn and all hell breaks loose...  Ronan is coming. He’s a big bear—an enormous bear—and arriving at Ghost Mountain is going to change the shape of who he is forever. All it will take is a little engineering, a lot of duct tape, and a pack willing to use history and hope to do the impossible.",
