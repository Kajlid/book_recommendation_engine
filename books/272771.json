  "description": "Having survived the dangers on Fenaira and the confrontation on Taladin, Rena finds herself in the surprising position of being next in line as Resdentay of Taladin, which gives rise to mounting political turmoil. Amidst the splintering factions, growing unrest on the planet forces officials from the capital of the Galactic Confederacy to intervene regarding the murder charges that still linger over her. The decision is made to hold her trial, as well as that of Beka's Guardian squad, at the capital on Baraytha in order to achieve an impartial judgment regarding the accusations against them, and to settle the increasing discord.Travel to Baraytha has been restricted, however, forcing them to go by ship. They are accompanied by another group of Guardians, who are assigned to ensure their arrival at the trial, as well as guards to keep them in line. Among the others traveling with them are members of the Donay family, who are vying for political favor, and a colonel in the Sentinels, a branch of the Defense Forces that is known for investigating infractions among the other branches.In the midst of family intrigue over the Resdentay position, Beka and Rena depart for Baraytha with the corrupt group, known only as the Junta, shadowing their trip. More dangers lie ahead of them, including a threat far more sinister than anything they have encountered before. Facing plots to dispose of the political obstacle that they present, and the efforts of the Junta to determine how much they know, Beka and Rena are caught in a tangle of deception that could very well destroy them.",
