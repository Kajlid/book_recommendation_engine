  "description": "I would love to present sports in school to Congress. This will give each student the opportunity to join in daily physical Education or join in sports during school hours. Sports like soccer, martial arts, and ballet, gymnastic, cheerleading. The parents will pay for the Uniforms and small fee to attend these Classes during P.E. This would save time and money for families. Our Kids are in school all-day, they go home they eat, do homework, and rush to attend sport practice and sleep. If they practice during school hours in place on P.E. It would make school Fun again, and more time to spend with family on school nights. I would love to see the Gladiator Duel sports in school and at the Olympic.",
