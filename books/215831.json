In this groundbreaking book, bestselling author Madhur Jaffrey presents more than 100 of the best curries, many recorded for the very first time, plus all the savory accompaniments to serve with them.In this fascinating volume, Madhur traces the origins of curry, explaining how Indian immigrants brought ingredients and techniques to new lands, creating an ever-growing cornucopia of delicious hybrids. To illustrate the evolution of curry, and its close relative, the kebab, she not only includes the finest recipes from India—like Hyderabadi Ground Lamb with Orange and Dry Masala Fish—but a wide variety of exotic curries from all over the world. Enticing recipes include Sumatran Lamb Curry from Indonesia, Red Beef Curry from Sri Lanka, Burmese Chicken-Coconut Soup from Myanmar, Lobster in Yellow Curry Sauce from Thailand, Vietnamese Pork with Lemongrass, Lamb Shanks Braised in a Yogurt Sauce from Pakistan, and even a beef curry from Japan, where, as in the United Kingdom, curry is one of the most popular meals, even among schoolchildren. To complement the curries, there are soups, noodles, breads, chutneys, beans, vegetables, and, best of all, twenty recipes for easy and deliciously spiced kebabs.Beautifully illustrated and filled with the kind of comprehensive insight into the art of curry that only Madhur Jaffrey could provide, From Curries to Kebabs makes fascinating reading for cooks everywhere and will be an outstanding addition to any curry lover’s library.",
