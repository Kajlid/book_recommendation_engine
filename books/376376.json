  "description": "In Wicked Hearts, Hank Seeley, Reese's controlling ex-lover, did his best to come between Reese and Jeff. Still bitter over Reese's desertion, Hank continues to use anger and sex to cover the shards of his broken heart. Not even bothering to pick up guys at bars, Hank orders in, calling for young rent boys to service him until he grows tired of them. When Russell Evans, a big bear of a man, shows up one night instead of the ordered twink, Hank ends up getting more than he bargained for.Russell is a sex worker with issues of his own. He's also a Dom with lots of heart, who sees a glimmer of the real man trapped beneath the cold facade Hank presents to the world. Russell is used to comforting the lonely men who seek out his services, but he doesn't count on his own powerful reaction to the handsome, difficult Hank Seeley.On this tough road to redemption, Hank will fall hard before he can hope to rise. The erotic exploration of dominance and submission is enough to draw the two men into a passionate connection, but in the end, it may not be enough. Unless Hank can face his own demons, he will lose the one thing worth fighting for - love.",
