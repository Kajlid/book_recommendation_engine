  "description": "Kyle James cashed in my V card and then disappeared like I was the finishing act in a magic show. I vowed to hate my best friend, turn the longing and secret obsession with him into toxic hate and maybe a poorly chosen tattoo. But as the years passed, I let go of any notions I'd ever see him again...until he sauntered on campus my senior year as a new transfer student. All of Rake Forge was obsessed with his inked skin and that darkness that seemed to seep out of every methodical step he took. I wasn't. I knew the boy underneath, and while I wanted to know where he'd been...I would never ask. Until my dad needed a favor. His team required a way in with my ex-best friend, and his contacts.I knew Kyle would see through it...but I went anyway.Suddenly, my world, made of black and white was bleeding color...and he was at the center, daring me to trust him.My heart, blind and foolish chose to not only trust but to love him too.I really should have known better. I was merely a way in for my father, and for the man, I loved...I was just a way out. *This is the final book in the Rake Forge Series*",
