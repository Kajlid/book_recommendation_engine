  "description": "“They say that music soothes the savage beast, eh? I’ve found that some good chain, a paddle, and a few clamps work worlds better!”  Argus is a werewolf hunter, but not the traditional kind. Whereas other hunters favor various silver weapons, stakes, mercury-tipped arrowheads, poison mistletoe, wolfsbane, and the application of fire, Argus takes a different tack. Why kill a werewolf when you can subdue him? Werewolves are big, beautiful creatures, for all their snarling savagery. There's no need to extinguish them from the world . . . not when you've got silver chains to bind them, and a silver paddle to give them a good lesson in manners instead. They've just got to learn who the alpha is, that's all.  . . . Now as for where the silver butt plugs come in, well, that's a trade secret.  Featuring 21,000 words of kinky bondage, spanking, and submission of hulking werewolves, as well as the men who hunt them. A gay erotic story where slavering beasts with uncontrollable sexual appetites hunt for both prey and mates under a full moon, and only one man has the skills required to tame them. While a standalone tale, Argus the Werewolf Spanker also expands on and takes place in the same world as previous story from S.G. CroupCover Artist: Pocky Rumz",
