But when he took her in his arms and arched her neck deeply for his kiss, it wasn't fear for her life that consumed her. At his mercy in every way, Cerise must fight the dizzying rush of passion that assails her at his every punishment--his every kiss--if she is ever to see her homeland again. Rating: Contains graphic explicit sex and language as well as mild BDSM.",
