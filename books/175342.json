My mind struggles to rationalize what I'm seeing and I tell myself that it's just a trick of the light, or that maybe I'm hallucinating due to the crushing amount of fear I'm feeling, because when I look at them, all I see is darkness. Deep dark voids that threaten to swallow me whole.'  When 17 year old Hanna Harper agrees to see a local band at The Iron Knife Club with her two best friends, she has no idea her life is about to change forever and that everything she thought was impossible...isn't.  Marked with a mystical symbol by a dying boy, she's thrust into a world she never imagined existed where her eyes are opened to the reality that fallen angels are very real, and very dangerous. And with just one look from their soulless black eyes, they can take everything from you.  And now, because of the symbol and the secret it contains, a secret she must protect at all costs, those black eyes have set their sights on her.",
