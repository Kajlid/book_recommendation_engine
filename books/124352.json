  "description": "1967. The Summer of Love. Not for Jonathan Parry, perhaps, but certainly a time of big he and his family are emigrating to Canada. But he carries with him a terrible secret–one that finds its way, via a bulky notebook, to Will Apland of the Saskatoon Police Force. Initially, Will treats Jonathan's story as a diversion, something to while away a Hallowe'en weekend alone. As he reads it, however, Will undergoes a one man's history infects another's. By the time he reaches the final page, Will is possessed by thoughts of hatred, vengeance–and worse.",
