The aliens who are part of a chilling conspiracy connected to ancient riddles, a government agency...and Area 51.  Now from the Great Wall of China to a top secret facility beneath Antarctica's ice cap, an eclectic group of soldiers and scholars are working with Duncan and Turcotte to give humankind one last shimmering hope to survive.  To stop the aliens--at least until the Pandora's box of Area 51 opens up again....",
