  "description": "I've danced for some powerful and deadly men. But lately, instead of dollars, I'm collecting death warrants.\nI’ve always played with danger. And as long as I followed the rules, I told myself I’d always be safe.One night is all it took, one mistake, and now every damned mafia criminal in the Black Spades gang is after me.But so are the Kings of Eden.Cassius, Dracon, and Knox-- they're monsters that would make the devil's serpent look like an inchworm.They want to play with me, break me, rule me.What they don't know is that I'll never fall to my knees... even if that's exactly where they want me.",
