  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Joss is a rebel-the daughter of a famous newscaster and a sperm donor; a wild girl who can play a mean harmonica; a student of time travel at the prestigious Centre for Neo-Historical Studies. This year, for the first time, the Centre has an alien student. Mavkel, from the planet Choria, has chosen Joss-of all people-as his study partner. Can this very different pair manage to live together, much less learn from each other? Singing the Dogstar Blues is a genre-breaking mix of humor, science fiction, and adventure that will keep readers riveted.",
