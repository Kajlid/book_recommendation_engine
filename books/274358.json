  "description": "One shared look across a crowded club, and their worlds collided.  Their attraction had been instantaneous and hotter than the fire burning in his soul.  But Blake Stone didn't do relationships. Relationships meant emotions, and he didn’t have the kind a woman would want.  Or need.  Anger, greed, lust, bitterness, hatred—he had in spades.  But a woman like Gwen, she would want more. And if he wanted to keep her, he'd need to reveal his secrets.  Secrets that could send her running.  Because she’s playing with fire, and he knew damn well how badly it burned.  FIRE is a full-length, standalone, contemporary romance with a HEA. * **Contains sexual situations, violence, sensitive subjects, offensive language, and mature topics.*** Recommended for age 18 years and up.",
