  "description": "Andrew Sheffield and Ally Arietta meet in paradise: Playa del Carmen, Mexico. They have nothing in common: He's a workaholic CEO, embittered after the failure of his first marriage. She's been caring for her ailing Sicilian grandmother who's just passed away, and now she's ready to put herself first for a change. The sparks fly, but Andrew is no easy guy to get along with. His workaholic ways have them bickering from the start, but Ally decides that doesn't matter: It's just a fling.But when Ally nearly dies during a para-sailing accident, Andrew realizes she means much more to him than casual sex. The accident causes Ally to run scared: She's vowed to put herself first after years of self-sacrifice. She breaks it off and returns to Chicago to resume the life she interrupted to care for her grandmother, but she hasn't seen the last of Andrew, who is determined not to let her walk away.",
