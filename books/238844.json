  "description": "Please note: A new version of this book was released in September 2019. Some of the reviews below reflect the old version. She's the last member of a cursed and deadly clan.He's the crown prince with a dangerous secret.Together, they'll save the empire--or destroy it.Decades ago, the High King of Sundolia waged a war that vanquished the serpent clan and drove them out of the empire, reducing them to nothing more than legends spoken of in occasional frightened whispers.But they did not leave peacefully. Their parting gift included curses that now rest within the empire's soil, beneath the shade of its jungles, treading through the waves of its seas. Growing more and more dormant as the years pass under the shadow of that increasingly tyrannical high king.Until Alaya--a girl with a hidden serpent mark who shouldn't exist--accidentally wakes one of them up. Then another. And suddenly she finds herself near universally despised and feared, a scapegoat exiled from her adopted village and left with no choice but to seek the truth about her cursed bloodline. About her true home. About a power, stolen from the serpent goddess herself, that is supposedly resting in that home. It is the sort of power that could help her overthrow a king, expose the lies he's told, and put a stop to his wars.But the closer she gets to that power, the more complicated the truth becomes. The more dangerous her waking power seems. And the more she begins to wonder: Can you still be the hero if you were born a curse?",
