  "description": "INCLUDES NEW MATERIAL FOR PAPERBACK EDITION  With all her notorious, righteous comic rage, Margaret Cho lays out in no uncertain terms what's wrong, what's right, and what's definitely worth fighting for.  That includes: freedom of expression, gay rights, racial equality, the right to choose, and the right to life-a real life, on your own freethinking, liberty-loving all-American terms.  Cho's is a vehement, principled, and resoundingly funny political agenda, and with this manifesto she encourages us all to go through our warrior rituals now-it's time to get visible, get loud, and \"get your war on.\"",
