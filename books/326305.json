  "description": "In Send Her Back and Other Stories, Munashe Kaseke offers an awfully intimate, fresh telling of the immigrant black woman experience in the United States, equally awash with a myriad of challenges as well as the joys of exploring a new world. With sumptuous candor, her complicated, and often tangled, female Zimbabwean protagonists navigate issues of identity, microaggressions, and sexism in vibrant and indelible settings, and at times a tense US political climate. Yet again, these are not only stories of overcoming, they're also marked by characters who've risen to the top of their professional fields, seized the American dream, and who travel the world in glee. Kaseke peels back on the inner wranglings of characters caught between two worlds be it by stories of dating outside one's culture and race or failing to assimilate upon returning home after spending time abroad. Uncanny. Hilarious. Witty. Gripping. Send Her Back and Other Stories dazzles, leaving you newly awakened to the world we live in.",
