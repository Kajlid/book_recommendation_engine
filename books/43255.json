  "description": "A hundred years ago the spell placed upon the Shard of DancÅ«n by the ancient wizards was undone and evil consumed the Shadow Hills. Now, as the Flying Comet appears again, Princess Airia Nyuru must flee her home for the safety of the Hamikai Temple. When a king attempts to kidnap her, she and her griffin Enereas seek refuge in the Hillwall country of Ruekar. The only hope for the end of the Shadow Hills and the Soulless that dwell within them are two puzzling prophecies that Airia alone can fulfill. As she struggles to decipher them, journeying to foreign lands and facing hardships from both within and without, she realizes the gravity and scale of the War of the Shard, and fears her quest is impossible.",
