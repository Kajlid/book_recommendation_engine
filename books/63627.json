  "title": "The Cassoulet Saved Our Marriage: True Tales of Food, Family, and How We Learn to Eat",
  "description": "Food is more than what we eat. It reflects how we live in the world and connect with others. From junk food to soul food, from busy weeknight meals to holiday feasts, from the vegetarian table to the kosher pantry, these essays bring you into the kitchens (and shopping carts) of real American families. Without mantras or manifestos, twenty-nine writers serve up sweet memories, salty irreverence, and delicious original recipes. They candidly reveal what food means in their families--and help you discover what it can mean in yours. With essays from: • Keith Blanchard• Max Brooks • Melissa Clark • Elizabeth Crane • Aleksandra Crapanzano • Gregory Dicum • Elrena Evans • Jeff Gordinier • Caroline M. Grant • Phyllis Grant • Libby Gruner • Lisa Catherine Harper • Deborah Copaken Kogan and Paul Kogan • Jen Larsen • Edward Lewine • Chris Malcomb • Lisa McNamara • Dani Klein Modisett • Catherine Newman • Thomas Peele • Deesha Philyaw • Neal Pollack • Barbara Rushkoff • Bethany Saltman • K.
