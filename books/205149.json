  "description": "An odd thing to do, indeed. To most people, hatpins are vestiges of the past, used now only by elderly ladies who don't leave home without a hat. But recently the notion store in Posadas County has been doing a good business in hatpins to teenaged girls at the county middle school, who sharpen the points and carry the pin hidden in the inseam of their jeans. There had been a fight - over a boy - after a volleyball game, and the other girl, Carmen Acosta, had been suspended because of it. But her friends were still around, and Deena wanted something to defend herself with.",
