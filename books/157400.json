As war engulfs an entire world, only queen can rule--through steel and fire.When her father is murdered, sixteen-year-old princess Claire Erinn must become the first female ruler of Keldaren. As soon as Claire takes the throne, enemies arise on her borders-and from within her own court. Claire knows she's not ready to rule. But that's a secret she has to hide-from her enemies, and from her own people. Claire must act like a strong queen if she hopes to survive long enough to become one. As war looms, Claire struggles to save her kingdom, and herself. A rival queen and Claire's half-mad brother are both coming for her crown-and her head. With Death herself hunting her, Claire must become the warrior her kingdom needs. She's willing to face Death to save Keldaren. But the price of victory may be even higher than Claire's life.---------------------------------------------------------------Book Trailer-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rIt3...",
