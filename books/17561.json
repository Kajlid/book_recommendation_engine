  "description": "An extreme experience. A heartbreaking autobiographical novel. The author testifies to bewildering crimes, occurring in Italy, just three decades ago, inside an adoptive family and in a mental hospital. Unimaginable crimes almost too absurd to believe possible, that no one has ever before dared to expose to public scrutiny. Actual events chronicled from a reality so bizarre, so nightmarish, where demented and criminal madmen continued to segregate, abuse, and torture a sane and innocent young woman almost to the point of no return. A story of illness and despair, lovingkindness and hatred, healing and romance, friendship and superstition, loneliness and loss, envy and revenge, electroshock and the worst psychical and physical abuses in an asylum turned house of horrors. Yet, on a distant horizon, the only A deliverance through the miraculous devotion of love. First edition worldwide",
