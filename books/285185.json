  "description": "Devon (one name only) is the most famous singer/actress in the country, and she is on location filming her newest blockbuster in the South of France. While there, she forms a bond with the director’s daughter—the hottest thing in Hollywood since she has recently lost two hundred pounds—who is learning to enjoy being young, rich, and famous. Devon also befriends Casey, a small-town girl who is an assistant to Devon’s biggest rival. Together, the three of them hit the best clubs, the beach, the Cannes film festival, and anyplace else where there is fun to be had.",
