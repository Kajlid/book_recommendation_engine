  "description": "Encourage young readers to express their gratitude with this sweet story of a girl's thank you letters. . . . and her town's overwhelming response.\nAfter her wonderful birthday party, Grace sits down to write thank-you letters to friends and family for all their lovely gifts. But why stop there? She writes to thank Mr. Jones for teaching her to read and write. She thanks her dog for his waggy tail. She even thanks the sky for being so perfectly blue.This sweet story about the power of gratitude encourages young readers to write their own letters, and share their joy with friends, family, and loved ones. For anyone who has ever wanted to encourage children to write thank you notes, Grace's sweet letters and the joyful way everyone in town receives them is the perfect, gentle lesson, and models how to respond to all kinds of gifts--including the intangible ones.When Grace returns home after delivering her notes, she finds a wealth of affection--cards, letters, and notes from her neighbors and friends, expressing their love for Grace and appreciation for her letters. A beautifully illustrated gatefold page shows how deeply her letters have touched the hearts of everyone around them.Beloved storyteller and illustrator Jane Cabrera's vivid and textured acrylic paintings are filled with joyful cuteness and warmth. Collage elements, including patterns from the inside of envelopes, smartly add to the epistolary theme. This delightful celebration of mindful thankfulness and community togetherness is perfect for curling up in a cozy spot and sharing one-on-one.",
