  "description": "Olivia would rather be getting a bikini wax. Instead, she’ll be surrounded by vampires at the fifteen hundredth re-birthday party of their leader. With access to synthetic and donor blood, vampires are no longer just creatures of myth—they are out and proud, living amongst the humans they used to secretly feed upon. And no one besides Olivia seems to have a problem with them. As if her trust issues aren’t enough to cope with tonight, she also has to deal with her feelings for her co-worker Daniel. Gorgeous, kind, and honest, he’s the perfect guy… except for the fact that he’s dead, his diet consists solely of blood, and those long, romantic walks on the beach that women fantasize about would turn him into dust. Daniel hates who and what he is. There is no redemption possible, no way for him to be the man Olivia deserves. But, damn it, that’s exactly who he wants to be. And just when she finally opens up and lets him into her heart, everything she lives for is put at risk. Can Daniel overcome two lifetimes of guilt and be the man she needs? Will either of them get out of this alive? This is a novella of approximately 76 pages.",
