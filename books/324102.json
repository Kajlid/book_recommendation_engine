  "description": "The wolves waiting in the wind are always watching.My life has never been normal. Raised by a survivalist, taught how to endure anything, I've learned to rely on myself. To keep my head down-- to mind my own business. That all changes in an instant when I hear the screams.There, in that filthy alley, I thought I was pulling Emmeline out of the darkness and toward safety, but it turns out, she was pulling me in. My new friend's world collides with my own, and they couldn't be more different. Where I spend my days alone, she rarely can. Not with four brooding brothers hellbent on her protection, watching over her every move like dark guardians.Guardians that set their sights on me, who want to claim me as their own.Theirs is a world of violence and bloodshed, of teeth and fangs. Monsters lurk in the shadows, just waiting for their chance to strike. A sane person would be terrified, but even as danger closes in around us, I know without a shadow of a doubt that they’re bigger threats than the ones they tell me I should fear.To protect their family, they'll become the monsters of legends and myths. The question is, if I’m supposed to be their salvation, does that mean I’m even more cursed than they are?To save us all, am I willing to damn myself?**This is a darker themed paranormal romance where the heroine gets all of her men, and contains some graphic detail, so please read the note in the beginning of the book before choosing to read. This is the first of a four book series that follows the same characters, and as such, will end with a cliffhanger, but this is my primary project until it's completed.**",
