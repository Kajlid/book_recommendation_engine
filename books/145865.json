  "description": "For Azsha Daggerwall the outside world has always been shrouded in secrecy. Confined to the space of a gypsy show-wagon since infancy, she has long rebelled against the wishes of an overbearing stage mother bent on her grand ascent. Little does she know, the lady harbors a dark and powerful secret that, once exposed, will have a devastating impact, not only on Azsha's life but on the whole of existence.  Aqua'Callah: Our world viewed through the faded lens of time before recorded history began; a place where magic took its first steps and animals walked and spoke alongside the races of Nymph, Hume, Elf, and others. Creator gods struggle in the face of a new agenda after an ambitious experiment gone terribly wrong. Only the missing link can put all back to right.  A young womanâ€™s yearning for a chance at life is granted but at a terrible price. Can she bear the weight of her newfound knowledge while seeking to unlock the mystery of herself?  Forced to leave the security of her tribe, the only family she has ever known, Azsha embarks on a journey of self-discovery set in a time of uncertainty and upheaval to brave the mounting dangers that threaten her present and our future.",
