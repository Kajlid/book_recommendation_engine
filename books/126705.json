  "description": "Twenty-five years after their hellish emigration - thirty from their famous father's exodus - a sister and her brothers hear his voice again. All three have long since \"made it\" in the States, despite - maybe, because of - his abandonment. Forced by his own divorce to question everything, Vlad reels and frolics to forget himself - and learn to live again. Skirt-chasing author Mark, seething with writer's block, commits himself to marry by a verbal slip. Alla's precocious children prod her to examine who she is and why. A sleazy cousin - Tolik, hopeless Brighton product - is about to score his one big hit, again. His brother, Boris, now religious, struggles to transcend his past. A family get-together threatens to ignite their old resentments. Edouard Yablonskiy, freshly minted dissident, has one last chance to make amends. His three grown children now must choose - to exit their own Egypt and forgive or let the past demand their satisfaction.",
