  "description": "A major discovery: The lost diary of a great mind—and an intimate, deeply moving study of griefThe day after his mother's death in October 1977, the influential philosopher Roland Barthes began a diary of mourning. Taking notes on index cards as was his habit, he reflected on a new solitude, on the ebb and flow of sadness, and on modern society's dismissal of grief. These 330 cards, published here for the first time, prove a skeleton key to the themes he tackled throughout his work. Behind the unflagging mind, \"the most consistently intelligent, important, and useful literary critic to have emerged anywhere\" (Susan Sontag), lay a deeply sensitive man who cherished his mother with a devotion unknown even to his closest friends.",
