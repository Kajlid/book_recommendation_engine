  "description": "\"Christmas at My House\" takes you on a nostalgic journey back in time where the author's mother described how Christmas was celebrated by her family in a small New England town over a span of 20 years. Within the week following each Christmas, from 1946 until 1966, the author's mother would pen a narration of how Christmas had just been celebrated. Although she recounted many joyful Christmases during these years, there were also some somber ones. This heartwarming memoir includes such adventures as tramping into the wild, snowy woods to chop down a huge Christmas tree, getting locked out of the house on a cold Christmas Eve, decorating the front door, and making hand knitted Christmas stockings. See how a pine cone, fudge, fruit cake and a red velvet bow represented a quiet but loyal friendship between neighbors.",
