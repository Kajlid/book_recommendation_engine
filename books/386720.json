  "description": "The Ferris Conspiracy is one man's insight into Britain's crime world and the inextricable web of corruption. Arthur Thompson, Godfather of the crime world and senior partner of the Krays, recruited young Paul Ferris as a bagman, debt collector, and equalizer. By the age of 21 Ferris had become Glasgow's most feared gangster, deemed a risk to national security. Feared for his capacity for extreme violence matched by his intelligence, Ferris was the Godfather's heir apparent. However when gang warfare broke, underworld leaders colluded with their partnersâ€”the police. Disgusted, Ferris left the Godfather and stood alone. Thereafter he was hounded and framed by the security services, and two of the UK's most powerful gangsters tried to have him killed and then framed him. Ferris is now in prison and wants to reveal the unholy alliance between the police and the criminal fraternity.",
