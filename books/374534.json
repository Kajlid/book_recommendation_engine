  "description": "Samantha Grayson has been burned before by Doms, and her attempts at vanilla relationships haven't worked for her either. She's gotten such a reputation for being an unruly submissive that most of the dominants at Bondage Ranch won't take her on. Arthur Marcelli is up for the challenge. But the more they play the more serious it gets, and D/s is just for a little light fun -- isn't it? Arthur knows that he has to treat Samantha gently. He also knows she can get a lot more out of herself if he can convince her to let her guard down. To do so he has to get her to trust him -- trust him so much, that he can start pushing her limits, one sensuous step at a time. \nPublisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Anal play/intercourse, strong BDSM theme and elements, domination/submission, exhibitionism, voyeurism.",
