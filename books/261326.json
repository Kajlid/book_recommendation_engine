  "title": "Are Women the Stronger Sex?",
  "description": "This book, years in the making, is written mostly for girls and young women so they can have a better understanding of who they are and why the men in their lives often act the way they do. Women will probably figure it out eventually but it's great to be armed with knowledge and insight. So if a woman comes across a guy with similar characteristics found in this book, she'll recognize the behaviors and know she's not \"just imagining things\", \"making a big thing out of nothing\", etc. - the way a woman is often told (by a guy) when she points out some character flaw he has.The understanding of a negative situation often helps us to make peace with it and experience forgiveness - which ultimately benefits everyone. Being informed will, hopefully, help us make better choices in life.",
