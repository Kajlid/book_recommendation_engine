He’s lost everything that counts—the right to fight for his king, the trust of his best friend, and any hope for a family of his own. Death seems preferable, until Galena Shantos meets him at his fateful crossroads and saves his life.Galena’s loyalty to her brother, the king, is absolute. Healing his warriors on the sidelines of war, she’s witnessed too many rebellion atrocities to be swayed for mercy. Yet something about Reese blurs the lines of allegiance, the call to her heart raw and primitive.When Reese ends up a prisoner of war, he’s visited by a mysterious being of another race and learns he’s the linchpin in a battle between good and evil. The lovers will face choices—Galena between family loyalty and championing Reese’s cause, and Reese between keeping his shameful secret, and saving all races by leading the darkest of his kind to redemption—starting with his own confession.",
