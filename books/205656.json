  "description": "The epic conclusion to Scarlett and Dante's story. Breaking Her The Love is War Duet: Book Two DESTRUCTION. BETRAYAL. RUINATION. TRUE LOVE. SCARLETT He had done it again. Ravaged me. Burned me. Broke me. Given me air, only to leave me gasping, writhing. But then something changed. Something that terrified and excited me both. Something that utterly destroyed me. Something that made me whole again. DANTE Our love was cursed from the start. She didn’t know it, but I did. All she knew was that I’d lied to her, betrayed her. Done unforgivable things. Unavoidable things. Yes, I had broken promises as surely as I had broken her heart. But, just as every war has casualties, and every lie has consequences–every bastard has his reasons.",
