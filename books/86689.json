  "description": "A FOREWORDYOU CAN DO ITUntil one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative ( and creation ), there is one elemental truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans : that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too. This certainly applies to Tonny Tonniez, a Young man on a mission, to see a change in the consciousness of this 21st century world. Being present is the key, and to live in the Now.All sorts of things occur to help one that never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision raising in one's favour all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed would have come his way.Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and the Spirit in it.Faith must be tested, because it can be turned into personal possession only through conduct.F = Faith / BeliefA = Attitude / PositiveI = Intuition / ListeningT = Trust / TenacityH = Hard work /Helpfulness/ Humor/ HumilityLove and compassion...are the ultimate source of human happiness, and our need for them lies at the very core of our beingDavid RussellA Child Unheard LimitedCrowthorne, Berkshire",
