  "description": "[Siren Everlasting Classic Erotic Alternative Fantasy Romance, M/M, HEA] Have you ever heard the phrase \"sleep your life away\"? I can testify to the fact that its meaning can go beyond pure sloth. For past centuries, I've been in a cursed sleep, waiting for my fated mate. I know, it sounds bad. After all, I didn't listen to my parents when they told me to forget about roses. But how could I? I am a dryad, and I was born out of roses. They are even in my name. Briar Rose. My wait finally ended when Prince Leonard of Arthuria appeared in our kingdom. He is everything I've ever wanted in a mate. He might not be classically charming, but he makes me tremble in delight, my roses blossom with hope, and my heart race with a need I've never experienced. But can Leonard single-handedly go against the witch who cursed me? Will our lips even meet in a real kiss? I don't know, and that scares me. This book is written in first-person point of view. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
