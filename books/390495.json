  "title": "No Place To Cry: The Hurt and Healing of Sexual Abuse",
  "description": "Dorie considered herself ugly, unloved, and dirty as the result of childhood sexual abuse. Then she gave her life to God—and He made something beautiful of it. No Place to Cry is the story of her struggle and her victory. Dorie knows what it is like to be neglected emotionally, to be abused physically, and to search desperately but to find no place to cry. She also knows of the blessing that came when she was thirteen—a Christian student visited her orphanage and introduced her to a God who loves even the unloved. Having been shunned by her parents \"like an unwanted dog,\" and mercilessly abused in several foster homes, Dorie clung to the unconditional love of God that so many take for granted. Just as God gave her a tender heart to forgive her abusers, He also gave her the strength to reveal her past in No Place to Cry , the sequel to the bestseller The Girl Nobody Loved . Through her candor, you will gain insight into the trauma of emotional and sexual abuse, as well as knowledge of potential steps to recovery for those afflicted by abuse.",
