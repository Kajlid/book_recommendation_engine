A heartless leader bent on collecting an unpaid debt.

Jeff owes a colossal debt. Nikolas wants his money. And he won't be satisfied until the debt is paid. And with no money to offer, Avery must choose whose life is more important; hers or Jeff's.  If you think for one second that the heroine falls in love with a monster, you couldn't be further from the truth. Follow Avery as she fights for her life... and even that may not be enough.",
