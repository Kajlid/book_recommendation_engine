  "description": "2013 Hollywood Book Festival Honorable Mention “A phenomenal story of a girl who should, by all accounts, be a bad girl, but wants so desperately to be good. The story of Desolation Black and her trials as a normal teen, while trying to please her father ( Satan) not only kept me on the edge of my seat, but left me questioning how I see the world. If a girl with such darkness in her life, can find a way to do good, then there's hope for the rest of us. Even if you're not a fan of dark paranormal novels, you'll love this one. It's not like all the others. Not even close.” C.K. Bryant (BOUND) “With beautiful, lyrical writing, this is one story fans of paranormal romance will not want to miss! And the twist at the end has me craving book two!” ~ Susan Kaye Quinn (OPEN MINDS) *** Sixteen-year old Desolation Black wants nothing more than to stay in Hell where it’s cold and lonely and totally predictable. Instead, she’s sent back to Earth where she must face the evil she despises and the good she always feared. When Desi is forced to embrace her inner demon, she assumes her choice has been made—that she has no hope of being anything other than what her father, Loki, has created her to be. What she doesn’t count on, is finding a reason to change—something she’s never had before—a friend. ** 2012 League of Utah Writers (Silver Quill) 2012 League of Utah Writers (Best eBook)",
