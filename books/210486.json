  "description": "The streets of New York have been plagued by a pattern of crimes too weird and bizarre for the average detective. Lurking in the evidence are shadows of loathsome horrors from beyond space and time, seeking to usher in the unimaginable evil of the Old Ones. And the only man capable of fighting against the unspeakable terrors isn't a man at all. Detective Sebastian Green is one of them--it takes a monster to catch a monster.New York Time's best-selling author, Fred Van Lente, and artist Guiu Vilanova are on the case for Weird Detective, a Lovecraftian mystery tale!",
