  "title": "The Case of Cabin 13",
  "description": "The year is 1912. John Darnell is a professional investigator whose specialty is debunking theories of paranormal activities. He is approached by the Managing Director of White Star Line with a proposition. A bizarre series of apparent suicides in cabin 13 on three different White Star Line ships has the Managing Director frantic, worried that unlucky jinxes, ghosts or violent spirits will follow him onto their newest ship, the Titanic, and into cabin 13. Darnell agrees to take passage on the Titanic in cabin 13 to investigate, and once on board, he suspects the reported suicides were really murders, and tallies up a list of very-much-alive suspects, each with their own sinister motives. But when the fate of the Titanic is sealed in the icy waters of the Atlantic, will the killer get away with yet another murder?",
