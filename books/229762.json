  "description": "Administrations and political mores change. One such change brought about a law that made it so that the government could force men to turn gay, in order to trim the effects of male sexuality on women, and to cut down the ever-growing population. Men would be nominated, and then taken to camps to have their sexuality twisted. Nathan has been taken to one of these camps, Camp Ganymede, in order to teach him to love men.",
