Once on the freeways, byways, and back routes, Biddy’s ride takes unexpected twists, and turns into a surreal ordeal that threatens to completely destroy him. Yet, with his inner voice screaming, his bloodshot eyes burning, and fantasy and reality blurring together, he presses onward—chasing a bright future he desperately hopes can exist.Biddy Debeau Rides for His Life is a story about how we can run, but never hide, from our problems. Dark, moody, and moving, it takes readers on one hell of a wild ride along the West Coast and through the human condition.",
