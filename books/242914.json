  "description": "The world ended. They didn’t. And now they’re in a fight for their lives.  Years ago, the elite of Earth escaped the apocalypse, taking to the stars, expecting everyone left behind to perish in nuclear war and its aftermath.  Instead, those who survived developed new abilities—especially the shifters and their pack-bonded mates, who communicate telepathically with the help of gold. Unfortunately for them, Earth’s colonies still need gold for their own communications devices.  When one of pack-leader Alia’s mates is taken by a raiding ship searching for gold, she vows to get him back no matter what it takes. Even if that means teaming up with another pack—the one that was once her pack’s greatest rival.  But none of that matters any longer.  Gold. Everything is about the gold now.  And rescuing the ones who’ve been stolen away.   Get ALL THAT GLITTERS today and fall in love with this reverse harem post-apocalyptic paranormal romance!",
