  "title": "Poems: James Joyce",
  "description": "This collection brings together James Joyce’s two published volumes of Chamber Music and Pomes Penyeach. Though celebrated for his revolutionary contributions to the novel, Joyce’s first published work was Chamber Music, a volume of poetry. Published when Joyce was 25 years old, he later described Chamber Music as “a young man’s book,” characterized by its delicate, musical quality and romantic themes. This early collection was followed two decades later by Pomes Penyeach, where Joyce’s verse turned inward, grappling with personal issues such as infidelity, loss, and emotional turmoil.For readers familiar with Joyce’s prose, these works provide a fresh perspective on his creative mind, through which his development as a writer, from youthful lyricism to a more introspective style, can be traced.",
