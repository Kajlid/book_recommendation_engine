New York businessman Richard Roe has recently made himself a candidate for biographical treatment by dropping dead on a ferryboat, and Hubbard, who once sat at a table with Roe without being introduced, however and has recently realized that if he ever means to do something significant, he'd best get started, decides to write a book, even though books don't really interest him a biography of Roe, in fact, in which perhaps \"the fatal germ of human identity might be isolated\" p.21 . Not that it would be easy to trace \"the footprints of one who trod so lightly and with such complete ignorance of his own possible importance ...\" pp.7-8 . At least Hubbard knows where to at the end. \"This long and many-mooded story...tells how the biographer explored the Life and Times Good Times and Bad of Richard Roe, the Unknown Citizen\" dust jacket . Minor jacket wear. xii, 350 pages. and Co., 1932, small 8vo., cloth, dust jacket..",
