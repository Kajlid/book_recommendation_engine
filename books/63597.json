  "description": "“Eerily beautiful . . . [Chaon] is the modern day John Cheever.”—Boston Sunday Globe  “Powerful and disturbing . . . The shocks in this collection are many.”—The Washington Post  These haunting, suspenseful stories by acclaimed author Dan Chaon feature scattered families, unfulfilled dreamers, anxious souls—lost, fragile, searching characters who wander between ordinary life and a psychological shadowland. They have experienced intense love or loss, grief or loneliness, displacement or disconnection—and exist in a twilight realm, in a place by the window late at night when the streets are empty and the world appears to be quiet. But it is not, and neither are you. And since you cannot sleep, you stay awake.The bees --Patrick Lane, flabbergasted --Stay awake --Long delayed, always expected --I wake up --To Psychic Underworld --St. Dismas --Thinking of you in your time of sorrow --Slowly we open our eyes --Shepherdess --Take this, Brother, may it serve you well --The Farm, the gold, the lily-white hands",
