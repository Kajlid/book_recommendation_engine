  "description": "When Amihanna di Aetes first got to Sel’Ani, she never thought she’d have the full support of the Aunare, but she does. She never thought that she’d fall in love, get married, or become the High Queen, but she did. She never thought that she’d be planning something so stupid as her return to Earth, but that’s exactly what she’s doing.With the Alliance broken, SpaceTech has fully retreated to their home planet, but the chaos of war will descend again. Amihanna and Lorne know they don’t have much time to plan their next move. Everything in their guts tells them to head straight to Earth, and that going into the heart of SpaceTech’s territory is stupid, reckless, and very likely deadly.Amihanna and Lorne have one chance to end this war quickly, protect the Aunare, free the Earthers from SpaceTech’s rule, and save Declan, Ahiga, and the missing ABQ Crew members. Trying to do it all feels impossible, but Amihanna has never been one to back down from a challenge, especially when defeating SpaceTech was never just her mission. It’s her destiny.",
