  "description": "Dynan Telaerin lives within a shell of his own making, a place devoid of light. Every moment is a struggle to rediscover who he is. After barely surviving the loss of his twin brother, Dynan is forced to run farther and submerge his identity deeper than ever before. Legend is the story of his survival, how he discovers a reason to want to live and where he learns that dreams can be real. But there are no guarantees, for with each action an equal and opposite reaction occurs. There are nightmares to consider and souls to be lost.To protect him, and give him time to heal, Dynan is sent to a place that is forbidden by the laws he’s supposed to uphold. It’s a calculated risk that he needs the anonymity Cadal can provide. The danger is weighed against the odds he’ll be discovered - by the people of this backward planet, by allies who would use this infraction against him, or by an enemy who would see him dead.The plans so carefully arranged soon start to unravel when Dynan meets the girl of his dreams – dreams that he doesn’t remember until they walk up to him, living, breathing and beautiful. Preordained by the Gods, their attraction to each other is unstoppable. From the moment of acceptance, the difficulties set before them stand in the way of their desire to be together. There are enemies, known and unknown, lurking in the outer reaches, and one, who as promised, intends to destroy everyone Dynan cares about.Maralt Adaeryn has plans of his own and none of them end with happily ever after.",
