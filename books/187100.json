  "description": "He sings of suffering. His eyes hold the pain of living in sorrow. The moment our gaze meets recognition flares within.We are tortured souls drifting in a sea of darkness. He knows I have secrets that I'll never tell. I am numb. I am broken.I can never be the guiding light through the darkness he thinks I am. I have forsaken my past, I rely on keeping myself shut off. I wish things were different, that maybe we could be each other's lifeline. But destiny drags us down like an anchor.He lives his life in the lime light of a famous rock star, and I live in shadows on the run. I wished I’d known that before I fell for him, but now it’s too late.",
