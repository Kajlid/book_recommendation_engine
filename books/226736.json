  "title": "Murder on the Mother Road",
  "description": "On that brilliant October day, all Libby intends is to get to Albuquerque in her sleek new motor home. On a whim she turns off the Interstate to take Route 66, the Mother Road. When she stops for coffee at an oasis of dust and rust in a desert of sand—the Knight's Rest Motel and Café—she stumbles across an old college sorority sister, her dead brother, and their assorted crazy relatives rushing in to claim the family fortune. There is yet another murder and, while Libby tries to solve the mysteries, Hazel, owner of Knight’s Rest, takes the opportunity to turn her money-losing motel into a Murder Museum, in keeping with the glory days of the famous Mother Road. Filled with delightfully off-beat characters.",
