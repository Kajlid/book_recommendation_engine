  "description": "A thoroughly original book featuring only pictures. With colorful paintings, drawings, and photographs of everyday people and objects, it evokes a world of contrasts and interrelations. Each image is related to the images before and after it. Sometimes funny, always vivid, the images open the way to limitless ideas and interpretations_about the nature of things, how they are connected, and how we picture them. Artistic and engaging, A Whole World is fuel for the imagination_an experience that can be appreciated by all.",
