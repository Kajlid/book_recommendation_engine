  "title": "A Place Like Mississippi: A Journey Through a Real and Imagined Literary Landscape",
  "description": "There is a palpable connection to the landscapes of Mississippi displayed in the work of the state’s many lauded writers. This connection to the land runs deep—across onerous lines of class, gender and race—spanning generations of authors birthed in the Magnolia State. It’s difficult to read Faulkner, Welty, Wright, and Ward and not come away with the very particular sense of place that the state and the greater American South represents in their work. You can feel the humidity and smell the kudzu. In The Literary Landscape of Mississippi, W. Ralph Eubanks takes readers on a complete tour of the natural places that have inspired Mississippi authors. Eubanks is a native Mississippian who has spent time in all of the state’s 82 counties, and he knows its writers better than most anyone. He is also an accomplished author in his own right, bringing a clear-eyed and expertly nuanced perspective to the content. Far from rose-tinted glasses, Eubanks will take readers through the lush and varied Mississippi landscapes that often hide a complicated, and at times bloody, history. This landscape, and this history, has informed the work of a diverse list of America’s most treasured authors, and the state’s literary legacy continues today.",
