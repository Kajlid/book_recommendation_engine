Kidnapped as a child and forced to train to become an elite gun for hire at an “orphanage,” he is now a ruthless, freelance mercenary. In a wealthy Middle Eastern kingdom surrounded by desert, the despotic King Nimir is determined to quash all dissidents calling for free elections. Billionaires, clerics, influencers, and journalists who dared to challenge King Nimir’s regime have vanished without a trace. Unfortunately for him, the latest person he has “disappeared” happens to be Irfan’s “sister.” Now things are personal, and Irfan Mirza doesn’t like personal. He likes justice. Assembling a ragtag team of specialists, a.k.a. his “family,” Irfan sets off on a wild rescue mission, determined to save the imprisoned from a medieval fortress, now transformed into a heavily fortified black-site. The palace is surrounded by endless stretches of uninhabited sand, difficult to approach and impossible to escape. The Palace of Sinners and Saints is an absolute thrill ride, perfect for fans of Lee Child and his Jack Reacher series, where courage and loyalty reign and anyone who wants freedom must pay a price.",
