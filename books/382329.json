  "description": "Far back in the tangled fastnesses of the great Smokey Mountains, estate and house had been abandoned for forty years, ever since the disaster that had destroyed forever a rich man's mad dream. Now the mountain was a haunted place of weird storms, choking undergrowth and strange accidents. Local rumours spoke of half-human, half-mythical creatures that crept and flitted through the hostile, overgrown woods. In spite of the fears of his second-sighted Indian wife, he has taken to prowling the woods, watching, lying in wait. And now, along with an ex-army buddy and his son, he is about to stumble upon the terrible demented dream-made-real that is at the black heart of Wildwood.",
