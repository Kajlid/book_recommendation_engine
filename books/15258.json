  "description": "“The best book yet in one of the best series going: a serious novel with a mystery at its core that takes us places we’ve never been.”—Timothy Hallinan, author of The Queen of Patpong Mystery readers who have not yet made the acquaintance of larger than life African investigator Detective David “Kubu” Bengu are doing themselves a great disservice. Death of the Mantis is the third Kubu novel from author Michael Stanley—following the critically acclaimed A Carrion Death and The Second Death of Goodluck Tinubu—and it plunges the robust manhunter into the chaotic center of a murder case involving nomadic Bushmen that is stoking the fires of prejudice and tribal hatred. Set in Botswana—the fascinating equatorial country also explored by Alexander McCall Smith in his #1 Ladies’ Detective Agency novels—Death of the Mantis is a book alive with the sights and sounds of an exotic and breathtaking land. The exploits of Stanley’s singularly captivating policeman protagonist will delight you and keep you guessing.",
