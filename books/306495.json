  "description": "They say the best lovers start as friends. Too bad I’m head-over-heels for my broody best friend but he’s completely oblivious. I’ve been crazy about MMA fighter Gabe Mendoza for most of my life, and he has no idea. As a doctor, I should be too smart to fall for someone who’s bound to break my heart, but love doesn’t care about logic. I’m tired of pining for someone who’s married to his job, but Gabe begs for a chance with me just as I’m finally ready to look for love elsewhere. He’s never put me first before, so how can I trust him to fight for our happily ever after? Is our relationship doomed before it even begins?",
