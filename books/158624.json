  "description": "Janice learns that her record label tycoon father has died in a plane crash just days before her wedding. She begins to see pieces of her father in the man she is about to marry, and it scares her to the bone.THE RECLUSE takes a hard look at the dysfunctional modern family, and asks the question: Do the sins of the father continue down the line, or are we free to create our own destiny? THE RECLUSE is part chic-lit, part post-modern literature, part modern realism. It quietly tampers with the make-up and struggles of the modern family, and the relationships with those closest to us. It is an anthropological snapshot that aims at the accelerating discord between the nuclear family and selfish ambition.",
