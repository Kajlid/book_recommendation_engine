  "description": "Aaron Envelar thought a sellsword's life was as dangerous as any life could be.He was wrong.  Trapped in a conquered city with a reward on their heads, Aaron and his companions must find a way to elude the soldiers pursuing them while he struggles to understand his bond with Co, a magical creature of myth and the Virtue of Compassion. There is power within the bond, power that could help him protect his friends, if he's lucky enough to master it before the darkness within the bond consumes him.  But luck, Aaron knows, is a blade reached for in the dark, the man who grasps it as likely to bleed for his trouble as find the handle.  Stalked by Belgarin's soldiers, Aaron and his companions struggle to find allies before it's too late. But Belgarin's army is not the only danger they face, and even should they escape, even should Aaron master his bond with a legendary creature of magic, they may still fail. They may still die.  For there are other legends in the world, other magic. And not all legends are good ones. Not all magic is benign.",
