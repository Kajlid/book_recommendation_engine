  "title": "We Ain't Pretty: A Disgustingly Funny Vampire Tale",
  "description": "On a sultry southern summer night, Chance Dolan is driving through the middle of nowhere when he pulls to the side of the road to empty his bladder and take care of some routine vampire business. What he finds deep in the forest both shocks and thrills him, breathing new life into his world-weary soul. The Rewders—who had gone undiscovered until now—are vampires too, only not in the traditional sense. Somewhere along the line their wires got crossed, and they became more human than monster. Although they don’t see themselves as lesser beings, Chance believes that they’re an abomination and feels compelled to destroy them. Take a peek into the lives of these two creatures as they head toward the inevitable clash that will change their worlds in ways they never thought possible. Funny, disgusting, disturbing, and outrageous, it’s the dark side of the dark side. Truly, this is a vampire story like no other.",
