  "description": "When Elizabeth Lancaster is kidnapped from a nature commune, she’s terrified for her life. She hadn’t expected her cover to be blown so quickly. But who is this huge, rock-solid guy who spirits her away to a secluded estate in the mountains? When she discovers the identity of her abductor, one thought burns through her outrage and frustration: What is the commando going to do to me?Caleb Trent’s special-forces training didn’t prepare him for life with his beautiful captive. She’s more resourceful than he anticipated, always managing to stay one step ahead of him, and far too alluring for his peace of mind. Still, he’s determined not to let down his guard. She might be a lying conniver, but he’s duty-bound to see this mission through to the end.Going Commando was a finalist in Romance Writers of America’s RITA Awards and winner of the Heart of the West National Writing Contest!
