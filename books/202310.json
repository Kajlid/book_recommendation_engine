  "title": "Haunted Hearths & Sapphic Shades: Lesbian Ghost Stories",
  "description": "At their heart, ghost stories are often domestic tales, and so there is little wonder why women have been some of the finest tellers of such stories: cautionary tales and stories where oppression is avenged by the grim ethereal, of lovers lost to life but who refuse to part. This rich tradition finds new voices in Haunted Hearths and Sapphic Shades.Early ghost stories are filled with characters that can be read as coded lesbians--maiden aunts and spinsters--lurking at the fringe of mortal life. But here are seventeen authors who have spun words that are fresh. These shades vary from the eerie to the romantic. These are phantoms who may well menace or linger long in the dreams of readers. Contributors include Sacchi Green, Marilyn Jaye Lewis, Jean Roberta, Melissa Scott, and Kaite Welsh. Editor Catherine Lundoff is a Golden-Crown Literary Award-winning author of lesbian speculative fiction.",
