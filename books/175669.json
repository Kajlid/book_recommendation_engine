  "description": "When two equally intelligent androids face off against each other, who wins?The year is 2300. Humans and androids live in peace after a devastating singularity and years of war. Xandifer “X” Crenshaw is a special agent android for the United Earth Alliance. His job is to track down rogue androids and destroy them to keep the world safe. When another android agent goes maverick and starts a killing spree, the fallout could shatter the alliance between humans and androids forever. X hunts him down, but what seems like a simple operation turns weird fast when X discovers that he’s up against something far more sinister that is just as intelligent as him. And whatever it is, it also holds the key to X's forgotten past. The future belongs to humans and androids...or is that a paradox?",
