  "title": "Living in the State of Stuck: How Assistive Technology Impacts the Lives of People With Disabilities",
  "description": "In the latest edition of this well-regarded work, Dr. Scherer brings us up-to-date on the \"battles won and battles lost\" of the disabled men and women whom she followed closely in previous volumes. The result is an engaging, eye-opening, and frank discussion on assistive technology from the standpoint of those who use it (or have opted not to). The book serves as both a mouthpiece for the disabled and an analysis of different types of assistive technology - including benefits and flaws.",
