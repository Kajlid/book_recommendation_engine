  "description": "The couple that swept you away in Taken by Storm is back! Michael is in Thailand diving his dream. Leesie is at BYU living hers. And they just can't leave each other alone. Their romance rekindles, deeper than before. They grow desperate to see one another again. To hold one another again. Michael decides there is only one direction their relationship can go and asks Leesie the ultimate question. Her answer challenges everything Michael is and wants to be. Can she change for him? Can he change for her? Enough? Wi-fi, thick in the air, pulses with him, revealing his far away fingers drumming as he stares at a screen. Dim light, noise, bodies-- I shouldn't answer this fruitless vision . . . But the more I erase, delete, eradicate-- the tighter my heartstrings twist, entwining Michael's shadow forever on my soul.",
