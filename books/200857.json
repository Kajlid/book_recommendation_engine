  "description": "Awkward web developer Sadie Ash and eccentric casino millionaire John Domino fall in love at the card table one night - but little does Sadie know about John's dark past. With everything at stake, can Sadie navigate seven simple lessons to own John's heart and soul - and can John escape from the emotional prison of his ex-lover? How to Train a Man in Seven Easy Lessons is by turns erotic, romantic, witty and deeply moving. It will live with you forever.  Finally, an outrageously addictive novel that turns Fifty Shades of Grey on its head. This intense romantic comedy contains explicit, erotic scenes from the outset, including female domination (femdom) male chastity and BDSM.  Praise on Amazon.com for How to Train a Man in Seven Easy Lessons:  \"...downright titillating: every good-girl-gone-bad fantasy...\" \"This book is in a whole new category on its own. I've read a lot of erotica before and this is EROTICA. I loved it.\" \"Chloé Hornett brings erotica to brand new heights in How to Train a Man in Seven Easy Lessons. If your plan is to start out by reading the first few chapters, forget it.\" \"Along with the humanity and humor, this book has a ton of, well, sex! And it is truly hot and beautifully written.\"",
