  "description": "In Book 1 of the ‘Unintended Consequences’ series Acts Beyond Redemption takes you on a twisted, deadly ,journey.  From the mountains of Arkansas to the corridors of power in Washington, to the slopes of the Hindu Kush… Mike Matheson is head of a Special Task Force set up by the F.B.I to track down and apprehend the serial killer or killers responsible for 18 brutal murders. He and his team are exhausted, frustrated, and ready to burn out after almost five years and no leads. Nothing in their considerable experience has prepared them for this. Nothing in their imaginations could conceive of the truth hidden in plain sight.  He finally has his perpetrator…, or does he? Everything points in the direction of the beautiful Sheila Harrington. She becomes the focus of their investigation. Deflecting their weary eyes away from a truth too incomprehensible to be permitted to exist. The truth is uncovered, but revealing it and those that set it in motion would bring the most powerful country on earth to its knees. The corridors of power shake. Who will be buried in the shattered remains of a country where freedom and honor are treasured above all things? Just how far will those elected to protect and defend go, to keep the American dream alive.",
