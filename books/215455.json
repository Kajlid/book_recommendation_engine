  "title": "Yellow Rock",
  "description": "In the west, sometimes heroes are also your enemy… After her plantation burns to the ground by the hands of her Confederate father, Willow is then forced to escape Georgia aboard a wagon train heading west. When the Apaches attack the wagons, capturing and brutalizing her, Willow’s mind tries to cope by escaping reality.  As her mind slips her from the present back into the past, confusing the Indians for Yankees. Willow no longer knows her enemies as the Apaches tie her to a tree as a gift for a man they call Yellow Rock. Dutch knows a trap when he sees one. The crazy woman whistling Dixie up on that cliff means only one thing; the Apaches want him to take her instead of the gold from their sacred mountain. And even though Dutch has plans for that gold, and secrets that the beautiful woman might not accept, his heart and the Apaches threaten to ruin all of it. They call her crazy. But he knows the truth and he’s going to do something about it.",
