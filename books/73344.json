  "description": "Brazil tells an ancient Talmudic legend of how a rabbi loses faith in God—save that instead of Rabbi Elisha b. Avuyah becoming Aher, it is Brazilian rabbinical student, Jose Baruch becoming Other. He searches for answers—by working as a clerk for the corrupt and sexually exploitive Beauchamp in a textile factory; by adopting an orphan from the poverty stricken streets of Rio; and by marrying a Roman Catholic textile worker. Baruch becomes ‘Other,’ a lonely anti-hero, and becomes lost in a world where greed rules but true goodness refuses to be stomped out. Is giving up God giving up on hope? And does the Jewish God give up on us because we give up on God? And is Other ultimately redeemable whatever his flaws might be?",
