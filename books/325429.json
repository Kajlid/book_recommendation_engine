  "description": "I was fourteen when my dad married Lane’s mom and our families became one, when my favorite moments were those spent staying up all night, talking or watching Lane create art. There aren’t many things more inconvenient than loving your stepbrother. I know the limits, and that’s pushing them too far. Over the years I’ve pulled away from him. It was easier when he left for New York, but now he’s back, not only in Atlanta, but in my home, trying to get back what we lost. How can I tell my own stepbrother that I want him in my bed? That I want to call him mine? One kiss changes everything. Our tight-knit family won’t understand. Our friends won’t either. But no matter how much I don’t want to disappoint them, now that we’re where we belong, I won’t walk away. Even if I have to lose everything to keep him. Pushing the Limits is a stepbrother romance with a cocky main character, who shows his vulnerability through the one man he’s not supposed to want, sexy painting, and a love that defies the odds.",
