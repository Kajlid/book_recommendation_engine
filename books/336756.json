  "title": "A Royal Witch",
  "description": "The Beechwood Manor is filling up fast and Holly’s feeling the pinch.  There are several new roommates in the Beechwood Manor, and one of them is a royal witch.  Literally and figuratively.  Unrest in a haven-ally magical kingdom leads a foreign princess into hiding and the Supernatural Protection Agency deems the Beechwood Manor as the perfect safe house—and Holly, her perfect guardian.  But with Holly's business taking off and a new apprentice under her wing, a royal babysitting detail is the last thing she needs. Besides, the spoiled princess is adamant she can take care of herself. So who could blame her if her supervision is a little lax?  When tragedy strikes, the bratty royal’s problems land at the manor’s front door and it’s going to take all hands on deck if the paranormal roomies hope to make it out alive.",
