  "description": "Bestselling author BB Easton pulls no punches in this gritty, taboo, forbidden love story based on true events. \nIn 1997, Ronald “Knight” McKnight was the meanest, most misunderstood boy at Peach State High School...perhaps on the entire planet. Knight hated everyone, except for me, BB—the perky, quirky punk chick with the locker next to his. I, on the other hand, liked everybody…except for Knight. I was scared sh*tless of him, actually. All I wanted was to marry Prince Eric-lookalike and king of the Peach State High punk scene, Lance Hightower, and have a million of his babies. Unfortunately for me, Knight was even better at getting his way than I was, and once he got under my skin, my life would never be the same.\n SKIN is Book 1 in the 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN spin-off series but can be read as a complete standalone.",
