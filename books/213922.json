  "description": "Pilot James uses flirting and sleeping with guys as his therapy. He likes variety and quantity when it comes to the bedroom. He doesn’t trust people, and the only way he really knows how to relate to others is through sex.Cabe Evans is the complete opposite of his best friend and roommate, Pilot. He likes things safe and predictable. In fact, he’s been with his girlfriend, Lydia, since high school. But lately, things are a little too bland, even for him. Things have begun to fizzle in the bedroom.When Lydia starts pushing for Cabe to move in with her, both men realize the feelings they have for each other might actually go way beyond simple friendship. But will Pilot’s fear of intimacy, and Cabe’s rejection of anything that deviates from his perfect life plan, destroy any chance they might have at happiness?",
