  "description": "Dakota Banks has taken the supernatural thriller and given it a breathtaking new twist! Deliverance is the third book in Banks’s relentlessly exciting urban fantasy series, Mortal Path, featuring heroine Maliha Crayne, once a demon’s henchwoman and paranormal assassin now determined to atone for her centuries of murderous acts. A cross between Tomb Raider’s Lara Croft and Marvel Comics’s Elektra, Maliha finds her powers are rapidly fading in Deliverance, and discovers that her quest to avoid eternal damnation has put those she loves most in gravest peril. Banks’s Deliverance delivers suspense and edge-of-your-seat adventure—a non-stop paranormal roller coaster ride that fans of Jeaniene Frost, James Rollins, Vicki Pettersson, and Indiana Jones, won’t want to miss.“A gut-kick of a read, with non-stop action and as inventive a world as I’ve ever seen.”—Vicki Pettersson, New York Times bestselling author of the Signs of the Zodiac series“Great characters who jump from the page; a smart, layered plot, and pacing that screams. This is the kind of book that makes you look forward to a rainy day.”—John Gilstrap, author of Nathan’s Run “Readers…will devour Banks’s clever and compelling Mortal Path series. Assassins, demons, and danger, oh my!”—Lisa Gardner, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Love You More",
