  "description": "Welcome to Grizzly Cove, where the sheriff has more than the peace to protect. The proprietor of the new bakery in town is clueless about the dual nature of her nearest neighbors, but not for long. It’ll be up to Sheriff Brody to clue her in and convince her to stay calm—and in his bed—for the next fifty years or so. Yeah, that might be enough. Then again, maybe he’ll keep her forever.* PLEASE This NOVELLA first released in the LOVE EVER AFTER box set, which came out on September 15, 2015. Meaning - if you already have the box set, you already have this story.",
