  "description": "After decades of training under his mentor Gildor, Kian Cardan walks out of the Blue Dagger Mountains with little on his mind but a strong desire to return home. Now a master of the ancient techniques of the Elven warriors, the time has come for him to defend the weak, and combat ever present forces of evil. But a cruel welcome awaits him, and he soon falls into the company of K’xarr and Cromwell, two mercenaries who appear to be harbouring a dangerous secret.  Hard times have befallen the kingdom of Bandara, and when the king dies the crown is passed to the princess Raygan, instead of her older, more ambitious brother. With war drums beating in neighboring Abberdon, and sinister schemes festering within the castle walls, the Princess Raygan turns to the three unlikely allies for salvation.  Only time will tell if the courage in Kian’s heart is great enough to overcome the growing darkness in his soul.",
