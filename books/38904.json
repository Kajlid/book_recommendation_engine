  "description": "Peach Kelley brings a little light into the lives of everyone she works with—or so she likes to think. And she's a whiz at helping her coworkers at Millennium Gift Baskets with their romantic problems. Even though her own love life is the pits, finding a boyfriend is the last thing on her mind-until she meets the new network administrator, Adam Quinlan. Preoccupied with his own chaotic life, Quin thinks Peach is spunky, pretty...and a big nuisance. But when one of their coworkers mysteriously disappears, the two join forces to dig around for answers. For the first time ever, Peach may have gotten herself into a situation she can't get out of—falling in love.",
