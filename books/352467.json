  "description": "Skate, drugs, and rock n roll! --Kat Von D, LA InkSkateboarding used to be my life. When I was fourteen years old, I was discovered by Bucky Lasek and Tony Hawk and was on my way to turning pro. I toured the country, signed autographs, and had my photo in skate magazines. Then I got hooked on heroin and threw it all away.Soon I was living in an abandoned garage and begging for spare change. Ripping off my family and friends meant nothing to me. I was a dreamseller, pushing the fantasy that I was a recovering addict. Anything to get my precious next fix.This is my story of struggling to survive on the streets and battling with addiction in rehab. It's a story of trust I betrayed and trust I had to earn back. It's also the story of my friendship with MTV and Jackass star Bam Margera. I would have died a junkie's death if not for him. Bam convinced me to write about how my addiction destroyed my career--and nearly my life.\"Entertaining, shocking, crazy, unimaginable.\" --Bam MargeraWith 24 pages of photos.Brandon Novak is an actor, TV personality, radio show host (on Radio Bam, Sirius Faction 28), author, and former pro skateboarder.
