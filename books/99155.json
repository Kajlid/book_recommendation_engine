  "description": "Michael Evans is only in rural St. Davids to maintain a low profile after his time spent as a city cop went disastrously wrong. The town is perfect for him: isolated. A tiny population. Virtually no crime.Until the night the strange canisters fall from the sky and the town priest turns up at the local restaurant carrying a recently severed head.As violence erupts across the town, Michael realises that what he is dealing with might not be a crime. In fact, the very notion of police work may have just been rendered obsolete. Faced with escalating insanity and fearing for the safety of his estranged daughter, Michael has only one option: survive. Or become something else.Something less than human.",
