  "description": "Lady Henrietta's lusty illicit dalliances with the handsome Nick have continued unabated. In public he is the estate's under-butler, dutifully serving his mistress. But in private Hattie is his to play with as he pleases... Yet tensions are rising from this secret and frequent inversion of power. Hattie cannot resist teasing and provoking him in public... and delighting in the punishments he dreams up in response... It cannot last. Sooner or later, Hattie must do her duty and marry. But can Nick accept sharing his lover? Or will his jealousy become another needle that Hattie can use to torment him? When she shows favor to one of her suitors by revealing a shocking amount of ankle, both the poor man and the under-butler get hot under the collar. Hattie knows she will suffer wonderfully for her teasing display, but she just can't resist... And in return Hattie will feel the burning shame of the under-butler's candles as they play a dark game of lust, dancing flames and dripping waxâ€“an urgent game with high stakes thanks to one large and intimately positioned candle in particular...",
