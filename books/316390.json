  "description": "It is the end of history and all is known, or will be soon. Humanity long ago transitioned to the era of holy technology. Now humans present as saintly animals, spending their days in meditation and drug-induced euphoria, far from the dark secrets their paradise is founded upon. But when an ancient prophet allegedly returns in the form of a troubled young girl, galactic peace can only last so long.Geometry for Ocelots is the story of two monarch siblings gone to war at the end of timeâ€”a holy empress, and an alcoholic university dean. With galactic resources dwindling, both believe they hold the answer to the crisis; be it spiritual salvation or technological nirvana. Both will be gravely mistaken.",
