  "description": "Ridge McCallister. King of the junkyard. God of the gridiron. Cypress Springs’ beloved bad boy. With just a wink and a smile, he has most girls at his beck and call. Good thing I’m immune to his (debatable) charms.Don’t get me wrong, he is beautiful. With the body of a Greek god and the face of a fallen angel, who could resist? Too bad he’s so… Ridge. Every time he opens his mouth, I want to punch him. Or kiss him. No, I don’t want that. Not at all. Not even a little bit.Yet here I am in a no-strings-attached summer fling with the guy I love to hate, and my traitorous heart is calling the shots. The problem is he’s a wreck, and I’m ruined. And as anyone can tell you, when wrecked meets ruined things tend to get… messy. Make no mistake about it. \nWe are going to destroy each other.",
