As far as Ian’s concerned, Francesca’s gone too far. It’s not just her flirtation with disaster, but her flagrant defiance and an agenda to torment him until he’s seeing red with need and desire. He will see the willful young woman submit, but when she does, Ian finds himself losing all of his carefully guarded control and leaping into the consuming flames with the woman he can’t live without. Includes a bonus excerpt of Beth Kery’s Wicked Burn, now available. More to come… Don’t miss Because You Are Mine, Part VII, available 9/11",
