  "description": "Fans of Jon Klassen and Oliver Jeffers will love this mischievously funny read-aloud from award-winning author/illustrator Jon AgeeMysterious noises keep waking up the Wimbledon family. \"That's very odd,\" says Mr. Wimbledon each time, but when he returns from checking on the sounds, he's always \"It's only Stanley; he's fixing the oil tank.\" \"It's only Stanley; he's clearing the bathtub drain.\"But what Stanley the dog is actually doing while his oblivious family goes back to bed is deliciously he's turning the house into a rocket ship to zoom himself and his family to another planet for an alien encounter. This is a perfect rhyming read-aloud for fans of irreverent tales like  Click Clack Moo and  I Want My Hat Back .",
