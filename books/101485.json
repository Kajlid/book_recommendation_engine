  "description": "With the suicide of her best friend, burned-out rock star Nikki Velvet came face-to-face with death, and she'd do anything not to face it again. When a mysterious stranger offers her immortality, she believes she's found what she's been searching for, but it's nothing like she's imagined .... Sylvan, the beautiful stranger who'd promised to make her a vampire, turned out to be all too human. He keeps his promise - but only to leave her weak, helpless, and addicted to his blood. Now, trapped in her new life with him - and with Paul, the vampire she's replaced as Sylvan's favorite - Nikki struggles to rise above Sylvan's control and Paul's jealousy, and to find a way out with the help from the ghosts of her past. But it might not be so simple. When Sylvan risks the retribution of the enigmatic Shadow Market, Nikki has to find her own fate, before time runs out for all of them .... STILL LIFE is a story of loss, isolation, the things we mistake for love, and the way back out of the dark.",
