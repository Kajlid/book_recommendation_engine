The question of how people reach a change of heart is a profound one; Hasselbach describes the external forces that led to his founding Germany's first neo-Nazi political party and the internal ones that led him away from it five years later with a surprisingly careful thoughtfulness and thoroughness that befits the issues at hand.based on: \"Die Abrechnung\" by Ingo Hasselbach (ISBN 3-351-02446-0)",
