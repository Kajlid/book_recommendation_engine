  "description": "Starring characters from Brian Wood's COUSCOUS EXPRESS, the sleeper hit graphic novel of 2002, THE COURIERS is a fast-paced action-adventure comic set in New York City, featuring Moustafa and Special: mercenary couriers. They do the work the normal couriers are only barely aware of: intelligence, large cash transfers, protection, assassinations, blockade-running... you name it. But there is one job they always knew they would refuse, known as a \"biologic.\" But when the package turns out to be a young deaf/mute girl from Nepal, with a gone-rogue Chinese Red Army Brigade hot on her heels, how can they NOT get involved? THE COURIERS is a pure action movie on paper.",
