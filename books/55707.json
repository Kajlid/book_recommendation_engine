  "description": "“Fisher’s first novel—first of many, I hope—is both sweet and savory, built on the foundations of a quirky Texas town that feels like it’s always been hiding out there in the desert, woven through with genuinely clever storytelling. The story unfolds like a tale told on a wraparound porch to the clink of iced tea glasses. Fisher creates a world where angels and demons are as delightfully believable as the perfect peach pie, and I’m eagerly looking forward to the next slice.”--Dianne Sylvan, author of the Shadow World series  Empathic pie baker Gracey Daylittle has lived a quiet life in the desert of Love & War, Texas, for ten years. But when she and her sister unwittingly rescue an insatiable Japanese demon from the side of the road, her world descends into a maelstrom of mythic chaos that threatens to destroy her town and the foundations she’s built her life—and her sanity— upon.  In a tale full of the warmth of the Chihuahuan landscape, the Daylittle sisters and their quirky, unforgettable neighbors grapple with the unexpected shift in their universe and get an eye-opening lesson in what it really means to be human.  A delicious fusion of Mexican and Japanese mythologies, the first book in the Love & War series is sure to delight urban fantasy and magical realism fans everywhere.",
