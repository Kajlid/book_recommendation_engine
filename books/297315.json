  "description": "The land of Valeis was once home for all Drishti - folk with the ability to control people. Since Isla became Queen, she used her power to create an army so loyal, it would burn down villages to seek out the last Drishti alive. For years, the kingdom has been riddled with a faint memory of what life used to be, replaced by cruelty and deception.Ashen Shadows is a story of three young women and their journey to end the Queen's treacherous reign:a Drishti who has been hiding all her life,a common thief who has always served her own purpose,a princess who has never disobeyed her mother.And it all begins with a letter from someone who knows the whole story..._____________Ashen Shadows is a women-led fantasy with vivid world building, fierce characters, witty humour, mystery and intrigue delicately woven into the angst of hidden pasts, hints of soul-wrenching romance and unexpected twists, cleverly tied up in a mind-blowing ending.",
