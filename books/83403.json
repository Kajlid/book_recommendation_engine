  "description": "In a small settlement south of Tanarak, a gunman named Westwind wakes in the darkness beyond which a sliver of light calls his name. He puts a sevengun to his head and tells the voice to shut up. But for once it's not a delusion. It's a church courier summoning him to Tanarak Citadel. After wading through winter winds and ice canyons, a man in red leans over his treewood battlefield and offers Westwind ten pieces of metal to assassinate the captain of Rail City and his two demons. It's too much metal, says the voice in Westwind's head. But he has to accept it anyways.",
