Muth, author of the best-selling book, The Three Questions, has crafted another profound and winning picture book. \"Michael,\" said Karl. \"There's a really big bear in the backyard.\" This is how three children meet Stillwater, a giant panda who moves into the neighborhood and tells amazing tales. To Addy he tells a story about the value of material goods. To Michael he pushes the boundaries of good and bad. And to Karl he demonstrates what it means to hold on to frustration.
