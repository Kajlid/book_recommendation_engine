  "title": "The Doomed Colony",
  "description": "A group of house mice struggle to survive a long and strange winter. The humans are gone, the sun is rarely seen, and a cold, dark rain befouls everything it touches.The mice, long dependent on humans for food, stubbornly cling to their old ways, looting the nearby abandoned houses for any scraps they can find. Once, there was plenty to eat, but now the scavengers return empty-handed, or not at all.Food is scarce, but danger is everywhere, in the form of poison, traps and-- worst of all-- cats. This gang of feral predators relentlessly hunt the mice whenever they leave the safety of their nest.As supplies run low and many mice fall ill, desperation creeps in. With the colony at a breaking point, rumours of a wrecked truck filled with food give them hope, but it lies far beyond the forest, where even the cats won’t go.Now the colony’s best scouts, including the brave Wix, embark on a dangerous journey to save the colony, but beyond the lawns and fences of the neighbourhood lurk far worse things than stray cats…www.scurrycomic.com",
