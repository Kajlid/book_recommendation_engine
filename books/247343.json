  "description": "Aveline got what she deserved. An unlucky thief, she’s been caught and imprisoned on the Interstellar Penitentiary System station. For the rest of her natural life, she’ll be an unwilling subject in whatever experiments the psychopathetic Earth government scientists choose to use her for. But Aveline’s luck is about to change. When a wormhole opens near the space station, Aveline is sucked out of hell and into a world she never knew existed—Sonhadra. And she’s not alone. Locked away by a species known only as The Creators, the Ventos, a race of air elementals, have lived a half-life—alive but unaware of the passage of time, or who they are. Until Aveline arrives. The last four Ventos in Sonhandra, Aaddhar, Branesh, Ettan, and Thanasis, are awake now, and Aveline holds their hearts in her thieving little hands. Faced with a world utterly changed and unfamiliar, they decide to forge a new one. Together, they’ll create world of freedom and joy, and if the five of them are the only ones who enjoy it, that’s fine with the Ventos. But Aveline didn’t arrive alone. The person at the heart of her downfall, the one who pushed her onto the path that led to loss and pain, has fallen through the wormhole as well. And she threatens everything Aveline and her Ventos have created. Will they be strong enough to survive the threat they now face? Or will the Ventos be sent back into oblivion and Aveline into hell?",
