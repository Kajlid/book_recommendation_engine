Her divorce came as such a shock and she’d been feeling lost and lonely, but that didn’t mean she was desperate to date again. It was a terrible day at work that made her say yes: it could be a bit of fun, a distraction at least.

He makes her feel wanted for the first time in years, and when she wakes up in his bed in the early hours she feels completely content.Until she notices that he’s no longer lying beside her.She’s tangled up in his sheets alone in his bedroom and she can’t remember how she got there.And then she hears the metallic scrape of a key in the door and realises that Malik has locked her in. Is her dream man going to turn into her worst nightmare?Thrilling and gripping until the final page, Blind Date is a dark and unsettling story about deception and how much we can trust the people we love. For fans of Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train and anything by Lisa Jewell.",
