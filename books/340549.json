  "description": "Searching for spirituality in 1960s China during the Cultural Revolution, Beijing intellectual Chen Zhen travels to the pristine grasslands of Inner Mongolia to live among the nomadic Mongols-the descendants of the Mongol hordes who once terrorized the world-who coexist in perfect harmony with their beautiful but exacting natural environment. At the core of their beliefs is the notion of a triangular balance between the earth, man, and the fierce, otherworldly Mongolian wolf whose fates are all intricately linked; the wolves and the Mongols are both facing extinction.The few wolves that remain haunt the steppes locked with the nomads in a profoundly spiritual battle for survival. By adopting a wolf cub of his own, Chen's fascination blossoms into obsession, and ultimately reverence. But when the peace is shattered by the intrusion of modernity, the age-old balance is disrupted, and life on the grasslands will never be the same. Part period epic, part fable for modern days, Wolf Totem is a stinging social commentary on the dangers of over-accelerated economic growth, and a heady immersion into the heart of Chinese and Mongolian culture.",
