  "description": "Marigold McCorkle’s well-to-do father demanded she work as a nursemaid for a year to remind her of her family’s roots and teach her some humility. When her employers drown in a boating accident, their children have no one to care for them until their uncle arrives from out West. But his tardy arrival causes Marigold’s impatient fiancée to cancel their engagement. Gordon Chambers dreams of Alaskan gold. The last thing he wants is to be burdened with his late brother’s responsibilities in New Jersey—especially not two precocious little girls and their beautiful, uppity nursemaid. Determined to sell his brother’s boating business then find a boarding school, he ignores warnings about the safety of the excursion boats until one of them begins to sink with his niece on board. Will Gordon abandon those who’ve come to depend on him? Or will he discover that Marigold and his nieces are more precious to him than gold?",
