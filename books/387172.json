  "description": "\"My house is the red earth; it could be the center of the world.\"This is Navajo country, a land of mysterious and delicate beauty. \"Stephen Strom's photographs lead you to that place,\" writes Joy Harjo. \"The camera eye becomes a space you can move through into the powerful landscapes that he photographs. The horizon may shift and change all around you, but underneath it is the heart with which we move.\" Harjo's prose poems accompany these images, interpreting each photograph as a story that evokes the spirit of the Earth. Images and words harmonize to evoke the mysteries of what the Navajo call the center of the world.",
