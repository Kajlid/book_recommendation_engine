  "description": "Millie opened her diary. Yes, here it is, she said. Jesus, please hold my heart in Your hand. Don't let me give it or any piece of it away. I want YOU to give it away in your time, to the right person. Please hold it tight, lock it up, and keep the key. October 8, 1836. Millie sighed. I will be sixteen in a week. Sixteen is too young for romance, isn't it? Millie quickly snapped her diary shut. Lord, I gave you my heart. Don't let me take it back and give it to another! In 1837, when Millie Keith's parents sent her south to spend the winter with rich relatives, they gave her three pieces of honor your parents, honor God in all you do, and give your heart to Jesus. Millie thought those things would be easy, but alone at Roselands Plantation she finds her convictions tested in ways she could not have imagined. Will the high society lifestyle of the Dinsmore family change Millie?",
