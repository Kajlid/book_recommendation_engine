  "description": "Teenager Paula Masters, who is used to her cell phones and cherry lattes and designer jeans, suddenly finds herself thrust back in time to 1848 and the Oregon Trail. In her modern life, sharp-tongued and something of a hellion, she rebels against the curfews and school restrictions of her day, seeing them as unfair hardships. But now in this alien world with its buffalo stampedes, wild Indians, and countless other ways to die, she must set aside her Rude Girl persona and figure out how to survive. Then Paula meets young Daniel Langdon, hunter and part-time scout, and an infatuation quickly becomes a great passion. She realizes this is the love of her life and to get home she will have to leave him. Tested in body and soul, she is about to learn what real hardships are. The Far Journey is an epic story of love and tragedy, loyalty and betrayal and ultimately survival. Throughout, Paula Masters is tested in body and soul and must discover the strength and toughness inside her she never thought she had. \"\"An intriguing story that captures you from the first page.\"\"-Sara Vinduska, author of Reflections \"What a grand, mind-bending tale Tom Reppert has spun!\" -Jim Payne, author of kayak adventure tales One Inch above the Water and Discovering England from One Inch above the Thames.",
