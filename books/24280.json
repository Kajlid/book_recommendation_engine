  "description": "A wolf without a pack is a solitary life. Calan runs wild on Channing land, but his stay can only be temporary. He isn’t like other wolves. He will never feel the need to breed and will never take a mate. The large black wolf—the shifter who claims him nightly—has other ideas. This Alpha wolf may not give Calan a choice.",
