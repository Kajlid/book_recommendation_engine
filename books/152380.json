  "description": "Tempting an Earl is not for the faint of heart.Thank heavens Bethanny is anything but faint!Now, honest, perhaps--too honest, but never faint!After all, why flirt when you can tempt? And why the devil would a woman choose to swoon when she could be kissed?Of course, she'd never try something so...honest, yes that was the word, honest on anyone but Lord Graham.He's the only one she wants.He alone has her heart.And, he hadnâ€™t a clue.So it was only polite that she tell him.Now, if only her blasted guardian, the Duke of Clairmont, would see Graham as more of a suitor than his old friend.Because Graham is anything but old and most certainly not just a friend, not after that kiss, or that touch.Though, if she were to lay all her cards on the table--which any gently bred woman ought--he wasn't completely aware it was her mouth, her lips, or her touch.But that's beside the point now, isn't it?",
