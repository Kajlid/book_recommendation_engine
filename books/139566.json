Besides, it's not like the boring nerd ever ends up with the hot guy.Then his housemate, gorgeous undergraduate jock Marshall Sulkowski, invites him to watch a movie. In his room. Side by side on his bed. Needless to say, the sexual tension is wreaking havoc with Greg's focus.Marsh seems to have it all-looks, charm, and a baseball scholarship to a great school.

But as the end of the semester approaches and the pressure rises, Marsh realizes charm may have gotten him into his brilliant lover's pants, but he'll have to dig deeper to discover what they both need.Warning: Contains housemates falling into bed with each other, a geek who needs a break, and a jock who doesn't know his own worth.
