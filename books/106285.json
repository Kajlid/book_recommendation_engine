  "description": "A cookbook recommended by three 100-pound lap dogs, sampled by a wonderful husband and fed to some great neighbors and friends! Every kitchen needs a dog! A dog quick to lick up the drops and drips that occur in the kitchen. A dog that looks at you with beseeching eyes for a nibble of cheese or a sliver of meat. A dog that awaits with hope and longing, a scrap of food will land on the floor. We all know better than to feed our crafty canines \"human food\", but we still do! Here's a cookbook that will charm you with adorable pictures of puppies and dogs as they try to beguile their owner into giving them a taste of what's to come. Recipes that have been served to former Vice-Presidents, pro athletes, family members and best friends - all savory, all tasty! These recipes were created for taste, ease, and an opportunity for the chef to showcase their talent in the kitchen. Recipes guaranteed to receive compliments - the cook will need to make enough for seconds!",
