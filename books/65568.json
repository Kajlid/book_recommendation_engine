  "description": "‘Nothing can prepare you for what is about to happen. After the uprising, Sintar used to be such a lovely place, a place where wizards and the non-magical lived in harmony. However, now it’s full of anxiety and fear. Crime has risen and the Council can’t seem to handle the evil magic that plagues society; and Therolius Delrunt, the Overlord has to do something fast to restore the face of wizardry. But most wizards fear for magic and their wands. So there is no hope, is there? The evil Lex Talionis are getting stronger and their leader hungers for one thing - The Grimoire. Why does he lust for it? How will he get past Therolius? Surely it’s just a matter of time, as nobody can stop him…except maybe for a young wizard called Fizbar... and his spoon.’",
