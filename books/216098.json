  "description": "There is an alternate cover edition for this ASIN here.Welcome to the world of self-proclaimed social outcast Anna who shares her adventures (sometimes misadventures) and her attempts to live a perfectly normal life with her housemate Sarah in a gorgeous flat in South Kensington only to be disturbed by occasional late night flower deliveries by regretful admirers, invitations to questionable parties, and uninvited guests who look too good to bear.Anna soon meets the likes of David and Gina, questionable elements she can’t quite put her finger on, who have taken on the new hobby of trying to ruin her completely.Oh, and let’s not forget James, who almost runs Anna over with his car and is at the centre of all this chaos.P.S. There’s London highlife we’re forgetting and they really don’t take well to being so blatantly ignored… it really became one gigantic mess!",
