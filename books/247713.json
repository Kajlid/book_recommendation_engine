  "description": "The Cats Be Unemployed: A Millennial's Topsy-Turvy Chase for Gainful Employment; or, A Generation's Catalog of ConundrumsWhen we are young and un(der)employed, we may find ourselves in desperate or humorous situations trying to chase some cash. We become curious about ourselves and our society and question what it really means to be an \"adult.\" We begin to compare ourselves to others...or to cats: living back at home, sleeping all day, going crazy, not wearing pants, pawing at that mouse. We are always on the hunt. We are constantly put in boxes. We are frustrated by closed doors.The Cats Be Unemployed takes you through one Millennial's topsy-turvy chase to find gainful employment after cat walking right into the Great Recession. Kristin's twenties are spent precariously enduring unemployment five times within a six year span, while fighting through bait and switch scams, unreliable jobs and gig work, questionable policies, rocky relationships, and her own \"quarter- life crisis.\"Through a collection of essays combining personal stories, extensive research, and humor, she examines the socioeconomic landscape this generation lives with, but has the potential to change. She provides insightful analysis on disconnects that surround education, health care, pay rates, company culture, and our perceptions versus realities of the working world. Join Kristin in an eye-opening discovery of the catalog of conundrums aspiring adults face after graduation.",
