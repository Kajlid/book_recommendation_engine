  "description": "Deep below Manhattan, tunnel engineer Josh Reed leads his team as they excavate the East Side Access extending New York's railway service. But sparks fly as the drill hits an unusual crystalline materialâ€”one Josh has never seen before. They push on and Josh discovers something even more unexpected . . . a vast room, empty and lifeless.  Or so it seems.  When Josh finds out that the CIA are now looking for him, and that his co-workers have gone missing, he turns to his best friend and boss Lionel Parker for help. Together they unravel the mystery of the room, what's inside it, and why the CIA are so desperate to keep them silent.  It's nothing they could ever have expected.  New York Deep was written by the author of the hit novel Vessel. Also available from the author:  Vessel New Dawn Noah's Ark",
