  "title": "Absent Kisses",
  "description": "From the \"bedwife\" who teaches medieval brides to make love, to the secretary whose mind turns to murder, these stories are the creations of an imagination that is by turns angelic and demonic. Frances Gapper's stories have been widely anthologized but are brought together here for the first time, with several fresh and surprising new tales. Elements of magic realism, fantasy, historical fiction, and English humor make up a delightful collection. Frances Gapper's stories have appeared in various magazines and anthologies, including Time Out (London) and The Diva Book of Short Stories . As well as a children's book, she has published one novel for adults , Saints and Adventurers (Women's Press), and is working on another set in a convent.",
