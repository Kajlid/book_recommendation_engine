  "title": "The Rose",
  "description": "When thirteen-year-old Lady Katherine sailed away from her home in the Caribbean for school in London, she didn't expect a brutal pirate attack. Nor did she anticipate ridicule and exclusion by her peers, or harsh punishment by the headmistress and the princess house assistant in Emerald House. Far from her mind when she boarded the ship was a murder mystery to solve. Don't get her started on the ghost. Her biggest surprise came, however, from a slip of the tongue by the Earl of Oxford; one that could have history changing implications.",
