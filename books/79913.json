It’s time to become Bad Girls.Imogen wants to get laid but how can she be a bad girl until she loses a few kilos and gets her body into order?Beth is happy to be a bad girl - so long as no one else finds out and so long as she is in control.Juliette’s not really sure what she’s doing there, but it sure beats another Saturday night gaming with her geek boyfriend.They band together to form the Bad Girls Club, a support group for recovering nice girls, and through a series of brazen dares, push the limits of their sexuality.But are the girls ready to finally take the final leap that will have them branded as bad girls for real? To save the club, and each other, they each have to publicly acknowledge their darkest secrets.The Bad Girls’ Club – it’s about sex, it’s about dares but most of all, it’s about friendship.",
