  "description": "We’ve all seen how the criminal justice system is portrayed on TV. From NCIS and Law & Order to White Collar and Cops, we’re led to believe that we know how the system works. But how much do we really know about what goes on?Author Robert Cromwell has actually been there, behind the lines, searching for truth and justice — and finding that they are not always easily connected. Cromwell details his own story — his work as a New Jersey police officer and NCIS agent, and his twenty-two year FBI career — looking at some of his more interesting cases along the way and giving us the chance to see inside the day-to-day workings of an agent’s life. As we read Cromwell’s story, we also come to understand why, despite the incredible good it does, the criminal justice system isnot always just.",
