  "description": "In the wake of King Henry VIII's death, England's throne is left in a precarious stateÂ—as is the peculiar relationship between his two daughters. Mary, the elder, once treasured, had been declared a bastard in favor of her flame-haired half-sister, Elizabeth, born of the doomed Anne Boleyn. Yet the bond between the sisters was palpable from the start. Now reinstated, Mary eventually assumes her place as queen. But as Mary's religious zeal evolves into a reign of terror, young Elizabeth gains the people's favor. Gripped by a tormenting paranoia, Mary is soon convinced that her beloved Elizabeth is in fact her worst enemy. And the virginal Elizabeth, whose true love is her country, must defy her tyrannical sister to make way for a new era. . .A brilliant portrait of the rule of \"Bloody Mary\" and her intricate relationship with Elizabeth I, the adored \"Virgin Queen,\" here is a riveting tale of one family's sordid and extraordinary chapter in the pages of history.",
