  "description": "For decades, Brendan Lau has swept the Hollywood scene as an openly gay actor starring in romantic films--but now, at fifty-one, he's losing out on roles to younger actors. And when he's passed over as the hero in a period film and instead cast as the father, it's less his reputation and more his pride that can't take the insult. But when he confronts the younger actor who stole his part, he walks in on Cillian Tell struggling to fend off the director's unwanted advances. For twenty-nine-year-old Cillian, Brendan is the reason he fell in love with acting. But the real Brendan is nothing like his debonair heroes or the charming image he presents on the red carpet; he's arrogant, domineering, grumpy, and entirely set in his obstinate ways. Cillian can't lose his first role in a major feature film. Brendan can't stand the idea of working with a sleazy director. Yet when Cillian begs him to silence, Brendan agrees to keep his secrets. But somehow Brendan's role as Cillian's guardian turns into something else. But what happens when Cillian starts to fall for the heart beneath the grouch? And what happens when Brendan discovers Cillian's royal lineage? Contains mature themes.",
