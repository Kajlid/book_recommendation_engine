It’s about you.Natalie Jamison has spent five years trying to forget the girl she was in high school: popular, pretty…and, okay, mean.

And their secret relationship was incredible, painful—and earth-shattering enough to inspire an entire album.Facing friends and enemies isn’t easy, but Natalie will go to great lengths to prove she is good enough—to her friends, to herself, and most of all, to the small-town boy turned worldwide heartthrob she never forgot.",
