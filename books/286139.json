  "description": "Preorder Bourbon on the Rocks.Life isn’t a game.Life isn’t an empty bottle of bourbon spinning on a warehouse floor as I hold my breath.I feel weak when others perceive me as strong.I’m passionate though I appear to hate the world around me.I see beauty in all ugly things.I feel pain when I laugh.No one knows the truth.Well, no one knew the truth until now.Somehow, Brody Pearson understands more about me than anyone else in my life. The severed connection should mean something significant, but I don’t know if I can forget all my self-proclaimed promises.",
