But Mariss is married, and she has no desire to lose what she loves for a one night stand with the indulgent playboy.When an attempt is made on Mariss' life, Sebastian rushes to her side. Those closest to him know that it's only a matter of time before his new infatuation causes him to crash and burn.For a man who lives on the edge, the Rules of the chase become clear at the start. If he wants to win Mariss, he will have to play on her turf. Boundaries and all. The harder Sebastian tries, the more Mariss refuses, and the harder it gets to keep his control.
