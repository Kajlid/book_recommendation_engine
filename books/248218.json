  "description": "Teagen McMurray would ride to hell and back to protect his land. He'd certainly never felt that way about a woman. At least not until Jessie Barton showed up with her three little girls, desperate for a place to stay. Suddenly he finds himself proposing marriage, telling himself it is only to protect her and her children ...Jessie had no place to go except Whispering Mountain --- and to Teagen, the one person who couldn't deny her, thanks to the correspondence he shared with her dead husband. But what will happen once the man she's loved through his letters discovers her tangle of lies?",
