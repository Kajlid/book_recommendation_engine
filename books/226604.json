  "description": "Suppose you witnessed a crime, but had good reason to believe that if you called the police and told them what you saw your life would be in serious danger of ending very soon after? That's what happens to Kasey Riteman, the completely believable central character in this well-developed first thriller by a commercial photographer with a keen eye for character and detail. Kasey has lots of problems of her own, so when she stumbles on a murder her first impulse is to hide and hope the killer didn't spot her. Then her sense of justice takes over, tempered by justified fear. And when Kasey comes up with what seems like the perfect way to tip off the police without risking her neck, things go from bad to deadly very quickly.",
