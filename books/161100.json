  "title": "Spirit of Tabasco",
  "description": "Spirit of Tabasco is a glimpse at the mystifying experiences of people young and old, working through circumstances that ultimately change their worldly perspectives. The stories include the travails of a young man who volunteers to give care to a mute, conniving ex-con dying of tongue cancer, a cynic who attends a lecture on compassion and is held captive by an ominous fellow-pilgrim, a teenager who goes with his friend to steal back a rifle, only to have the friend aim the gun at him and then shoot himself (in the foot), and a young girl who is lured by her odd older cousin to go trick-or-treating in early July. The novella tells of a precocious teen who helps his mother retrieve a mysterious and possessed ancient Mayan mirror from the hands of his greedy estranged father.",
