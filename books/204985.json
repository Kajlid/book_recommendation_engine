  "description": "His lifestyle. His rules.Is she willing to risk her heart to play his game? Guitarist Cole Hayes learned early that falling in love is the easiest way to lose. Determined never to go down that road, he sealed his heart off, numbing himself with erotic and sensual pleasures--with men and women alike. The rules were simple: group sex only and never one-on-one. Itâ€™s all so simple until he meets Devon Bannister, the beautiful director shooting the documentary on his band. Suddenly, she's all he can think about. Neither can deny the attraction and desire between them. Although Devon is open to exploring Cole's lifestyle, for the first time in his life, he finds himself reluctant to share.  How can he own all of her, if he's only willing to give half of himself?",
