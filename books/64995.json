  "description": "Subject: Navy SEAL Lieutenant Blake Landon Current Status: Two weeks of enforced leave Mission: Distract himself in any way possible Obstacle: A woman who tempts him to break the rules...including his own!  Navy SEAL Blake Landon (aka \"Boy Scout\") knows the rule book inside and out. Checked. Rechecked. But when a mission ends badly, his entire team is ordered on leave. And that's when Blake sees the tall redhead whose dark eyes suggest that the rules-especially those in bed-are made to be broken. Scientist Alexia Lane has sex on the brain-partly for work, but mostly because she needs a man who makes her girly parts do the happy dance. Her only no-no? No military dudes. But Blake's rockin' bod promises delicious pleasures, and Alexia is halfway to sexual Nirvana before she can find out he's actually a Navy SEAL. And where one rule is broken, more are sure to follow.... Uniformly Hot! The Few. The Proud. The Sexy as Hell!",
