  "description": "This Vintage Romance is inspired by Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey.  His heart is in his castle, hers is in the clouds. Can they find a way to meet in the middle?  Beverly Tune is a bookstore owner with a very active imagination. When she accompanies her aunt on an American castle tour, she stumbles into the wealthy and handsome playboy Ned Sterling. Or was meeting him not a coincidence at all? Beverly’s quick to conclude that the flirtatious Ned is both full of himself and hiding a secret agenda. Ned expected to inherit the family castle, but when his mother died without a will, the entire estate went to his ambitious, money-hungry father. Ned’s goals revolve around protecting the castle and his heritage, and he hopes Beverly’s aunt can help him. He doesn’t mean to give Beverly mixed messages, but how else can he keep her close enough to help his cause and far enough away that she’s not a distraction?  When Beverly’s imagination gets her in trouble with Ned—again—they both have to decide what they’re willing to change to give the affection and attraction between them a chance to grow.",
