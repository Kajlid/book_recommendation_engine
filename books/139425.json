  "description": "\"There is something sad about a person who blindly sacrifices his life 'for his country,' for he is unaware of the real issues. If a person can grasp the truth about war, it can't help but color his thinking on such issues as draft dodging. The name draft dodger suggests the evasion of a just debt or obligation. In reality, a draft dodger is either a person who rejects military service on religious or moral grounds-or plainly doesn't want to allow himself to be killed. Any of those reasons should be good enough, and I don't think that he should be persecuted or prosecuted. A person who is willing to sacrifice his life 'for his country' is merely a dupe in the profit game of the military-industrial complex. A man who has the courage to stand up against such twisted idealism and refuse to be sacrificed for profiteers is no coward. My opinion of the draft dodger differs from the opinion of many of my peers, but then, my generation is probably one of the biggest collections of fools on record.\" - Major Ralph E. Hamilton, WW2 Veteran, 1976",
