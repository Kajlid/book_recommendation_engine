A spiritual journey that will will change the way you view the world and your place in it.\"The best religious conspiracy since the Da Vinci Code!\"\"Sometimes history is fiction, and sometimes fiction makes history...\"\"Spellbinding and terrifyingly possible...\"\"What an amazing, inspired, and frightening look at the world and the history of homosexuality. By blending past, present, and future so seamlessly, you have given us our own mythology, our own place in the universe. I cannot wait to continue on and see how this loving family of chosen members saves the world. Thank you so much!\"Ages past, the Sons and Daughters of Goedric had fallen, and their once noble creed was trapped in time, drifting like a ripple across an endless sea with no hope of shore.In the remote mountains of Mexico, a great grey-wolf raises its muzzle and curls back his lips to taste the air. The scent of blood stings his palette, and he howls into ancient winds as they paint the mists with death. The winds were born on the battlefield, in a time long past. They saw the Great Purge of King Yoshiyahu. They witnessed the atrocities that were committed in the name of Yahweh, and they moaned in anguish as the blood of the Disciples of Goedric muddied the ground.As the winds remembered the horrors of centuries past, they whispered a single name, Etan, and they called to the Guardians of the Blood to protect the Living Alpha.For the first time in twenty-seven hundred years the Disciples of Goedric could once again sense the SoulFire of God coursing through their veins... and as men who yearn for men, and Women who yearn for Women they know their calling. The second dawn of Man's hope was in peril and fate itself trembled as the universe prepared itself for a future fighting to be born.

Jeffrey Jude has spun a tale rooted in historical facts that will grip your soul and inspire your imagination\"--GayNovelists.com Reviews\"If I hadn’t had book two and three in my possession I could have been pushed clean off the edge of sanity... The characters in this story are three dimensional, well described and ‘real’ on every level. Each with unique emotions and reactions to the many high adrenaline situations that Jeffrey Jude throws them into. Even the wolves in this story have their own personalities!\"-- Top 2 Bottom Reviews\"I was going to try to write this review without using the word epic, but that's not going to happen. This book embodies the word epic as you would have described blockbuster classic movies. The locations are varied and well researched, the characters are diverse and compelling and the storyline whilst encompassing elements of fantasy/fiction also deals with very contemporary and relevant current affairs. Books can entertain, inform and hopefully enthrall the reader. Jeffrey Jude has accomplished all of this and more.\" -- Dyna Leake, G2Z Reviews\"Best gay themed fantasy I've read in years. Was totally enthralled by the narrative...\" Goodreads ReviewAbrazos a todosJeffrey Jude",
