  "description": "An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here.I’d fought to lead a normal life, despite being anything but. Until the night three monsters forced me to fight for survival instead. They turned a short walk through the woods into the road trip to Hell. The leader made me his, made me dread pleasure and relish pain. Made me want things I’d once feared. They wanted to break me, bleed me drop by drop. They picked the wrong witch.Author’s Note:The light at the bottom of this rabbit hole is tinted obsidian, and I put the characters in this story through the ringer. Not for the faint-hearted, this read explores the dark side of obsession, in all its forms. Adults only from this point. Strap in and buckle up. Keep your hands and feet inside the ride at all times. Because the teeth lurking ahead are razor sharp and the blood they seek might be yours. Please, do not attempt to exert your human morals on the fictional beasts you will meet. They'll just laugh while they rip you to shreds.",
