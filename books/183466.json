  "description": "She’s Caith Morningstar: bar owner, leather wearer, shoe worshipper, werewolf, Orlando’s resident ass kicker and… Satan’s niece.In the tween—between On High and Hell—Caith has three rules: order, secrecy, and if you can’t manage that at least have a little discretion. Wait, make that four: no one screws with Caith or her stuff. Orlando—land of that famous mouse—is her home and people are either gonna get in line or get the fuc- heck out.Except someone didn’t get that memo. Or, they have a death wish. Either way, she’s gonna bust out her bat and smash some heads. She’s got zombies demolishing her home, vamps chasing her, and on top of the normal violence in her life, she’s quickly falling for an angel. Satan’s niece and a goody-two-shoes angel! And don’t even get her started on corralling her five fathers while trying to keep them from interfering with her life.Caith can handle the blood, gore, and frustration, but can she deal with the pain of loving the angel Samkiel? Probably not, but she’s gonna try anyway.",
