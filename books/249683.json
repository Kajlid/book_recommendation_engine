  "description": "Front-word, Back-word, Lessons on Writing the Novel Lurking Inside You from Start to Finish Every day, people sit down in front of a blank computer screen or piece of paper and start to write their own version of the Great American Novel. Many never get beyond \"Once upon a time....\" Their stories remain stuck inside, where only they can hear them. That s because writing a book is easier said than done. Writing a good book is even harder. Why? Because novel writing is a skill that must be learned, just like a nurse must learn to take a patient s blood pressure, a pilot must learn how to fly, and a concert pianist must learn to read music. Based on her years of teaching writing workshops, author Smoky Trudeau has created a program of step-by-step lessons to teach you how to transform that story stuck inside you into good fiction. You'll learn winning techniques for starting your story and how to decide which character should tell it. You'll gather ideas for writing believable dialogue and developing characters readers will love and those they ll despise. You ll learn how to build tension, write an exciting climax scene, then gracefully bring your story to an end; and much, much more. Full of examples and exercises to help you hone your skills, Front-word, Back-word, Insight-Out is the must-read book for anyone who wants to unleash their inner author and free the stories lurking inside.",
