There’s just one problem. He falls in love with April Moxley, the daughter of a famous rock star and the most challenging woman of his life. Football means nothing to April. She’d rather spend her time volunteering at the Red Cross and helping others than go to a game. April has a broken past, full of pain and betrayal. No good has ever come from her dad’s fame. She wants nothing to do with it … or the fame Tallan is destined for himself. Their two worlds don’t work together, yet they can’t seem to stay away from each other.",
