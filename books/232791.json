  "description": "\"There's so much woman energy in this house, it feels like we're livin' in a Georgia O'Keefe paintin.'\"   Seeking safe harbor, Aunt Lea offers Annie shelter and peace of mind-she and her four children move in.   Despite his monstrous abuses, Annie longs for her husband to heal. Life lessons assault her: some comical, others tragic. Annie stumbles. Hard knocks and Aunt Lea encourage her to take a leap; then another, and another...  Meanwhile, stories of Aunt Lea's Aspergian son Beau grip and enliven, as strange behaviors of Lea's college-friend Lisi force Lea to confront her own vulnerability.   Tales of the va-j-j house will touch your soul and enlighten your spirit. As encouraging as heartbreaking, this novel depicts a family's trials in the face of near-impossible challenges.   Learning and growing together, love, laughter, and more than a few tears will enrich those who enter and read The Va-J-J-House.   \"You are welcome here...\" (From: The River's Voice.)  \"First-time-author Lance uses alternating perspectives to tell the story of Aunt Lea and her neice, Annie - two strong, complex women who suffer much in their quests for happiness... an intriguing, inspiring story... and the two characters at the center of her novel are compelling and winning...\"-Kirkus Reviews  \"Another focal character in The Va-J-J-House is Beau whose Aspergian-naivete thrusts him into perilous predicaments. As Beau is forced to find creative solutions, he prevails with grace and dignity. A must-read for autistic adults, their families and friends, as well as women and men of strength and purpose.\"   -Debra Muzikar, The Art of Autism: Shifting Perceptions, www.the-art-of-autism.com",
