  "description": "In Earth's dim future the Dark Empire had grown more powerful - so powerful that it threatened to destroy even the well-protected province of the Kamarg. Only the ancient crystal machine of the wraith folk could save the Kamarg's people by warping them into another dimension. But Dorian Hawkmoon knew that such a sanctuary was but an illusion. Though his destiny was still ruled by the Runestaff, he was fated to don sword and armor once again...to find himself in a strange, unfriendly land, battling new and powerful enemies. This, the third in the Runestaff fantasy novels, is complete in itself and has been newly revised and specially authorized by Michael Moorcock.",
