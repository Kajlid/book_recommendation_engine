  "description": "A ROSE\nMarjory Macpherson felt rebirth at hand. She'd known fifteen years of winter since her parents' brutal murder at the hands of the rival Cameron clan. But now Ewen—the enemy son she'd been forced to marry—was dead, perished in a rockslide. Marjory rejoiced. She could shed her thorns...at least, until her husband's father returned.\nIS A ROSE\nYet, was her husband dead? When Marjory went to retrieve Ewen's body, she found instead a living breathing man, covered in blood, talking strangely but very much alive.\nBY ANY OTHER NAME\nThough he wore her husband's face and kilt, Marjory recognized salvation. Whether he was a kinder Ewen or another who, as he claimed, had been transplanted from the future, the man she'd found was the key, a strange twist of fate that reseeded Marjory's future. It was finally time for Crannag Mhór to bloom again: a rebirth that brought with it the promise of true love.",
