  "description": "It's the 2070s. The United States is no longer united, and the breakaway territory of Cascadia in the Pacific Northwest has created its own myths and realities. In this sequel to the first METAtropolis anthology (2008), six award-winning science-fiction writers share a brash, finely detailed world in which economic collapse, genetic experimentation, and battles over the environment loom large. Each narrator is a recognizable Star Trek series alumnus.",
