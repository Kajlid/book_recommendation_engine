  "description": "Tyrel Uvieras, a bodyguard serving the Union of planetary governments, has been assigned his most interesting charge Verithe Jerrith, Union's ambassador to what might be the most cursed planet in the galaxy. Something distinctly unsavory surrounds Corrina, whose first contact with Union space came through the stolen equipment of a stranded spaceship. Yet, Union policy requires an answer to the Corrinans' request for negotiations. The best they can do is send a well-prepared diplomatic party—if it's possible to prepare for what they find on the planet's surface.Tyrel and Verithe discover a mutual attraction, though Tyrel also thinks Verithe perhaps too lighthearted given their dire mission and certainly too gentle—like a thornless rose—to survive long in a dangerous world without protection. Tyrel tries to provide that protection, but the two men are captured in what is just the beginning of their descent into barbarity and treachery. They will be called upon to make unbelievable sacrifices and confront the \"curse\" of Corrina that brings out people's darkest desires, endangering sanity and soul. Even their feelings for each other might not give them the strength to endure.",
