  "description": "A M/M Humiliation Play Romance. Christopher can’t help that he looks so innocent but has such dirty fantasies—and even if he could, he wouldn’t want to. He might not have any actual experience with humiliation or guys in general, but he knows what he wants. Ethan. He just has no intention of going after him.  Ethan has done his best to be careful around his painfully shy college roommate. He might think Christopher is cute and a little awkward, but that doesn’t mean he wants to make him uncomfortable. But when a college assignment takes a naughty turn and outs Christopher’s dirty desires, Ethan has to decide if he’s willing to take a chance and give Christopher the humiliation he desperately longs for.  Christopher might think his fantasies should stay hidden in the darkness, but Ethan knows it will just take the right person to show him how beautiful and freeing they can be.   53k words Story Contains: M/m sexual content, spanking, exhibitionism, consensual humiliation play, and BDSM elements.   Author’s Note: This is a sweeter version of humiliation play. It is completely consensual and both main characters are enthusiastic about their desires. The heat level is higher than some of my other books, but it is very much a romance at heart. Each book in the series will be a standalone story.",
