  "description": "Callie Jennings reels from her pa’s demand that she marry his friend, a man older than him. Her heart belongs to her soldier hero, Zach. Pa won’t change his mind, and Callie has nowhere else to go. Then her sister, Louisa, proposes a shocking alternative. Zach Pearson still hears his pa’s scornful word—quitter. He’s determined to make something of himself as a soldier. He’ll serve the Confederacy until they win the war. If they win the war. Callie and Louisa disguise themselves as soldiers and muster into the Confederate army in the fall of 1864. Times are tough and getting tougher for their Confederacy. For Callie, shooting anyone, especially former countrymen, is out of the question—until truth and love and honor come together on the battlefield.",
