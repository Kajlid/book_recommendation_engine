  "description": "There are secrets only known to Sea Kings, and memories so dark they are buried deep within the earth...  For fans of Firefly and Dr. Who comes a quirky intergalactic adventure about a Maid from Mir.  Ana doesn't look forward to another wedding season with its blaring reminders that she's a freak who will always be alone. Thanks to a couple of pesky recessive genes that show up every few generations, she's gifted telepathically and marked from birth for a life of chastity and service as a Maid. Ana is just one of the galaxies misfits that leave their homes in hopes of acceptance into the Alliance Academy. Unfortunately, the nearest Academy is located in Fraternity City, a space station orbiting the water world of Mir. Controlled by clones intent on creating a master race, and filled with sinners of every sort, Fraternity City is rumored to be cursed. Will a dark history be repeated?",
