  "description": "Manor of Sweet Souls is the oldest entrance between earth and Faerie in the eastern US. Today’s its birthday and it deserves a celebration! But this entrance was created none too sweetly, and someone has to pay. As guardian of the entrances between worlds, it’s up to Gladys to keep everyone in line. Even if it means making enemies of her own.But when old wounds are brought to light, making things right won’t be easy. Gladys does her job with a style and finesse that only a troll in a swanky black dress could bring. But as lines blur between wrong and right, it’s hard to tell which side she’s on—and who will have her back when it’s done.",
