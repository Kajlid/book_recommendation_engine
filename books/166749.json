  "description": "Sparkling with magic, warmth and charm, this is the first book in the Philippa Fisher series from bestselling Emily Windsnap author Liz Kessler - full of friendship and fairies. Eleven-year-old Philippa Fisher is not happy. She's picked on at school, her parents are embarrassing, and worst of all, her best friend has just moved away. But it seems Philippa's luck is about to change when Daisy, the new girl at school, reveals that she is Philippa's fairy godmother - or godsister, since they are the same age. Daisy has been assigned to help Philippa by granting her three wishes. Unfortunately, Daisy is not too fond of working with humans, and she can't wait to get her mission over with. But as every wish seems to make Philippa's life worse rather than better, can the two girls team up to fix Philippa's world before it's too late? A traditional story in a thoroughly contemporary setting, PHILIPPA FISHER'S FAIRY GODSISTER touches on friendship, luck, finding out what you really want, and learning to handle the cards you are dealt.",
