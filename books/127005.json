In Love Is Relative, Danny and Emily fought for their love despite the insurmountable obstacles standing in their way. But just when it seemed like everything they had ever wanted was finally within reach, Danny destroyed it all with one rash decision. For Danny and Emily, loving each other should have been easy. After all, they had been doing it for their entire lives. But as their past has proved, things are never easy, and being left behind is the hardest thing Emily has ever had to endure. But she is doing everything she can to hold the fragile Donovans together, without Danny, and despite the constant pain in her heart. When Danny comes home to her he is proving to be more than her heart and her body can handle. But before she gets what she wants, Emily needs to know that all of the people she loves have everything they want. When life outside of each otherâ€™s arms begins to slip through the cracks, the resulting tragedy may be enough to destroy everything that Danny and Emily have fought so hard to build. Will Danny and Emily find a way to love, despite their lives? Or will their past and present afflictions prove to be more than they can overcome? Find out in Love Is Absolute, coming in February 12th, 2014.",
