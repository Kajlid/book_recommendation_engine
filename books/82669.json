Upon the ship, Rachel mourns the loss of her life on land, marred by the betrayal of those who were supposed to love her most. She adapts to her new, dangerous life and all its adventures, including swordfights, vengeful pirates, a trip to the New World and a handsome first mate who threatens to steal something she'd thought too broken to ever give again.",
