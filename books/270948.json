  "description": "I thought I was having a breakdown; turns out, it was a breakthrough.In 2014, I wanted out of my story. I didn’t want to be on this earth anymore. Bombarded by uninvited memories of childhood trauma, I questioned why God would allow so many horrible things to happen to me.When God interrupted my pleas for help with a simple question—“Will you trust Me with your story?”—I agreed to step out of my stage-perfect Christian life and into the journey toward healing and finally seeing Him as a good, loving God.",
