When Healy High star quarterback, Brandon Fitzsimmons, dies in a car crash, it was because he was sexting with Alice. Ask anybody.Rumor has it Alice Franklin is a slut.

In this remarkable debut novel, four Healy High students tell all they \"know\" about Aliceâ€”and in doing so reveal their own secrets and motivations, painting a raw look at the realities of teen life. But in this novel from Jennifer Mathieu, exactly what is the truth about Alice? In the end there's only one person to Alice herself.",
