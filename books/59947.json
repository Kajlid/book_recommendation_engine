  "description": "Coming out of suspended animation one by one, the survivors of a global disaster must try to make sense of the world they live in now. When they're newlyborn, they have no memory of the lives they left behind. As they awaken, they remember parts of the lives they lived before the disaster, discover what they can contribute, and become full members of the tribe.But sometimes they don't awaken. Those are the soulless ones. So the Elders say.Jelena has been unawakened for seven years--long past the time she should have. Her protector, Michael, does not complain, but she knows that she is just another burden to him. Everything she does, from befriending the wolves that terrify the rest of the tribe to challenging the decrees the Elders lay down, puts her in conflict with the tribe--and thus with Michael.Jelena and Michael must find a way beyond custom and fear to live--and love--as equals.Sensuality Level: Behind Closed Doors",
