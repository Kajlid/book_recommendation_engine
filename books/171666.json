It chronicles the real-life conflict between television newsman Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph McCarthy. With a desire to report the facts and enlighten the public, Murrow and his dedicated staff—headed by his producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) and Joe Wershba (Robert Downey Jr.) in the CBS newsroom—defy corporate and sponsorship pressures and examine the lies and scare-mongering tactics perpetrated by McCarthy during his communist \"witch hunts.\" A very public feud develops when the Senator responds by accusing the anchor of being a communist. Despite the climate of fear and reprisal, the CBS crew carries on, and their tenacity eventually pays off when McCarthy is brought before the Senate and his lies and bullying tactics are finally uncovered.In a format similar to the Newmarket Press books on Hotel Rwanda and Kinsey , this in-depth companion delves into the history behind the acclaimed film. In addition to the complete screenplay by George Clooney and Grant Heslov, this informative volume features historical materials and articles, original contributions from the actual figures featured in the film (Joe and Shirley Wershba, Milo Radulovich and others), and an exclusive Q&A with the screenwriters Clooney and Heslov. 40 b/w photos.",
