  "description": "Sabine ‘Snow’ Goubert grew up thinking that all families were like hers. She had a mother who’d abandoned her for the sake of her political career, and a father who’d taught her that deception was love. Then she meets the operatives of Shadow Elite and is drawn into a team that would give her the family and values she craved. Finding out she shares a niece with the cold and ruthless Judge Alexander is a blessing and a curse.As a highly respected judge, Sebastian Alexander has it all—a niece he adores, a job he loves, and more money than he’ll ever be able to spend. But his handsome façade and perfect life hides a terrible secret. Appointed guardian of his six-year-old niece when her mother dies, he vows to uncover the truth about her death and the lies told by the people who should have loved her. When he hires a beautiful nanny to take care of his charge, he thinks his life will get easier, but with every look that passes between him and his new employee, he knows the need to possess her and see if she tastes as good as she looks is a losing battle.As she goes undercover to get to know her niece, she soon realises that the truth is never simple, and Sebastian isn’t as evil as she thought he was. Instead, he’s a sexy devil she can’t resist. As secrets and lies are exposed and people start to die around them, the only way for them to face the past is to confront the present and have the courage to rush headlong into the future.",
