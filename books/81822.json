  "description": "Far above a magical land, an enormous pumpkin flies across a bright sky with five-year-old Owen and his three-year-old brother, Oliver, riding on top. The two boys hang on tightly and laugh with pure joy as the beauty and wonders of the land below nurture their innocence and their imaginations. Even so, there is a darkness that threatens to extinguish the light of their childhood. Although they enjoy the home they have created in a cozy and shadowless cave, the boys miss their parents and long for a way back to them. Every night, the pumpkin sits motionless outside the entrance to the cave, keeping the boys safe from harm, but the pumpkin cannot protect Owen and Oliver from all danger. Shadow eyes wait in the darkness, and other creatures even more deadly. When the boys are torn from the pumpkin's safety, they must find strength and courage in their love for each other if they are to survive and find their way back home. This poignant fantasy tale explores the bond of love between two young brothers as they take an enchanted journey through the extraordinary miracle of childhood, through its hardships and fears, its discoveries and triumphs, its vulnerability and its resiliency. With only each other to depend on, the brothers must find their way through the darkness, and back to the light.",
