  "description": "Chelsea, a second-year student at Yale University, thought she had it all. A caring mother, a guy who was crazy about her, and some pretty decent grades. How much better could it get? When boyfriend John gathers the nerve to propose, the answer should have been obvious. Instead, she freezes up, asking for time to think it over. Before she can give her answer, Chelsea is snatched off the street. Trapped in a dark cell and tortured, only the inspiring memory of her mother's words keep her from giving into despair. Now, she's determined to find some way out of her living hell to be reunited with the love of her life once again.",
