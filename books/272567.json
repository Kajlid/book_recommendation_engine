  "description": "A refreshing look into a little girl's humorous outlook on life, her Christian perspective, and the customs and social mores of nineteenth-century America. It contains a collection of essays of a child's experiences at a religious boarding school at the turn of the century. Guaranteed to make the reader LAUGH! With qualities similar to Eloise and Dennis the Menace, Virginia Cary Hudson was only ten when she wrote these essays for her teacher at the Episcopal boarding school she was attending in 1904. This humorous collection (over 1 million sold) of small-town Americana is a modern-day classic that celebrates the honesty and charm of a child's turn-of-the century world. On Everlasting Most of the things you get somebody dies so you can get it. But, you have to die your own self to get everlasting life. On Etiquette is what you're doing or saying when people are looking or listening. What you are thinking is your own business. These naively commentaries of school, church etiquette, and everlasting life are both a child's honest impressions that become hilarious when read by adults.",
