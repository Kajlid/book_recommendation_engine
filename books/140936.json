Since his family disintegrated a decade ago, Jake has kept his heart safely ensconced within the protective walls he's erected. Determined to live out his life alone and free of the burden of love, Jake's world is turned upside down when the grief of a woman he hardly knows calls him to step out of his comfort zone.

Devastated by loss after loss, Marnie is left a shell of her former self.

Marnie finds she must place her trust in a quirky stranger and his three-legged dog. Desperate to reach out to the only stability in her life-Jake-but paralyzed by pain, she struggles to pick up the shattered pieces of hope. Marnie wonders if she will ever learn to live or love-again. One year. One apartment. Two strangers, each wrapped in their own personal turmoil. Can Jake and Marnie overcome the obstacles before them and find love despite the odds?",
