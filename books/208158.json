  "description": "I don't see dead people. I see you. I see every incarnation of you. I see the history of your soul.I can see your aura soaked in the blood of your previous lives.Most people are inherently good or evil.Some flit between darkness and light. Few can change the fabric of their essence; it's a fight that most are too weak to win.He was once darkness. An evil so pure that his very soul is black and yet I am drawn to him like a moth to a flame.Some days, I feel like I am drowning, the waves of my feelings stealing the very air from my lungs.Other days, I feel nothing at all.I'm unsure which is worse; gasping for air or dying from this thirst.Can you learn to breathe underwater when you find someone worth drowning for? Feyness is a dark standalone.Readers of a sensitive disposition may want to step away from the book. Step away, nothing to see here.Readers who like to dance on the dark side, come on in and enjoy the ride.",
