Annie has resolved to do her best for grieving mother Martha Martin and keep the sordid details of her son Terry’s life hidden, but when conflicting stories around Terry’s last days surface, Annie is quickly entangled in a web of rumor and deceit. Pretence and distortion have become accepted as integrity and truth—but who is a fraud and who is an innocent victim? Annie desperately needs a third case on her books to secure her future, but when it arrives, her future career is the last thing on her mind. Not only has Annie herself walked into a trap but she has also led a young girl into mortal danger. Can she make things right before it’s too late?",
