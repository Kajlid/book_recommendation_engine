But she still finds time to pursue her her small but increasingly successful business, baking individually designed cakes for the parties and celebrations of her neighbours and their friends. As a businesswoman, Angel prides herself on behaving professionally at all times, even when faced by awkward situations, ethical dilemmas and her own undignified menopausal hot flashes.

And, finally, she comes to accept how much that is true of her too...",
