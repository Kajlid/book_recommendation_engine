  "description": "As a veterinarian Sydney Linden knows cats and dogs, but she has unfortunate gaps in her expertise when it comes to men. Her elderly friend Mae decides Syd should get together with Ben, the new Shady Haven Park manager, and gives her a gentle shove in that direction, but before Syd can quite get her balance back, Mae dies unexpectedly. Mae's nephew Eddie, who happens to be in town looking for a loan to repay gambling debts, has his own problems. He's being tailed by a mismatched pair of enforcers sent by his bookie and, although he has fierce hopes that he knows where his conveniently deceased aunt has hidden a fortune, he can't get to it. For reasons that Eddie can't comprehend, the animals in Shady Haven keep ruthlessly interrupting him. Then Syd, who has her suspicions about Mae's death, gets creative in dangerous ways that may lead to the downfall of both men... in very different directions. The human characters and events in The Ruthlessness of Cats and Dogs are fictional. Any resemblance to actual events, et cetera. The animal characters however, are based accurately on dogs and cats that the author has known personally. In some cases the names have been changed to protect the questionably innocent.",
