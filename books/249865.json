  "title": "Misheard Lyrics",
  "description": "Misheard Lyrics is an irreverent and often hilarious novel about misheard lyrics, religion, messiahs, friendship, and the nature of the universe. Charles, an agnostic newspaper columnist and struggling novelist, and Chip, a jovial minister who swears like a sailor and runs a Haitian United Methodist church in Miami, discuss Charles’ various attempts at writing a book about messiahs. The pair’s wide-ranging topics include the origin of religion, faith vs. science, dogma, evil, magic, existentialism, the end of the world, the meaning of swearing, masturbation, astrophysics’ discoveries about the Universe, post-traumatic stress disorder, gay marriage, and whether we’re all really just living in a computer simulation.The book includes several false-start chapters as Chip tries to write his novel. The two friends discuss these chapters as well as some incendiary newspaper and online posts Charles writes.",
