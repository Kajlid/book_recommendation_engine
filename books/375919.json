  "description": "When we are young, we all hope that even if we are not totally hip, we are not completely unhip. With age, we begin to realise that we have had more than a few embarrassing moments and tastes and, maybe more to our surprise, we don't really care. There are days when we are unhip and proud of it. Part social commentary, part autobiography, here are some of KJ Rigby's confessions.",
