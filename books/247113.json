  "description": "A Note from Dr. Cameron West... First of all, for those of you who have read First Person Plural, thank you. Rikki, Kyle, and I have been very moved by the kind words many of you have sent, and for the stories some of you have shared about overcoming your own challenges.I'd like to share something with you that Leonardo da Vinci wrote, which I think of as \"Leonardo's Rule.\" He said, \"Every object yields to effort.\" I remind myself of that every day, and when I'm having a difficult time, Rikki reminds me that this rule applies not only to the obstacles \"out there,\" but to the more important ones-the ones we face in our own minds. Rikki lives by Leonardo's Rule; it comes to her naturally. Even though they are Leonardo's words, it is Rikki's actions that guide me and inspire me to work toward becoming a healthier and better person.",
