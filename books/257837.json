  "description": "He's a brooding cowboy in need of a wife. She's a virgin stripper who might just fit the bill... Her stage name is Buttercup, and she's coming home with me. She needs to buckle up, because I'm about to throw her over my shoulder and breed a baby in her belly.  My ex drove her out of town, but I'm going to haul her ass back. Two years later, Buttercup is back, and she's sweeter than ever... With a little surprise who has my smile and my eyes. I'm not buying her bullshit, I know Noah's my son. And she's my woman - always has been.  I'm going to take my family back, one way or another. Whatever it takes, I'm getting my happily ever after.  Buckle Up, Buttercup is a steamy novella about a sexy-as-hell ripped cowboy and his innocent virgin who just happens to be a stripper. If you like alpha men, not-so-accidental secret babies and sweet-as-pie love makin', you've found your perfect read. Written by USA Today bestselling author Isabella Starling.",
