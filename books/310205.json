  "description": "A coming-of-age romance about love, loss, heartbreak, hope, and the labels that don’t define us.Star pitcher. Town golden boy. Heartbreaker. Nemesis.Caleb Winters was a familiar name long before he deigned Landry High with his presence. It took me all of ten seconds to determine he’s everything I’m not: charismatic, captivating, and celebrated. Unlike most of Landry, he doesn’t shy away from my messy background. Or pretend I don’t exist. He answers my caustic remarks with choice retorts of his own. Our notorious bickering aside, I don’t have time for the town golden boy. I have actual problems. Challenges. Crushing responsibilities. But when I’m suddenly forced to spend more time with him, I unexpectedly discover Caleb Winters might be more than just the entitled jock I’ve sparred with since freshman year. And that realization can only end badly. For me. Because everyone knows he’s destined for big, impressive things, and I’m… not.",
