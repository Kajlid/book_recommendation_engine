  "description": "Don’t look. Don’t touch.  Those were the rules.  It took one heartbeat to fall in love with my best friend’s little sister. One more to know I could never, ever let it show. So I broke her heart and left her behind to go to war.  She wasn’t supposed to walk back into the wreckage of my life.  Now my Sunny is all grown up. All woman. She has eyes like liquid heat, curves that beg for my hands, and a mouth that’s hungry for mine.  I shouldn’t look. I shouldn’t touch.  But the rules are no match for one hot, reckless kiss. And this time, I’m not walking away.",
