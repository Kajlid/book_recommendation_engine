  "title": "Business Storytelling Guide: Creating business presentations using storytelling techniques",
  "description": "Have you ever wondered why business presentations are so boring? Wouldn’t it be great if presentations were as captivating as a good story or movie? We asked that question many years ago and found that the key to improving business presentations was storytelling. This book shows how to use Joseph Campbell’s “Hero’s Journey” story structure to create captivating and compelling business presentations. The audience is the hero, you are the mentor, and the goal is to defeat the shadow. In business terms, this means creating an audience-centric presentation that is meaningful and compelling. Use the techniques provided in the Business Storytelling Guide to keep your audiences on the edge of their seats.",
