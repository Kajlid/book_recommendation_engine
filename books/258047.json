  "description": "This is an alternate cover edition of ASIN: B0106QTOAO. The original cover edition is  here.Tequila Key is just like any other small town and I'm just like any other small town psychic. Scratch that. Tequila Key is a world onto itself and some people might think that I am one crayon short of the box.  And, if we're being totally honest, Tequila Key is just like any other small town â€“ if that town boasts a voodoo priestess and a few white witches for flavor. Turquoise blue water and the best margaritas this side of Mexico make it hard to leave.  I'm Althea Rose, co-owner of Luna Rose Potions & Tarot Shop, and I've just stumbled into a love triangle while trying to save my best friend from being accused of murder.  See? Just like any other small town.",
