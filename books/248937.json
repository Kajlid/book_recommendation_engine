  "description": "Reverse HaremWhen an orbital prison is torn through a wormhole and crashes on an unknown planet, it's every woman for herself to escape the wreckage.As though savage beasts and harsh, alien climates aren't enough, the survivors discover the world isn't uninhabited and must face new challenges—risking not only their lives but their hearts.  DEJA thought she could fear nothing more than the daily treatments she received during her imprisonment on the Concord. The horrible experiments which rack her body with unimaginable, searing pain. But she discovers the true meaning of terror as she clings to life pod’s harness while plummeting toward the surface of an unknown planet.  Struggling to outrun the beasts hunting her, fighting to outrun the light, Deja hastens for the only cover she can find — between the feet of a giant stone statue. Only statues aren’t supposed to move, or wrap you in their arms and carry you off INTO SHADOW…  Welcome to Sonhadra.  The Valos of Sonhadra series is the shared vision of nine sci-fi and fantasy romance authors. Each book is a standalone, containing its own Happy Ever After, and can be read in any order.",
