  "description": "Jaden Thorne is living the dream. Well, not exactly the dream, but her dream—if you call working sixteen-hour days in a hot kitchen a dream, which she does. She’s the executive chef at the hottest new restaurant in Miami Beach, and she’s worked her ass off to get there. When her boss suddenly falls ill, she’s gifted two tickets to the premiere food and wine event of the season. Jaden jumps at the opportunity to network, and with her best friend, Tasha, in tow, she’s soon on a road trip to Sarasota, Florida, for the Winemaker’s Dinner—and a good time. No Reservations is a short-story prequel to the highly anticipated fictionalized erotic romance The Winemaker’s Dinner: Appetizers by co-authors Dr. Ivan Rusilko and Everly Drummond. No Reservations is an introduction to the romantic heroine in the series, Jaden Thorne, and is written by erotic romance author Everly Drummond. The Winemaker’s Dinner: Appetizers will be released July 31, 2012.",
