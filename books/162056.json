  "description": "Spring is just a few weeks away, but winter is still digging its claws into tiny Moosetookalook, Maine. Even business at the Scottish Emporium has frozen up, so Liss MacCrimmon is cautiously optimistic when a twist of fate lands her on a reality competition show--until the contest gets a little too cutthroat. . .Driving on an icy road on a truly dark and stormy night, Liss swerves her car when something darts out in front of it. She braves the weather and discovers a Scottish terrier shivering in the snow. Relieved that the dog survived their run-in, Liss sets out in search of her owner, unaware that the Scottie is actually a tiny celebrity--or that she was dognapped.Liss soon sniffs out the pup's owner, a well-heeled woman named Deidre Amendole, who is ecstatic to be reunited with her furry friend. Deidre and her Dancing Doggies recently won Variety Live, and the trio is slated to appear in the reality show's \"champion of champions\" competition. But for Deidre, the contest is over before it's begun when she turns up dead. . .Deidre's daughter asks Liss to help find out what happened to her mother--and to take Deidre's place on the upcoming show. Before Liss can tell her she's barking up the wrong tree, she finds herself ensnarled in the strange world of reality competitions and hot on the trail of a deadly dognapper. And just as she starts pawing at the truth, Liss realizes she could be next on the murderer's list. . .",
