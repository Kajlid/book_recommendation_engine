  "description": "Cover Blurb:In a near future alternate history, America has split. Sovereign security companies compete in the booming Arizona Zone.Evie retired as an anti-terrorist detective sergeant and emigrated to escape from Britain. Who is hunting her for revenge?Evie hires Sam Harper, from Sharper Security, to protect her. Who is her mysterious attacker, plotting from a distance?How will Sam defeat the soldiers, intrigue and legal maneuvers of his competitors to capture Evie's nemesis and deliver justice for what really happened in Paris 18 years ago? Answers involving forgiveness and redemption are revealed during a week of mystery, intrigue, technology, heroes, villains, action and adventure in the Sonoran desert.Oh, and humor. The book definitely has humor. Also some interesting characters. I especially like.... well, just go read the book.The book has elements of action, adventure, mystery and suspense in the tradition of Tom Clancy, Robert Ludlum, and Louis L'Amour. It's set a couple of decades into the near-future with a liberty view of society based on individual choice and free market economics, taken to enough of an extreme to make you consider what's really possible. In terms of Science Fiction, it's always difficult to predict the future, but the technology in the book is stuff we currently know how to make that is possible to become common in the next few decades, but isn't really available right now.",
