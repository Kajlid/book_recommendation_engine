  "description": "Zack Hartley is just a man.He has a simple job, working in a candle store in a mostly empty mall, a roommate to help make the ends meet, and the ability to walk magical lines that take him places instantly.He also has a split personality that thinks he might be a homosexual, and a few pesky demons hanging around far too much for his liking.So when there's a sudden attack at a different mall, Zack is asked to help sort things out, which is where the fun really begins.Because it seems that some people have taken it into their heads to think that he, the humble candle man, is a demon too. In fact, some of them are banking on it.That means no end of trouble, if he can't get it sorted out fast.Possibly even a war.No one sane wants that. Even Zack doesn't, and he hasn't claimed to be in his right mind in a long, long time.",
