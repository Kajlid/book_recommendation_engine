Discretion is of the utmost importance. Special conditions apply.When Sarah Larsen finds the notice, posted on creamy card stock in her building's lobby, one glance at the exclusive address tells her she's found her ticket out of a life of long hours waiting tables for little pay.At the interview, the job seems like a dream come a glamorous penthouse apartment on the Upper West Side; a salary that adds several zeroes to her current income; the beautiful, worldly mother of her charge, who feels more like a friend than a potential boss. She's overjoyed when they offer her the position, signing the NDA without a second thought. These are important people, after all--they can't be too careful about who they hire.In retrospect, the notice in her lobby was less an engraved invitation than a waving red flag. For there is something very strange about the Bird family. Why does the beautiful Mrs. Bird never leave the apartment alone? And what happened to the nanny before her, who disappeared under mysterious circumstances? It soon becomes clear that the odd behaviors Sarah initially dismissed as the eccentricities of the wealthy are hiding something much darker and more sinister. But by then it's too late for Sarah to seek help--she's become complicit in their secrets. And, after all, discretion is of the utmost importance.",
