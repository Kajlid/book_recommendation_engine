  "title": "Haunted IV",
  "description": "Although written in first person, this fourth volume of Haunted is a recounting of ghostly encounters from several of my friends. As with the other volumes, all stories are believed to be 100% true. Each story teller has been carefully questioned about any and all details pertaining to the story they had to tell. Unlike the other three volumes, there are no sweet little blue girls, or protective entities to be found among these frightening tales of diabolical occurrences. This is an adult read. Please read prior to sharing with anyone under the age of 18.",
