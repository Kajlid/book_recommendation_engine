  "description": "In these eight masterpieces there is no room for the smallest sign of stumbling or youthful undertones: they are perfect. These stories that speak about objects and daily happenings, pass over to another dimension, one of nightmare or revelation. In each text, surprise and uneasiness are ingredients added to the indescribable pleasure of its reading. These stories may upset readers due to a very rare characteristic in literature: They stare at us as if waiting for something in return. After reading these true classics, our opinion of the world cannot remain the same.1. \"Casa Tomada\" (\"House Taken Over\")2. \" Carta a una señorita en París\" (Letter to a Young Lady in Paris\")3. \"Lejana\" (\"The Distances\")4. \"Ómnibus\" (\"Omnibus\")5. \"Cefalea\" (\"Headache\")6. \"Circe\" (\"Circe\")7. \"Las puertas del cielo\" (\"The Gates of Heaven\")8. \"Bestiario\" (\"Bestiary\")",
