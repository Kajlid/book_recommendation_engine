  "description": "Joe has been cursed. He must meet with Yahweh, the Creator, once a week for coffee and listen to God complain. Yahweh is a crotchety old deity with a pantheon of family problems. His wife, Frigga, has basically stopped talking to Him, except to nag Him about retiring. His son, Jesus, suffers from crippling depression. Oh, and Jesus' estranged wife is planning a terrorist attack to start a holy war. God is fed up with all the drama. He's perfectly tired and infinitely irritable. Though God doesn't seem to care about human problems, Joe's little, mortal life isn't perfect, either. In fact, it's a comedy as black as God's coffee.",
