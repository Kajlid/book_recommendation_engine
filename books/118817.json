  "title": "The Story of Doctor Dolittle",
  "description": "Doctor John Dolittle is the central character of a series of children's books by Hugh Lofting starting with the 1920 The Story of Doctor Dolittle. He is a doctor who shuns human patients in favour of animals, with whom he can speak in their own languages. He later becomes a naturalist, using his abilities to speak with animals to better understand nature and the history of the world.* This e-book is a true representation, hand-transcribed from a high-definition scan of a pre-1923 print version of the book. Unlike other e-copies of the book, it was not produced by using Optical Character Recognizion (OCR). OCR-scanning old books is seldom, if ever, error-free. This often results in an e-book with many **, ^^, >> and typographic errors when OCR can't read the word or punctuation correctly.* \"True representation\" means that if the print version has any inscriptions or previous owner's name in the front of the book, this e-book might as well. Blank pages that often separate chapters might be left in. And pages that may have a folded corner or other, similar damage might be included, too.* In other words, no changes or as few as possible have been made to either the illustrations or the text in order to bring you an e-book that is as close to the original as possible. If it was a printed book, it would have about 208 pages.",
