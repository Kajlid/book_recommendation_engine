  "description": "\"A quietly surprising and unexpectedly satisfying conclusion.\" -PUBLISHERS WEEKLY Truth cannot remain entombed forever. Only long enough. . . Returning to the Vale after six years at university, Linhare is thrust into the long-standing grudges and precarious alliances that maintain her realm. But there is more to this balance of peace and prosperity than political intrigue. Ambition. Secrets. And a terrible deed, glossed over by history--a deed, recorded in a scarred, red journal, that should have remained forever secret. Wait's secret. Dakhonne warrior and living legend, Wait has shadowed Linhare all her life. Unearthing his past was an accident; keeping it to herself was not. As she wrestles with her duty to return it, and the need to know all, the journal vanishes, heralding a spiral of betrayal and dark magic that casts Linhare into a world of bolleys and Dr√ºmbul Lords, of gobbets and ghasty-haints. A world where the Dakhan have not been seen in a thousand years-until Wait falls into Fae to pursue her, bringing with him hope, love, and more truth than she can bear.",
