Is she back behind the Iron Curtain? Or has she too been murdered?The entire household gets involved in solving the mystery, dashing around the city that is their new home, and discovering, in the end, the bonds of love and friendship they have brought with them from San Francisco, across the Atlantic Ocean, and to La Ville-Lumière— The City of Light.And that's only the beginning...",
