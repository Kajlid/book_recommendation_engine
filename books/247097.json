  "description": "Honesty. He wanted it. He craved it. He could barely remember what it was.   When Garth's uncle comes to visit, he's like a breath of very needed fresh air. Mike is laid-back and relaxedâ€”and willing to accept Garth for who he is, without question. For the first time in a long while, Garth feels like he's around someone who understands him. But before long Garth is helping Mike with some pretty mysterious things and finds himself keeping secrets from everyone around him. He's forced to wonder: Is his uncle Mike really who he says he is, and can Garth trust him? More importantly, can Garth trust the person he's becoming? P. E. Ryan has crafted a clever and compelling novel that asks the question: How far will you go for your family, to find yourself?",
