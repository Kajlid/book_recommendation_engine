In this Sinful Share, romance author Mandi B, serves up the love story of a hot couple forced to keep their sexy romance a secret.  And why a secret? Because office relationships are a hard limit at Sanderson Global where David is CEO and Amy an on-the-rise department head.  But if he’s CEO, what’s the big deal, right?  Figure in a domineering mother, a pot-stirring aunt, a loyal sibling who keeps her brother’s secret, a reporter sensing an exclusive, and the surprise addition of a Greek judge, for a story that delivers from page one!  With every ending comes a new beginning.  Hidden – Sex With No Apologies",
