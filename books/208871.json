  "description": "Life has always been pretty easy on me. I wake up every morning, drink too much coffee, log in a few hours of work, relax and then start the process all over again the next day.  Like I said, easy.  Of course, like everyone, life has been known to throw me the occasional curve ball - just a little something to remind me not to get too comfortable. Because once you get to that point, where things have fallen into a routine of complacency, that Son of a Bitch called life comes back with a vengeance; ready to send his size 13 up your ass.  That’s exactly what happened to me the day that Alex Paige came back into my life.  He was different than the last time I saw him. Maybe he’d lost some weight or gotten taller– I wasn’t sure. All I knew was that something fundamental had shifted in Alex during the six months that he’d been away and I felt the compulsive need to find out what it was. Unfortunately, that task was far more unattainable than it seemed. Why, you ask? The answer is simple. Alex just got a divorce.  From my sister.",
