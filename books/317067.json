  "description": "Gothic Horror meets Splatterpunk in this chilling and unsettling tale. Young, puritanical and fastidious William Roxby is hired at the Earl Exenchester’s house, after the sudden disappearance of the previous footman. What seems like a dream job fast becomes a descent into mania when he learns that the family’s teenage son, Francis, is being barbarously abused by his cunning but psychotic governor... and no one believes it but him. Inspired by the unsettling works of the Marquis de Sade, this riveting yarn of the 18th century depicts a nightmarish London filled with perversion, deviancy, murder, and a psychotic love as only erAto can write. Not for the faint of heart, STEPS OF THE MALEFACTOR is the bloody adventure that fans of twisted horror have been awaiting. A prequel to The Virgin and the Bull, William’s behavior echoes the love triangles that Francis Exenchester will later live to endure.",
