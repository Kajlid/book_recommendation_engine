  "description": "Welcome to Intrepid. Where Halloween brings tourists, turning leaves - and demons.  Over two decades of bloody murder, Steven Savonarola carved a sorcerous Demongate into the heart of his own hometown. With less than two weeks to disarm it before Halloween, Detective Church and the IPD are running out of time.  Lucky for them, they have an edge: Myrrh, a hell-raider with over a thousand years’ experience shattering dark magic, and Aidan, a half-demon fire mage with a very personal grudge against evil.  The plan is simple: Find the tainted sites. Purify them. Try not to die. They’ll need all the help they can get. Steven may be gone, but shadows in the mountains are determined to see the Demongate open - even if they have to slaughter half the city to do it. And when it comes to killing shadows, even hell-raiders don’t know everything.  If they’re going to make it to All Saint’s Day, they’re going to need hot lead, cold mead, and a weapon that’s out of this world.  And a little praying wouldn’t hurt....  Welcome to Intrepid. It's a hell of a Halloween. -------- Like A Net of Dawn and Bones, Seeds of Blood covers more of what I wish I could find in urban fantasies on the shelf. Lone heroes holding back the dark makes fun reading, but if society as a whole has to deal with magic and monsters? There would be laws. There would be training for law enforcement. There would be some interesting discussions on how to properly restrain supernatural suspects. The ACLU would stick their oar in. The politics would be a nightmare....  I suspect our heroes will prefer dealing with the monsters. At least they can shoot the monsters. ...If they can demonstrate it’s self defense. Or in defense of others. Thank god for cameras.",
