  "title": "A Nose For Trouble",
  "description": "The big tawny dog named Smoky refused to hunt with the pack, so old Bill Tolliver gave the 'no-good hound' to Tom Rainse, the new Game Warden. Tom discovered that Smoky's keen bloodhound nose tracked men, not animals, and soon he was hot on the trail of a ring of poachers whose mysterious leader was called 'Black Elk.' These illegal hunters swore they'd kill anyone who got in their way, and now Warden Tom had a special partner who could smell trouble coming. Would this tough mountain man and his fighting hound be able to stop the dangerous Black Elk gang? Or would the gentle elk, deer, and beaver disappear forever from this beautiful wild land?",
