  "description": "The last thing Vince Fowler wanted to do was volunteer at Serenity Nursing Home. But with a locker-room brawl on his record, and forty hours of community service to fulfill, he had no choice. There, Vince met Jacob Fitts, a former raft guide who was full of far-fetched anecdotes. Vince doesn't believe the stories, but the more he heard, the more he wondered if there might be some truth behind the fantasy. No matter what wild tales the old man might cook up, guardian angels aren't real. Are they? An inspirational story for the young, the old and all of those in-between.",
