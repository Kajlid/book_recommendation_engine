  "title": "The Raft: Three Men, 34 Days, and a Thousand Miles Adrift",
  "description": "The Raft recounts the harrowing adventures of three downed US Navy airmen in the Pacific Ocean during World War Two. The men, forced to ditch their plane after running out of fuel, were then confined to a 4 foot by 8 foot rubber raft for 34 days at sea, with no food or water (apart from what they could catch or trap), and no protection from the relentless tropical sun and the long nights. Their story is a powerful testament of courage and leadership under extreme conditions, and has been an inspiration for generations of readers.",
