  "description": "Sari and Jess are best friends and total opposites. They've liked each other ever since they discovered that they are the only two normal people at Eldridge Alternative. As they prepare to face the trials of ninth grade, Sari is psyched. Jess, not so much. How can she face the Prada Mafia, the most evil clique at school? Or Mr. McGuiness's unnervingly long nose hair? What if something really interesting happens to Sari and nothing whatsoever happens to Jess? Not even Jess can predict the mayhem when Sari falls madly, psychotically in love with David Cole. David is a senior. David is cool. And he's been dating Thea Melendez for forever. So he can't possibly be interested in Sari. Or can he? Now Jess has a new worry. Because if David is interested in Sari, Sari may not be interested in being Jess's best friend anymore. Cool is cool and geek is geek, and at Eldridge, the two definitely do not mix.",
