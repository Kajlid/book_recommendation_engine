  "description": "San Francisco lies under a cloud of radioactive dust. The World War has killed millions, driving entire species to extinction and sending mankind off-planet. Those who remained coveted any living creature, and for people who couldn’t afford one, companies built incredibly realistic fakes: horses, birds, cats, sheep . . . even humans. Rick Deckard is an officially sanctioned bounty hunter tasked to find six rogue androids—they’re machines, but look, sound, and think like humans—clever, and most of all, dangerous humans.[Philip K. Dick’s award-winning Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? served as the basis for the film BLADE RUNNER. BOOM! Studios presents the complete novel transplanted into the comic book medium, mixing all-new panel-to-panel continuity with the actual text from the novel in an innovative, ground-breaking 24-issue maxi-series.]",
