Jump to the far future of 2015 and nosh on some dehydrated pizza. Things might get a little greasy in Biff s alternative, dystopian 1985, but the hardy frontier food of 1885 will keep you going through shoot-outs, train robberies, and whatever else the Wild West has to throw at you.Featuring full-color photography, alternative ingredient suggestions, and helpful notes from some of your favorite characters (Hi, Doc!), this time-hopping, genre-defying cookbook is the perfect gift for foodies, home cooks, and Back to the Future fans of all ages!",
