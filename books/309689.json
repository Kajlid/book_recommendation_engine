  "description": "A child of the Dublin slums who brought hope to Vietnamese street children: Christina Noble's childhood was a catalogue of deprivation and abuse. Her mother's death split the family part and her alcoholic father was unable to cope. She was sexually abused and escaped an orphanage for destitution on the streets of Dublin. Years later, overworked and dealing with a violent husband, Christina realised she needed a dream. Drawing on her own experiences, she reached out to the swarms of children on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City. Within two years 'Mama Tina' had set up a Medical and Social Centre and achieved world-wide renown. Christina's is one of the bravest, most astonishing stories ever told.",
