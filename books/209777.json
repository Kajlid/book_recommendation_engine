  "description": "When a whoring, violent drunk loses everything—his job, his wife, his kids, and his home—his violence quickly intensifies into a frenzied vengeful rage. Far beyond rationality, his energies become focused on killing prostitutes. When a college graduate winds up with a job on the city's newspaper writing obituaries, it doesn't take him long to spot an opportunity. In order to draw near to those closest to the murders, he takes a part-time job as a cook at a diner where the victimized hookers hung out. Unexpectedly, the journalist falls in love with one of the prostitutes, turning his world upside-down. When Johnny Blade takes this particular streetwalker for a ride, it is the journalist who must save her life.",
