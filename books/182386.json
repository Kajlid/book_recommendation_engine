  "title": "Taking What's Mine",
  "description": "Alone at night in the middle of nowhere. The town sheriff pulls me over. I should be safe.  I'm not.  Nothing could have prepared me for what he had planned. And my darkest desires should have remained a secret. But it seems he knows everything about me.  I'm his now, and only I will do.  Warning: This book contains situations involving forced submission and dubious consent. The hero is obsessed beyond control. Nothing can stop him from being the only woman he'll ever have. These themes are triggers for some but sweet candy for others. If you're willing to hold off judgment until the last page the ending is worth it, I promise.",
