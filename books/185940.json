  "description": "I’m your fantasy. The man you want in your bed, the lover you’ll masturbate over long after I’ve gone, and the dream that leaves your panties wet making you crave just one more touch. Tonight I can be yours. It won’t mean anything except hot, pounding, mind blowing sex, but you don’t care. Each breath you catch, every moan you let slip, I pull you deeper into my world of lust. I want to serve you, maybe dinner or if you’re lucky something more fulfilling. Walk through these doors and reality slips away. This is my playground. So tell me. Are you ready for a HUNK?Dane – Book 1 of HUNKS: Behind every hunk is a story. How much will you risk to go all the way?",
