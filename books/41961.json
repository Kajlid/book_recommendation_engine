  "description": "A combination of Princess Diana and Kim Kardashian, the bejeweled Maharani of Kapurthala, Princess Brinda Devi lived a whirlwind life in Europe even as she struggled with the demands of marriage and motherhood at home. A brilliant study of contrasts, Princess Brindaâ€™s story revels in the luxuries of 1920s India but does not look away from the rickety shacks of its most destitute. All while she searches for true love.",
