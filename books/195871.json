  "description": "Number 9, Charles Street has a habit of catching on fire. Twice it burned down, taking with it the people inside. When a bag of bones falls on twelve-year old Julia, she finds herself thrown into the spirit realm with the house's past residents. Her new neighbors aren't so lively, and some can't even remember their own names. But as Julia discovers, there’s more to these people than meets the eye. Something's been cut from the town’s records, and whoever did it will kill to cover their tracks.",
