  "description": "The Brethren. Who are they and why are they here? Discover the origins of these enigmatic angels manifested on Earth for millennia. Lose yourself in their compelling stories of human salvation and triumph over Evil.**This is an anthology of three short urban fantasy stories that were originally part of an online serial. It is meant to be a companion to the Brethren series, and not necessarily a stand alone, but can be read as such. It brings us closer to three of the nine Brethren, Gabriel, Nathanael, and Cassiel- who they are and what they do. There are more stories to come. There is no romance here, but plenty of hot-blooded angel!",
