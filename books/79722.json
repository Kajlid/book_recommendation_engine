  "description": "It's the end of the world as we know it, so forget about feeling fine. Things are going out with a bang and a lot of whimpering in these thirteen tales of the end of days. Where can we turn for help? Gods and goddesses, wizards and warlocks, the fey folk, heroes, assassins, federal agents or even outer space? No, we turn to International best-selling author Keith DeCandido, award winning authors Patrick Thomas, John French, KT Pinto and those visionary masters of the craft - Roy Mauritsen, Edward J. McFadden, Hildy Silverman, David Summers, Robert Waters - as they stand side by side with newcomers Samantha Mills, Matt Schianti, Briana Vandenbroek, Jordan Pettit and lead the charge into the final battles to prevent total annihilation and save us all.",
