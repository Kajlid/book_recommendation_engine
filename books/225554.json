  "description": "Book Six of the bestselling Fallen Immortals series**START with KISS OF A DRAGON (Book 1)**Leonidas is a Dragon Prince of the House of Smoke… and he is cursed. Falling in love was never in the cards for Leonidas. An angry witch made sure of that—if he loses his heart, he loses his life. But the treaty guaranteeing peace will die with him, unless he wins the True Love of a woman and she bears him a dragonling. When a fiery red-headed witch comes along with plans of her own, five hundred years of guarding his heart and opening his bed might not be enough to protect him. Because Love is Magic… and the fate of the mortal and immortal worlds depends on Rosalyn and Leonidas not only opening their hearts, but surviving a Love that’s True… The FALLEN IMMORTALS series is a modern Beauty and the Beast story with flaming HOT dragon shifters, vengeful Dark Fae, and beguiling fallen angels.THE FALLEN IMMORTALS SERIESLucian and ArabellaKiss of a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 1)  Heart of a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 2) Fire of a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 3) Leonidas and Rosalyn Chosen by a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 4)Seduced by a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 5) Touched by a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 6)Leksander and ErelahLoved by a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 7)Marked by a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 8)Claimed by a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 9)Of Bards and Witches: Leonidas's Story (Fallen Immortals 10)",
