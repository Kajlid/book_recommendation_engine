  "description": "With a narrative that grips the reader like a detective story, Antonia Fraser brings the characters and events of the Gunpowder Plot to life. Dramatically recreating the conditions and motives that surrounded the fateful night of 5 November 1605, she unravels the tangled web of religion and politics that spawned the plot.\"Told with impressive scholarship and panache¿ The result is a narrative that is clear, balanced, and builds to its denouement with a sense of pace and tension worthy of a John le Carré novel\". - John Adamson, Sunday Telegraph",
