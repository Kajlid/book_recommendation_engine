Devastated, she began crisscrossing the globe, finding rare and spectacular birds that brought her to the heights of spiritual ecstasy. But as it turned out, she beat the cancer.

Life List is a powerful portrait of a woman who found refuge from society’s expectations in a dangerous and soul-stirring obsession.",
