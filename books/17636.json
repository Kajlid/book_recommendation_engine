  "description": "\"When a cop escorted a handcuffed prisoner into the roadside diner, reporter Kelsey Merrill was intrigued. And when she discovered that the convict being transferred to the state penitentiary was none other than the notorious Benton Carlyle, she knew she had a chance to get the hottest scoop of her career. One moment Ben was fending off a nosy female journalist. The next a tornado ripped into the diner, bringing chaos, destruction--and a chance for escape. With Kelsey as his hostage, he fled into the mountains, free at last. Ben swore he wouldn't hurt her, and he swore that he was innocent. Kelsey knew better than to believe a murderer, but something in Ben's eyes made her want to help him--before it was too late\"--P. [2] of cover.",
