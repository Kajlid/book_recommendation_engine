  "description": "The Timestream is at least six known versions of Planet Earth arranged in hexagonal fashion. Each has different histories and societies, some different geologies, but all share the same physical laws and chronology. At critical historical points on one of the planets, crucial decisions result in two Earths with the same prior history but differing subsequent ones. Major events on neighbouring planets in the Timestream affect each other strongly...James IV, High King of Ireland and the worlds he rules, is deposed at the height of the Three Worlds' War in 1941. Banned from the throne by his corrupt nobles for sixty years, he struggles to survive and maintain the Pax Hibernia (Ireland's enforced peace over the planet) despite clan MacCarthy's genocidal high-tech schemes. Characters struggle with religious and political loyalties as all are drawn into Greater Hibernia's intrigues. Romance and tragedy converge on the stage in remote Edwardstown, launching reborn lives and new hopes.",
