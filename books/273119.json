  "description": "ABOUT THIS EPISODE  \"I'm sorry.\"  A stage play turns into high drama when the leading man's mutilated body takes center stage--and the remorseful note pinned to his chest is Malcolm and Seong-Jae's only clue to finding the killer. What should be a simple case is complicated by secrets and lies; as more and more of Seong-Jae's past surfaces, every deflection and careful half-truth builds the walls between partners-turned-lovers higher still.  When Malcolm and Seong-Jae can no longer see eye to eye...will the closing act of their story turn into a tragedy?",
