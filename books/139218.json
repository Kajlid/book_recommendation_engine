  "description": "SUITABLE FOR 15+ Tezzi's Point of View: Just the Beginning  Trolls... We've all heard the stories. The childhood tales forever imbedded in our minds. Tezzi is no different. She would sit in bed night after night as her mother told her of the trolls. The tales of the Dark Woods are keeping her up at night. And she dreams of a lush dark place only in fairy tales. Her heart pounds and her feet want to take flight. She feels her mind running. Running towards a fantasy, running towards adventure, running towards something she's only dreamed about.",
