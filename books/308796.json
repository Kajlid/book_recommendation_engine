  "description": "Heightened Desires is part of Kristen Proby's With Me in Seattle UniverseMarcel Lafitte runs one of the largest broadcasting networks in Seattle. He has to make decisions in a matter of seconds. His need for control continues in both the bedroom and at the high-end BDSM club Temptation. He plays but never commits, but in Portland on assignment, he meets the very young and alluring Molly O'Hennessey. He's taken with her right away, sharing one incredible night together. Molly O'Hennessey lives life on the run. She's a dedicated teacher, but her mantra—work hard, play harder. On one of her evenings out on the town, she comes across a silver fox—but just not a silver fox, but a Frenchman to boot. She can't say no to a drink, and she certainly doesn't say no to a night she'll never forget. And when he dominates her in the bedroom, she's never felt so free to be herself. She learns her silver fox is from Seattle and doesn't hesitate to use the excuse of visiting her famous football player brother to spend more time with the Frenchman fox who occupies her mind. Marcel soon introduces her to his prestigious club and his lifestyle. Molly becomes captivated by everything Marcel teachers her. Feelings begin to develop, and both are thrown off their axis because this is supposed to be about sex, not about falling in love.",
