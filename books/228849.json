  "description": "Sophia's life is about to take a hard left off a high cliff. Again.  After spending a lifetime hiding her magic, Sophia is now practicing her arts with the most dangerous person she could possibly be involved with. Adam Pierce is a man with pretty eyes and heartwarming words... who just happens to be closely associated with the very people who cry for Fireborns like Sophia to be executed.  Adam doesn't know the truth about Sophia's past. Come to think of it, neither does she. Being public enemy number one used to be her biggest problem. Now, the monster who took her as a child is back in play, and hiding in plain sight is the least of her worries.  When two women are murdered, both connected to someone important to her, Sophia learns that the upheaval of her world is just beginning. And if she continues to keep everyone she cares for at arm's length, her friends may not be the only ones paying the price.  Smoke and Magic is the second book in the Touched By Magic: Dragon urban fantasy series.  This book features strong heroines and a powerful hero, perfect for fans of Linsey Hall, Ella Summers, and Jasmine Walt.",
