  "title": "Butterflies and Jellybeans - A Love Story",
  "description": "A lightning strike brings two people together. That is the start point of this tale of love, some brotherly deception, and a grandmother's hidden secret. It is an 'old fashioned' love story simply written with just a couple of added ingredients, like a gambling habit gone beyond any sane limit, like a paradoxical misread of situational occurrences by two star-crossed lovers. There is pathos, a heart-breaking sadness, a poignancy that will linger in the heart. In the end, it will take a death, a fateful dust storm, and a dazed desert wandering to bring the story to an end point all readers desire --- that 'old fashioned' happy ending. Read and enjoy.",
