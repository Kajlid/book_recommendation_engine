  "title": "Neptune Noir: Unauthorized Investigations into Veronica Mars",
  "description": "Veronica Mars has won the hearts of a small but devoted fanbase drawn to Veronica’s class-torn hometown, where the high school landscape echoes adult patterns of power and privilege, and your best bet for justice is a teenage girl and her private detective father. The show is so snarky, so smart, and so savvy, that the detective show’s biggest mystery is why more people aren’t watching.This collection of essays on the show’s first two seasons explores the noir roots of Veronica’s blond locks, and the sharp writing and killer plot twists that have catapulted Veronica Mars to the top of smart viewers’ must-watch lists.",
