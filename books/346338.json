  "title": "I'm A Girl",
  "description": "Tomboy Jenna woke up one morning at the end of her senior year in high school and declared, “I’m a girl!” Something inside her clicked and, for the first time, she wanted to embrace and explore all things feminine. Her mother, thrilled with Jenna’s newfound sense of womanhood, provided her with a skirt to wear to school—it had to be a skirt! Jenna insisted! Her blossoming femininity was almost immediately squelched, however, first by an incident at school, and then, in an even more horrifying incident in her own home. When her twin brother, Jimmie, returned to find his sister broken and violated, he knew he would do anything to help her. But how far will Jimmie really go? Will he be able to go to the lengths his sister says she needs? And together, will they be able to find their way through the horror, pain and heartache, back to a place of healing and even love?",
