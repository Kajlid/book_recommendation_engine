  "title": "FOX TALK: How Some Very Special Animals Helped Scientists Understand Communication",
  "description": "ABOUT THE BOOKWhen you talk to a dog, does the dog talk back?Many people think so. But for a long time, scientists didn't know how our furry friends learned to communicate with people.Luckily, Russian scientist Dmitri Belyaev had a plan. If he could tame wild red foxes, he could learn how dogs first came from wolves. By studying the way these foxes changed during domestication, the mystery of communication would be solved at a last.More than 50 years after the experiment began, Belyaev’s foxes have become so tame, you can have one as a pet! Packed with eye-popping photos and first-hand research, FOX TALK reveals the story of these amazing animals… and everything they've taught us about wolves, dogs, and communication.Fun Facts- Dr. Carmichael first heard about domestic foxes in 1999, when she read an article by Lyudmila Trut, a scientist with the project. Her first thought was “I want one!” Having the chance to write Fox Talk was the next best thing.- In February 2013, Dr. Carmichael got to meet some domestic foxes living at \"Featuring Animals\" in Florida. Stories and photos from that day appear in the book.- Fox fur is rough on top, but very soft underneath. They smell better than dogs.",
