But for Gervase, the focus, and challenge, remains the frankly spoken children. However, the new school year doesn't get off to the best start after a teacher intimates that Gervase has let him and his school down. So when he is called up in front of his new boss, the formidable Miss de la Mare, Gervase fears he is going to be in hot water. To add to his woes, he is given another 'little job' by the Chief Education Officer, which inevitably means liaising with the infuriating and interfering Mrs Savage - the bain of the inspectors' lives. Meanwhile, away from the pressure of school, Gervase's life with wife Christine and their new baby son, is blissful - until an assortment of noises in the attic start to disturb their nights...",
