  "description": "“Yes, of I am a cat…”With those words we begin to see the world through the eyes of the Timeslider Cat—a super-intelligent, telepathic, time-traveling feline with a scientist’s interest in the human race. And through the Cat’s eyes unfolds the story of Renata Beaumanoir, a beautiful young college teacher with many of the problems common to young college teachers, and one big one that’s not so Renata is a vampire.Renata is able to hide her vampire nature with injections of thanadoxicil, a substance created by the mysterious Doctor—a powerful vampire somehow connected to Renata’s past life. How? Renata doesn’t know—the endless, empty reaches of eternity have degraded Renata’s ability to remember her past, just as happens to all immortal creatures. But when Renata is confronted by the Vampire Council and its vicious assassins, the Cat realizes that only a furious effort to reclaim such memories by timesliding into the past centuries of Renata’s life will suffice to rescue Renata from a peculiarly horrible end…With locales ranging across the centuries from a small college town in North Carolina to the plague-ridden battlefields of the Middle Ages, TIMESLIDER is a sometimes whimsical, sometimes violent, but always intelligent and entertaining romp across time and space. It’s an adventure, as well as a meditation on the meaning of immortality, memory, history and friendship—all told in the opinionated, snarky, sometimes infuriating voice of the Timeslider Cat.",
