  "description": "Close your eyes and think of a phrase that describes the most horrible act that you can imagine. Search for that phrase on the internet, and a website called Amity will be in the top of the list. The regulars at Amity can help you learn about that horrible thing. If you desire, can help you find it. Or help you do it. Reclusive neckbeard Timothy Berbee has exiled himself from the world, and spends his time to huddled with the reckless population of Amity. When they turn their collective poison on him, his life turns into a battle to reconnect with his lost humanity, and a race against his own apathy to save the life of a stranger. In a satirical whirlwind story based on real-world events, AMITY explores the allure of online lives and the downward spiral when absolute anonymity overrides one's moral compass.",
