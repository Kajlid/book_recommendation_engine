  "description": "Not seeing what isn't there—-can kill you. Either a dead madman is haunting her, or Kendra is going insane. With her little girl sharing her peril, Kendra must choose between realities, but how can she decide? Her life has always depended on family and friends. Will the same hold true for fighting the impossible—-a ghost? Or will Kendra’s indecision get them all killed? As Kendra summons courage to make her choice, only one thing is certain. Not seeing what isn't there—-can kill you. The perfect \"Halloween horror\" read for older teens and adults! (Vapor contains incidental violence. I recommend other parents read Vapor before letting children 12 or younger read it, although I would have let my kids read it at that age.)",
