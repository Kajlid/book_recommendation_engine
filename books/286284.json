  "description": "Two adventure-seeking survivalists, Cadence and Jackson, attempt to rekindle their romantic connection after completing a wild and grueling twenty-seven-day survival challenge in Madagascar. The chemistry between the two perfectly-matched former teammates that developed while surviving in extreme conditions, continues to grow as they assimilate back into their normal routines without each other. For Cadence, the distance from Jackson only enhances her desire to be closer to him, and see him face-to-face. But, Jackson remains elusive, even as their popularity on social media skyrockets once their episode of the survival show airs and the hashtag #JacksonandCadence goes viral with new fans from all over the world encouraging their romantic coupling. During an out-of-state business trip to Arizona, Cadence makes a surprise visit to Jackson’s house and discovers there’s more to the man she considered to be her true soulmate, exposing the secrets he consciously kept from her during their intense month-long journey surviving together. Unable to stand behind his facade, Jackson has two choices to make – admit the truth of his alternative lifestyle or risk losing Cadence forever.",
