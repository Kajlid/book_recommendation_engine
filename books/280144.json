  "title": "Little Red Dot",
  "description": "Little Red Dot travels the world to capture people as they deal with violence, war, loss, fear and love. There is an aging mother on Flight 370, a World War I British veteran remembering a soccer game with the Germans during a Christmas lull in the fighting, a Liberian mother watching a girls soccer game in the United States, a portrait of a long marriage told through works of art. The search for self is never-ending and doesn’t always look pretty. There’s plenty of fear, cowardice and depression on the road to self-awareness.",
