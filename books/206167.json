  "description": "Will smiled and said “What is written across my face? I have the guilt of a Catholic, the shame of a Jew, and the scruples of a whore?”Will Turner is almost thirty with no career goal. New to Atlanta, he quickly discovers he’s not the only gay man focused on sex instead of work. Lunchtime sex is always an option in men’s rooms on lower floors of the office tower he works in. Will’s friend Kevin is already up to speed on a maze of nighttime sex. Kevin fuels Will’s fascination for the gritty side and guides him through an exploration of dark back rooms and sex clubs - not where you’d think you’d fall in love. Will feels a spark that sets a fire and now he can’t stay away from Greg. Greg knows the mazes like the back of his hand. He knows Will like the back of his hand, always a step ahead. TRASH is a story about a naïve person who wants to fall in love, but instead breaks a piece of himself as he trails an obsession through underground sex clubs in 1990's Atlanta.",
