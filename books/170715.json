  "description": "“We are two halves of the same soul – we are one. Despite the demons of our past, the simple fact of it all is that, when push comes to shove, you can’t fight fate. Fate is the mother of all things twisted and dire. She’s the bearer of pain and wrong, but in the wake of such devastations, her talent finds a way bloom something beautiful.”To every action, there is a reaction. To every high, there is a low, because what goes up must eventually come down.Nova has been home for nearly two months, dying inside, as her soul struggles to continue living life without Calix – her husband, her lover, her captor. With the help of her sister, Nova finds a way to escape the rescuing clutches of her father to return to Calix. Through all the damage done, and all the horrors stripped to stand exposed, can the wrongs enacted become right? Can the monster lurking beneath Calix’s very handsome skin remain dormant – or will that monster ruin all the beauty thriving – in a moment of fear. When life hangs in the balance and our true nature is tested, will instinct prevail over compassion? And can forgiveness exist for a future when the past is tainted with bloodshed? ***This novel does NOT end in a cliffhanger! It is intended for audiences 18 years of age and older due to subject matter.***",
