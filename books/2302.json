  "description": "From the pages of the multiple award-winning SANDMAN series...A beautiful angel with an ancient score to settle puts out a contract on Lucifer Morningstar. But can the devil really die?Alerted by an attack on his Los Angeles piano bar, Lucifer follows a trail that leads him from the mercurial realm of the Dreaming to the luminous streets of Beijing. It's here that the Morningstar must fight his most difficult battle--of body and spirit--as he falls into the jaws of a trap that doesn't even exist until it's sprung. And a young widow becomes the trigger of a diabolical weapon aimed at Lucifer's heart--and the bullet is nirvana.Deftly written by Eisner-award winning writer Mike Carey (Lucifer, Hellblazer) and exquisitely painted by Eisner-award winning painter Jon J. Muth (Moonshadow, The Mystery Play), LUCIFER: NIRVANA features special guest appearances by Lucifer's masked accomplice, Mazikeen, and Daniel, the new Sandman.",
