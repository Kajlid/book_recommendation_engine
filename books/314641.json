  "description": "There was a fine line between love and hate, and the line was fading fast.\n\n\n\nI was a rule breaker by nature but not when it came to women. Especially the one who lived to drive me crazy.Mindy Clark’s fiery temper matched her red hair. Going toe to toe with her to get a reaction had become my favorite pastime. The more fired up she got, the more I wanted to know what sounds she’d make for me between the sheets.When she asked for my help with watching our godson for two weeks, I reluctantly agreed. But two weeks to drive her as crazy as her curves drove me? I was in. As the insults flew, so did the chemistry. The problem with chemistry? It would either create magic or chaos. And I wasn’t sure what I’d get if I finally gave in to what was building between us. But temptation was hard for someone like me to avoid, even if my heart was on the line. \n\n\nThis small-town enemies-to-lovers romance with a stubborn, cocky playboy and a feisty, outspoken badass is packed with so much banter, drama, and heat, it will melt your kindle.",
