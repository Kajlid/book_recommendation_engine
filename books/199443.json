  "description": "When seventeen-year-old Eriah Collingwood gets recruited into the Melange – the governing division of America – not only does he free himself from the limitations of the camps, but he also sets out to save his father’s life with a dangerous quest to retrieve the elixir of life. During the challenging integration process, Eriah struggles to work alongside his fellow recruits, discovering an expanding conflict when he finds himself involved in an overwhelming case that might solve the mystery behind the loss of his childhood memories. As the integration advances, he experiences the ultimate test: controlling the sinister device that he was implanted with at ten years old - it threatens to dismantle his entire plan. Some of the consequences of the decisions that follow might be disastrous enough to unfold his apparently imperfect life.",
