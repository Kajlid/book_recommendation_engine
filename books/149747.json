  "description": "In a world where monsters are running rampant, demons are emerging from the underworld to stake their claim and distinguishing friend from foe is nearly impossible. A few brave humans will embark on a quest to save their home. Some will volunteer for the cause, while others will be forced into it. Accused of crimes he didn't commit, Torhan is manipulated into joining the fight while proving his innocence. On a journey where danger waits at every turn, Torhan must rely not only on his skill with a blade, but will need to utilize every ounce of his resourcefulness if he is to survive long enough to clear his name.",
