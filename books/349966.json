  "description": "Once there was a race of beings not of angels and not of man.... A cross-breed between the divine and the mortal, known as the Nephilim. Some adapted and moved on to become as gods among men, scattered over the continents by the floods intended to kill them, to create varying forms of divinity in their image. One in particular, Nemesis, began the Immortal War - the bloodiest war in human history. Nemesis and his wife Lamia were imprisoned in an attempt to end the war. For twenty years Nemesis has waited for release.... Soon, Nemesis will get his wish. THE TOWER is the final book in the Immortal War trilogy.",
