And she’s not alone. Kane kidnapped Page as well, in order to ensure Reagan is on her best behavior.With little hope that the Parkers will be able to find them, Reagan must face her kidnapper and his crazy mother alone. Despair sets in and then turns to desperation when Kane’s confusing behavior calls to some secret part of her. Not only does she have to protect Page from the Allen family, but now her own heart, as well. Kane promises they are safe, even if they are isolated. But is anyone truly safe during a Zombie Apocalypse?",
