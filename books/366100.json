  "title": "Their Last Suppers: Legends of History and Their Final Meals",
  "description": "A journey through over 2000 years of culinary history and the final repasts of famous figures—with recipes included.Part historical narrative and part grilling guide and cookbook, Andrew Caldwell’s  Their Last Suppers  guides history buffs and gourmands alike through gastronomically inspired biographical accounts of more than twenty legendary personalities. Recipes are included (though the author has decided to skip the pork blood beverages drunk by the Spartans).Unearthing recipes as far back as 323 B.C., Caldwell, aka the History Chef, provides insight into two thousand years of culinary lore. Each historical figure’s profile includes a brief description of pursuits and accomplishments as well as little-known anecdotes, popular foods of his or her time period, recipes for the figure’s actual last meal, and cooking tips. Because the kitchens of Montezuma, Caesar, and other notables profiled within the book were often very basic, Caldwell brings their fare into modern kitchens, although he strongly believes that, whenever possible, grills and open fires should be used for most dishes and therefore provides specific preparation tips throughout.From the  Titanic ’s twelve-course tasting menu to personal recipes for Princess Diana’s Favorite Watercress Soup, Elvis Presley’s Fried Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich, Julius Caesar’s Ambrosia, Cleopatra’s Hummus, and Stone Crab a la Kennedy, historians and foodies alike will relish the trivia and tastings paired within this unique and entertaining book.",
