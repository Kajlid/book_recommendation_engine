  "title": "The Silver Child",
  "description": "Maia Starfield is on the run, having successfully hidden her ability to create silver just by singing—until government thugs arrived to take her away. Her mother sent her out the door just in time, giving her only one piece of advice: Find Dr. Martus.  Albert Martus has no idea why Maia was sent to find him—the doctor who delivered her 17 years ago. But from the moment she turns up, his story becomes intertwined with hers…as it has been since before she was born.  Follow this unlikely team as they discover the truth about the past and their present, the regime known as the Brotherhood, and the magical and ordinary power they each carry deep inside.   “Nancy Norbeck's THE SILVER CHILD shows us a fantasy world that is all too real, ruled by a modern Inquisition that seeks to control minds and wipe out history.  Maia, the Silver Child of the title, is a natural magician who has only the faintest awareness of her powers.  More important, she is alive, a vividly drawn teenage girl who must discover who she is in a time of terror.  The story is big, the characters both heroic and sweet.”  ~Rachel Pollack, World Fantasy Award and Arthur C. Clarke Award-winning novelist",
