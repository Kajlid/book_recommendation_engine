And when he left, she thought her life was over. But then, after the worst happened, she truly understood what that phrase meant. Now, he’s not ready for a second chance, and she’s not offering one. Though given that their families have been forced together after losing one of their own, she knows there’s no turning back. Not this time. Not again. Not when it comes to Cameron.Cameron Connolly never wanted to hurt Violet, but there were reasons he had to leave all those years ago—not that she'd believe him if he told her what they were. He not only left her, he also left his foster brothers. Honestly, Cam didn’t want to come back to Denver to help run his father’s failing brewery. But when it comes to his brothers, he knows he’ll find a way to make it work. Perhaps he’ll even earn Violet’s forgiveness and face the connection they both thought long forgotten in the process. Because he wanted her then, but now he knows he needs her. He just hope she needs me.",
