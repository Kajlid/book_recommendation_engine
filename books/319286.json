  "description": "\"An entrancing and cryptically told financial thriller, As Sure as Death and Taxes is far from your standard spy fiction. The bursts of action and streams of prose that are both matter-of-fact and creatively visceral will grip readers to the last page. Sterling balances authentic character development with timely subject matter and a unique storytelling style that makes this novel hum with contemporary tension.\" Self-Publishing Review, ★★★★",
