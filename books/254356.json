  "description": "What do you get when you mix an incubus bite with a vampire bite? A shitastrophe. All I wanted to do was go to a bar and drown my sorrows in some alcohol, but I had to get attacked by an incubus. Now I'm being guarded by a hunky but oh so irritating vampire (who bit me too) while the incubus stalks me.Being guarded by the sexy vampire probably wouldn't be that bad if not for the fact my perfect boss has finally noticed me. Try dating while a vampire guards you way too closely and an incubus tracks your every move, waiting to pounce.Then there's some creepy hunter guy who also wants to kill me.The sun wants to kill me.Human food wants to kill me.Don't even get me started on my family.Life sucks after you die.",
