  "description": "Country Trails and Tales is an easy read which offers the reader temporary escape from the anxieties of today's stressful world. Bits of history and humor are sprinkled into nostalgic tales creating a yearning for the reader to return to a simpler more treasured time. While reading one might find their heart's desire is to return to a time when water melons cooled in the edge of the creek's chilly waters as joyful children worked up an appetite while swimming. Memories of the sands cool grit between barefoot toes might summon back recollections of children walking along country roads in absolute leisure. Hayrides, kite flying, and baseball games being played in open fields enriched the stories included in this selection. Whatever the memory, the reader will not be disappointed with this calming nostalgic look back at yesteryear.",
