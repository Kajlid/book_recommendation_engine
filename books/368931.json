  "title": "The Ghosts of November: Memoirs of an Outsider Who Witnessed the Carnage at Jonestown, Guyana",
  "description": "This work represents the first book to be written by a participant in the clean-up operation of Jonestown. It is nonfiction horror written in its most descriptive form. The further you get into this book, the more horrified you will become. And, when you realize that the events you are reading about actually occurred, and could happen again, your concept of reality will take on a dark and sinister nature the normal person cannot comprehend. Jeffrey Brailey, the author, is extremely concerned about the proliferation of dangerous doomsday cults as we enter another millennium.",
