  "description": "In the summer of 1866, the separate bands of the Kiowa Nation gather at the sacred Rainy Mountain to elect a successor to Little Bluff, the recently deceased principal chief. Three men stand as candidates, each the chief of a major Kiowa band. When the nephew of one candidate is accused of killing the nephew of another, the nation finds itself divided; no matter how the council rules in the matter, one band is sure to declare war on the other.With only five days remaining before the ruling council issues their judgment, Tay-bodal, a healer, decides to learn the truth about the murder. Certain that the accused is not guilty, Tay-bodal must find compelling evidence proving the guilt of the actual murderer. If he succeeds, then war will be averted. But failure could easily mean the destruction of the Kiowa Nation.",
