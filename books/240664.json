  "description": "Echo  I’m a Doomsday Sinner. A biker to my very soul. Women have always been the same—interchangeable. Until her. She loves my control and craves my touch. Now she’s mine. I’ve claimed her in every way possible and I won’t let anything, least of all her, tear us apart.  Olivia  I was on the holiday of a lifetime, until I ended up stranded in Archer’s Creek. Then I met a badass, Harley riding biker boy who laughed at me. He’s a bloody pain in the arse. Bossy and controlling, he’s the unexpectedly perfect guy at the worst moment—because even the strongest love can falter when a crazed psycho decides I need to die.",
