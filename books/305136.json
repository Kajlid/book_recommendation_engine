  "description": "Stone Jacobs must…hate me.The tenuous bonds the four of us built could end with one split-second decision. Good versus bad. Old versus new. Loyalties will be tested when the truth spills like blood from a razor’s cut.Caught between high society and the homicidal reach of a well-known gang, finding my family’s treasure is our only hope. It’s the loose thread tying us all together in this hellacious game of hide and seek. But when betrayal rears its ugly head, one of the men who I’ve come to count as family might just slip out of my reach for good.Maybe that’s the real curse of the Wilders. It’s not losing our treasure. It’s never being able to hold on to the ones we love.This Fearless Girl is the second book in the Saint Clary's University series, an enemies-to-lovers reverse harem.",
