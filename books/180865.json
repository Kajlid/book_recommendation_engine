  "description": "~ Lust, greed, and revenge collide... ~Fate screwed Eden MacLaird at the age of twenty-one, stole her first love, then her first child. Twenty years later, she still hasn't found her happily-ever-after. Sure, from the outside, she appears to have it all, including Declan, her gorgeous, rich-as-sin husband. But things aren't what they seem, and catching Declan in bed with her best friend destroys any dreams she harbors for love, much less sexual fulfillment.Then in walks Sean Bennett...Just months away from earning his law degree, Sean's smart, driven, and serious, but an unexpected encounter between them in a bar one night changes everything. His best friend, Trinitee, warns against getting too involved, but the heat between them is beyond intense, and neither of them are willing to walk away.With Eden's marriage in shambles, she's eager to make a go of it with Sean, despite their sixteen-year age difference. But while she relishes her sexual reawakening, she fears giving up the posh life she's grown accustomed to. That life, however, and everything in it, comes crashing down as bodies start piling up around them, and all clues point to Eden and Sean.Secrets, betrayal, and revenge threaten to destroy not just her carefully-crafted reputation, but her very life. With their freedom at stake, Sean and Eden join forces to uncover those plotting against them. But as doubt and evidence mount, she must choose: give in to her suspicions and save herself, or trust their new-found love and save them both.Stirred is a 2016 Kindle Book Awards semi-finalist in Romance!",
