  "description": "The Killer Becomes The Hunted\nShe was gagged. Violated. Tortured. Nailing the killer is priority number one and only the best will do—that means Frank Quinn. And Quinn wouldn't want it any other way. Because he recognizes the victim. Years ago, as a homicide detective, he saved her young life. Now the hunt is on, and deep in his gut, Quinn welcomes it. He knows he's seeing the work of a truly twisted serial killer. Except it's not the ritual weapon that makes this killer so disturbing. It's who he kills—and how he makes them suffer. . .\"A Heart-Pounding Roller Coaster Of A Tale.\" —Jeffery Deaver on Night Victims\"A Page-Turner. . .Twisty, Creepy.\"—Publishers Weekly (starred review) on Mister X\"Lutz Is In Rare Form.\" —The New York Times Book Review on Chill of Night",
