  "description": "An epidemic hits the country, and Brooklyn Harper is stolen from the life she knew. Implanted in a rural camp, Brooklyn and her friends are severed from their families and the outside world. Each day is filled with combat training to assure their safety against a mysterious virus and the creatures it creates--violent humanoids with black blood. Two years later, Brooklyn's cabin-mate, Dawson Winters, finds a letter that shatters the illusion they've been living in. There is a world outside Camp Eleven, and the virus that supposedly destroyed their country seems non-existent. After a daring escape, Brooklyn finds the world they've left behind harbors the normalcy she remembers. But when they are attacked by a black-blooded creature in the city, Brooklyn and her friends realize there is more to Camp Eleven than they thought. Someone took them, someone trained them, and now someone is trying to find them. As their exploration continues, the group is faced with impossible feats while betrayal, love, and secrets force Brooklyn and her friends to fight for their life, their freedom, and most of all, each other.",
