  "description": "They say I’m troubled. They tell me I’m damaged. They ridicule me, point fingers at me, and send me away. Tory’s School for the Troubled is supposed to be my redemption. Instead, it’s my new hell.In this school, I’m surrounded by the broken and the hurt. The liars and the psychopaths. Everybody at this school is hiding behind a mask, including the professors. They say monsters roam the halls of this academy at night, and I think... I think they might be right. This is book one of a horror/bully reverse harem romance. It contains strong language and sexual situations. Reader’s discretion is advised. If you like your men a little broken and psychotic, your FMC a take-no-shit badass, and a plot that will leave you guessing until the very last page, then this book is for you.",
