  "title": "Why Diwali",
  "description": "I tried reading and looking for many books on Ramayana or Diwali for my very sensitive child. But somehow my child always ended up losing interest midway. The reasons were many – from scary images to the story being too focused on demons, battles, fighting, etc. Also, unlike a good toddler book which has smiling faces – the characters’ images almost always had a frown.A child needs to learn about our traditions, festivals but in a fun & happy way – this is the primary reason I thought of writing down the ‘Toddler Ramayana’ – with smiling faces, no violence & in which even Ravana and Shurpanakha are cute looking characters. This book focuses more on the positive values of all the characters – may it be Rama as an obedient son, loving brother, and a good human, Lakshmana as a ‘friend’ in brother, Sita as a strong woman & wife – even Ravana as a nice brother who tried to help Shurpanakha but of course in an incorrect way.",
