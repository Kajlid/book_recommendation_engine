  "description": "Rostenberg and Stern run a New York antiquarian book firm, and for half a century have specialized in books by and about minorities that mainstream collectors neglect. Here they identify and describe works that foreshadow later developments in a range of fields. Among them are blood transfusion, feminist militancy, world federation, the free press, relativity, and the Chunnel. They also include eyewitness accounts of historical events. Annotation c.
