Old and new friends, unexpected relatives, and dangerous enemies converge upon Solantha in the heat of high summer, and amongst them is Garrett Toring, the Federal Director of Security. With Fenris's mortal enemy sniffing around for potential threats, he must be more careful than ever to remain undetected. But time is running out...and Fenris and Mina may have to look in unexpected places for help if they are to win the day and make sure their friends make it to the altar safe and sound.",
