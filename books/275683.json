  "description": "On the face of it, the village in which Sparrow lives is as well-equipped, technologically, as any other in the modern world - there are telephones, televisions, calculators... The odd thing is, though, that no one knows what these machines are for. Even the old reilway line lies useless - and only Sparrow believes in the existence of aerplanes. Dragons, however, are another matter; Sparrow's friend Bull seems to know all about them, and other magic too, which gives him a sort of power over Sparrow and their red-headed companion Gogs. Then, one day on the mountain, Sparrow meets the strange, magical Puckel and his even stranger and more magical stick - and after that, for the three boys, nothing will ever be the same again.",
