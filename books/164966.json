  "title": "Unsafe Haven",
  "description": "“Sooner or later, you have to trust someone.”A new novel, featuring new characters (and a few old) in the Amazon UK #1 Post-Apocalyptic series “Surviving The Evacuation”. Set during the first nine months of the outbreak, in Cumbria, Scotland and Wales.“There are no reported outbreaks in the UK or Ireland.” That is what the government broadcast. Nilda didn’t believe it. Not trusting the authorities, she, and her son, Jay, stay behind when Penrith is evacuated. After weeks of rationing, there is little food left in the small town in Northern England. Soon, she discovers that there are many other survivors competing for it. Choosing diplomacy over violence, she attempts to forge a community out of a disparate group, but as the number of the undead grow, she realises that they will have to seek sanctuary elsewhere. Nilda travels north into Scotland, but death follows, and she is forced to leave once more.Joining with others who have survived the evacuation, she finds not all of them have the same motives. Some, like Tuck, Sebastian and the Abbot of Brazely only want to help. Others, like Harper and Rob, only want to help themselves. Whilst Chester and the new Mayor of Anglesey have their own agenda, one at odds with Nilda’s quest; to find a safe haven for her son.",
