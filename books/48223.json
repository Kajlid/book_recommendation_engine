  "description": "The road to passion is paved with guilty pleasures. Love in Reverse, Book 1Faith Hillman is in a bit of a pickle. She's been commissioned to write a series of magazine articles on spicing up your love life. She's got the theme--the \"Seven Sexy Sins\"--but there's one major problem. She hasn't experienced any of them. Ever since Faith's older brother gave Rusty Thorne a black eye for kissing her on her eighteenth birthday, he's kept his distance, waiting for the right time to make his move. This is it. She needs a research partner? He's the man for the job. When sex-on-legs Rusty offers his services, Faith is all over it--with one caveat. The notorious heartbreaker must sign a confidentiality contract. Just to keep him safe from her brother's wrath, of course...and her heart off Rusty's long list of conquests. As they work their wicked way through the list, the implications of the contract hit Rusty as hard as the handcuffs binding his wrists to the bed. It isn't just Faith's touch that rocks his world. It's the way his heart likes it that blows his defenses out of the water. And makes him wonder, when the contract ends, if he can bear to let her go.Product Warnings: Includes rebellious hero who enjoys inserting Tab A into Slots B, C, and even occasionally D. Also includes highly inappropriate use of a Mars Bar.",
