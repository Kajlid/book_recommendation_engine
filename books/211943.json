Handsome and playful and soon-to-be heir to the kingdom of my lady parts. Yeah, I said it. I was all but ready to let the man lay siege from the moment I noticed his running shorts cling to very compelling evidence. But a few stray words revealed a game-changing truth. Now he will need his skills as a surgeon to remove the giant foot he's jammed in his mouth. He won't give up until he's proven to me that polar opposites don't just attract, they ignite.---This is a bite-sized romance. Everything you crave--banter, steam, romance--all in one quick, fun, and delectable standalone.",
