  "title": "Peckuwe 1780: The Revolutionary War on the Ohio River Frontier",
  "description": "As the Revolutionary War raged on fields near the Atlantic, Native Americans and British rangers fought American settlers on the Ohio River frontier in warfare of unsurpassed ferocity. When their attacks threatened to drive the Americans from their settlements in Kentucky, Daniel Boone, Simon Kenton, and other frontiersmen guided an army of 970 Kentuckians into what is now Ohio to attack the principal Native American bases from which the raids emanated.This superbly illustrated book traces Colonel George Rogers Clark's lightning expedition to destroy Chalawgatha and Peckuwe, and describes how on August 8, 1780, his Kentuckians clashed with an army of 450 Native Americans, under Black Hoof, Buckongahelas, and Girty, at the battle of Peckuwe. It would be the largest Revolutionary War battle on the Ohio River frontier.",
