But the winds of apocalyptic prophecy are tearing through the kingdoms of Talohna. Rumors of a strange being influencing kings and emperors as well as sightings of a vile, ancient, witch coven believed destroyed long ago are all omens of the darkness growing within Talohna. With her personal history woven firmly to these events, can Yrlissa keep her family safely hidden long enough to finish her final contract and then disappear with them or will the phantoms of her past rise up to take everything from her first?",
