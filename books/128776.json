  "title": "Decolonizing the Hindu Mind - Ideological Development of Hindu Revivalism",
  "description": "The ideological dimension of Hindu revivalism has mostly been misrepresented, or rather neglected, in the ongoing debates on the subject. Thoroughly analysing the ideological statements of its advocates and their critique of the existing secular order, Dt Koenraad Elst provides an overview of the ideas animating the movement. A period of rapid political changes that witnessed the rise of the BJP with only 2 Lok Sabha seats in 1984 to 179 seats - which enabled it to form a coalition government at the Center in 1998 - is the focus of the study. Amidst the several other books available on the subject, this book stands out with its clear focus and clarity of thought.",
