  "description": "Kurt joined the staff as a waiter at the Hammer Club because he wanted a Master of his own. He’s shy, though, and just one boy among the many looking for that special someone to dominate them. In fact, he’s working the night of the Hammer’s Annual Christmas Auction when Master Marcus asks him to fill in for a sub stuck in traffic.  Master August noticed Kurt when he first started working at the Hammer, but hadn’t approached the boy, wondering if they were compatible. When he sees Kurt on the auction block, he figures it’s the perfect time to test out their chemistry without putting any pressure on either of them.  Will Kurt and August find what they’re looking for in each other? Find out in the Christmas Hammer tale.",
