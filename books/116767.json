  "description": "\"This epic tale spanning past and present will have you on the edge of your seat. Set in a world of Voodoo, spirits, and the historic locale of New Orleans, Villere House is deliciously spooky and romantic.\" ~ Tracey Garvis Graves, author of the New York Times bestseller, On The Island and Covet.College senior, Lottie Boyd, expects to drink too much while on spring break in New Orleans. What she doesn't expect is to be haunted. Or fall in love. But that's exactly what happens. It starts with strange, vivid dreams about a 19th century widow so desperate to save her sick little girl, she's willing to do anything--even if it involves the black magic of Voodoo. It doesn't end there. Voices, ghost sightings, familiarity with things and places she couldn't possibly know. All leading her to the Villere House of Voodoo and the young Creole owner, Xavier Villere.Xavier is compelled to help and is drawn to Lottie in a way he's never known, but skepticism of his family's century-old link to Voodoo and the occult keep her at arms length. If he can only come to terms with his heritage, he might be able to help solve the mystery of the widow plaguing Lottie's dreams. And maybe even find love in the process.Note: Villere House is an adult romance and not suitable for readers under 18.",
