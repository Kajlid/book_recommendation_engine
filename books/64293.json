  "description": "Dumpy Yarns & Diminutive Legends: short stories, poems, and essays written by Rebecca Jane. The tales range from an analysis of Edgar Allen Poe's \"A Tell-Tale Heart,\" to a medieval knight story, to an exact description of corpse decomposition. Many of these compositions were written for college projects and assignments, but the rest were created for Jane's own enjoyment and hopefully the enjoyment of others. These are Dumpy Yarns and Diminutive Legends.",
