  "description": "~ The universe shifts, and our stars realign. ~ I’d sworn off men. And then I met Nick Christiansen. Technically, I fell for him, literally, the moment I landed in his quarterback-sized arms and looked into those soulful eyes. I blame the rum. Or was it tequila?  Spoiler alert: It was those delectable dimples. Either way, Nick was stupidly handsome and ridiculously charming. He held me like he cared and listened to me like I mattered. Captivated by great conversation and rock-hard abs, Nick had me reconsidering the “No Men” promise I’d made myself. I still regret walking away the next day.~I can’t stop thinking about the one who got away. But then I run right into Natalie St. James.  She’s still unwittingly gorgeous, if not more so, and as wildly quirky as I remember. Sidebar: She’s on a date. What do I expect? For her to still be thinking about me?  I still regret what happens next.  We didn’t get the love story we deserved the first time, then I screwed up our second chance. When the universe shifts and our stars realign, is the third time a charm?",
