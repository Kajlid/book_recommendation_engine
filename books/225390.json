  "description": "Tess Newhart knows her ex-boyfriend Nick Jamieson isn't the right guy for her. He's caviar and champagne; she's takeout Chinese pot stickers. He's an uptight Republican lawyer; she was raised in a commune. He wants to get ahead inbusiness; she just wants...him. But there's no way Tess will play second fiddle to his job. Yet somehow she finds herself agreeing to play his fianc√©e on a weekend business trip that could make or break Nick's career. And while he's trying to convince Tess that he needs her in his respectable world, Tess is doing her best to keep her opinions to herself and her hands off Nick.",
