When her beloved sister is attacked by an unearthly creature, Emma Rose finds herself in a contract of exchange for her life that defies all laws of heaven. A contract with a vampire.Her world is torn apart and the reality she had known and believed in is revealed to be a facade, just like the masks of a midnight vampire ball; a mask worn by Markus Winterly, the inimitable viscount and master of Winterthurse.

Spanning centuries, lifetimes, and the rise and fall of ancient civilizations, Winterly takes her on a journey of self discovery where Emma awakens to the truth of her identity at last, and she comes to learn that the line separating light and dark is as tenuous as her humanity.When she surrenders to the call of her blood, she finds where she belonged all along. And it was never in London, or even heaven, but in the arms of the devil himself.od, she finds where she belonged all along. And it was never in London, or even heaven, but in the arms of the devil himself.",
