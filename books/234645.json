  "description": "\"This is the reason I called her my angry girl in the first place. I was teasing her back then, but the truth of the matter is that she impressed me. She blew me away with her strength of character and her fire. She’s not just angry. She’s fierce. She’s determined. She’s strong. She’s brave as f#*$. She is everything she needs to be in order to withstand being in love with a man like me, and I am eternally grateful for that fact.\"  Zeth Mayfair is on a mission to take care of business in New York.
