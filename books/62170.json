  "description": "Read 14/75 poems and reviews from this book free on wattpad http://www.wattpad.com/story/1031729-...The poems in this book reflect on my journey through life, love, the Arab Spring and Occupy Movement. As a socialist and one of the 99%, this book is about love, social revolution and theeternal struggle for equality and justice. In these poems, I look into and out of the wooded windows of the past, present and future and become romantic and erotic, political and spiritual. I am a pagan peasant in this poverty and paradise, chained to the same land in serfdom, but trying to climb the tree of life and reach the branches of freedom.http://www.lulu.com/shop/strider-marc...http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wooded-Window...",
