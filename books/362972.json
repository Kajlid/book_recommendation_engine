  "description": "When Jimmie Knight was ten years old, he foresaw other peoples' suffering. He hesitated to act on a vision, and a girl drowned, leaving him devastated by guilt. Now, after seven years of dormancy, this local high school rock-star's gift re-awakens, showing him a vision of the town's children tortured by an evil force which lays beneath the surface of the pond where the girl died. Overwhelmed by his visions, Jimmie begins to alienate himself from his friends in a desperate attempt at redemption. Ember Grace, the most popular girl in high school, is also Jimmie's crush, and she struggles to hold together her own failing friendships as she tries to understand her own unique gifts. Cast from her circle by vindictive friends, she finds herself drawn to Jimmie, his music, and his visions. When strange and evil events plague the town, Jimmie realizes that time is running out and all will be lost if he repeats his failure to act.",
