  "title": "The Orangery",
  "description": "Poetry. First published in 1978, THE ORANGERY is one of Gilbert Sorrentino's most memorable collections of poetry. Each poem is a variation on orange, which appears and reappears as a color, a fruit, a memory, an intrusion, a word seeking rhyme, a presence expected and awaited. As William Bronk wrote upon its original publication, In THE ORANGERY Sorrentino makes things which are hard, gaudy and sometimes scary... They are made to last.",
