  "description": "Desiree Mendelsohn is a French cook and caterer who lives life to its fullest, enjoying dalliances with men and women. Her business masks the fact that she is running arms for the Resistance. Despite all the excitement of her life, she feels something is missing. Then she happens to come into contact with Colonel Hans Faber, a charming and dashing SS Officer with a rich love life of his own.  Theirs is an immediate attraction, and despite her fears, Desiree finds herself drawn deeper and deeper into a relationship with the handsome officer, who is equally drawn—despite the fact that he has been sent to seduce her for information regarding the smuggling ring she is a part of.  Desiree and Hans run a gauntlet of turmoil and trouble, leading up to a climactic confrontation that may prove to Desiree’s undoing.",
