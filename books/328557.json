  "description": "When a feline fatale meets his magical match, Baltimore might just go up in flames.Carter Strike here. Siamese shifter extraordinaire, Tommy Tittoti’s right-hand cat . . . and the star of this book. Don’t let the author whatsherface tell you otherwise. That’s why its 113k. I’ve got A LOT to say.Terrible things are afoot in Charm City. Snark happens. Bad guys die. And I have a new favorite donut. But I promise it’s also an epic romance with a very happily-ever-after. And Gods, we’ve earned it.I know you’re going to find this hard to believe, but Bengal Damon-Cowles and I don’t hit it off right away. I mean, you’d think an arrogant Rakshasa would be insane to turn all of this down. *waves at self* But you’ll find that Bengal is nothing if not frustratingly contrary, all wrapped up in a too sexy package.So, buckle up, dear readers, we’re going for a wild ride . . . Hmm, did I mention that I don’t know how to drive?Cat’s Chance in Hell is a snarktastic, roller coaster of a romance with a guaranteed happy ending and lots of steam. Shenanigans include: a catnapping gone very, very wrong, a hot pot incident that will go down in infamy, and a Rakshasa with more layers than a Smith Island Cake.",
