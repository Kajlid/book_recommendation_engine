Eve Gates needs help finding a new path when her best friend since childhood suddenly drops out of her life, but her mother, Maisie, speaks a language Eve can't decipher. What's behind Maisie's loving but stern guidance and her refusal to talk about her own mother? The reader will find in Eve's grandmother, Evangeline Lee Grey, a heroine whose story of resilience and grace establishes a foundation for her daughter and granddaughter's triumph over the social isolation that, as a Romani woman, Evangeline herself cannot transcend.",
