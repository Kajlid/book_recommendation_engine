  "title": "I Ain't Gonna Paint No More!",
  "description": "A New York Times best-selling masterpiece featuring a sing-song rhyming text and humorous energetic illustrations about a spirited child and outside-the-box, creative thinking.When the child gets caught painting everything from the ceiling to the floor, Mama says \"Ya ain't a-gonna paint no more!\" But nothing will keep this artist from painting! Written to the familiar tune \"It Ain't Gonna Rain No More,\" the text bounces alongside vibrant stylized pen-and-ink drawings, while page-turns offer up a fun read-aloud guessing game in which kids will delightfully participate. What will the child paint next? \"So I take some red and I paint my . . . HEAD!\" Silliness paired with the ruckus read-aloud appeal will have every reader begging for repeat reads.",
