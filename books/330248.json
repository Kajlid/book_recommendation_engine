  "description": "\"Inspired by an actual child's life and writings, this tale of a young leukemia victim will elicit both tears and laughter.\" -- Booklist, BoxedBecky Zaslow's leukemia diagnosis has introduced her to a world she never knew existed, a scary world of hospitals and blood counts and chemotherapy. Ten-year-old Becky is afraid. But she doesn't have to go through this alone . . . she's got a trio of singing zebras to keep her company! A herd of zebras from the Serengeti plains forges a special spiritual bond with Becky. They boost her spirits by telling her the story of Zink, a polka-dotted zebra with the most courage and the biggest heart. \"Think Zink,\" the zebras tell her when things get bad. And when Becky does as they say, her soul voyages to Africa, where her imagination can run as free as the zebras.",
