  "description": "Planet Earth has been wiped out after the most final war in history.  The last remaining survivors have made it to the planet Usonia - a secret colony built after the second world war to protect the human race in the event of nuclear warfare. A utopian world that puts equality, freedom, peace and the planet above all. A glittering world devoid of pollution, banks, governments and police.  The final shipment from Earth is scheduled to descend on the planet. The planet’s resources are already stretched to the limits and the Usonians have been working all hours to prepare for the mass arrival of asylum-seekers from all around the world.  Scared, malnourished and traumatised, the Earthlings must adapt to a new life. Integrating with alien inhabitants on a planet that they had no idea existed until now. A planet where there are no fast food chains, no super markets, and no laws.  As the population grows, the planet’s idyllic way of living quickly begins to deteriorate. Crime, discord and tragedy are all new to the peaceful planet, and the inhabitants must act fast to prevent the planet becoming another Earth.  In the final instalment of the Project Ark trilogy, sixteen year old Earthling, Mia McAdams and her friends from all over the universe must work together to save the human race. One last time.",
