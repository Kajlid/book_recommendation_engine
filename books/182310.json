  "description": "Taken without a trace. Held by a sadist intent on loving her.He said I was the only perfect woman in the world. It's why he had to have me.   “The game today, Larissa, is called pick your poison.” He took me while I was sitting alone in my backyard. I had my feet cooling in the pool, face heating in the sun when his shadow eclipsed all happiness four days ago. I don’t remember any sounds or words, only waking up here…and his games. “I expect you to either make a choice, or don’t.” In this box of horrors, he wanted me to find my purpose. I thought I already had—to save my heart from pain and to hold out for freedom. Turns out, I wasn’t wrong. Only my perceptions were. And he’s giving me a chance to choose again. “I’m going to hurt you.”I’ve been a monster for him, a perfect version of myself, and I don’t think I can pretend that I haven’t liked it.Whoever said knowledge is power wasn’t chained up when they said it.What Lies is a prequel to What Love and should be read first. Trigger Warning: Contains explicit scenes, on-page violence, the dubiest of dub con, blood, a dark captor - captive romance, a jealous / possessive / obsessive antihero, and gripping psychological suspense. Also loads of angst (it’s in the title after all). No cheating. Author’s version of happy for now.",
