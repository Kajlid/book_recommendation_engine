  "description": "I need a man. Just for the holidays... Skin care is my life. My business, my baby.I don’t have time for a relationship.In fact, I don’t even want one. As one of seven children, the last thing I want is marriage and kids. I enjoy my single life, thoroughly—thank you very much.When I’m faced with yet another year of questions from well-meaning relatives, I decide a little white lie won’t hurt anyone, and say I’m dating. Actually, I tell them I’m quite serious about an imaginary man I dub, ‘Liam’. Not my finest hour.It starts out quite innocent at first, but as the lie grows, I find myself promising that Liam will be joining us for Thanksgiving.But, that’s fine. I can just tell them he’s busy—or we broke up—and then I can insist I don’t want to talk about it and live to fight another day. Right?The plan seems workable until my mother calls to warn me about the ‘surprise’ my great aunt has for us—a month-long holiday cruise. Sounds like Paradise, but add the fact that she’s already bought myself and my imaginary boyfriend non-refundable tickets, I’m faced with admitting I was lying, or...finding myself a stand-in.I’ll bet you already know what I decide...Mine for the Holidays is the first full-length novel by Megan Wade. It contains all of her usual sugary goodness, and of course comes with her Sugar Promise—high heat, low drama, guaranteed.",
