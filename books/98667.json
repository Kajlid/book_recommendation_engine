  "title": "The Visions of David Palmer: Recoil",
  "description": "Six months have passed since David, Maddy, and Ridley defeated and exposed the domestic terrorist organization known as the Triangle. With the occasional help of David’s brother, the league of friends have spent their time using the foreknowledge of David’s visions to anonymously go about serving the desperate and destitute. Whether helping victim or potential perpetrator, their objective and ultimate satisfaction comes from using their limited resources and abilities to make the world around them a better place.   Unknown to the trio, David’s visions have routinely put the group at odds with some of the most powerful people in the world. Because they have disrupted evil too many times to be ignored, an organization much more dangerous and menacing than the Triangle is about to go hunting, and David Palmer is their target. Unfortunately, in the midst of the group’s struggles, when David’s visionary powers are needed most, David discovers that any help from his visions could also mean his death.  Recoil is the second book in The Visions of David Palmer series from Stephen Reid Andrews.",
