  "title": "Rethinking Catholicism in Reformation England",
  "description": "This book considers the ideological development of English Catholicism in the sixteenth century, from the complementary perspectives of history, theology, and literature. The author shows that Catholicism in this period was neither a defunct tradition, nor one merely reacting to Protestantism, but a vigorous intellectual movement responding to the reformist impulse of the age. Her study makes an important contribution to the intellectual history of the Reformation.",
