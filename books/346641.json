Now he has an even bigger secret. In every shifting shadow of the sprawling mansion he's recently inherited he can see her--tempting, ethereal, and untouchable. Hope Stillwater inhabited that mansion in 1906.

But there is one grave danger: Ryan's job has put him on the trail of a depraved criminal in an investigation that's risking Hope's eternal fate and happiness. Now he must do whatever it takes to change history, protect Hope from harm, and set his own desires free.",
