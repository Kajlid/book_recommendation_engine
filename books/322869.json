  "description": "Lotus Calanthe can't believe her luck when she lands a high paying job at a resort in paradise- or so she thinks. At the last minute, the plan changes, sweeping her off to another location and the job description couldn't be more different or unappealing. A journey underground to an ore mine on a frozen planet awaits her and from the start it becomes apparent there is more to it all than meets the eye. As doubt begins to rise in her mind, it becomes clear someone worked in her coveted position before and everyone seems to know something they won't tell. Soon, she finds herself reeling from disturbing sensations that make her question her own sanity and commit an unforgivable mistake that sends currents traveling farther than she can imagine. Just what happened to the woman she replaced? Why do the miners arm themselves as if going to war? What are the true intentions of everyone around her- and what deadly, unfathomable secret lurks in the darkness of the mines?",
