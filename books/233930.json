  "description": "It's double the pleasure and double the fun. Stuart Woods brings one series lead, Holly Barker of 'Orchid Blues' (she's chief of Florida's Orchid Beach Police Department), onstage to co-star with another of his leads, lawyer and PI Stone Barrington, in this exciting addition to the author's thrillers.Holly has come to New York hot on the trail of Trini Rodriguez, a bad guy she thought she'd stabbed to death in an earlier adventure. He's currently wanted for (among other things) blowing up a dozen people by hiding bombs in the caskets of two of his earlier victims and detonating them at the funeral! But finding him won't be so simple: he's been placed in the FBI Witness Protection Program and is working with the Feds and the CIA to catch an Arab terrorist group trying to employ the Mafia in a money-laundering scheme.Will readers find this one riveting?
