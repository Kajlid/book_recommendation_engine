  "description": "The Games of Neith - Margaret St. ClairThe people of Gwethym were highly intelligent, rational beings. They worshipped the goddess Neith, not because they believed in such a golden-haired being, but because they recognized the need for religion as a counterbalance to human passions.So when trouble struck their planet, when they discovered an energy leak which was slowly destroying their world, the Gwethymians turned to science for their answer. If their world was to be saved, the solution must come from the logicians.Or so they thought, until one day a woman, the image of their goddess Neigh, walked across the waters of the harbor and into their city! Then their trouble was twofold. Would there be anything left to save of their world if they waited for the scientists? And if they didn't, if they put their trust in this goddess whom logic told them could not even exist, would they just be sealing their doom that much quicker?The Earth Gods Are Coming - Kenneth BulmerThe Prophets of Earth slept crated in their thousands.They filled the ship's bomb-bays, lying quietly waiting in their machine-gleaming metal sheaths.Each individual one was destined to cover a world.Each individual one lay there, quiescent in its capsule, awaiting the master command that would send it, after the one before and receding the next in line in strict mathematical order, out over a new and unknown world to plunge down to its destined consummation.",
