  "title": "A Worthy Opponent",
  "description": "Once upon a time I was a girl who believed in love and happily ever afters.  Now the only thing I believe in is revenge.  Unfortunately for me, there’s only one man willing to help me. Hook. I should have known it wouldn’t be out of the goodness of his heart. He doesn’t have one. No, Hook wants his ring on my finger and me on my knees before him—and he won’t take no for an answer.  I’m willing to pay any price in order to bring Pan down…even if it means I lose my soul in the bargain.",
