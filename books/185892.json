Young, beautiful, and broke, Takako is sold to pay for her father’s debts. Thrust into a world she doesn’t understand and battles she didn’t ask for, she must decide where her loyalties lie.  When their lives crash together in a Kingdom on the brink of war, the decisions they make will change both their lives and their Kingdom forever.  If they can stay alive.",
