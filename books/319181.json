  "description": "Her new job as an on-air reporter in sunny San Diego is a big break for Skyler Ruiz. No more covering small-town softball games or vegetable growing competitions. She’ll be working at the same station as her TV mega-crush and longtime idol, anchorwoman Carolyn McNamara, and that doesn’t hurt either.Unfortunately, people don’t always live up to expectations.Skyler’s hopes of impressing Carolyn are dashed when she discovers Carolyn has little time for newbie reporters and is downright unwelcoming. But when Carolyn drops her guard, Skyler is left with her head happily spinning, her heart wide open, and oh-so ready to explore a romance she never saw coming.So, of course, the network pits them against each other.It’s only when Skyler is ready to sacrifice everything she’s ever dreamed of for Carolyn does she begin to suspect love is nothing but fake news.",
