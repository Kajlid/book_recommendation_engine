The woman has one of the smartest mouths he’s ever heard, not to mention, tasty as hell. Chris Collier only wants to find her sister, Millie, settle her up with whatever she needs to get her out of her life. They aren’t close at all, but she is still her stepsister, and the only family she has left. But Myles insisting on helping her is getting on her last nerve until some jerk shackles them together in a bedroom without any clothes. As mates, they can do so much more, but neither of them wants what comes with having someone in their lives full time. And as a vampire, the term ‘a long life’ takes on a whole new meaning. But once Myles tastes the tantalizing human, he knows that he’ll never have enough of her. He only hopes he can convince her of that before she kills him.Myles and Chris were destined to be together, the Fates had decided. But there are forces trying to pull them apart, and neither of them are sure they can win against such odds. An ancient evil has set his sights on Chris and will stop at nothing to have her for his bed. She has been told she is destined to destroy him, but others have tried…and failed. Austin Force and his pack are ready to help, but it will take a force like no other to stop him. Will Chris be able to fulfill her destiny and defeat the beast? Or will she meet the same fate as her predecessors?Word Count: 60,498",
