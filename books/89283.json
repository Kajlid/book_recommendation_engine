  "description": "Sometimes the only way for justice to prevail is to get a little Wicked... Wick Templeton is taken by surprise when a mysterious email is sent to his private address. Surprise won't stop him from hijacking an investigation of a serial killer. He's sure his investigative style won't mesh with the enigmatic Ned, but that's Ned's problem not his. Together they will wear each other's nerves down, butt heads, raise libidos and maybeâ€”if they are lucky, solve a few murders in the process.",
