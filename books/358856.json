  "description": "New York Times bestselling author Elizabeth Adler invites you on a decadent Mediterranean cruise--where nothing is what it seems, no one is telling the truth, and murder is on the agenda…When English tycoon Sir Robert Waldo Hardwick dies mysteriously in a car accident, he leaves behind a note naming six people he suspects might have wanted him dead. Daisy Kean, and P.I. Harry Montana team up to take the suspects--and also six 'red herrings'--on a fabulous Mediterranean cruise, all expenses paid by the late Sir Robert.  As they call at Monte Carlo, St. Tropez and Sorrento, the mystery deepens.  And the unexpected twists are just the beginning.   Finally, they arrive at the beautiful Villa Belkiss on Capri, where Sir Robert's will is to be read…and the killer unmasked. With the beauty of the Yorkshire countryside, the Mediterranean resorts and the magnificent cruise ship, plus the intense attraction between loner Montana and wary Daisy, passions flare and the beauty of the Villa Belkiss enchants. No one writes delicious armchair travel or intriguing suspense like Elizabeth Adler.",
