  "description": "In the near future, a man is going to bring the furthest reaches of the galaxy within the grasp of mankind. Meriwether Hawke has created a vehicle that folds space, changing the whole perspective of the space program in an instant. Unfortunately for Hawke, the first manned test vehicle doesn’t end up where it’s supposed to. Lost and without sufficient life support, the two-person crew must engage the automated distress beacon and then settle in for a deep cryogenic sleep to await potential rescue. When Hawke is revived from cryosleep by an alien species, he quickly discovers that he is both their honored guest and guarded prisoner at the same time. It’s no secret that they are extremely interested in his ancient dead spacecraft and its method of propulsion. While he may not be aware of how much time has passed, two things become evident to him: The alien species are sworn enemies of his people, and humanity has become both more and less technologically advanced in the years that have passed. Hawke may hold the only key to the rescue of a forgotten human colony. Brought to you by the international bestselling author of the Mystic Saga and Ghosts of Ophidian.
