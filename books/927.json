  "description": "Sometimes forbidden fruit is the sweetest of all...She was untouchable...his business partner's wife. Beautiful Rachel Tanner was everything that Dylan Prescott longed for in a woman -- all lush curves and unconscious sensuality. But he had too much honor to even think about tempting her away from the man she loved...Dylan has always known he should stay far away from this bewitching woman, but now, her marriage over, she has turned to him with questions only he can answer on her alluring lips, As he takes her in his arms he realizes that her tantalizing kisses are no longer forbidden...and the illicit passion he feels for her is no longer out of his reach. But will their love find a way to survive once he tells her the truth?",
