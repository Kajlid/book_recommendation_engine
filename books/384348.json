  "description": "Maybe a tender love story is your thing, a husband doting on his wife's rotting corpse. Or perhaps a forbidden encounter in a secret cafe, serving up the latest in delectable zombie cuisine, or some dirty, dirty dancing in the old-time honky-tonk. Voodoo sex-slaves and vending machine body-parts? You'll find those here, too. Whatever your flavor, these short tales of undead Romance, Revenge, Risk, and Raunch will leave you shambling, moaning and clawing for more.  Features works Pete Alberti, Damon B, Renee Bennett, Xander Briggs, Jennifer Brozek, J R Campbell, Johann Carlisle, Nathan Crowder, Carrie Cuinn, R Schuyler Devin, Annette Dupree, Michael Ellsworth, Jay Faulkner, Kaolin Imago Fire, M G Gillett, Sarah Goslee, Kay T Holt, Calvin D Jim, Alex Masterson, Edward Morris, Don Pizarro, Michael Phillips, John Nakamura Remy, V R Roadifer, Ander Penn Romine, Armand Rosamilia, Jacob Ruby, Steven James Scearce, Lance Schonberg, Lucia Starkey, R E VanNewkirk Wendy N Wagner.",
