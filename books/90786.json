  "title": "The Eaglet and the Angry Dove",
  "description": "This is a children's book, but written by a real stylist. I loved it so much my father bought it for me in hardback when I was at primary school. It's about St Columba and two small boys, one a Scot and one a Pict, who go on a journey with him to find the Pict's sister. It appears to be out of print, which is a great shame. I think I'll need to start a campaign on its behalf.",
