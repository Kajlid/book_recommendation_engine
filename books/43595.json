  "description": "Abandonment, neglect, drugs and a little bloodletting. Dodge Landry and his fifteen-year-old son, Chris, have a lot in common. But while Dodge only narrowly survived his childhood, Chris may not.Navigating the murky waters of the foster care system in the mid-1970’s, Dodge hits the mother lode when he is sent to live with Kate Landry on her small Pennsylvania horse farm. Through her functionally dysfunctional family, and with the help of an abused mess of a horse named Storm, Kate shows Dodge no one needs to be perfect to be worthy of love. It is a lesson Dodge desperately wants to share with Chris. The problem is, Chris isn’t interested in listening and Dodge fears his adopted son is headed down the same road Dodge once walked.",
