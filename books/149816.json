  "title": "Excuse It, Please!",
  "description": "From the back cover: It is as impossible to attempt a description of these delightfully gay little sketches as it is unnecessary to introduce Cornelia Otis Skinner to a world which has long laughed and wept over her inimitable monologues, either on the stage or over the radio. Already widely-known and loved as one of our foremost stage figures, this book is a further indication of her versatility. Miss Skinner's humor has that rare quality which shows its depth and genuineness in her ability to laugh at herself. It takes on a true universality in its sympathy with other poor mortals in the same unsettling situations. It ranges pleasantly from the salon of a dancing school to that of an employment agency. It conducts you through the vagaries of the Long Island telephone system and those of an encyclopedia. It introduces such potpourri of odd characters as you will find nowhere else except in real life. It is mildly mad and utterly delightful throughout.",
