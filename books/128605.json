  "description": "Lizzie Medina is living a fairy tale life. Ever since she left home for an adventure in London—and fell in love with movie star Thomas Harper in the process—her world has become brighter. More exciting. The kind of life she’s always dreamt of. And she has no intention of going back to the way things used to be.  When Thomas is required to temporarily move to Los Angeles for his new movie, Lizzie joins him without hesitation. After all, it’s not every day she’s invited to live in a luxurious Malibu beach house with the man of her dreams, rubbing elbows with Hollywood celebrities, spending her days steps from the ocean.  But it doesn’t take Lizzie long to realize than in Hollywood, not everything is quite what it seems. Will she and Thomas succumb to the pressures inherent in their new life? Or will they find a way to create a perfect Hollywood ending of their own?",
