  "description": "Francine has always had a gift. She has always been able to sense ghosts and she loved the paranormal. However, when she went civil war ghost hunting she never expected for one to follow her home. She expected even less to have said ghost turn out to be the man she'd always dreamed of. She hadn't expected him to fall in love with her or to fall in love with him. But that is exactly what happened. But, surely this is crazy and nothing could make this relationship work... could it?",
