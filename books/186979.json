This is where Brice Sullivan comes in. After a chance encounter brings Jada and Brice together, Jada decides that he would be the perfect guy to use to get back at Todd for cheating on her. She knows that she’s still in love with Todd, but she wants to teach him a lesson- that she won’t wait forever for him to get his act together. However, what was intended to be a one-time hookup with Brice, turns into much more as things begin to spiral out of control. One night of pleasure, is definitely proving to have some painful consequences.",
