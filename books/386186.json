  "description": "Infuriating, Imperious. . .Proud Scottish lord Kieran Rossburn doesn't relish the idea of a marriage of convenience, but he'll do what he must to preserve the family estate. Worse, the bride he's been saddled with--the daughter of a crass, unrefined, American merchant--is far too weak-willed for his tastes. Or so it seems at first. . . \nAnd Entirely Irresistible. . .\nAfter a lifetime under the thumb of her domineering parents, Diantha Quinn can't believe she's being shipped across the ocean to be locked away yet again. Now, to gain any sort of power in her life, she must resist Kieran's seductions and keep the marriage in name only. Yet how can she keep from falling in love, when she is wed to the most tempting man in all of Scotland?Praise for Ann Stephens's To Be Seduced \"An engaging and breathtakingly romantic tale. I savored every well-crafted word!\" --Celeste Bradley, New York Times Bestselling author",
