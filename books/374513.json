  "description": "When making life hell for the poor twitching users isn't any fun for the sysadmin, what's a geek to do? Run away to space, of course. Allard's current job is a nightmare. He'll do anything to find another job -- including joining the slightly nutty crew of the Mary Sue, who have an even more malevolent attitude to traditional management structures than he does. The crew and joint owners of the spaceship Mary Sue were looking for an IT expert who shared their political ideals. That's not Allard, but that doesn't bother him as long as he's left out of it. He's just looking for a working environment where he likes the people and the job. He'll be pleased if they like him in return, although he's not betting on it. Now Allard's stuck on a spaceship with another very hunky man-and he's about to discover that even wise-cracking geeks like him have sex lives. And thanks to a voyeuristic crewmate, so are the rest of their sexy shipmates.",
