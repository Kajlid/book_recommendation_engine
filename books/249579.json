  "description": "Gary starts out as a murder suspect when a woman is killed and he ends up wearing a good bit of her blood. The fact that Gary writes horror novels doesn't help his case one bit. Neither does his story of the big, monstrous man that actually did the killing, who stopped by on the way from the scene and gave him a hug. Police detective Zeke doesn't think Gary murdered anyone. There's something about Gary, even if the rest of the world thinks he's crazy. Zeke is drawn to Gary to a degree that amazes him, and even when he tries to stay professional, he finds himself wanting to do very unprofessional things. Between Gary's terrifying house and the horrifying events of Gary's childhood, Zeke knows there's more to the case than meets the eye. He tries to balance keeping a watchful eye on Gary and protecting the man, but Gary's fear of the world outside his own door makes things difficult, to say the least. Danger lurks around every corner of Gary's life, from the stacks of boxes in his hallway to the terror that waits for him every time he leaves the house. Can Zeke convince Gary that he can escape his past, and that they have a future together? Or will Gary wait too long to face his personal demons?",
