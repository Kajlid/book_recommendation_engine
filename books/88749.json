  "description": "Arvid is six years old and lives on the outskirts of Oslo. His father works in a shoe factory; his Danish mother works as a cleaner. Arvid wets his bed at night and has nightmares about crocodiles, but begins to piece the world together. One day his father is collected in a black car; his grandfather has died, like the bullfinch. When Arvid sees a photo of his mother as a young woman he understands how time passes and then he cries and says he doesn't want to get old. And one morning the teacher tells the pupils to pray to God because a nuclear war is looming.These are beautiful tales of growing up from prizewinning international author Per Petterson.",
