  "description": "Alien Execs are planning a disastrous finale to their Big Brother style show, in which earth is the star. Only one man can save our planet, and he's hardly a likely hero. Earth used to be Galaxy Entertainment's most lucrative show. The inhabitants of the Western Galaxy—the savviest, richest demographic in the Milky Way—just couldn't get enough of the day-to-day details of the average Earthling's life. But now Channel Blue's ratings are flagging and its producers are planning a spectacular finale. In just three weeks, their TV show will go out with a bang. The trouble is, so will Earth.",
