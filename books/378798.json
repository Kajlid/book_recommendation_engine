  "description": "Three timeless favorites Little Red Riding Hood, Jack the Giant-Killer, and Rumpelstiltskincome together in this enchanting collection of read-aloud fun. Illustrated in charming detail by Edward Gorey and retold with engaging wit by James Donnelly, these unique renditions offer a fresh take on age-old tales. What happens when Little Red Riding Hood ignores her mother's advice to \"Keep yourself to yourself\"? How will young Jack fight the Giant who gobbles children by the fistful? And how will Queen Omoline save her baby from the devious Rumpelstiltskin? Gorey's expressive drawings and Donnelly's breezy text prove that good stories never grow old: rather, the tales in Three Classic Children's Stories are better than ever.",
