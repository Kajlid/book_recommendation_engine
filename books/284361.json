  "description": "Once upon a time, my family name meant something. It meant everything. Then my father was taken away and my world was shattered. Where our name once brought glory and recognition, now it brings only disdain.  Now when I roam the halls of Crescent Academy, I'm nothing.  A nobody.  A forgotten girl who gets nasty looks from everyone.  Especially Gavin.  There was a time when our families were close. Our dads were practically brothers. Now Gavin can't stand to even look at me.  Now he's nothing but a bully.  And he makes my life hell at every fucking chance.  YOU SUCK is a high school bully romance. Not for the faint of heart.",
