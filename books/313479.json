  "description": "Ride hard. Love harder. Live recklessly.Tank is done with his old life. All it's brought him is trouble and misery in the form of a four-year prison term. Though he did find one good thing while behind bars: Charles \"CJ\" Crane, pen pal extraordinaire.After months of exchanging increasingly personal letters, Tank knows exactly where he's headed as soon as the prison gates open. CJ doesn't know he's coming, and he's not sure what he'll say when he gets there, but he knows one thing for certain.The promises he and his boy made to each other in their letters may have been reckless, but he's willing to risk everything heâ€™s got on finding out if what they have could be real.Reckless is the first book in the Leather & Chrome series and features a motorcycle club's annual charity ride, a possessive biker whose new favorite color is pink, a twenty-four-year-old overly eager to experience his first time, and an excessive appreciation for perfectly lined tattoos.",
