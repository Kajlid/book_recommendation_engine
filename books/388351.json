  "description": "A “wildly entertaining” ( San Francisco Chronicle ) novel about a young marriage unraveling under the pressure of a subprime mortgage and ruthless Hollywood economics—from the New York Times bestselling author of Watch Me Disappear “Part social satire, part melodrama, part intimate domestic portrait . . . Brown has an uncanny eye for contemporary characters and settings.”— Los Angeles Times Claudia and Jeremy, a young married couple (she’s an aspiring filmmaker, he’s an indie musician), are on the verge of making it. Her first film was a sensation at Sundance and is about to have its theatrical release; he’s got a new band that is a few songs shy of an album. They’ve recently purchased their first home—a mid-century bungalow with a breathtaking view of Los Angeles—with the magical assistance of an adjustable-rate mortgage. But a series of seismic events—the tanking of Claudia’s film, the return of Jeremy’s manipulative, art-star ex-girlfriend, and the staggering adjustment of their monthly mortgage payments—threaten to deal a crushing blow to their dreams of the bohemian life and their professional aspirations and make them question their shared vision of the future.",
