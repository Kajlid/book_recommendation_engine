  "description": "At a simple level, ‘Howson’s Choice’ is about the downfall of an exceptionally successful man brought about by him succumbing to sexual temptation as based on real life events.On a deeper level, it is also about a titanic struggle between two brilliant men. It involves a clash of cultures between the British Upper Middle Class establishment and the dark underworld of drug dealing and prostitution. Issues of sexual peccadilloes, drug-taking and racism are dealt with in a hard hitting and direct fashion.The plot also involves a link between present day skulduggery and a murky historical past.The narrative style is peppered with humour and irony. The novel is written in ‘bite sized’ chapters which makes for easy reading. The story is told in a straight line towards a very satisfying ending.",
