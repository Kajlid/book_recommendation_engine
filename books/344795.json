  "title": "Big Man: Real Life & Tall Tales",
  "description": "For the first time ever comes the inside story of Clarence \"Big Man\" Clemons--his life before, during and beyond the E-Street Band, including unbelievable, never-before-told adventures with Bruce Springsteen, the band, and an incredible cast of other famous characters recounted by himself and his best friend, television writer/ producer Don Reo.Here are just a few things you'll get from reading it: The truth behind the final hours of making Born To Run; the real story of how the E-Street Band got its name; what happened when Clarence and Ringo Starr were sitting in a hotel room and Clarence got the call that Bruce was breaking up the band; how Bruce and Clarence met that dark, stormy night at the Student Prince; The E-Street band's show at Sing-Sing prison where all of their equipment blows out right as they take the stage; the secret that Robert De Niro told Clarence and Bruce they had to keep for 25 years. But that's merely a glimpse. This is not your average rock book. It is something creative, something unique, something new. It is the story of E-Street. It is the story of stories. It is the story of the Big Man.",
