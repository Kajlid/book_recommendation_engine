  "description": "Fergus Irvine is a hybrid–a human who shares his body with a fairy’s soul. Like other hybrids in the human-governed metropolis of New Peiling, his life seems stuck on okay-at-best—but that all changes the day he returns to his apartment to find his best friend Flynn dead. Unable to accept that Flynn would kill himself, Fergus decides he must find out for himself what really happened.He must survive arson, anti-hybrid vigilantes, airship crashes, ravenous fairies, and his catty kind-of-girlfriend to peel back the layers of lies and find the truth about Flynn… and himself.",
