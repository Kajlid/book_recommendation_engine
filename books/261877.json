  "description": "Four sexy gods of death—Thanatos, Anubis, Mictlantecuhtli, and Morrigan—vie for one woman's eternal soul.   Beth Carter is a private investigator preparing for the biggest case of her life. When she narrowly misses getting hit by a train, she counts her blessings and goes about her day.  But in the underworld, the representatives of death from every pantheon were already preparing to harvest her soul and escort it to the afterlife. Beth’s near-miss causes the wheels of fate to come to a screeching halt—and rips some gods out of the underworld.  Now four gods of death walk the earth: the Greek god Thanatos, the Egyptian deity Anubis, the Aztec immortal Mictlantecuhtli, and the Celtic goddess Morrigan. Still hungry for Beth’s soul, they must discover what strange fluke caused Beth to avoid her fate—and then bring her soul back to the underworld before it’s too late.  Yet Beth isn’t ready to accept their harsh truth, especially while focusing on her career-making case. Can she find a way to convince them to let her stay in the mortal realm? Or will she eventually succumb to their almost lustful desire for her soul?  Gods of Death is the new Reverse Harem Romance trilogy from Ruby Ryan. It’s a slow-burn romance packed with humor, drama, and supernatural action. Happily Ever After 100% guaranteed!",
