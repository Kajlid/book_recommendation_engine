  "title": "Gita Desai Is Not Here to Shut Up",
  "description": "It's eighteen-year-old Gita Desai's first year at Stanford University, and it's a miracle she's here and not already married off by her traditional Gujarati parents. She's determined to death-grip her good-girl, model-student rep all the way to medical school, which means no social life or standing out in any way. Should be easy: If there's one thing she's learned from her family it's how to chup-reâ€”to \"shut up,\" fade into the background. But when childhood memories of her aunt's desertion and her then-uncle's best friend resurface, Gita ditches the books night after night in favor of partying and hooking up with strangers. Still, nothing can stop the nagging voice in her head that's growing louder and louder, insisting something's wrong... and the only way she can burst forward is to stop shutting-up about the past.",
