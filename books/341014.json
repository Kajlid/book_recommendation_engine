  "description": "Pressurized family dynamics and a dysfunctional church experience force 16-year-old Olivia to seek her own reality. Hounded by the distorted reflections of mirrors, car doors, and shop windows, she sets things in order by papering her bedroom wall with glossy clippings from glamour magazines. Olivia's baggy clothes and exhaustive calorie scrutiny can't cover up the fact that she is allowing her body to wither away. As she encounters small town prying--and a tighter-than-comfortable rental house--Olivia's escape becomes her art. And her goal becomes the impossible perfection of the airbrushed models on her wall.Feeling for Bones is Olivia's story as her struggles become more than physical and she is finally led to the answers she was running from all along.This novel opens a window to the thought processes and struggles of teen and college-aged women who struggle with eating disorders. Young women will find a friend who thinks like they do and mothers will find a compatriot in the battle to help their daughters deal with body image.",
