  "description": "A trafficked girl.A monster in the dark.A tortured soul.A woman's might.A desperate struggle against the oldest sin in the history of mankind!\"\"I changed that day. The old Vijaya died, in its place an ugly creature reared its head which cleaned away every trace of the bright eyed young girl with a hope for a better future even when she was branded as a Molki. What my abduction couldn't do to me, what those scars adorning every inch of my body couldn't do to me, Shivil Kaushik's retribution did it to me.I became his slave, but he became mine too. Even if he didn't realize it until it was too late.\"\"",
