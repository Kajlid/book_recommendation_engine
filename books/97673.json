  "title": "'Twas the Week Before Christmas",
  "description": "A romantic inn... a white Christmas... hot cocoa by a roaring fire... it all adds up to a perfect holiday romance! Dear Holly, As I look around the inn, I see garland and mistletoe, colored lights and ornaments–everything I have always professed to despise. You were right to wonder why I would choose to visit The White Barn Inn. You were right about a lot of things. Since I met you, though, everything has changed. I’ve changed. And that’s why I can’t go on any longer without telling you the whole story. I don’t know if you will ever be able to forgive me. But they say Christmas is a time for miracles. And you do believe in them, don’t you? The question is, can you still believe in me? Max.",
