  "description": "In Rosaura a las diez,published in 1956 by the Argentine Marco Denevi and winner of the Premio Kraft, the mystery surrounds the sud­den appearance of a young woman in the life of a lonely middle-aged portrait painter named Camilo Canegato. When this woman is murdered and Camilo is accused of the homicide, the mystery takes on bizarre proportions. The gradual un­folding of the mystery involves the reader intellectually, but also holds him captive to the special interests of several narrators. And the unravel­ling and ultimate resolution of the mystery permit the reader to be gratified that his efforts at following the narrative carefully have finally been rewarded.",
