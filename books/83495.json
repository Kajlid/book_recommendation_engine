  "description": "Graves Buchanan has had to climb farther and higher than any of his friends, singlehandedly becoming a billionaire in less than two decades, even with a rotten poor childhood in the streets. He likes sex the way he learned it; animal, raw and without any strings attached. But even as messed up as he is, he cares deeply for his best friend’s baby sister, Chloe Lexington. But Chloe is an heiress, a ‘princess,’ and no matter how much he wants her, Graves doesn’t think he has it in him to handle a girl like her. But Chloe has other plans for him, and she’s not taking no for an answer. She’s been warned against Graves by her brother, Daniel, and against all of his eccentric billionaire friends, but Chloe has merely been biding her time. Now that she’s almost twenty-five, she’s determined to have the man she’s always wanted, and she’ll use anything as incentive to be claimed by him, at last.",
