  "description": "The world is losing hope.  Political and social infighting threaten to destroy the world. Rancor and hatred only grow stronger, engulfing entire nations. And each day moral and economic strife brings embroiled countries ever closer to war.  But hope is not dead. Everywhere, pockets of honor and compassion continue to persevere. Where human lives are cherished and valor endures. And one small, extraordinary group fights to save us all.  A team in possession of the mother of all secrets. The one secret – the one discovery – that could bring the world back from the brink.",
