  "description": "Part 2 of the trilogy is titled \"The Battle of Trust and Treachery.\" Discover the dreams, the magic, the quest. Kids of all ages will love this inspirational epic fantasy adventure, suitable for the entire family. The three parts of Maycly found in the paperback are sold separately as Ebooks. Part 2 picks right back up with the action on Maycly - still in the past. But get ready as this Part leads you into an epic battle that is fought in a fresh new way. Forget the machine and ray guns as on Maycly that kind of technology is non-existent. The battle creatures, weaponry, and such are described in vivid detail, making you feel as though you are a spectator watching from the ridge. The lead up to the battle is written in such a way you will feel the love, loss, heartache, dedication, and passion of the newly found characters from Part 1. A great continuation to this epic saga.",
