Struggling to get history flowing correctly, they encounter a brutal, dystopian regime, steam-powered airships, breathtaking revelations, and a pocket watch that is both a tool and a trap.Time travelers, freedom fighters, Frankenstein’s monster, the Battle of Waterloo, and Napoleon invading Britain by dirigible. \nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n(Science fiction -- Steampunk time-travel, historical romance and adventure)\"If Jane Austen and Mary Shelley had locked H. G. Wells in a dungeon and revised his wildest work, the result would have been something like this rollicking steampunk time-travel adventure that still manages to be a comedy of manners. Albano s delightful characters confront the not only monsters and killer robots, but their own divided loyalties between personal happiness and the fate of their country.\" --Ken Schneyer, The Law & the Heart:",
