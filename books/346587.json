  "title": "The Psychoanalysis of Children",
  "description": "This book is a classic in its subject and one which revolutionized child analysis. Melanie Klein had already proved, by the special technique she devised, that she was a pioneer in that branch of analysis. She made possible the extension of psychoanalysis to the field of early childhood, and in this way not only made the treatment of young children possible but also threw new light on psychological development in childhood and on the roots of adult neuroses and psychoses. This volume describes both the theory and practice of her methods, and includes a preface, written for the third edition, in which she outlines the development of her thinking in relation to certain essential hypotheses. This new edition, which contains a revised translation and a new index, has an explanatory note by the Editorial Board of the Melanie Klein Trust placing 'The Psycho-Analysis of Children' in the general compass of her work.",
