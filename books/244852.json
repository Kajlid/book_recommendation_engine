  "description": "Being one of the rarest shifters that exist, Charlie tends to hide his unicorn from the world, choosing to surround himself with what he loves â€” books. Owning one of the best bookstores in the area, he dedicates his life to his passion, and to spending time with family and friends. Knox Vaughn is a hero, a larger than life Siberian tiger shifter who has earned the respect of everyone in the paranormal world. Few know the real man, the one who fights for his family and friends and hides who he really is inside. When a simple mistake thrusts Knox into Charlie's bookstore, he finds himself smitten with the young unicorn. Two lives couldn't be more different on the outside, but Knox has a secret, one he's never shared with anyone other than his family. One that proves he's not so different from Charlie after all. Unable to ignore the chemistry between them, Charlie and Knox grow closer, but as they do, trouble descends on the small paranormal community, threatening to keep them apart. The two must come together, trusting in what they feel so they can overcome the threats to their union. When secrets are revealed and truths admitted, bonds form that won't ever be broken. Still, when it comes to tigers and unicorns, it might not be enough to save them.",
