  "title": "The Secret World of Red Wolves: The Fight to Save North America's Other Wolf",
  "description": "Red Wolves are shy, elusive, and misunderstood predators. Until the 1800s they were common in the longleaf pine savannas and deciduous forests of the southeastern United States. However, habitat degradation, persecution, and interbreeding with the coyote nearly annihilated them. Today, reintroduced red wolves are found only in peninsular northeastern North Carolina within less than 1 percent of their former range. In The Secret World of Red Wolves, nature writer T. DeLene Beeland shadows the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's pioneering recovery program over the course of a year to craft an intimate portrait of the red wolf, its history, and its restoration. Her engaging exploration of this top-level predator traces the intense efforts of conservation personnel to save a species that has slipped to the verge of extinction.",
