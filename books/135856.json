  "description": "Flowing with the River of Life outlines a basic map for your own personal journey, under the guidance of the eight Chohans, towards restoring your Creative Powers. From the universal spiritual teachers of humankind comes an amazing teaching on how we create through energy, but how we endow everything we create with consciousness. The effect is that during our spiritual journey on earth we create spirits, who have no self-awareness but still a survival instinct. In their drive for self-preservation, the spirits we have created can prevent us from escaping old patterns or rising out of the death consciousness. You will be given a very practical guidance on how to overcome the influence of the death consciousness and take your path to the point, where you begin to lock in to the stillness behind the babbling of the ego. This teaching helps you rise above the collective struggle and flow with the creative energies of the Holy Spirit or the River of Life. The book also contains a practical exercise for learning how to make more conscious use of the creative energies of the seven spiritual rays. You will be invited to attend the spiritual retreats of the Chohans, who are the teachers of the seven rays.",
