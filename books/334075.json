  "description": "Saint.Virtuous. Kind. Patient.These were words never associated with Gabriel Saint.He was a monster. The devil that haunted the city of Redhill.And he had found me.I’d managed to hide for a while from my past, present and future.But I should have known they’d come looking, after all I had the heir of the city in my arms, and if there is anything I do know about the ruling crime family of this city, it’s that family comes before all else.When Gabriel comes for me, I fight but know it’s useless, and when he forces me to be his wife, I vow to make his life as miserable as possible.But there was something about the man. Something I wanted to unravel, pick apart so I could find all the pieces that made him who he was.What I found was not what I expected.He wants my heart.He wants me to his wife in more ways than just that piece of paper that binds us.And the more time I spend trapped with the mafia boss in his clifftop house, the more pieces of me he steals.But with this life comes blood and violence, and there was someone determined to make us pay.No Saint is a standalone dark mafia romance. It contains kidnap and a forced marriage theme which may make some readers uncomfortable.This book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.",
