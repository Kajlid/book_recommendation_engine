  "title": "Killing Richard Dawson",
  "description": "'The phone rings. It s Jesus. I listen to him speak and then hang up...' In this darkly comic, slow-burn thriller, reality is blurred... nothing can be taken for granted. A gripping and poignant black comedy about love, friendship, booze, morality, death... and a generation s casual dissatisfaction with modern life. Sometimes, redemption lies in the darkest of places. You don t need to die to destroy yourself.",
