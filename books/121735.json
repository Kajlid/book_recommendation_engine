  "title": "Diamond Dogs",
  "description": "Don Collins is the author of \"Old Watchdogs,\" an aclaimed first novel where he introduces Tom Newberry and Barry Noonan, two hardnosed former detectives from NYPD's Fugitive Warrant Squad. When Newberry retired he opened a detective agency just to have something to do. But when a serial killer terrorized unsuspecting women in northern Queens he picked up the scent and he and Noonan joined the chase. Newberry's relentless, unconventional, and often maddening style brought criticism from high ranking police brass. But he had done his homework and, in time, his detractors had to admit Newberry was onto something. In \"Diamond Dogs\" the hunt is personal. When Noonan's nephew, Jack McGuire, a Manhattan attorney and former star pitcher for St. John's University goes missing, Newberry and Noonan do what they do best, and soon the chase is on.",
