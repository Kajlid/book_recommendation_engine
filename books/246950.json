  "title": "Changing Trains: One boy's journey of discovery across 1980s Europe",
  "description": "Sam had doubts about everything when he was 19! He had no idea where he fitted into the world, what he was going to do with his life, or how to deal with that 'small' issue of being gay? As older Sam boards a train to the Continent for the weekend, a chance encounter compels him back to that time of uncertainty and how he dealt with it. This sun-kissed, life-affirming coming-of-age adventure will take you on a journey from the present day back to the 1980s, as uncertain and unworldly Sam Interrail's across Europe in search of adventure, answers and self discovery. Changing Trains is a fictionalised memoire that will transport you back to that glorious time just before mobile devices, the internet and social media changed the world - and one boy's journey of discovery and sexual self awareness. Sam’s story will take you on balmy trek across France, Spain, Monaco and Italy in the late summer of 1985, with a fab soundtrack in the form of Sam’s Walkman. As well as being based on a true story this novel was also partly inspired by Christopher Isherwood's Berlin Diaries. Had Isherwood been a young man in the 1980s he would almost certainly have gone Interrailing, too. If only 'for the boys'This sensual, funny and evocative story is the perfect escape from wherever you are right now.",
