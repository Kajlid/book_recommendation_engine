  "description": "“Some moments are like bruises...Dark and deep and so malformed that even once the color fades back to normal, when the blood flattens and the bump erodes and you begin to recognize the skin as yours again, you remember the moment it happened. That unexpected pain. And you do your best to avoid it forevermore.”  In the second installment of the SPELLSPINNERS saga, Lily’s worldview is rocked by fear, mistrust, and heartbreak, as she deals with the fallout from the night of her enchantment.  Someone powerful is determined to keep her and Logan apart. But who? And why?  As the covens prepare to do battle in the Solstice Stones, the lines between good and evil, dark and light, begin to blur. Allegiances are called into question. Trust is broken. And all Lily knows may just be an illusion.  Will the star-crossed lovers unearth the seeds of betrayal before it’s too late? Or will the witches and warlocks of Melas County be forced to say goodbye to their magic—and any chance of reconciliation between the covens—for good?  In THE GLEANING, nothing is as it seems. And Lily and Logan will have to tread carefully if they hope to uncover the truth in time to save their love and break the curse.",
