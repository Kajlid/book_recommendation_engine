Far from her younger days as a New England preppie and Oregon hippie, the challenges of farm work daunt her. She befriends an Australian shepherd, reflects on her spirituality, and muses on the man she left behind. Elizabeth grows stronger, facing self-doubt, while she maintains her humor and ekes fun where she can. When tragedy strikes Elizabethâ€™s adopted family, she summons belief in herself and becomes the leader they desperately need. NONFICTION",
