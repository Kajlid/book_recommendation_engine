  "description": "The city of Hell. That's what Hell is now, an endless metropolis bristling with black skyscrapers, raging in eternal horror. The moon is black and the sky is blood red. Screams rip down the streets and through alleys. The people trudge down sidewalks on their way to work or to stores, just like in other cities. There's only one difference. In this city the people are all dead.But two living humans have discovered the greatest of all occult secrets. They have the ability to enter this city of the damned, with powers beyond those of even a fallen angel. One plans to foil an unspeakably diabolical plot. The other plans to set it in motion - and bring all the evils of Hell to the land of the living.",
