  "description": "An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here.Tamara never expected to be the center of a love triangle, especially one involving a ghost. As she grows increasingly attracted to long-dead Cal, her co-worker, Dex, pays closer attention to her. Awkward.For fifteen minutes each night a portal opens in her barn and a horde of ghosts spills into her yard. She and Dex work together to find a way to help Cal and the thousands of spirits stuck in the void to cross over. When she learns she has the ghost touch—the ability to touch the ghosts as if they were corporeal—and she accidentally helps a little boy cross, she believes it might be possible. But not all the spirits play nice and when they learn they can sip energy from her ghost touch, they become greedy putting her life at risk.Each time Cal has to pull her from the mass of ghosts, her touch restores him more and more until he is at danger of being stuck on earth—forever, which is very enticing to Tamara the better she knows him. Will she and Dex figure out how to help the spirits cross and if they do, will she be able to let Cal go?",
