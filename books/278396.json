  "title": "Venice Carnival",
  "description": "he Venice Carnival is recognised world-wide as a symbol of all that is lavish, passionate and original in costume and design. It has always been a feast of the senses, a human machine which interprets the world through allegory using themes from the seasons, the cosmos, the elements, mythology, history, politics and culture. The illustrations capture the fascinating decadence of the contemporary Venice Carnival. Expressions, gestures, damasks, brocades and colours are manifested like ghosts, shadows and reflections with the use of a photographic technique that evokes the traditions of Venetian painting, changing carnival imagery from the postcard to the art document. The photographer gained access to private palaces and parties to record the images. The essay analyses both the ancient and modern significance of carnival in Venice. Historical and social documents from theatrical literature, chronicles, descriptions from travellers of old and laws and punishments invoke the true essence of the significance of the carnival to the people of Venice.",
