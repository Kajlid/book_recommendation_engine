  "title": "Want to Go For a Ride In My Spaceship?: The Nathan Daniels Saga: Act 1",
  "description": "Captain Nathan Daniels had the best lifestyle in the modern galaxy. As an independent trader he set his own schedule, selected his own cargo, and had the freedom to visit any of the kingdoms, empires and fiefdoms in known space. He even had the best pick-up line of all time: \"Want to go for a ride in my space ship?\"  After leaving a small mining colony on the moon of Droshai, just outside of Kalifet space, he receives a summons from the Empress of the Kalifet Empire. The fact that the summons is delivered by two military cruisers both ensures his compliance, and piques his curiosity.  Little did he know how much this summons would change his life...  ***This book contains the complete text of The Nathan Daniels Saga: Parts 1, 2 & 3, which have also been released separately!***",
