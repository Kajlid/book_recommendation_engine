  "description": "After a war with human hunters, Kingston Sebastian was left with a pack of not only normal shifters, but that of hybrid shifters who had been products of human experimentation. As the son of the almighty alpha pair of the Phoenix Pack, Kingston had set upon a mission to guide hyrids just like himself into the safe haven that was his pack. However, no one told Kingston the difficulties he would encounter in not only building a pack but helping to nurture hybrid wolves who had no idea of what they were to become. Instead of facing the battle of enemies, the members of the pack found themselves facing internal battles. Would it become too much of the pack to survive? The Legacy will either rise up, or completely crumble into nothingness in this spin off tale from The Phoenix Pack and Next Generation Series.",
