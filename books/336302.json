You know the one I mean, right?It’s not just the natural-born talent that cascades from him in musical waves when he's on stage, and it’s more than drive, more than passion.It’s the one indescribable thing I can’t nail down for myself, and the man I despise more than anything right now, is throwing it away like it’s nothing. It’s infuriating.He’s infuriating.I didn't expect to spend so much time with him, near him, on this tour. And so, when the opportunity arose to escape to the quiet of the cabin, I took it. Only for the self-obsessed prick to turn up not long after. Now, I can’t escape him and the reminders of the week we shared, what feels like a lifetime ago.He’s got what I want, what I need. But can he help me find mine? And do I even want him to?Defying Ella is a steamy rockstar romance. It is the fourth book following the Rhiannon men and the fourth in the True Platinum Series.
