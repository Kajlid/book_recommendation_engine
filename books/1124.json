  "description": "When Anna is dumped by the love of her life, the perfect guy, the only one in the world who truly meshes well with her, she is devastated. She’s angry, she wants revenge, and most of all, she wants him back. But when life throws her a curve ball in the form of Miguel, literally The Boy a Few Houses Down, Anna thinks she can be happy again—or is her heart just playing tricks on her?“This book is exactly what teen lit should be—smart, funny, and filled with all the thrilling firsts that shape girls into bright, young women. Readers will love Anna, a refreshingly offbeat heroine, because for all her quirks, she speaks in a voice that’s strong, clear, and true.”-Candy magazine",
