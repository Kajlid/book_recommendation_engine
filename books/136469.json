  "title": "Christmas Slaughter",
  "description": "Genetically engineered to fight mankind's wars, murderous mutant soldiers have instead made war on their creators-brutally enslaving the human race and obscenely perverting its most sacred traditions. To celebrate their grotesque parody of Christmas, the laboratory-bred monstrosities are rounding up human beings for processing in a garish, ornament-bedecked slaughterhouse. And now rebel leader Max Turkel and his tiny band of guerrilla fighters must sabotage the hideous enterprise and disrupt the mutant masters' happy Horrorday... before every last surviving man, woman and, child on Earth is ground up into bloody bits!",
