  "description": "Lisia Fariel only wants to go home. She’s willing to try anything to get there. She never expected to meet a large Aridi male or to feel such a connection to anyone, much less someone so handsome, dominant and possessive.Jarritt E’Sain’s clan has been under attack and in desperate need of help that never seems to stay long enough to do anything. Finding a female Aridi helping the United Defense Alliance gain access to the planet is surprising, but even more so is the connection he feels to her. He’s not going to let this beauty slip away from him when the tie between them is so strong.Lisia’s determined to resist his attempts to bond them together, but Jarritt isn’t making it easy to ignore the attraction. Toss in the threat of space pirates and suddenly “complicated” takes on a whole new meaning.",
