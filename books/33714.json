  "title": "Scotch Whisky: A Liquid History",
  "description": "New in PaperWhisky is widely considered the finest spirit in the world--and this is the definitive history of the \"water of life.\" Written by the editor of Whisky magazine, and Scotland's leading writer on the subject, it's the perfect blend of anecdotes and pioneering research. Superb illustrations help tell an intriguing story that goes back as far as 2000 B.C., and that includes a cast of fascinating characters who smuggled, bribed, conspired, and advertised with a vengeance to turn whisky from a common man's drink into a proud part of the Scottish national heritage. Unfolding decade by decade, it presents names such as John Walker and Sons, Glenlivet, and Macallan, providing a treasure trove for the whisky connoisseur or anyone interested in a really good read.",
