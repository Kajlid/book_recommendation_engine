  "description": "Luke: After my parents died when I was eighteen, I found that running from my problems was easier than dealing with my feelings— even if it was as drastic as moving across the country. After a while, I realize that the loneliness doesn’t cut it for me anymore, and I end up back in small-town, Tennessee, trying to find my roots. Instead, I find a cute, feisty caterer that I can’t stop thinking about after she covers me in cupcakes. Literally. No matter how hard I try, I can’t stop thinking about Nicole and that scares me because suddenly I realize that I’d do absolutely anything in the world to keep her in mine.Nicole: I’ve never been one to do what is expected of me. Like conforming to my mother’s beliefs that I should act a certain way, settle down, get married, and start having babies. It’s not that I’m against the idea— it’s just not for me. Or at least I didn’t think it was until a hot, new stranger comes to town and practically sweeps me off of my feet. Suddenly, settling down doesn’t sound so bad. Just when I think this could be my happily ever after, one knock on the door changes absolutely everything.***All the Right Ideas is a steamy small-town romance. It is book six in the series but can be read as a complete standalone***",
