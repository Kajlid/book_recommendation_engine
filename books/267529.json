  "description": "Who ever thought that life after an apocalyptic event would be easy?   Charley is under pressure. The demands of her new community are piling on stress after stress and, even with her developing magical skills, she's finding it hard to cope. Things aren't any better for Monroe - his grief and guilt over what happened to his werewolf pack are overwhelming him. When dead bodies start to appear across the city, they're going to have to work together to prevent more killings. But whether they'll be able to survive together too is anyone's guess.   This is the second book in the City of Magic series.",
