Free to explore life for himself without the worries of being a future king, unlike his older brother Vasileios, who has just felt his soulmate bond for the first time.But it all comes crashing down in flames when Vasileios inadvertently breaks his bond, leaving the throne unprotected, and ends his own life out of shame.Now the former Master of the Hunt is thrust into a new role, a new life, with expectations he's never had placed upon him. And the lingering fallout of his brother's actions may have left the throne in permanent jeopardy, making Olympio and the entire royal family overly diligent about keeping the scandal quiet... and preventing those who would overthrow them to take Sefaera for their own.THE FIRST Before Gabriel ever goes to college and meets \"Ollie,\" he was just a normal kid, trying to figure himself out. Well, as normal as a billionaire's son could be. And long before he ever made his presence known. Prince Olympio has been watching Gabriel from the shadows, protecting him and their magical connection so that, when he comes of age, they can consummate the bond. But that protection isn't without hurdles--big ones. Olympio may be in for more than he bargained for, and Gabriel is wildly unprepared for the twists life throws at him.",
