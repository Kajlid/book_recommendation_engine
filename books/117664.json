  "description": "‘Fascinating, darkly humorous and horrific: not one for the feint hearted’ - FourFourTwo MagazineThe Games we Love to HateThe local derby isn't just about football, it's about pride, and being able to hold your head up when you go to work on Monday morning, and knowing your lads are better than the other lot. Sadly, the opposite can also be true. The scum up the road can ruin your entire season in ninety gut-wrenching minutes. However, what happens on the pitch is only half the story…From Britain's most authoritative writers on football hooliganism comes a fascinating examination of the passions and emotions that are an integral part of the local derby. Derby Days takes a frank but often humorous look at why these games are so important to supporters and examines the lengths to which many will go to put one over their local rivals.",
