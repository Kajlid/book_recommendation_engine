But he made a promise, and his word is his bond.When a looming deadline forces these clashing creatives to live under the same roof, an unexpected attraction threatens everything they think they know about their paths—and each other.Maintaining distance is impossible, so they draw an invisible line between them, and all that’s allowed to cross are the words they share.And it’s working.Almost.(The Hope of You is an open door, standalone novel, with a guaranteed HEA. Please be advised: this story explores sensitive subjects surrounding mental health, cumulative/integrated grief, and parental abandonment/loss of a parent—that may be triggering for some readers.
