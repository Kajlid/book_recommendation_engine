  "title": "The Merleau-Ponty Reader",
  "description": "The first book to offer a comprehensive view of Maurice Merleau-Ponty's work. The Merleau-Ponty Reader collects the essays necessary to understand the core of this critical twentieth-century philosopher's thought. Of great interest are the previously unpublished working notes found in Merleau-Ponty's papers after his death and several essays that appear here in English for the first time. The editors also have provided an introductory overview of Merleau-Ponty and the works included herein and have updated all English translations. By situating Merleau-Ronty's writings on the philosophy of art and politics within the overall development of this thought, this volume allows readers to see both the breadth of his contribution to philosophy and the convergence of the various strands of his reflection.",
