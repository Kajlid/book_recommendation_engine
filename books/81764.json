  "description": "A divided land. A shaky truce. An unforgettable adventure. Cimari's history is rife with magic; the verdant land exists because of the sacrifices of its first settlers. For centuries memory of that sacrifice, and respect for it, kept peace in Aeir's western half.But the power hungry, as they always do, must rise. Under words of peace, and finally admissions of war, the Tigers swept across Cimari and conquered the other prides one by one. Only the island of Ayari, and the Leopards who guarded its ancient relic, stood against them in their march south.Generations later a leopard princess, Kaia, was born with the rare all-black coloration that has marked great members of their line for eons. She, at the will of her father, is chosen to invade the Tiger fortress in a way she would never have forseen - a way that would change her life irrevocably, and the outcome of which will determine the fate of her people and all Cimari.",
