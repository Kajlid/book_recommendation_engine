  "title": "Magenta Rave",
  "description": "Before the #MeToo Movement, Magenta Rave sought justice for sexual assault survivors. When she couldn't get that, she got even. Like Lisbeth Salander in The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo, she doesn't kill the perpetrators. She just makes them wish they were dead. But who is Magenta Rave? Is she more than one woman? Eyewitnesses describe her as a petite blonde, a loud buxom redhead, and an awkward boyish brunette. Detective Simone Rosenberg and her good-hearted, good-old-boy partner, Marty Sloan, are assigned the case. Their investigation leads them into a world of shattered women, paramilitary wackos, and the outer boundaries of their own hearts and minds. This fast-paced, character-rich, and often darkly funny novel will keep you guessing as it careens wildly towards its startling conclusion.",
