  "title": "Making a Difference Memoirs From the Women's Movement in India",
  "description": "The autonomous women's movement in India is remarkable for its energy and staying power, and for the impact it has had on progressive social change in the country. What constitutes a feminist memoir? What makes it different from any other memorable recounting? Twenty women who have made a critical contribution to the women's, and women's studies, movements recall the last quarter century of activism, taking as its starting point the impossibility of separating the personal from the political, or the private from the public. Each memoir vividly covers the most momentous and memorable developments and campaigns of this period, recounting its triumphs and disappointments, speaking about alliances forged, reflecting on relationships lostâ€”and found. Their inspiring, poignant, humorous and always politically engaged memoirs are not just personal stories, they are a quintessentially feminist recall of a movement they helped to shape. Memoirists include: Indira Jaising, Vandana Shiva, Kamla Bhasin, Bina Agarwal, Uma Chakravarti, Vasanth Kannabiran, Gabriele Dietrich, Pamela Philipose, Sheba Chhachhi, Saheli, Norma Alvares, Ruth Vanita, Devaki Jain, Nalini Nayak, Meera Velayudhan, Roshmi Goswami, Nirmala Banerjee, Vibhuti Patel, Ilina Sen, Ritu Menon.",
