Now I’m left running in a red gown and heels to escape the horror of an ambush wedding, and I’ve inadvertently trapped a hot man in a suit in the elevator with me. Only me. The woman with a permanent seat on the Hot Mess Express. Though the mystery man turns out to be a dream at hailing a cab and making a girl who’s down on her luck have a magical night in New York City. I wouldn’t mind a little makeout under the mistletoe. But when the ice skating is over will there be a future or a miss with fate?**This is a holiday rom com prequel to the sexy and fun book Halftime Husband, featuring a grumpy boss and a heroine down on her luck.",
