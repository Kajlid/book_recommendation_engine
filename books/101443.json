  "description": "\"Fatty Patty\" is the cruel nickname that followed Pepper to high school graduation. Five years later, she's back at her reunion to prove it hasn't defined her. In her slim Kate Spades, she'll show them all - her underachieving classmates and especially the boy who broke her heart.But Pepper's not the only one who's changed in five years. She's not the only one who has regrets about the things that were, and especially weren't, said.And she's not the only one who plans to use this chance to rewrite history...FATTY PATTY is the first in a series of new short stories set around the crisp green San Juan Islands in Northwestern Washington. Refreshing as an iced vanilla latte and local as a salad with Ranch dressing and sesame seeds, these stories capture the essence that every journey - no matter how far - is truly about finding your way back home.",
