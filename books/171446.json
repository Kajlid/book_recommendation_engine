  "description": "Twenty-something Australian Brooke Reynolds works as commissioning editor for Sydney-based popular fiction publishers Horizon books. One morning, she stumbles across a manuscript submission from a would-be author entitled \"The Last to Know\", a contemporary story about the interconnecting lives and loves of three women based in Dublin. At first, the novel reads like a feel-good, light-hearted tale about life, friendship and the problems modern women face; exactly the kind of book Horizon usually publish. But when Brooke tries to contact the author with a view to offering her a publishing deal, she proves strangely difficult to locate. And as Brooke becomes more and more absorbed in the manuscript, she gradually realises that there is a lot more to this story than meets the eye. Who is the elusive author of \"The Last to Know\", and what story is she really telling",
