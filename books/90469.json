  "description": "This book, Vol. 3, is part of \"To Move A Mountain - The Series.\"The origin, energy, and dispersion into the cosmos, it was quite a voyage. Now, the work begins. Arrancies returns from the origin to life and with him, purpose and clarity come to us from his experiences. He draws from the source of our being, the energy, to bring messages of death, life, and our purpose in the universe. We gain insight into love, our reason for being, education, and many other notions of life facing us daily. The story of our creation and continuance after death at last revealed. We have inspiring ideas of our current world and a vision of our potential future. Enlightening visions present themselves, such as the binary mind and the human concept. Everything we need to move the mountain in our life, invoke thought, and feed our curiosity with fresh ideas.",
