  "description": "Twelve-year-old Josephine has a lot on her plate, best friend issues, first crush issues, divorced parent issues, twin brother issues . . . and then her mom hits her with news that shakes her to her core: a breast cancer diagnosis. Josephine doesn't want anyone to know, not even her best friend. Sharing the news means it's actually real, and that's something she's not ready to face. Plus it would mean dealing with the stares and pity of her classmates. She got enough of that when her parents split up. Unfortunately for Josephine, her twin brother, Chance, doesn't feel the same way. And when Chance dyes his hair pink to support his mom, the cat is out of the bag. Suddenly Josephine has to rethink her priorities. Does getting an invite to the party of the year matter when your mom is sick? And what if it does matter? Does that make her a monster?",
