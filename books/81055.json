  "title": "The Killings",
  "description": "The year is 2570, the world is overpopulated and countries have taken action to reduce the human footprint. The United States Precursor has established an inhumane means to decrease the American population; he simply imprisons adult-aged criminals and sends juvenile delinquents to coliseum-like death traps throughout the country. In each of these groups, freedom and presidential pardon will be granted to one individual, the one who finds the exit. Sixteen year-old Nova Deans is sentenced to the Colorado Coliseum where she encounters other criminals, neurotoxins, mind games, and most importantly, love. Nova made the biggest mistake of her life when she chose to walk out of the coliseum and left love trapped inside. In this fast-paced novel, Nova is a fugitive traveling from state to state in order to enter the Colorado Coliseum once more to save her true love, if he isnâ€™t already dead. Will the Precursor interfere with her quest?",
