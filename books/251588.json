  "description": "Carol Ann continues to join the other women in the Fat Fridays group for their Friday lunches—no calories counted—and to help one another deal with life’s complications. With her unexpected pregnancy and the support of the women in the group, Carol Ann breaks free from her dismal life with her parents. Left on her own with no support from the father of her child, she decides to start an interior decorating business on the side. She begins by secretly helping Ed Pritchard, her boss at MacTel, decorate his condo for Christmas. One Secret Sunday leads to others. Carol Ann and Ed are planning a future together when trouble arrives. Ed is diagnosed with a serious illness and decides it’s only fair to break off his engagement to Carol Ann. Devastated, Carol Ann wonders how she can continue. But all their Secret Sundays bind them together to bring about a new beginning when he joins her for the birth of her baby. The women in the Fat Fridays group celebrate in style as they prepare a special surprise Ed has arranged for Carol Ann, and she has the home she’s always wanted—and deserved.",
