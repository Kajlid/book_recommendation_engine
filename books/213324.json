  "description": "Glyn, former bodyguard and companion to a dragon lord, is now Lady Glynnes Janaleigh, a dragon lord in her own right. And she has found her intended mate. But, her new-found happiness is fleeting. Finding your mate is only half the battle. Keeping them alive is the other.  For a dragshi, duty is more than administering justice or saving the innocent. More than one suitor has fallen from the sky during a mating flight. Even worse, fate decrees mating fights don’t always involve the partner you want.  Vengeance takes many paths. The leader called the Parant means to have his, no matter how long it takes or how many innocents die in the attempt. For the last two unattached dragon shifters, their only weapons to survive their destinies are their swords—and love. Sometimes not even dragon fire and talons are enough to overcome the mind control wielded by the leader called—the Parant.  Book Four of the Dragshi Chronicles continues the tale of the dragshi, a human who can exchange bodies with a dragon. But the freedom of the skies comes with a price.  Although the stories in the Dragshi Chronicles are connected, each book stands alone as an individual read",
