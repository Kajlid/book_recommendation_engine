  "description": "Shy-me has cost me too many opportunities in the past.So when Evan and Trevor offer to keep me company at an anime convention, I’m done hiding in my shell. I’m going to be a new, bolder me. Things escalate quickly, leading to me posing for a scorching set of photos with Evan, while Trevor mans the camera.Best. Decision. Ever.The more time I spend with the two best friends, both in public and private, the harder it becomes for me to ignore my growing feelings and attraction for them. And I definitely can’t imagine going back to who I was before.But am I really the person I’m pretending to be? If I can’t get the real me to please stand up, and convince Evan and Trevor to do the same, we’ll lose out on more than just incredible chemistry.",
