  "description": "When thirty-one year old Carrie is over-extended, exhausted from work, and trying to pull together the perfect birthday for her child, she ends up on the kitchen floor, lying in a sticky mess of splattered cupcakes, wondering how exactly she had gotten to this point in her life. A candid memoir, Burnt Cupcakes-a Memoir of Marriage, Motherhood and Madness, is the story of a young woman who is struggling to balance her marriage, two babies, career and home, not to mention all the social pressures that accompany raising a family in a close-knit community, all while not losing herself along the way. Presented with truth and humor, readers of Burnt Cupcakes will respond with recognition and empathy to an honest and genuine, but not always pretty, depiction of contemporary marriage and motherhood.",
