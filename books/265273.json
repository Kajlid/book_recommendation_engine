  "description": "My name is Erela, which means angel. Literally. As a member of the Michael family, I've always been destined to join the Order of the Seraphim, the highest and most prestigious angelic warrior class, on my eighteenth birthday.  But then I make a hell of a mistake the night before my initiation ceremony by pissing off a tricksy Archdemon. As revenge, he plonks me right into the middle of the Order of the Fallen, the worst possible place for an honorable celestial warrior like me. Mostly because I find myself surrounded by four dangerously wicked—and, let's face it, hot—fallen angels who want to tempt me to stray from my path.  Now, I must find a way out of this hellhole so I can get back home and fulfill my fate as a warrior against evil. Unfortunately, the four devious males have no intention of making it easy on me. In more ways than one. And, if I give in to my growing desires, I will never be able to join the Order of the Seraphim. Or even go home at all.  Instead, I will fall.  Ruinous is a full-length reverse harem fantasy novel.",
