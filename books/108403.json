  "description": "Superstitious . . . straight-laced children's author Braeden McKay? Leprechauns and cluricans and the kissin' of the Blarney? For sure and certain, she believes! Braeden is three-quarters Irish after all. She dutifully keeps the woven cross of Saint Brigid attached to the wall above her bed. And by all that stands right and true, she should have stopped her friend from stealing the nickel off that hoodoo woman's grave in a New Orleans Cemetery. At the very least, coaxed Angie put the nickel back. Now Braeden hasn't a clue where the confounded coin is. A ruthless mugging, deadly accident, betrayal and murder. Multiple murders! Misfortune plagues her. Will the handsome New Orleans detective, Sanderson Montgomery, be her salvation? Can love, the very entanglement she's fought so hard to avoid, be the one force greater than any adversary â€” even a hoodoo curse?",
