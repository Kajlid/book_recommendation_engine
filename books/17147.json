  "description": "The Shadowmoon is a small, unobtrusive wooden schooner whose passengers and crew are much more than they Ferran, the Shadowmoon's lusty captain who dreams of power; Roval, the warrior-sorcerer; Velander and Terikel, priestesses of a nearly extinct sect; and the chivalrous vampyre Laron, who has been trapped in a fourteen-year-old body for 700 years.They sail the coast, gathering useful information, passing as simple traders. But when they witness the awful power of Silverdeath, an uncontrollable doomsday weapon of awesome power, they realize they must act. But every single king, emperor and despot covets Silverdeath's power. It will take all of their wits and more than a little luck if they hope to prevent one of these power hungry fools from destroying the world. Their only advantage? The Shadowmoon .While it seems to be little more that a small trading vessel--too small for battle, too fat for speed-it is actually one of the most sophisticated vessels in the world, one that allows them to travel to places where no others would dare. They can only hope it will be enough to save them all before Silverdeath rains destruction across their entire world.",
