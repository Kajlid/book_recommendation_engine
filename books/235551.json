But her latest manuscript is different—more serious, more personal—and she’s sure it’ll be her breakout book . . . if it ever sees the light of day.Zachary Easton holds Nora’s fate in his well-manicured hands. The demanding British editor agrees to handle the book on one he wants complete control. Nora must rewrite the entire novel to his exacting standards—in six weeks—or it’s no deal.Nora’s grueling writing sessions with Zach are draining . . . and shockingly arousing. And a dangerous former lover has her wondering which is more torturous—staying away from him . . . or returning to his bed.Nora thought she knew everything about being pushed to your limits.
