His hips stay pressed flush to mine, his length lost inside of me. My jaw falls open, and I see him watching me, waiting for me to make a noise. My eyes lock on his, while sinful sensations swirl through my body, building tighter and higher. He slowly adds more pressure, teasing and pulling my nipples tighter and longer. The heat in my stomach sears through my body. It makes me shift my hips and try to fuck him, but he stills me.\"TRYST Vol. 2 & 3 are on sale now.",
