  "description": "You will be taken through Psalm 91 verse-by-verse, unfolding the promises of protection from God. While there are other promises of protection found throughout the Bible, Psalm 91 is the only place in the Word where all of them are brought together in one collection.Along with the author’s in-depth teaching, this book is full of heart-wrenching testimonies from servicemen who have seen firsthand God’s protective hand. Testimonies include those who survived a Nazi prison camp and have endured the turbulent times while fighting recently in Iraq, as well as a story from legendary author Corrie Ten Boom.Come and understand God’s protection and become inspired and encouraged from those who have seen His protection firsthand. We will remember that the Lord has not made us to fear but to have power, love, and a sound mind.About the AuthorPeggy Joyce Ruth and her husband, Jack, are former pastors at Living Word Church in Brownwood, Texas.
