  "description": "Hidden in the red-light district of Moscow, tucked away behind the strip clubs and brothels, lies one of the mostly closely guarded secrets among the wealthy upperclass of the same-sex persuasion. The exclusive, members-only Club Rimska is no common gay bar. The powerful men who come there expect total discretion and to be served by the most beautiful boys in the city. They all have money and they all have secrets.  Young Mishka works at Club Rimska and one of his clients seems to have more secrets than most. He says very little, but he pays very well. He demands most of the pretty dancer’s time and attention. Mishka brushes off his fixation as harmless, until one night the powerful man decides that ‘most’ is not enough. He wants ALL of him.  Kidnapped and imprisoned by a psychopath, Mishka must now do whatever it takes to make the powerful man happy- no matter how degrading or humiliating. His captor is determined to punish him and thereby ‘save’ him from his wicked, sinful ways (whether the young stripper wants to be saved or not).  Days pass, and then weeks. Brutality turns to tenderness and obsession begins to resemble love. Mishka becomes more and more confused about his own feelings towards his mysterious captor. Is it Stockholm Syndrome or something more? And how does the man know all of Mishka’s deepest, darkest secrets? What secrets is he hiding in turn?  This unique story by best-selling author Amelita Rae is not for everyone. It explores the most twisted versions of love and dares to shine a light on the darkest corners of the human heart. You will not forget the Fallen Angel. ~55,000 words",
