  "description": "Realism lends humor and relevance to the story lines enacted by Ã¼bernerd Jason Fox and his family in the enormously successful syndicated comic strip FoxTrot. Unafraid to tackle timely topics of the day, FoxTrot finds wry humor in such issues as SARS, video game violence, boy bands, Internet music piracy, and a multitude of pop culture themes.In fact, FoxTrot is so inextricably intertwined with pop culture that creator Bill Amend was interviewed in the premiere issue of The Lord of the Rings Fan Club Official Movie Magazine, thanks to a series of strips about Jason's fanatical excitement over the movie trilogy. And not only does FoxTrot incorporate pop culture into its story lines, the strip has actually become a pop culture It has been used as a question on the game show Jeopardy! and as an answer in the New York Times crossword.Am I a Mutant, or What! is the newest FoxTrot collection, featuring strips that ran from late 2002 through mid 2003. Amply documented as a favorite with readers, FoxTrot runs in more than 1,000 newspapers, and previous FoxTrot books have sold more than two million copies.",
