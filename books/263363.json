  "description": "The storm is over, but going home may be the most dangerous adventure of all.With the storm dispersed and the blood mages defeated, Cora and Damorin set off on their deferred honeymoon. But their personal lives get put on hold yet again when the classified details of their desert mission are splashed across the Estorian Empire’s leading tabloid. To allay the suspicion heaped on him as a new sand mage, Damorin takes a prominent position as the crown prince’s bodyguard. But this entrance into the royal family thrusts Cora into a world of darkness and intrigue beyond anything she imagined—and with the leaders of the blood cult still at large, even her wind magic may not be enough to save her.Shaun and Faryn’s plans for happiness are also overturned, when Shaun accepts an undercover mission that threatens both his life and his love for Faryn. Faryn has more to deal with than a broken heart, though—enrolled at the empire’s most elite school for magic, she’s received orders to get close to the son of a proven blood mage. The more she gets to know Gavan Minato, the more Faryn wants to believe him innocent of his father’s crimes. But her compassion for him may be blinding her to the truth. Because Gavan’s interest in her goes far beyond her pretty face.As the noose of intrigue tightens, Cora and Faryn must fight against the knives in the dark—to save themselves, to defend the ones they love, and to escape a betrayal so deep it could fracture the heart of the empire.",
