  "title": "After Man: A Zoology of the Future",
  "description": "The time is 50 million years from now. The place is the planet Earth. Man has long been extinct, as have most of today's dominant species. Some continents have moved into different climatic zones as a result of natural geological processes, and new kinds of animals have taken over the earth's surface.In this remarkable book Dougal Dixon, a palaeontologist specialising in evolution, presents his amazing vision of the animal world of the future, but bases the vision on the known principles of evolution.As Desmond Morris writes in his Introduction, it is the way in which Dixon \"has perfectly balanced his vivid dreamings with strict scientific discipline that makes his book so successful and his animals so convincing\".The superb full-colour illustrations, in the manner of a 19th-century naturalist's sketchbook, enhance the immediacy and credibility of this inspired description of future life on earth.",
