  "description": "In this special collection, compiler Stephanie Nettell has selected material dealing with the birth of Christ, the enjoyment of Christmas as a family event, the traditions of giving and receiving and how Christmas is so very different in other places and in past times. The collection includes old favourites from A A Milne and Ogden Nash, contemporary verse from Michael Rosen, and classic Christmas stories from Charles Dickens and Laurie Lee. A stimulating mixture of the familiar, the unexpected and the completely new, this is an anthology for all the family to enjoy.",
