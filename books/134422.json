  "title": "I Want a Hug",
  "description": "From the zany imagination of John A. Rowe comes the story of a little hedgehog-like creature named Elvis, who just wants to be hugged. Poor Elvis is so prickly that no one wants to go near him. “Please,” he asks, “won’t someone give me a hug?” Everywhere he goes he sees hugs—in the city, in the park, in the forest—but no one anywhere will give him one. Just as he’s about to give up, he hears someone crying out, “Won’t someone give me a kiss?” It’s Colin the crocodile, and he’s so ugly that no one will kiss him. The two become instant pals, with hugs and kisses aplenty. Here is an adorable book about what it means to reach out to someone.",
