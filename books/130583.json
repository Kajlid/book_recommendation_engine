  "description": "An ancient and malignant evil seeps through the decaying walls of a deserted building in the heart of old Edinburgh. Like a ghost from the past it haunts the dark alleys and streets of town as its influence poisons friendships, creates discord and leads to murder... This is Major Weir's dark legacy to the town he called home. When one bookseller is murdered and another accused of the crime Robert Young of Newbiggin is called upon to help and has to use all his talents as an investigator to try and save an old friend from the noose. Unfortunately when all the evidence points towards his guilt is it already too late?",
