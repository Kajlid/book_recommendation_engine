  "description": "What do you do when the whole world has seen you getting down and dirty in a broom closet?I, Elle Evans, am on the run.Not from the fuzz—although that would be more exciting.No, I’m on the run from the four-year-old private tape that, thanks to my vengeful ex, has probably already ruined my vlogging career.There’s nothing like the entire world knowing what you look like mid-O.Creek Keys, Florida, is a million miles away from NYC and the perfect place for me to hide for the rest of summer until I can figure out what I’m going to do.Something that’s easier said than done since my new landlord’s daughter thinks you’re God’s greatest gift. Even better? Their beach house is right next to the one I’m renting, so there’s no getting away from her—or her hot, British dad.Who most definitely does not think I’m role model material.He might be right.The problem is that neither of us can say no to her.Or each other.",
