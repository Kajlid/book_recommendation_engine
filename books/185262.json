  "description": "“Fact is, I’ve been in Las Vegas for like eighteen hours already and am no closer to figuring out where Leah is. Almost a whole day down the tubes. And all I’ve done is run around my hotel suite and look out the windows and press the buttons to make the curtains open and close automatically and order room services and take baths in my Jacuzzi tub. Oh, and discover a dead guy and stab someone and accidentally steal evidence from a crime scene.” What small town sleuth Samantha Stone lacks in credentials, she makes up for in above-average deductive logics and superior mission-solving skills. Or so she thought. After accepting a mission to track down an almost-famous wealthy royal heiress, Sam finds herself lost in the glitziest, most glamorous city of all – Las Vegas. It doesn’t take Sam long to realize that Sin City isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Despite five-star treatment from her new boss, Sam somehow winds up on the seedier side of town. The part filled with murderers and Las Vegas mob gangs and a kidnapping that isn’t as straightforward as it initially seems. Not to mention the crime scene that somehow has Sam’s fingerprints all over it and the sexy-yet-dangerous detective that has Sam firmly stuck at the top of his suspicious characters list. Soon, Sam ends up in a race against the clock, desperately trying to solve her mission and clear her name before she runs out of time…or loses her life. Discover what critics are calling one of the most hilarious new series to arrive on the mystery scene as Samantha Stone navigates her most dangerous mission yet.",
