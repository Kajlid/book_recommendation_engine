  "description": "Rockstars live by their own set of rules…and these guys are no different.Cruel. Privileged. Sexy.The summer alone with four rockstars in a beach house sounds like a dream come true.Wrong.What I thought was going to be my big break ends up being my own personal nightmare. I’m not learning about music. I’m not making music. I’m a glorified babysitter for one of the hottest bands around.Worse yet, they despise me.I’m their servant, not their assistant, and because I need this job, I can’t even fight back…Until I do.Trust me, I won’t let anyone take my big dreams away, especially not the four guys who do everything they can to make sure I know my place is not next to them.",
