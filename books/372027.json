  "description": "What is the HEMO10 Virus? This is a completely new disease... It is a hemorrhagic fever... It is a violent and aggressive virus... We do not know where it originated... There is no vaccine or cure... When restrictions on travel between counties are suddenly imposed in the United Kingdom, the residents of York don't worry too much, despite the rumours seeping out via the international media. It's only when a complete ban on travel and martial law is brought in, that people start to panic; and see first hand for themselves just what the world's governments and health organisations have been hoping could have been avoided. For this is a virulant and very sudden pandemic. Survivors in one of the city's suburbs gradually realise just where the disease is headed, and are forced to accept what is expected of them if they are to survive this plague.",
