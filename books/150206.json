  "title": "From Both Sides, A Look into the World of Foster Care from Those Who Know It Best",
  "description": "Recommended for ages 13+. Written by a foster parent, this book explores the emotions, issues and experiences that accompany being involved in foster care. Split into two sections, this book lets the foster kids tell things from their side and then flips around and looks at things from a foster parent's point of view. The information in this book was collected from the author's personal experience fostering children in her home and from multiple interviews and conversations with foster parents, current foster youth and former foster children.Written in a personal, open and brutally honest prose/poetry form, this book will hopefully bring comfort, encouragement and a sense of familiarity to those involved in the foster care system. It is also a great resource for those who wish to learn more about the foster care system and the unique challenges and experiences that foster children and foster parents go through everyday.",
