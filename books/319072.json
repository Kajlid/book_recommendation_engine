  "description": "Pressured to choose a husband, Katrina Van Tassel inadvertently creates a crisis moment between suitors Brom Brunt & Ichabod Crane. The bloody aftermath leaves her wounded & abandoned on the Old Church Bridge, helpless to the oncoming Headless Horseman. This steamy romantic version of Washington Irving's original tale incorporates a sassy Katrina, the Celtic myth of the dullahan (headless riders), and some beloved romance tropes to create a novella you'll want to read annually around Halloween!(Previous edition contained brief mention of slavery due to the time period, but the updated edition does not contain any mention of historical slavery.)",
