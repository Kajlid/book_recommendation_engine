  "description": "Katelyn Tod, known as Kate to her friends, lives a high-powered life of intrigue as an assassin for the CIA. It's a glamorous life, traveling the world, living on the edge every day. Kate slips in and seduces her targets, then escapes without a trace. But the one thing that Kate can't escape is her family. Her parents own the only funeral home in rural Kentucky, and when they call Kate home to help out with the family business, she has no way to refuse. So Kate takes a leave of absence from her secret career and returns to small-town Kentucky for just \"a few weeks.\"Those few weeks turn into more than Kate could ever imagine; her parents announce that they are parting ways, leaving Kate in charge of the funeral home and to deal with her more-than-slightly off-kilter relatives. If that weren't enough to handle, she is also tasked with guarding someone in her tiny town who just happens to be in the Witness Protection Program. All without anyone knowing what she really does for a living.Kate trades her glamorous, high-powered life for a small-town, odd-powered life, and the two collide in ways that make torture look like a spa day. Criminal plots meet local quirks in a hilarious series of mystery and misadventures.",
