Soon he’ll be Merrick’s apprentice again, just like when they first met. But instead of healing arts, he’ll be learning the life of a vampire.  If only the otherworldly apothecary didn’t seem more miserable about it by the day. How can he resist the passion waiting to explode between them? What dark secrets from the past still hold him captive? And what does it all have to do with his old friend, that miserable, ruthless French fop, Theo?  Set in the shadows of New York and Boston after the events of Merrick.  Also by Claire Cray: Merrick Thirsting for More (short story) Backwoods Beast (short story)",
