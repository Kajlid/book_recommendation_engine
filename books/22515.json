  "title": "The Treasury of David: Spurgeon's Classic Work on the Psalms",
  "description": "C. H. Spurgeon's enduring classic, The Treasury of David , has long been regarded as the most comprehensive pastoral and inspirational study of the Psalms ever written. Originally released in seven volumes, Spurgeon's work has been carefully abridged by David O. Fuller in this accessible, one-volume edition. As Herbert Lockyer observed, this edition gathers out \"all the jewels\" of this great work, presenting more than 4,000 quotes from notables such as Augustine, Calvin, Luther, Bunyan, Matthew Henry, and of course Spurgeon himself. Ideal for devotional reading or sermon preparation, The Treasury of David contains \"some of the greatest and grandest words of comfort and inspiration that have ever been penned\" (from the preface).",
