  "description": "He wasn’t supposed to come back.For years I’d lived my normal small-town Texas life in peace and harmony.So imagine my surprise when one normal afternoon, the one man I could never forget wanders in. Troubled. Alone. And drinking his worries away.If that’s not bad enough, another tall, dark and dangerous stranger wanders in. This one though... this one causes real trouble.I don’t need or want a hero. I don’t need or want the trouble that both men cause; even if it’s in completely different ways. But Ford Gentry isn’t one to sit on the sidelines, he’s the one that always has your back. Not only that, when it comes to matters of my heart, he was playing for keeps. And my heart was willing to take the chance.",
