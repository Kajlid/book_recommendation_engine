  "description": "What enemy could be more terrifying than a soulless, alien machine?  A year ago the Kher Empire was forced to retreat, but they were not beaten. In ORION FLEET they return with a new weapon. A huge ship driven by AI begins methodically grinding inhabited worlds to dust. This unstoppable enemy is without fear or remorse, and the Rebels begin a desperate battle just to slow its advance.  Leo Blake takes Earth’s first warship into space to find a counter to this deadly new attack. The Imperial Fleets take notice of Earth’s interference, and they’re intent upon revenge. Even if he wins, Blake might have doomed our homeworld.  ORION FLEET is the second book in the Rebel Fleet series, Military SF by bestselling author B. V. Larson.",
