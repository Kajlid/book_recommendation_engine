  "description": "Big, burly and bristling with high-powered weapons, Vlad and Slava are the best bodyguards and hostile environment consultants Russian money can buy. They’re also about to meet their five-foot match. Government veterinarian Jane Ransom expected explosives, shelling and bad-tempered ewes while working in Russia’s war-ravaged Caucasus mountains, but nobody warned her about excessively hot Russian bodyguards. Or long hours spent sandwiched between them in a backseat designed for two. Too bad for the Russians that Jane’s learned the hard way about men and commitment, and would sooner be run over by a troika than succumb to lust. But while their client might be reluctant to take a risk of the carnal variety, Vlad and Slava have her firmly in their sights, and neither will abandon their mission to keep her hostage in their bed until she surrenders and realises she belongs to them—for keeps.",
