  "title": "The War on Women",
  "description": "In 1973, Sue Lloyd Roberts joined ITN as a news trainee and went on to be the UK's first female video-journalist to report alone from the bleak outposts of the Soviet Union, China and Iran. During her 30-year-long career she travelled the world and witnessed the worst atrocities inflicted on women. But in observing first-hand the war on the female race she also documented their incredible determination to fight back.The War on Women brings to life the inconceivable and dangerous life Sue led, it tells the story of Mary Merritt who was imprisoned in a baby laundry in Dublin, and of Monica, who was trafficked and forced into the sex trade in Bosnia. She gives voice to Maimouna, the woman responsible for taking over her mother’s role as the village female circumciser in The Gambia and provides a platform for the 11-year-old Manemma, who was married off in Jaipur at the age of six. From the gender pay gap in Britain to forced marriage in Kashmir and from rape as a weapon of war to honour killings, Sue has examined humankind’s history and takes us on a journey to analyse the state of women’s lives today. Most importantly she acts as a mouthpiece for the brave ones; the ones who challenge wrongdoing; the ones who show courage no matter how afraid they are; the ones who are combatting violence across the globe; the ones who are fighting back.Sue sadly died in 2015, shortly after writing this book, today she is widely recognised as one of the most acclaimed television journalists of her generation. This book is the small tribute to the full and incredible life she lived and through it these women’s voices are still being heard.",
