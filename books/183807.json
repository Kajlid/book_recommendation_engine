  "description": "A New York City love triangle forms the center of a literary universe peopled by a Guardian Angels-like vigilante group, a Chinatown cowgirl, and ex-leather queen, a real-estate mogul, and, at the center, Kate, Peter, and Molly, as they confront love in the time of AIDS. The film Rent stole most of its best plot points from this novel.",
