  "description": "I was the average daughter. The troublemaker. The side character in my sister, Mona’s, story. My sister was a Prodigy, endowed with exceptional skills and bonded with a guardian. In a world where all leaders, scientists, and artists are selected and pledged to shifters, she was born for greatness. I was born to live in her shadow. In a moment of rebellion, I trespassed on pack lands and an alpha guardian shifter, Theo, bonded to me. Tragedy makes me reject the pairing. They say I am a Prodigy now--someone special. I think they’re wrong.Theo is protective, overbearing, and gets under my skin. He knows me better than anyone else. It takes everything I have to keep the wall around my heart built up. I refuse to ever trust a shifter. I refuse to fall in love with my rival.But fate comes in phases. Once a nobody, now a hero. Once an enemy, now my forever.",
