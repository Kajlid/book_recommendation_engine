Best described “...'Hobbit meets Game of Thrones'...” ★★★★★ This is a can't-miss series!***THIS SERIES IS NOW COMPLETE***Ten thousand years ago, the gods themselves forged weapons of war unmatched by any mortal steel. Most were lost to the mysteries of time. A few...were not. Cyrus Davidon, a warrior on the ragged edge of poverty, leads a trio banded together with others into a dragon's den in search of adventure – and gold. When things go terribly wrong, a chance encounter with the guild of Sanctuary saves their lives and brings Cyrus into a world he has only imagined. But all is not rosy in the ranks of Sanctuary; betrayals are brewing, and tensions within the guild threaten to destroy them as a shadowy villain begins collecting the weapons of the gods for terrible purposes. Paired with a beautiful, caustic elf named Vara who harbors a mysterious secret, Cyrus must brave the lands of Arkaria and find out who is pulling the strings before Sanctuary, and the land of Arkaria, are destroyed.What readers are “A thrilling fantasy, that leaves you guessing until the last page. An adventure with dragons, swords, and trolls, I only wish it was longer.” ★★★★★“Crane has blended action, adventure, mystery, magic, suspense, even a little romance into a wonderfully rich tale of heroes conquering evil and going on through impossible odds to triumph.” ★★★★★Includes the first three volumes of the Sanctuary Defender, Avenger, and Champion.",
