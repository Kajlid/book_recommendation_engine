  "description": "At many times keeping our lives in perspective is difficult for anyone, but it is especially hard around the holidays. We become overwhelmed and forget what really matters. What should be a time of celebration and reflection turns into a time of stress that has little to do with spirituality. Now, world-renowned psychic Sylvia Browne has put together a beautiful inspirational book to help readers get into the spirit of the holidays by reminding them of the joy and love that surrounds us in the Afterlife. With chapters on Forgiveness, Celebrations and Anniversaries, Family, and Life's Purpose, among others, Sylvia Browne tells uplifting stories of those people she has helped and imparts the indelible lessons of the Other Side that can make our life here on Earth happier, healthier, and more spiritually fulfilling.",
