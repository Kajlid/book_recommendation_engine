  "description": "Asmodeus, Prince of Hell, just wants to play music. Jazz, specifically.Unfortunately, he’s a demon, and he’s supposed to be evil. A career as a musician isn’t exactly an option.And he’s cursed, to top it all off.Sick of playing by the rules, Ash and his brothers escape Hell in search of freedom on Earth, only to discover it’s harder than they thought to keep their enemies off their tail. The four rogues quickly become the Underworld’s Most Wanted, and if they’re caught… The consequences will be dire.Everything changes for Ash when he meets a beautiful violinist who can see through his curse. It must be too good to be true, but he can’t resist the temptation.No matter the risk, he has to have her.Evangeline Gregory is just your average human. She works at a jazz bar, plays gigs on weekends…And, apparently, hallucinates demons.At least, that’s what she tells herself happens when, moments after she meets the man of her dreams, she sees him shift into a seven-foot-tall, red-skinned monster.Not believing her own eyes, Eva decides to investigate and soon finds herself caught in the middle of a supernatural clusterf**k of epic proportions. But Ash isn’t the only one keeping secrets, and the search for answers reveals a shocking truth that will change the course of her life forever.Or maybe just doom it.My Funny Demon Valentine is a steamy paranormal romance about learning how to love (and what love is in the first place) with an HEA, clothes-ripping-hot love scenes, and a crew of devilish demon brothers who are supposed to be the bad guys.There’s violence, sex, and too much swearing. You’ve been warned.",
