  "description": "Haven escaped the clutches of the new Sun Sovereign and found solace in Shadoria, but for how long?  Now that the extent of her powers is known, Solis, Noctis, and mortals all hunt her. Meanwhile, chaos reigns across the land. The immortal realm is ruled by a depraved King who will stop at nothing to reclaim Haven as a weapon, while the mortal lands must choose between serving a tyrant or following Prince Bell, the Kinslayer.  And below, in the Netherworld, a great evil awaits, amassing an army of untold powers.  Hunted, plagued by doubt, and torn between duty and love, Haven must find a way to broker peace between the nations before itâ€™s too late.  Welcome to the Kingdom of Runes where immortals and humans clash, light and dark magic reign, and mythical creatures lurk in the shadows. If you like fierce heroines, enemies-to-lovers romance, wild plot twists, and endearing characters that stay with you long after you reach the end, you need to discover the book readers are calling dark fantasy at its best. Just make sure to clear out some space on your calendar first!",
