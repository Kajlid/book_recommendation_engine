  "description": "He’s the worst mistake I’m dying to make.Shane - I’m on the cusp of achieving my dream promotion to the C-Suite of a major financial corporation, when Cole, the CEO’s grieving, broody son, stumbles into my life. Cole has made me question everything from my sexuality to my goals. He’s unlocked new desires I desperately crave. Large hands and a commanding voice calm the storm in my head. I’m addicted even though he could absolutely ruin my career. Failure at my job isn’t an option; clinging to success has kept me sane. Love defies logic. Cole - There is no second chance at love. Not since I buried my heart with my husband. Shane shouldn’t matter because I’ve sworn off men. Unfortunately, I’m obsessed with big brown eyes, a square jaw, and a pink flush. Shane is too young, too innocent, and too smart to get involved with me. But when he begs, I cave, agreeing to teach him and give him what he needs. Now we’re in too deep- either I’ll destroy his heart or he’ll destroy what’s left of mine.The Truth of Loving You is an LBGTQ romance: MM, bisexual awakening, age-gap, second chance at love, off-limits, mental health representation, and light spanking.",
