  "title": "The Fate of Mercy Alban",
  "description": "Grace Alban has spent twenty years away from the stately Alban House on the shores of Lake Superiorâ€”for reasons shed rather forgetâ€”but when her mothers unexpected death brings Grace and her teenage daughter home, she finds more than just her own personal demons haunting the halls. Family secrets, a packet of old love letters, and a lost manuscript plunge Grace into a decades-old mystery about a scandalous party at Alban House during which a famous author took his own life and Graces aunt vanished. Her mother had intended to tell the truth about that night to a reporter on the very day she died. Could it have been murder, or was she a victim of the supposed Alban curse? With the help of the disarmingly kindâ€”and attractiveâ€”Reverend Matthew Parker, Grace must uncover the truth about her home and its curse before she and her daughter become the next victims. This suspenseful mystery skillfully skirts the boundary between the paranormal and the psychological.",
