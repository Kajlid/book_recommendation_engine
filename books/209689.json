  "description": "“Over the years writing the Shadowhunter books, Magnus Bane has emerged as one of the most fun and fascinating characters for me to bring to life,” Clare says in a release. “He’s always had a lot of secrets — there are so many things we don’t know about Magnus, from the story of his first love to the secrets of his parentage, to the beginning of his relationship with Alec. All those are things I was able to touch on in The Bane Chronicles, but I’m excited to dig in even more deeply in these three volumes devoted to Magnus, his past, his future, and his present.”Says Chu, “I am so excited to contribute to the world that Cassandra Clare has created. These books and characters are iconic, and Magnus is a fan favorite. I can’t wait to give them all the things they deserve. And probably a few they don’t. Sorry, Magnus.”",
