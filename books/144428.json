A love that stands the test of time. Thea Valentia spent her entire life following the path others had decided for her until an unexpected tragedy forced her to carve her own.After she abandons her life in the royal court of the Faraway North, she embarks on a perilous journey in search of the magical castle from her childhood memories and the little vampire prince she had once called a friend. Instead she finds a lethal man with an inescapable destiny and a sentient castle that is determined to bind them together.Hector Aventine spent his entire life loving Thea from afar, and when she left him behind, he thought he would finally be free of this torment. But as tragedy thrusts them together once again, he finds his longing for her to be burning greater than ever, and that there is nothing he wouldn’t do to keep her safe from the dark and dangerous world he was born into.As the two of them are left with no choice but to lie their way into vampire society, they fall deep into a world of deceit, betrayal, and the worst kind of bloodlust.  The Vampire Castle in the Sky is a standalone adult romantasy about the dark path of grief and the rare love that lights the way through it.",
