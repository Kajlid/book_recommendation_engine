  "description": "MAXWELL, Part 2  As the trial becomes an emotional battle ground – within the courtroom and without – Max struggles to maintain his resolve to resist his heart. But as it becomes more and more evident that Horatio’s heartbreak over losing Max isn’t healing, but in fact growing worse, Max begins to question the choices he made so long ago.  Encompassed by inner fears that he doesn’t fully understand, Horatio continues to hide the truth from Max and cling to Seth. But Seth’s compassionate and selfless heart won’t allow Horatio to give up his dream of Max – even if Seth must give up his own to make it come true.
