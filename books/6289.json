He can't find a single trace of them, but he does find Vasiliy Federov, the sweetest-smelling man he's ever met. When Vasiliy accepts his proposition for a night of sex, Nikolai is thrilled until the next morning when Vasiliy informs him that their lives are in danger. Better yet, somehow during their sexual escapades the previous night, they mated each other. Unfortunately, the danger to them is real, and a wolf hunter is bent on killing them both. When Serge Dmitriev attacks the house, Niko finds himself with another mate, one who has no idea he's a wolf. The man doesn't even realize that during his attack on Nikolai and Vasiliy, they forged a mating bond between all three of them that will only end in death. Now, Nikolai finds himself with two mates he never planned on having, a basement full of Tri Omegas, an insane Beta trying to kill him, and a band of hunters wanting their heads. If Nikolai, Vasiliy, and Serge have any hope of getting out alive, they will need to work together, and that means accepting their mating bond. But is what they might have together worth changing their entire lives? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
