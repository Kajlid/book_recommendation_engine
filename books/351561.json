  "title": "Tender: Volume II: A Cook's Guide to the Fruit Garden",
  "description": "Uniting the anecdotal charm of Toast with the intuitiveness and seasonality of The Kitchen Diaries, Fruit is Nigel Slater's definitive guide to seasonal garden fruits. Combining reminiscences from a lifetime spent working with and enjoying food, along with cultivation tips for the growing season, Fruit shows you how to use seasonal fruits in simple suppers and indulgent desserts. Organised alphabetically, each fruit is carefully considered in Slater's inimitable, unhurried warm prose, to give you an instinctive understanding of our heritage garden fruits. From a weekday supper of pork chops with cider and apples to a Chinese Sunday roast with spiced plum sauce and old family favourites of a deeply appley apple crumble to traditional fruit ices, Slater shows how the delicious flavours of fruits offer far more than simply being the inspiration for the occasional pot of jam, but are really the hidden gems in imaginative meat dishes and the backbone of successful home baking.",
