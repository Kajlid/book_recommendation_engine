  "title": "Under God",
  "description": "\"Statesmen... may plan and speculate for liberty, but it is religion and morality alone which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand.\" -John Adams. What does it mean to be a nation \"under God\"? Where have we been as a nation, and where are we going? Using unforgettable accounts of both famous and little-known Americans, Under God tells the stories of men and women of faith who forged our nation. Against these stories of light, the authors also examine the dark side of America's legacy so that a new generation might seek God's face and avoid repeating the sins of the past, for it is only under God that there will truly be \"liberty and justice for all.\"",
