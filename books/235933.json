  "title": "Jerzy Popieluszko: Victim of Communism",
  "description": "As Communism consolidated its victorious grip on Poland in 1947, Jerzy Popieluszko was born into a peasant farming family. Nearly 40 years later as European communism began to crumble, his mutilated body was dumped in the Wisla river. In life and death this young and unassuming priest, courageous beyond his means, lived in his flesh Christ's call to love the enemy, to overcome evil with good. This chilling reminder of modern-day totalitarian brutality is surpassed only by the overwhelming hope that the victory of the Truth, Christ Crucified, brings to today's world. This account includes many of his own writings.He was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.",
