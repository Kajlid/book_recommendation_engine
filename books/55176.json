He'll do anything to help Joan and Joey save their mother's ranch at Cricket Creek, even chase a bank robber. He's shy. He's so shy he gets Joan and Joey into hilarious, dinosaur sized trouble!Originally published in 1955, this well loved classic returns with all the original text by Evelyn Sibley Lampman and illustrations by Hubert Buel",
