  "description": "I was so close to getting everything I wanted, an internship with my Uncle, an officer with the special-ops team.If it weren't for a stupid boy that had to go and make me angry, causing me to turn a certain part of his anatomy purple and sparkly, I wouldn't have accidentally revealed to my family what I really was. What I had been hiding.Now, my father is making me attend the school he headmasters, a stuck-up elite academy that will never take a bodysmith like me seriously.Fate may have cursed me with six mate spots to fill, but that doesn't mean I need to tell everyone my true purpose for being at the academy.If I can survive the other petty circulators at the school that think they're queen bee, and hide my own status from everyone, I just might be able to find the six men that I don't really want.They might think I'm inconsequential, but I'm determined to carve out my own happiness, no matter what it takes.",
