  "description": "Big things are happening in small-town Wilfred, Oregon! The retreat center is open for its first workshop, the local café is done remodeling, and librarian and witch-in-training Josie Way is hosting her sister--and a few suspicions about the new killer on the loose . . .\n Josie is eager to show off Wilfred's delights to her visiting sister, Jean--even though Josie must conceal her magic from her. In any case, Jean is excited to attend Cookie Masterson's trademark \"Ready-Set-Go!\" workshop on becoming a life coach. Then there's the grand reopening of Darla's Café, where the doors are thrown open to reveal . . . a dead man, stabbed in the back. That was definitely not on the revamped menu... Even more worrisome, the sheriff receives a report of a fresh corpse at the retreat center. Maybe murder isn't so uncommon in Wilfred anymore, but two unfamiliar bodies within an hour certainly is! Josie's willing to let law enforcement take the lead--after all, she's gotten into some trouble from the hints the library's spellbound books keep feeding her about the patrons. But when her sister receives the killer's chilling calling card, she'll use everything within her otherworldly powers to divine just who in town has homicide as his new slogan . . .",
