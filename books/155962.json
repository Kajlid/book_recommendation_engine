  "title": "Rush Limbaugh was Right: Liberals who saw the light thanks to Rush Limbaugh",
  "description": "The 3rd edition includes stories from more Liberals swayed by Rush Limbaugh during the 2014 Senate flip. During his long and successful broadcasting career, Rush Limbaugh has become the role model for all conservative talk show hosts. His acolytes permeate the radio world, reaching into podcasting and a wide range of “New Media” outlets. While the liberal, Main Stream Media (MSM) slanders him with insults and abuse, he stands fast with a reputation for honesty, integrity and accuracy unparalleled in the news industry. Even some of Rush’s long-time fans may not realize that Rush has a history of showing liberals the light. He doesn't just help his self-proclaimed “Dittoheads” stand firm against the onslaught of a degenerate media and corrupt government, he helps liberals, moderates and lapsed conservatives alike see their way back to reason, rationality, and sanity. This book tells the stories of times the scales fell from a person’s eyes because of the education provided by Rush Limbaugh. Who could expect less from a man with “talent on loan from God?”",
