  "title": "Rivers Run Back",
  "description": "Rivers Run Back is a story of many lives spanning different continents, weaving together a fascinating tapestry. Shankar Chatterjee, born in a wealthy Bengali family, Marilyn Benson, an artistic but emotionally unstable girl struggling to find her balance in New York City, and Narsimha Sastry, an outcast born in a small village in India, despised by the grandparents who raise him.Into this fray are drawn the beautiful sisters, Padma and Leela, whose lives entangle with Narsimhaâ€™s until it becomes a question of life and death. It is a story of the Indian Diaspora, the search for the American dream, and finally a story of diverse cultures connected in such a manner that we realise that what finally does matter are universal, humane principles and values.The book is driven by both mythological and psychological themes that intersect and merge at the end.",
