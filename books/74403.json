  "description": "If Friday the 13th wasn't creepy enough on its own, imagine having the power go off all over the globe for thirteen minutes. Crystal had finally put the ordeal behind her when it strikes again, exactly thirteen weeks later on a 13th in April on a Friday.. There is a third Friday the 13th in the year 2012, and if the pattern continues it wonâ€™t be minutes or hours, there will be a global blackout for 13 days. Crystal has to find the connection as creatures that resemble storybook monsters, surface and start attacking people. A trip to Mexico leads her on quest not to just find answers, but for her and her family to stay alive. The clock is now ticking down to another date feared in legends, and she is going to find out the reason why. The Mayans were not the first to prophesize the impending doom of the year 2012. That prophecy came long before them, in the age of magic. Long have people feared it, and whispered of devils and its evils. The taint of magic ran deep before it was finally banished from the earth only now to return. The veil is thinning, and time is running out.",
