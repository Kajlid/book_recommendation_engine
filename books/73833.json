  "description": "Does your teen have you screaming and pulling your hair over stupid stuff? Does she make you feel you are wrong, when she is the one whose room is in violation of all health codes?Or is he following you around the kitchen and saying for the thirty-third time, \"There's nothing to eat.\" Then there are the fights over the serious stuff; stuff like coming home smelling like a brewery and making you think you are the reason the kid drinks. No one can push your buttons like a teen out to win what Katherine Gordy Levine calls the Gotcha Wars. Most of the parent experts will preach sympathy for the teen. Not Katherine. She's on the side of the parents and finally knows how parents can step out of the battle and turn them into a win/win for all.Katherine Gordy Levine is a certified therapist, mother of two and over a period of 12 years was foster parent to almost 400 troubled teenagers.",
