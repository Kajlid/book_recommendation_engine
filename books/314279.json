  "description": "In, The Angels of Discontent, there is once again an angelic revolt in heaven, but this time in another universe's heaven, and their God may not be triumphant. It's up to a legion of our own angels, sent by our God, to determine the outcome.  And speaking of heaven, in The Neighborhood Watch, does Jesus Christ have extraterrestrial origins? What was his link to Judas and Simon of Peraea? This short story may surprise many.  Could a battle pitting three sisters against the Jersey Devil be any more terrifying than four Lakota monster hunters in mortal combat against Unktehila, the most dreaded demon of the Sioux religion? The Devil and the Three Sisters, and Parasites on the Great Spirit will surely answer that question. Finally, what in the interstellar world is a young crewman thinking as he prepares to marry a girl from a planet circling Tau Ceti? Being non-human is only part of it. Her family is a bunch of eccentrics. Read, I Married a Womanoid from Tau Ceti, just for the fun of it.",
