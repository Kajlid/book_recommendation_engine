  "title": "When Celestial Dynamics becomes Kinematics Again - General Relativity",
  "description": "This e-book corresponds to Chapter 7 of the printed book entitled \"Galloping with Light - Einstein, Relativity, and Folklore\", and is the number 7 of the e-Series entitled \"Relativity free of Folklore\".Because you deserve more than just folklore, in this e-book you will find the surprising answers to the following intriguing questions:1) Why do we see the astronauts weightlessly floating inside the International Space Station, when at the altitude of about 350 Km where the Station is, Earth gravity is of course very strong and it is precisely (according to Newton) the reason why the station keeps rotating?2) Why is “General Relativity” referred to as a Theory of Gravitation? What does Gravity have to do with Relativity?3) What does it really mean to say that gravitation and acceleration are equivalent?4) Is the Twin Paradox a real paradox? If motion is relative, why is the traveler twin the one that is younger when they get together and not the twin that stays on Earth?5) Do you really age more slowly if you live on the first floor than if you live on the top of a skyscraper?6) What is the relation between Relativity Theory and the GPS navigation technology in our cars?7) Why was the Apollo 11 landing on the Moon so important for Relativity Theory?The fact that the reader may not have a scientific education does not mean that s/he does not have the intelligence to understand profound concepts -- as long as they are presented with semantic and epistemological clarity. After all, Einstein said that Science is simply the refinement of our intuition and everyday experiences.",
