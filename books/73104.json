  "description": "\"When do you know you are truly in love?\" An India Today Bestseller for seventeen straight weeks, Of course I love you! is a story set in Delhi, during the years 2006-2008, which revolves around colleges, nightclubs, relationships and friendships. It takes a dark and hilarious view on modern day relationships. Narrated in Debashish Roy's unsure, confused and testosterone induced voice, it takes a jibe at college time romances. The book takes you through the tumultuous journey of a young guy with raging hormones, relationship issues, and a forgettable past. Just as he struggles with life on these accounts, an exquisitely beautiful girl walks in to his life and wrecks it in ways more than one. Will he survive the ordeal? Will he come out stronger? Of Course I Love You! is a constant feature on the AC Nielson-Bookscan Top 250 books. Not for the prude, the book tackles issues faced by young adults in a brutally honest manner.",
