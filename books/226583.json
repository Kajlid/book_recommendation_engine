  "description": "Life is supposed to be easy and carefree when you're young, but if you live in Washington D.C., it's anything but. In the spirit of storytelling, the Urban Griot brings you Capitol City. Flashback to the 1990s as you enter the lives of three young black men looking to gain money, power and respect. These brothers come from different walks of life, but they have one thing in common: the desire to make fast money in the harsh inner city. But when the money comes too easily, there's usually a price attached... the ultimate price!",
