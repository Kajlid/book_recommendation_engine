Despite battling cancer, defeating death, and an overprotective family, he believes in promises of forever, enchanted encounters, and love at first sight. He knows his perfect girl is out there … If only he could find her.  Zadie Fisher doesn’t believe in love. At least, she doesn’t want to. Despite undeniable attraction, second chances, and resurrected hope, she doesn’t believe in soulmates, true love, or happily ever after. Not anymore. She knows falling in love is a mistake … If only she could avoid it.  But fate has a funny way of twisting things, and some mistakes are destined to be made.  Most fairy tales start with Once Upon A Time ... This one starts with a kiss.",
