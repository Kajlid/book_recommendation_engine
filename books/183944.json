  "description": "From the ashes of the Old World, M.O.T.H.E.R. rose to power. The government agency, Maiden Objectives Through Holy Effective Righteousness, brought with them the creation of the Six Daughters. Genetically engineered from the greatest female figures in all of human history, the Daughters were designed to be perfect soldiers. Through their powers of persuasion, combat, empathy, technology, biology, and invulnerability, they would be humanity's saviors - the ones who would reshape the world in M.O.T.H.E.R.'s image...until the day they broke free. The hardest lesson everyone must learn is that M.O.T.H.E.R. always knows best.",
