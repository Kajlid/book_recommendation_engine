  "description": "My name is Mia Beck, and I’m a lucky girl . . .Billionaire Damien Call didn’t magically stop being moody just because Jake and I moved in with him. Fortunately, I've devised a strategy. I inherited a share in an exclusive erotic club, and they’re beta testing a role-play game. Surrounded by period perfect detail, members pretend to be Edwardian lords and ladies . . . or stable masters, if they prefer.By switching up our dynamic, I'm hoping to smooth the snags in our otherwise fabulous menage. Neither of my lovers has trouble opening his heart to me, but I suspect Damien would benefit from exploring his dominant side, and he and Jake could be easier with each other.That’s my goal anyway. My plan might go up in smoke when Jake and Damien concoct their own scheme for me!The sequel to Beck & Call",
