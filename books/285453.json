  "description": "When Julia Hardin is hired to plan the local library’s annual fundraiser, it’s exactly the chance she needs to take her event planning business to the next level. With a shoestring budget and ridiculously tight timeline, it won’t be easy to pull off, but Julia has never shied away from a challenge before. Then again, she’s never met a challenge quite like Fergus MacNair, the town’s hot, grumpy librarian who’s determined to thwart her plans at every turn.Fergus is willing to do almost anything to bring in more funds to support vital library programming. But nothing about working with Julia, a woman who gets under his skin like no other, is easy. Not her bossy attitude, not her over-the-top decorations, and most certainly not the way she sparks an uncontrollable desire inside of him. But when she accidentally returns a library book with a sexy doodle of him for a bookmark, he realizes just how unprepared he is for this partnership.When Fergus discovers her doodle, Julia is certain this is one disaster she’ll never recover from. But when Fergus responds with a naughty drawing of his own, these complete opposites might just find a common language after all.",
