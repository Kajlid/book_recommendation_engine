  "description": "Twenty-three-year-old Ali Spencer is on the prowl for a man who can help her overcome her terror of sex. When she takes a graduate art seminar taught by the handsome and enigmatic Dr. Geoffrey Blake, she wants to take a trip into hell with the hot professor as a guide-hell in art, that is. But Ali might just have met the true Satan when her path crosses with that of Eric Damien, a wealthy and powerful businessman whose sterling reputation hides the dark side of the man: Damien is a man who blurs the lines between right and wrong and who decides he will have her at any cost. One woman, two men. Will the artist or the devil win? And who is who, false, or true?",
