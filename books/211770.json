  "description": "Something is stalking King City. The Elite is baffled by a string of bizarre murders in the same church where Amber killed a demon. She may be a newbie, but Amber knows there’s no such thing as coincidence. When she visits the crime scene, the murderer enters her mind and attempts to claim Amber for himself. Luckily for Amber, her demon mark isn’t willing to share. As if that wasn’t enough to deal with, now she’s seeing ghosts in the cemetery. And her attraction to Nic is rapidly reaching fever pitch. Caught between the worlds of the demon and fae, Amber must fight for her life before she loses her sanity. Whoever said being a Shadow Sorceress was easy never faced a pack of Heart Hounds. Sometimes, even the strongest magic can’t save everyone.",
