  "title": "The Mortal Messiah: From Bethlehem to Calvary, Book 4",
  "description": "This five-star book is the crown-jewel of Bruce R. McConkie's Messiah series. In the book, McConkie elaborates on the last week of the Lord's mortal life and his week of passions, the Crucifion, and the resurrection. The atoment is the fulcrum of the book, with its infinitude of belssings! Considerable time is spent on the Nephite ministry and the commentary on 3 Nephi is beyond priceless. This book is what the other four books in the Messiah Series was leading up to, and the Millenial Messiah is the catharsis. This book is wonderful, scholarly and HAS CHANGED MY LIFE",
