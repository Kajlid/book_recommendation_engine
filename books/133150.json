  "description": "Latino linebacker Emilio Madero has a huge crush on the new backup quarterback. He’s perfection in motion with his lean, muscled body and rich boy good looks. But there’s no way in hell Emilio is going to do anything about it. He’ll just have to be content with fantasizing about the guy of his dreams and watching him from afar, because hitting on another player is out of the question.That is, until Andrew turns the tables and makes the first move. Then all bets are off as the two of them drift into uncharted territory.",
