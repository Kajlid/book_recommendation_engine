  "description": "This collection of poetry is definitely dark but you will find no ghosts, goblins, or vampires hiding out. These poems come alive from the depths of the binding darkness that is found in all of us. Travel down the spiral to visit the barren heart of depression and the scattered mind. Sadness can be paralyzing, madness can be hilarious and together, they will be inspiring. These poems were written between the ages of 18-24. Out of print.",
