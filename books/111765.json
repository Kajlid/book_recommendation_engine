I looked clients in the eye and told them I'd get their shit done. And I did...\" Patrick doesn't do \"nice.\"At least, not anymore. After his fianc√©e cheats, he follows up with a one-night stand and a disastrous office hook-up. His business partner (Derek Alexander) sends him to the desert to get his head straight--and clean up the mess. While there, Patrick meets Elaine, and blistering sparks fly, but she's not looking for any guy. Or a long-distance relationship. Patrick's ready to do anything to keep her, but just when it seems he's changed her mind, the skeletons from his past life start coming back.
