  "description": "Sometimes, when we truly hope and dream and wish really hard for something, it will come true--the power of our imagination is a wondrous thing. If you've ever tossed a penny in the fountain or made a wish on the North Star, you know what I mean. There are so many ways to make a wish, and sometimes we will discover yet one more way from someone we meet along the way, like Nick in The Skipping Stone. Nick is an ordinary little boy fervently yearning for something extraordinary to happen. One day, on a family outing, his dream comes true in a rather unusual way. When Nick's wishful thinking finally pays off, could it be that he ends up with a special memento to remind him of his extraordinary day?The Skipping Stone contains two bonus sections in the back of the book, Did You Know? and How to Skip Stones.
