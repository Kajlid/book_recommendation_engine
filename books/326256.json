  "description": "Four kingdoms are locked in a horrible civil war—a war that, if lost, will surrender innocent lives to the power and control of King Kayne, the barbaric and bloodthirsty king of the South. The kings and queen of the North, East, and West have no choice but to join forces against the South if they're going to hold onto everything they hold dear.But the northern Queen's brother has a different ambition in mind, and sees the south as a route to power he wouldn't have had access to if he stayed where he was comfortable. While Kayne spends his time traveling across the Great Sea, seeking out herbs and potions to enhance his abilities, Kristofer rises amongst the ranks to become his right hand and leads the people in Kayne’s absence.Heartbroken and inconsolable after Kristofer’s betrayal, Elora, Queen of the North, realizes she will have to lead her army against her beloved brother if she is to do her duty and protect the people and land in her care. With the help of Rian, king of the West and Kristofer’s once closest friend, Elora must come to terms with Kristofer’s choices and what his actions mean for the strength of the South. With every passing day, Kristofer becomes more lethal, more powerful, and rumors of his atrocities spread like wildfire throughout the land.Can Elora and Rian deal the fatal blow in the last great battle? Or will the love they once had for Kristofer prevent them from taking down the most dangerous man in the nation?",
