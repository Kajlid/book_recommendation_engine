  "title": "Godzilla: King of the Monsters",
  "description": "Inspired by the 1954 movie Godzilla: King of the Monsters, this middle-grade novel recounts Godzilla's first appearance and treats readers to the story of his origins. Legends say twentieth century nuclear testing transformed the lone surviving Godzillasaurus dinosaur into a towering monster who can deliver an atomic blast with his breath and topple whole buildings with his tail--which is just what he does when he rises from the Pacific and pays his first visit to Tokyo, Japan.",
