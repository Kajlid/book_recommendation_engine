  "description": "There is darkness lurking inside us all. What would you do to escape yours? Nikki grew up in the Soldiers of Chaos Motorcycle Club and as far as women in MC's go she's somewhat of an anomaly. Nikki's one of very few patched female members in the existence of outlaw motorcycle clubs. Between club business and the long running love triangle between her, the club's VP and his best friend Nikki's life is complicated to say the least. Or at least she thought it was. Then she discovers her mother murdered. The event unleashes something dark that had been laying dormant inside her all this time and leads her down a dangerous path into the arms of an equally dark and powerful man. How far will she go to quiet the dark inside her? What will be left of her when she does? Walker 'Tex' King and Trace Deveraux have been in love with the same woman since they were kids. But she's no ordinary woman. She is the darling of their MC, the daughter of the club's man-at-arms and the strongest most stubborn woman they know. Their precarious balance is made more difficult by Tex and Trace's friendship and Nikki's unwillingness to break either of their hearts by choosing one over the other. They've nearly lost her once before and when she pulls away from them embarking on a mission of self-destruction the fight is on to bring her back. As events unfold they discover there is more to the murder of Nikki's mum than first appears. They begin to uncover an interwoven web of coincidences, lies and cover ups that will lead them to nowhere good. Chaos Abounds..........",
