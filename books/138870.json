  "title": "Fear of Falling",
  "description": "Every writer has a stash of short stories hidden in their drawer. Short stories are a great introduction into the publishing world because they teach a writer about deadlines, submission guidelines, dealing with rejection, and sometimes the joy of publication. Author D L Richardson has selected eleven of her favourite speculative fiction short stories for this anthology. At a time when she considered giving up, A Lesson In Time Management was published and reaffirmed her enthusiasm to pursue a writing career. Shortly following that small success, Mr Zodiac was published, and then Talking To Walls. Mr Zodiac was reworked and became The Twelfth House which was submitted in 2008 to a project titled Hollywood. Next Stop! The story never made it to the final cut, and it was re-edited for this anthology, as were most of the stories contained in this anthology. Some of these short stories were written for competitions, such as The Harvest Of The Damned, Falling Down A Rainbow, and A Watch Of Nightingales. Some stories were written simply to get an idea out of my head, which is really the birth place of all speculative fiction. The Puppet Masters is a perfect example of speculative fiction for anyone who wants to know; what happens to a character once a writer has created them and the story is over?",
