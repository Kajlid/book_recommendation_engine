Charlotte is one such human who has become renowned for her skill as an exceptional drink for vampires in an elitist club atmosphere where drinking blood and sensual pleasure is the norm.When Charlotte's best friend and co-worker, Charisse, drags her to a local mansion to interview as a \"personal drink\" to a local vampire, Charlotte isn't happy about it. Nor is she happy when she's selected by Alexander, the vampire who had actually refused her offer of a drink in her club only recently.Charlotte moves into Alexander's mansion and meets Nathan, his servant, who is obviously more than he appears to be at first glance. Is he more than human? Both Alexander and Nathan are handsome and she starts to learn more about their world than ever before.Nathan is clearly hiding something. His abilities are definitely not human and maybe that's part of his appeal. Charlotte meets more vampires and other people who exist in this twilight world. She learns more about herself, how she relates to others and the uncanny power she holds over the two males who co-habit the mansion with her. Intrigue, love, power plays, suspense, fear and seduction; all of these play out in various scenarios during Charlotte's \"relationship\" with her new guardian and his servant...but where will it lead to in the end? Only time will tell.",
