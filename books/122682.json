  "description": "The first in the Practical Potions series.Sella is tired of being a failure.She has a lovely, cozy shop—an heirloom from her mother—, a snarky feline familiar, and one, single friend to call her own. It should be enough. But Sella’s magical abilities left a stain on her hometown, and even years away didn’t repair her reputation. The life of a kitchen witch is rough when everyone thinks Sella’s magical blends of coffee and tea will leave them with boils instead of the intended “motivation” or “self-compassion.”But when a murder shakes the town and Sella’s best friend becomes suspect one, failure is a luxury they can’t afford. Luckily, the murdered woman—a confident ghost with a fiery determination for justice—is ready to help… and she’s more than Sella ever bargained for. With her friends, her familiar, and a bit of magic, Sella is ready to prove herself once and for all.Although, perhaps she should brew a strong cup of “courage” first.Just in case.",
