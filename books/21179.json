  "description": "Ethan Knight – sweet, Southern, striker. He spent the beginning of his career playing in Major League Soccer and with the US Men’s National Team. But an offer to play for a Premier League club – even a mid-level one like Stanmore FC – is too good an opportunity to turn down. He signs a new contract and in doing so, his ticket to a new life in London. It’s a whole new world for him, but Ethan has never let fear stand in his way, and he’s not about to start now. Especially not when he meets the beautiful legal assistant who gives him the strangest feeling…like they’ve met before. He’s more than ready to scale the walls around her heart to find out why. Billie Axton - aloof, Londoner, legal assistant at Stanmore Football Club. Stuck in a job she hopes will one day help her with her goal of a career in law. If only she could work up the nerve to actually apply to law school. But a dream that’s haunted her since childhood makes her so afraid to fail, she doesn’t even try. Not with her goals or her love life. No risk, no heartbreak, right? Right. Not even when the hot new striker shows up with his Southern charm and his generous spirit. And that odd nagging in her heart that she knows him from somewhere. All the more reason to keep her distance. They must navigate their feelings together, with plenty at stake – their jobs, the FA Cup, and most importantly, their own hearts.",
