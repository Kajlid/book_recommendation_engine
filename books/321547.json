  "description": "As one of the war heroes searches the oldest language in the ancient art of dance, he might discover the Intuitionist's power of finding answers to any questions.Missing memories might pile up if you encounter the Mesmerizer who stopped World War III with a four-minute speech, especially if he asks you to forget. Even if it’s the one and only purpose you have, you will forget it. For he has the voice. Kusha forgot what she found on the night of the High Auction.But the laws of the universe are painfully fair sometimes. Purpose always calls you, either through your dreams, or daydreams, even in nightmares … perhaps, through intuition? So the Intuitionist, Kusha, runs through the questions the universe throws at her. Each question leads her to her purpose. Her life as an unevolved, Ungraded citizen seems rich compared to those of her friends outside the walls who aren't even citizens. She wants to help her friends, but her questions, her past, her missing memories lead her to myths she never should tangle with. Most importantly, she never should encounter the war heroes who seek the Source among the devil’s scriptures and an old form of dance. Not when the dance calls her in dreams after what happened on the night of the auction.Welcome to Episode 2 of Wisdom Revolution.",
