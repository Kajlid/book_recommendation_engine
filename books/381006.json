  "description": "This 576-page deluxe, hand-numbered volume--a collectible edition limited to a single printing of 1600--pays homage to the creative and entrepreneurial spirit of the book business in the 20th century. In fond recollections of the titles that helped shape our culture, and the people and companies behind them, more than 100 prominent figures in publishing and bookselling recall their careers from the postwar period through the independent publishing revolution of the 1960s and '70s to the new millennium. Illustrated with original photography of vintage book jackets, archival photos and period graphics from Publishers Weekly, Among Friends reveals how the book business both reflected and responded to massive societal changes. Contributors include Tom Borders, Carolan Workman, Peter Kindersley, Jane Friedman, Dick Snyder, Chip Gibson, Daniel Halpern, Clyde Anderson, Jim Chandler, David Cully, John Sargent, Betty Prashker, Bruce Harris, John Cassidy, Lloyd Kahn, Joni Evans, Nan Talese, Esther Margolis, Sally Richardson, Constance Sayre, Jean Feiwel, David Godine, Jack Romanos, Nigel Newton, Robert Haft and Gary Hoover.",
