  "title": "The Adventures of Thomas Pellow: Three and twenty years in captivity among the Moors",
  "description": "In the summer of 1716, a Cornish cabin boy named Thomas Pellow was captured at sea by Barbary pirates and sold into human bondage to the despotic sultan of Morocco. This riveting memoir of a slave narrative is a story of pluck, and endurance in the face of barbaric splendour and suffering. A remarkable testament to the strength of the human spirit and to all those snatched from their homes and taken in chains to the great slave markets of North Africa. A bestseller in its day and a classic of slave literature.",
