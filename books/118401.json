  "description": "\"The Moon Realm Series combines the richness of Game of Thrones with the fun and wonder of Chronicles of Narnia. Perfect for kids, or anyone who loves mystery and adventure.\"Book Two in the award winning Moon Realm Series.It's the middle of the night, you need to send your brother to the Moon Realm, and he won’t wake up. So you improvise. . . . When a confused Jasper awakes, he's convinced he's dreaming. But by the time he meets Greydor, Jasper understands that this is no dream. In fact, persuading the King of the Rinn to work with the men of Dain to defeat their common enemy is a nightmare. Then there’s the other side of the coin: convincing Tavin and Dubb that saddling a Rinn isn’t certain death. (“It’ll be fun!”) And perhaps even a greater worry: can he make friends with Dubb’s daughter Darce before she punches his lights out?Lily has problems, too. There’s a little mousie scratching in her closet. Or at least, it sounds like a little mousie. Oh, and her second confrontation with Curse, and trying to form her first peerin. (Don’t you have to be from Dain to do that?) And where’s Ebb?One thing’s for sure: now that Lily and Jasper have entered the Moon Realm, nothing can ever be the same again.Illustrated by Carolyn Arcabascio. Volume One of the The Moon Realm Series.",
