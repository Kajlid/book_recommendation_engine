  "description": "The adventure began when a young British photographer, Kevin Muggleton, suggested driving from one end of Africa to the other–“You know, the old ‘Cape to Cairo’ sort of thing.” For the renowned feminist writer Ann Jones, it soon became an expedition with a to find the legendary Lovedu, a tribe ruled by a great rainmaking queen and dedicated to the “feminine” ideals of compromise, cooperation, tolerance, and peace.Setting out from Tangier in a battered old blue-and-yellow Land Rover, Jones and Muggleton face daunting physical challenges, from shifting sand in the Sahara to deep mud wallows in Zaire. They encounter severe food shortages in Mali, military roadblocks in Nigeria, and corrupt border guards all over. In Mauritania they meet a young girl who offers to give Jones her baby sister. As they pass through the ever-changing face of Africa toward a meeting with the Queen of the Lovedu, Jones is perceptive, funny, moving, astute–everything a good travel writer should be. You’ll feel you’re right there beside her, meeting the people, marveling at the physical beauty of the land, sharing in the grand adventure.",
