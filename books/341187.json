  "title": "Three Came Home",
  "description": "This book tells the experiences of a family imprisoned in a Japanese internee camp during World War II. In 1942, Japan occupied Borneo and the author Agnes Keith, her husband and their 1.5 years old son George were imprisoned in an internee camp. As a captive, the author used the keen eyes unique to a writer to observe herself, the captives around and the complicated Japanese who were both violent and gentle. This book records but never renders pains, observes the human nature but never attacks any individual; the author's writing is restrained and touching. In 1950, it was adapted into the same name film Three Came Home by Hollywood.",
