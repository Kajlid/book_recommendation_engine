  "title": "Gogol and the Ukrainian Night",
  "description": "The reader sees a different Gogol. Our contemporary loves entertaining stories about Gogol’s Sorochyntsi fair. In fact, his first book, Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka, offers an insight into the mysterious depths of human soul, which would become Gogol’s key theme.The book is a collection of pieces about Gogol, written for three decades: Gogol the romanticist and humourist, Gogol as satirical author and religious thinker, who took up a challenging mission of making Russia face Christ and putting it on the path of truth and law.This tragic figure, the split spirit, the martyr of crossroads, Gogol impregnated Ukrainian literature and gave rise to that kind of Russian literature which later rose to the global scene. His tragic gift of sensing metaphysical evil in the banal triviality of everyday life was prophetic, just like Khlestakov for the bolshevist epoch and Chichikov for the post-communist time.However, Gogol’s apologetic smile is a veil hiding a humourist, poet, and magician.",
