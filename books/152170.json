The success or failure of the strategy of the Sangyma rest upon their final, high resolve. Trecrogo holds firm with a secret purpose yet to be activated. Mojolo stands proud. The cockroach army are preparing for battle. The dragon brothers are bringing a Sagit√¶ to Zaqui. But Crilodach has Its own surprises and, as space collapses, It becomes even more deadly, ever more focussed and every second more determined.",
