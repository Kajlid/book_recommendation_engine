  "description": "**Preorder Special Pricing**Emily Finland, twenty-five, college graduate, hot mess, lover of all things cheese. Hasn't had a date in a year. Yeah, that's not something I would put in a dating profile. Ever. In fact, I can't be bothered to date. There are so many awful guys out there. I much prefer to Netflix and chill with a pizza. But of course, my busybody best friend Annie was having none of that. So she set me up on a blind date. Which I went on very reluctantly.Liam Montgomery, forty, rich, cocky, wears a rolex, likes expensive whiskey, completely out of my league. He was not who I would have chosen to have gone on a blind date with. Just because he was gorgeous didn't mean he would make a good boyfriend. Plus he was way too old for me. That didn't stop me from flirting with him though. Or from spending the night with him. One long very exciting night. That I'm never telling a soul about. Ironically, it turned out that Liam hadn't even been my intended date.Unfortunately for me, hot mess Emily, the biggest shock of my life was still to come. For while Liam and I should never have been, he's not about to leave my life quite that easily. You see I'm spending the holidays with my folks and Liam is also there. Only this time, he's not alone.",
