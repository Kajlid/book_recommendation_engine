  "title": "Buddhist Swastika Hitler's Cross",
  "description": "Does the Buddhist swastika encompass the same dogma touted by Adolf Hitler: SOCIALISM? Do Buddhists and Buddhism embrace socialism? Do some Buddhists hide links between the Buddhist swastika and Hitler's cross?  China requires Buddhists to support socialism and the socialist government. Some Buddhists in other countries support socialism too.  The swastika means \"well-being\" and \"good fortune\" from the Sanskrit language. All socialists believe that socialism is beneficent and produces well-being. Hitler believed that too when he touted \"socialism\" by the very word in his voluminous speeches and writings. Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, the Kim thugs and many others touted \"socialism\" by the very word. Millions lived in poverty and died under socialism. Do Buddhists perpetuate the same mistakes about socialism today?  Hitler tilted his symbol 45 degrees and oriented it in the direction of the \"S\" letter shape to emphasize it as alphabetical symbolism for \"socialism.\" Hitler also designed the \"SA\" symbol to show another \"S\" letter shape for \"sturmabteilung.\" The \"SS\" symbol for \"schutzstaffel\" is similar too. \"VW\" car symbols show alphabetical symbolism from German socialism.  Buddha was/is adorned with the swastika. Hitler was too.",
