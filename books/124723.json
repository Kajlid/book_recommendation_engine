  "description": "Wrangler is part Cherokee, and all Colson. He moved from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Apache Junction, Arizona to get away from a needy ex-wife, and to get to know a family he's only recently discovered existed. The MC known as Exiles welcomed him with open arms. After prospecting for a year, he's been a proud member of the club for about three years when he knocks on the door of the woman who will mess up his busy life. Celeste Skye is a psychologist with her own satellite radio show, which she runs from her house in the quiet little town called Gold Canyon. Her fiance is absent at best, and up to no good. She has no idea the man she called to rid her shed of a deadly rattlesnake, will ultimately save her from much more. The only thing Wrangler likes more than putting on a good reptile show, is a good cookie. Or cake. Or pie. If it's a dessert, he's all over it. Celeste opens her door and awakens his senses. Not only is she beautiful with her voluptuous curves and long waves of caramel colored hair, but she smells like cookies. What's a man to do when he's confronted with two of his favorite things all rolled up into one gorgeous package? Wrangle her in, of course.",
