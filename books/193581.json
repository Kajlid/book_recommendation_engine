  "title": "What God Can't Do: Keys to Prayer Power, Self Awareness, Love, Growth, Freedom, and Joy",
  "description": "Drawn from over thirty years as a Christian, teacher, pastor, and missionary, the ideas presented in \"What God Can't Do\" will help the reader experience the joy of overflowing prayer, and achieve unparalelled growth and freedom by focusing on what God will do. Jerry says, \"I love to ask God questions, and He never seems to get tired of answering them. One day I started putting some of the things we talked about down on paper, and realized that He was using me as a \"voice\" to bring hope, healing, and encouragement to both Christians and to people outside the Church.\" Written in a light-hearted, easy to read style, he presents totally unique and original insights into God's purpose and design in our lives.Pastor Jerry shares from his heart the \"secret of happiness,\" and talks about some of the explanations of God we have heard in church for years that are not accurate, and which hinder our prayers. His experience shows that most of our sickness, frustration, and relationship problems ultimately have a hidden spiritual root cause that can be readily discovered and addressed. Other topics hands-on prayers that work for physical healing, Forgiveness 101, exploring and listening to God, unconditional love, and much more. Also included is the prayer that God always answers immediately, and the one question we should never let God hear us asking (or even thinking).",
