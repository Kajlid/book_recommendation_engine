  "description": "Olivia’s hopes and dreams were shattered when her ex-boyfriend turned her world upside down. Now, working as a barista and battling PTSD, Olivia has lost sight of what she wants out of life. All she knows is that she longs to be free of the cage she’s been locked in for the past year. Jack Walker has a successful career, good looks, a dashing accent, and a mean right hook. But his tendency to bury himself in his work has made him forget how to relax and have fun. He would be lying if he said the cute barista with the bright smile didn’t make him want to take a chance on love again. But old wounds heal slowly, and he’s not convinced he can take another heartbreak. When a clumsy moment makes sparks fly, Jack and Olivia quickly learn they must set aside their fears and insecurities to be together. But looming behind their budding relationship is a shadow from Olivia’s past, and they soon realize there might be something to fear after all. Can they overcome all the hurdles this unwelcome guest brings?",
