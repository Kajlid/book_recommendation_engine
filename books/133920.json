  "title": "Triangulation: End of Time",
  "description": "What happens when you ask a bunch of writers to come up with stories based on the theme \"End of Time?\" Well, you get stories that are apocalyptic, stories that are whimsical, and stories that are whimsically apocalyptic. You get continents running amok, zombie stampedes, and cryogenic mishaps. You get hurricanes, killer comets, and all-consuming deserts. You get frivolous time travel, alien invasions, and trickster gods threatened by an eternity of boredom. In short, you get this anthology. Take a peek inside for stories that really mean it when they say \"The End.\" Featuring stories by Ian Creasey, Dario Ciriello, Tim Pratt, Jeff Parish, Idan Cohen, Jetse de Vries, Michael Stone, Kurt Kirchmeier, D.K. Latta, Ashley Arnold, Matthew Johnson, Rebecca W. Day, Trent Walters, Scott Almes, Jessica E. Kaiser, Terry Hayman, Katherine Shaw, Jared Axelrod, Sue Burke, and Geoffrey Thorne.",
