  "description": "“ The German Lesson marks a double triumph––a book of rare depth and brilliance, to begin with, presented in an English version that succeeds against improbable odds in conveying the full power of the original.” ―Ernst Pawel, New York Times Book Review Siggi Jepsen, incarcerated as a juvenile delinquent, is one day assigned to write a routine German lesson on the \"The Joys of Duty.\" Overfamiliar with these “joys,” Siggi sets down his life since 1943, a decade earlier, when as a boy he watched his father, constable of the northernmost police station in Germany, doggedly carry out orders from Berlin to stop a well-known Expressionist, their neighbor, from painting and to seize all his “degenerate\" work.
