  "description": "For over 150 years, from 1314 to 1485, England fought an almost continuous war with its neighbors. This period saw an unprecedented supremacy of the English army over those of its enemies. Reid proposes that the key to English success lay in its preparations and in its style of warfare, interweaving his analysis with a dramatic telling of the main events on land and at sea.",
