  "description": "Fourteen-year-old Freya is a Valkyrie: a Norse goddess, a reaper of souls from human battlefields. She has the power to cause death with just one touch. But Freya has not followed in the footsteps of the legends before her. She has been to the World of Man to befriend humans - and not to reap their souls. Now she must go to the World of Man again on a new quest to track down the runaway Valkyrie of legend. There she will discover a dark secret that leads her to the Land of the Frost Giants where she must take on new enemies. But this time she has friends to rely on, and lots more to gain ...and create a new VALKYRIE legend. 'Kate O'Hearn serves up a winning mix of modern adventure and classic fantasy.' Rick Riordan, author of Percy Jackson",
