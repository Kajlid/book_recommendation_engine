  "description": "Rachel and Daniel broke every rule in the Hunter book.Don’t turn humans into Hunters. Daniel did that when he saved Rachel from becoming a vampire bride.Don’t travel beyond your assigned area. Assigned area? They’ve traveled half-way around the world in search for Vlad, the vampire boss.Report all hunting activity to the Hunters’ High Council. There’s a Hunters’ High Council?Don’t tell humans about the existence of paranormal beings. Ooopsy, they kinda let that one slip.Don’t resist arrest and escape from your death sentence. Well, about that… If they’re to go down, they’re taking Vlad with them, especially since he screwed up both their lives.The Council has a valid reason to want their heads, but Rachel and Daniel have more pressing matters to worry about. Like the screechy voices inside Rachel’s head which sing of death and destruction and the creepy Banshee who predicts the coming of a Hunter – vampire war. A war which Daniel and Rachel must trigger to save their race from extinction.And Rachel seriously doubts that a head-on battle between the vampires and the Hunters will be their ticket out of the death sentence.",
