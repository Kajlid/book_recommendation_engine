  "description": "Garth Ennis' world of Crossed has become the pinnacle of survival horror in the comics world. David Lapham (Stray Bullets) returns to Crossed with a crime story told both before and after the Crossed outbreak! A father is pushed to the brink when his family is brutally tortured and killed. With only revenge to keep him going, he becomes a monster himself with only one purpose -- to find the man that did this and make him suffer more than anyone has before! But then C-Day happened and the world changed. Now a mystery to solve becomes one man's singular obsession to cross a sea of maniacs and destroy a monster no matter the cost. There is no help and there is no hope. There is only the Crossed. This volume collects issues #62 - 70 of the ongoing Crossed: Badlands series.",
