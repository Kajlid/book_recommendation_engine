  "description": "On a flight from Le Bourget to Croydon, on which Hercule Poirot is an apprehensive passenger, a woman is found dead. A doctor on board is inclined to put it down to a wasp-sting, but Poirot suspects that a poisoned dart is the real causeâ€”and, perhaps rather too conveniently, a blow pipe is dicovered stuffed down the back of his seat. Clearly, the murder can only have been committed by one of the passengers or crew on the plane. But which one? Poirot, Japp, and M. Fournier of the Surete will make their way through shoals of red herrings before reaching an utterly unexpected conclusion.Hercule Poirot - John Moffatt Chief Inspector Japp - Philip Jackson Monsieur Fournier - Geoffrey Whitehead Daniel Clancy - Murray Melvin Jane Grey - Teresa Gallagher Lady Horbury - Carolyn Jones Norman Gale - Ben Crowe Jean Dupont - Andrew Harrison Dr Bryant - Bruce Purchase Elise Grandier - Liza Sadovy Anne Richards - Priyanga Elan Airline Steward/Agency Clerk - Stephen Critchlow Dramatised by Michael Bakewell.Directed by Enyd WilliamsThis dramatisation was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 3 May 2003.",
