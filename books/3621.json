  "description": "Jen's always been a daddy's girl, even though her dad isn't her real dad. She's just now coming home to Pleasant Parks on her way to a brand new life. She's got a thriving sex life, she's had tons of fun, and she's gotten a goodly amount of wildness out of her system.Gil, her stepfather, welcomes her home with open arms and a huge hug. After all, it’s her home too. He even semi-welcomes (or tries to put on a good show of it) her tagalong guy of the moment Carl. Gil’s all on his own now that Jen’s mother took off and left him for Marty McMurtry. A situation that breaks her heart the more she sees of his solitary life.The longer Jen’s home, the more she wonders how her mother ever could have walked away from a man like Gil. When her long suppressed feelings for her step father come bubbling to the surface, she’s shocked to find that Gil has his own feelings for her. Emotions and passions and turmoil run high as their torrid affair unfolds.There are a lot of folks whose tongues would wag if they knew what Jen and Gil were doing together. And as Jen’s relationship with Carl fractures and she tries to deal with her haunting resentments toward her mother, she almost doesn’t notice herself falling hard for her stepfather. Almost.",
