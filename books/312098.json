  "description": "Eugenia Price has long shared with her millions of devoted readers her fascination with St. Simons Island and the families who built their lives in that beautiful corner of Georgia. Bright Captivity opens in the last days of the War of 1812, when the British invade the southern United States, and a young officer of the British Royal Marines takes one very special prisoner...Anne Couper knew that one day love would come for her-love for one man, endless and abiding. But she never expected that the very first time she looked into the eyes of Lieutenant John Fraser on her eighteenth birthday she would see there the certainty that this man, her enemy, loved her as deeply as she loved him. The lush plantation of Dungeness would become her prison, the man she loved would be her jailer, and together they would learn that while love offers joy, it also brings harsh choices.",
