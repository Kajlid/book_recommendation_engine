  "description": "A black rock cube topped with an amber horn, found in the long buried ruins of a 3500-year-old tomb. Its discovery triggered a global storm of intrigue and espionage, international theft and hijacking, diplomacy and war - even before its mystery became known: The artifact should not have been in a Mycenaean tomb. And what was inside the artifact should not have been on Earth at all.",
