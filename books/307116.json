  "description": "I told the tale of my banner childhood—complete with my photo on the side of a milk carton.For a kid that time forgot, I got pretty damn lucky.It only took two and a half decades to learn my legal name and birthdate. But at least I’m fortunate enough to have a beautiful wife and daughter, both of whom put up with my impulsive ass.I should be celebrating, right?Not even close.When they returned my identity, they stole something far more valuable—my sister. She escaped their clutches but couldn’t outrun her demons, and I blame our captors.There’s no doubt—they will pay. She will not die in vain, and I’m prepared to take whatever path necessary to deliver retribution to my captor’s door.However, I’m unsure if Vixen will stand by my side, or leave me to fight this final battle alone.Sometimes, love, even as strong as ours, isn’t enough to save a soul.But is it enough to save mine?TRIGGER THIS BOOK CONTAINS STRONG THEMES IN REFERANCE TO CHILD ABDUCTION, AS WELL AS SEX AND COARSE LANGUAGE. READER DISCRETION ADVISED. 18+",
