  "description": "The author of The Shaping of Things to Innovation and Mission for the 21st-Century Church presents a worldview for the emergent church--people who are not at home in the traditional church or in the secular world. As exiles of both, they must create their own worldview that integrates their Christian beliefs with the contemporary world. Exiles calls for a dynamic, life-affirming, robust Christian faith which can be lived in non-religious categories and be attractive to not-yet Christians.",
