  "title": "Inside Ball Lightning",
  "description": "Inside Ball Lightning is a book-length memoir in verse that follows the growing distance between the poet, Rainie Oet, and their brother, Mark, over the course of several years around the time of their grandmother's death. It traces a childhood full of competitive chess, Gameboys, ghosts, ESP, and ball lightning. Here, parents' childhoods merge with the poet's in a book that looks back across generations, and looks forward into the continuing implications of the family's immigrant experience. Through its masterful craft and stunning attention to detail, Inside Ball Lightning attempts to reconcile terror and love, nostalgia and pain.",
