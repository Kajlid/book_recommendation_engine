One mistake means execution and, with her history of being a snitch, her fellow inmates will do everything they can to get revenge.When new prisoner Alex Martinez arrives, armed with secrets about Evelyn's missing memories, she must make a choice. She can follow the rules to win and walk free, or covertly uncover details of the crime that sent her there. But competing in the trials and dredging up her erased past may cost Evelyn the one thing more valuable than freedom: her life.",
