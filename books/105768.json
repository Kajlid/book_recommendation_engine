  "description": "Her lucid visions of his life labelled her delusional, but with a spiritual medium suggesting they were very real, which theory would hold the truth?Sheffield, England, 1912. Nurse Mary O'Driscoll's sheltered life is set to drastically change when she is called to a police cell by Court Missionary, Robert Elliott, to help with Walter Sanford; a roguishly charismatic, deaf and mute criminal. When Walter collapses and is rushed to hospital, Mary has the first of her vivid out-of-body experiences, which turns her normally organised life into turmoil and forges an undeniable connection with Walter. Why have the two of them been brought together? Can Mary really accept the possibility of spiritual intervention? How can her feelings for Walter coexist alongside her developing friendship with handsome surgeon, Tom Sharpe? And what links a harrowing crime to a locket found in Walter's cell? One thing is certainâ€¦the answers have consequences!",
