But now a mysterious, mouth-watering man threatens to take it all away from me... and steal my heart at the same time.EricI learned years ago to not let feelings for a woman get in the way of building wealth. My next real estate conquest was within sight... until I met her. Young, gorgeous, smart... I was smitten. It seemed impossible to claim both. But I'm a man who gets what he wants.The Billionaire's Curvy Librarian is a steamy, sweet, safe, short romance novella that can be read as a standalone. No cliffhangers, no cheating, and a guaranteed HEA between an older, obsessed alpha male and his younger plus-size woman. A perfect short read for that lunch break, train ride or the one hour the kids are napping.",
