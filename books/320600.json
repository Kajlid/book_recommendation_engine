  "description": "I was a savage bent on claiming her as punishment for her family's mistakes. As a powerful Russian Arms dealer, no one steals from me and gets away with it. She was an innocent pawn in a dangerous game. She had no idea the package her uncle sent her from Russia contained my stolen money. If I were a good man, I would let her return the money and leave. If I were a gentleman, I might even let her keep some of it just for frightening her. As I stared down at the beautiful living doll stretched out before me like a virgin sacrifice, I thanked God for every sin and misdeed that had blackened my cold heart. I was not a good man.I sure as hell wasn’t a gentleman… and I had no intention of letting her go. She was mine now. And no one takes what's mine.",
