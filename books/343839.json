  "description": "What at first seemed to be a chaotic uprising of machine against man is becoming a controlled event, destroying the lives of billions and hurling the known galaxy into a state of utter discord. The fourth fall of mankind is well underway. The Order of Eden seems to be the only force for order and peace, offering a place in their new society in trade for a large investment and their freedom. Frontline takes the Spinward Fringe series to an epic scale without leaving what makes Space Opera great behind. Frontline has the drama, grit, characterization and humor we've come to expect from Randolph Lalonde.. Captain Valance and the Triton crew are finally working as a unit. Oblivious to the grand designs of the Order of Eden, they will be drawn into the center of a galactic conflict over a planet with a secret that's been buried for decades.The question put to them is not if they can prevail, but if they can survive.",
