  "description": "It began with rumors from China about another pandemic. Then the cases started to multiply and what had looked like the stirrings of a criminal underclass, even the beginnings of a revolution, soon revealed itself to be much, much worse. Faced with a future of mindless, man-eating horror, humanity was forced to accept the logic of world government and face events that tested our sanity and our sense of reality.Based on extensive interviews with survivors and key players in the 10-year fight-back against the horde, World War Z brings the very finest traditions of American journalism to bear on what is surely the most incredible story in the history of civilisation.Max Brooks lives in New York City but is ready to move to a more remote and defensible location at a moment's notice. His Zombie Survival Guide was adopted as a required text by all of the world's basic military training programs during the recent global conflict.",
