As she questions her own sanity and spirals out of control, a man appears on her doorstep and tells her that, like him, she’s a witch.Pulled in all directions, her unbridled magic draws dangerous attention and Jade wonders if she’s made the worst mistake of her life by joining a coven, or if she’ll even live long enough to regret it.",
