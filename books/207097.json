  "description": "With Elizabeth Cady Stanton and James Mott presiding, women met in Seneca Falls, NY on July 19, 1848 to debate the draft of the Declaration of Sentiments, whether or not to include male signatures, and the merits of each of twelve resolutions. The next day, July 20th, sixty-eight women and thirty-two men signed the Declaration. Most of the resolutions won unanimous approval. However, the suffrage resolution only passed by the narrowest of margins. This edition contains the complete text of the Declaration, along with brief biographies of the signers.",
