  "title": "Tal: His Marvelous Adventures With Noom-Zor-Noom",
  "description": "The story of Tal, a little orphan, and the adventures that befell him on the amazing journey to the land of Troom. His companions were the wise old man, Noom-Zor-Noom, and Millitinkle, the talking donkey, whose caustic comments enlivened the journey. In the evening, after the exciting experiences of each day were over, Noom-Zor-Noom told Tal and Millitinkle wondrous tales of adventure on sea and land, of high romance, of hairbreadth escape, of miracles and magic. These tales recall the glamour and atmosphere of the Arabian Nights. Tal is a very real boy, ragged and mischievous. All young people will envy him his marvelous adventures, which are told in a way that make it seem probable that they might happen to any girl or boy. There is beauty and suspense in this story, which builds up to a thrilling climax when the three travellers reach the court of King Tazzarin of Troom, and Tal's real identity is revealed.",
