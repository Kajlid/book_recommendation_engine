  "description": "It began as a problem in one of Holmes' beloved beehives, led to a murderous cult, and ended - or so they'd hoped - with a daring escape from a sacrificial alter. Instead, Mary Russell and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, have stirred the wrath of those they've thwarted, and they are now separated and on the run.",
