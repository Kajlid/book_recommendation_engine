  "description": "These purple sparks...he would trade his life for the chance to hold them in his handsAkutagawa (1892-1927) was one of Japan's foremost stylists - a modernist master whose stories are marked by original imagery, cynicism, beauty and wild humour. Rashōmon and In a Bamboo Grove inspired Kurosawa's magnificent film and depict a past in which morality is inverted, while tales such as the Nose and Loyalty paint a richly imaginative picture of medieval Japan peopled by Shoguns and priests, vagrants and peasants. Later works such as Death Register, The Life of a Stupid Man and Spinning Gears draw on Akutagawa's own life to devastating effect, revealing his intense melancholy and terror of madness in exquisitely moving impressionistic stories.Including both famous and little-known works, some translated into English for the first time, this volume reveals Akutagawa in a new light. In his illuminating introduction, Haruki Murakami explores Akutagawa's place in Japanese culture and influence on his own writing, while Jay Rubin's translation catches the spirit of the originals.Spine-tingling brilliance...intuitive, natural - and beautiful - Haruki Murakami",
