  "description": "\"A non-stop rush of sci-fi goodness!\" In 2038, asteroid mining is illegal, thanks to corrupt world governments protecting multinational corporations. To survive, poorer countries hire mercenaries to ship much-needed materials home... crazy, dangerous pilots known as dustrunners. Feared in the skies, hunted at home. But now a normal teenaged girl named Kani has been sucked into the fray, forced to fly dangerous missions in low Earth orbit, risking the lives of millions of people below. Trapped on all sides, she tries desperately to get out... but when you're being chased by the police, pirates and the mob, there aren't many escape options available, are there? \"Packed with wicked tension and laugh-out-loud antics!\" Typhoon is the first book in the Dustrunners saga, to be followed by the game-changing Polarity in late 2014. This new enhanced edition includes extended text and new appendices, filling out the world of 2038.",
