  "title": "Grave Trippers II: Remembering and Respecting America’s Heroes and Heroines",
  "description": "Come along with the Gardino brothers as they lead another trip to cemeteries across the United States where prominent Americans who served their country lie in their final resting places.Visiting the graves of these heroes and heroines in all parts of the United States, once again the Gardinos use their tour itineraries to enlighten fellow travelers about underappreciated nuggets of American history and the lives of the men women who made it.These citizens were soldiers, scientists, authors, judges, civil rights leaders, actors, singers, athletes, political leaders, and clergymen with one thing in common—they used their talents to help others and to build a better society. To stand at their graves with Robert and Vincent is to take inspiration from their lives.When asked on his deathbed where he would like to be buried, Bob Hope famously quipped, “Surprise me.” Plenty of surprises await the reader in these stories of the lives and deaths of the heroes and heroines of American history—a unique way to learn about our shared past.",
