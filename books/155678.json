  "description": "In a dark young adult fantasy where political intrigue is met with the flash of fangs and silver bullets, the determination of one young woman to hold on to her humanity questions: what does it mean to be a monster? The life of a teenage werewolf yawns wide for Maeve Berkeley. At first, the darkness within her seems contained, changing her shape only once a month and content to sleep while she struggles with the coming of age problems of an ordinary teenager. But when her estranged uncle turns up with secrets of his own and shows her the hidden world of werewolf society, her perceptions are thrown into chaos, the delicate balance of her two selves shattered. But even as she fights to gain control of her life, she discovers something even more deadly lurking in the shadows: a werewolf hunter spurred by revenge and sworn to kill her. When a brutal attack leaves her scarred in more ways than one, Maeve finds herself further than ever from the ones she loves - and when her uncle returns, bringing with him the promise of a way to drive out the darkness within her, she leaps at his offer. She will soon find, however, that being a teenage werewolf coming of age in werewolf society has horrors and burdens of its own. As secrets become harder to keep and Maeveâ€™s fear of the werewolf hunter grows, she will be tested with a choice, the most terrible choice - one that may alter her future and haunt her forever.",
