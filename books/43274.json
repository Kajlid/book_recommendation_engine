  "description": "When Elizabeth Morgan and London Dahlbeck met, they felt an instant attraction. Despite swearing off romance, they inspired one another to try and love again. But love’s a hard game to play.Between playing in a travelling band, learning to control his newly re-emerging psychic powers, and seeking the truth behind a vision sent to him by a fellow Practitioner, London has little time for romance. And while London’s busy being fabulous, Elizabeth’s singing the hometown blues. She’s left behind everything she knows – her friends, her apartment, her school, and her therapist – to take a job in a new city.Faced with a string of lonely nights and the unexpected attentions of a living cliché – Mr. Tall, Dark, and Handsome – Elizabeth starts to wonder: is love really all you need, or are there times when love just isn’t enough?",
