  "title": "The Self-Aware Universe: How Consciousness Creates the Material World",
  "description": "In this stimulating and timely book, Amit Goswami, PhD, shatters the widely popular belief held by Western science that matter is the primary \"stuff\" of creation and proposes instead that consciousness is the true foundation of all we know and perceive.Â His explanation of quantum physics for lay readers, called \"a model of clarity\" by Kirkus Reviews, sets the stage for a voyage of discovery through the common ground of science and religion, the entwined nature of mind and body, and our interconnectedness with all of creation.",
