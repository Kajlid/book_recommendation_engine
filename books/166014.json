  "description": "You realize, of course, that we could never be friends. Why not? What I'm saying - and this is not a come-on in any way, shape, or form - is that men and women can't be friends, because the sex part always gets in the way. That's not true. I have a number of men friends and there's no sex involved. No, you don't. Yes, I do. No, you don't. Yes, I do. You only think you do.",
