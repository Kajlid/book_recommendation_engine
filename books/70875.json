Meanwhile, Shaun's dream of taking over the management of Jinjulu is dashed by his dictatorial father who tries to rule Shaun's life both on and off the farm. The Brodericks are dismayed when Shaun falls in love with 'that Farrell girl', whom they deem unsuitable. And they don't just make their feelings clear to Shaun but to Bridie as well. Faced with a choice, Bridie must decide whether to turn her back on her heart or her dreams in order to make the biggest decision of her life...
