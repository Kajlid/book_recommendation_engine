He doesn't know how the attack it warns of will come. All he knows is that his three very carefully separated lives are about to collide.There’s far more at stake than Adrian’s sanity. The clan of dragons who depend on him will be left vulnerable. The teaching career he treasures will be over. And if all his secrets are spilled, then the peaceful world he's built with his flamboyant and passionately gay human lover, Josh, will implode. As a thousand years of hatred take aim right at Kendall, all he can do is offer himself as the price of peace.",
