  "description": "The zombies rose and walked, the country went mad, and then the zombies laid down again-all without committing a single act of violence. Song of the Living Dead is a satire and an elegy, a patchwork oral history of the strangest plague in world history. While scholars, politicians, and common citizens share their insights on this fictional madness, the restless dreamer Lionel tells his own story. Traveling randomly across the east with a group of close friends, he witnesses first-hand the nightmarish confusion that the living dead bring upon the land.It's a story of one man's despair over his country's inability to unite in crisis, a tale of sudden, random violence and illusions of America's greatness gone askew. When the zombies rise a second time and become anything but docile, the tale becomes even darker, as Lionel struggles to understand the design of a universe lost in the realm of B-horror movies-and more vivid real-life tragedies.",
