  "description": "This book is a merger of The Friend Zone & More Than Friends. It has been edited, revised and re-released as a full novel. Chloe Thomas is a small town girl with small town dreams. All she wanted from life was to live and be happy. She's tormented by a past relationship that she can’t seem to escape; Chloe feels like her only option is to swear off men completely. Two years later, the self-imposed “man-ban” is still going strong, but then Skye walks back into her life. Skye Carter left Bartow thirteen years ago an awkward, pimple-faced boy who didn’t quite fit in, but the man that returns evokes a white-hot fire inside of her. Chloe is the only woman Skye has ever loved and he’s not about to let her slip through his fingers again. Just when Skye thinks he’s finally broken down the walls of stone that surround Chloe’s heart, something happens that will leave them both devastated and broken. Are they strong enough to survive?",
