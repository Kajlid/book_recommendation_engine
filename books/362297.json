  "title": "Political Emancipation: Observations from a Black Man Who Rejected Liberal Indoctrination",
  "description": "The purpose of \"Political Emancipation\" is for the reader to explore the perspective and experience of a black man in the United States who is proud to be black and proud to be an American. This is the story of a patriot who will gladly defend his freedom and constitution for the rights it protects. I am not here to offer the meaning of life or provide answers to all of the problems that ail our society or the black community. Through process of elimination, I can tell you that the government is not the answer. Somewhere the answer lies in the individual and a collective desire to preserve our Republic. Perhaps if all Americans take advantage of the freedom the constitution affords as I did, we can recognize that despite philosophical differences, the desire to maintain our society should remain the focus because regardless our differing opinions on gay marriage, abortion or taxation, if we are invaded and enslaved by a hostile enemy, I can assure you that these things will not matter to them. Each person must realize there is a price for freedom. Each of us must learn our history, how it operates, the rights it affords us and that we must remain eternally diligent because there will always be those who will threaten it.",
