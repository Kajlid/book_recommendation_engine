  "title": "Why Mexicans Don't Drink Molson: Rescuing Canadian Business From the Suds of Global Obscurity",
  "description": "A scathing wake-up call castigating the timidity of Canadian companies in international markets, combining bracing analysis and compelling anecdotes with shrewd prescriptions for the future. Canada has all the makings of a global leader, yet it has opted to become a laggard, frittering away its jackpot of rich resources rather than building viable multinationals that are ultimately the country’s best defence in a globalized world. Andrea Mandel-Campbell interviews some of Canada’s leading executives and behind-the-scenes movers and shakers to reveal the hidden challenges to Canada’s global success and the perils of continued complacency.",
