Something has always been missing from my life. A hole that I could never seem to fill.  When I accidentally turn a coven of witches into nightmares, I find out what that something is.  Magic.  And it turns out, I have a crap load of it.  As a latent power awakens deep inside of me, I’m exposed to one of the most powerful and corrupt organizations in the magical world—the Mages’ Guild.  Barely knowing a spell from a few swear words and luck, I won’t be able to evade them alone.  And that’s when I meet him.  The Rogue Natural. The best and most feared mage in the world.  He’s dangerous, mysterious, and has a vendetta of his own. He is now the only thing between me and magical enslavement.",
