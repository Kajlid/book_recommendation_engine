  "title": "Nuremberg: The Last Battle",
  "description": "Using the unpublished diaries and papers of the principal actors David Irving takes a close-quarters look at the trial which finally ended World War Two. There would be few crimes listed in the indictment at Nuremberg of which one or other of the four prosecuting powers was not guilty of itself. In the cause of defeating Adolf Hitler, civilian populations had been burned and blasted, murdered, brutalised, intimidated, deported, and enslaved; aggressive wars had been launched, neutral countries occupied by pretext and deceit, and the unalterable paragraphs of international conventions flagrantly violated.",
