  "description": "The glittering epic of Kleopatra continues as Egypt's queen allies herself with Antony and begins a love story that immortalizes her as one of history's great political players and most tragic heroines. Kleopatra has been reinstated to the throne and now shares her bed with Caesar. But in order for their infant son to be officially recognized as Caesar's rightful heir, Kleopatra must journey with the child to Rome. There she forms an intimate bond with Antony, Caesar's second-in-command. When Caesar is assassinated, it is Antony who wages war against the slain ruler's monstrous nephew, Octavian, who claims it is he, and not Kleopatra's son, who is next in line to rule. Now Antony and Kleopatra are inextricably allied in love and a fierce battle against a formidable enemy, where no less than the control of the world is at stake.",
