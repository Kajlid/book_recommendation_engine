  "description": "I never should’ve let my guard down. Especially not with him. I’m used to being strong. In control. I have to be to run my corporation. So, I should’ve been able to hold my own against him. Against his relentless charm and devastating good looks. But I couldn’t. I didn’t. It doesn’t matter that our companies are irrevocably tied together, or that being with him is beyond inappropriate. It doesn’t matter that he’s a known player and I don’t tolerate games. It doesn’t even matter that he makes me lose my prized control with every heated glance, stolen touch, and dirty whisper. I crave him. Being with him could cost me everything I’ve worked so hard to build. But as strong as I am, I can’t seem to walk away. Now, all I have to do is decide whether the cost of following my heart--which is pushing me straight into Alex Grayson’s arms--is more than I’m willing to pay.",
