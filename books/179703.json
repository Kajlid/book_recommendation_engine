  "description": "I f**ked a SEAL—the human kind, the kind who shoots terrorists, sports rock hard abs and tattooed biceps, and scores an easy lay with every girl he ever wants.  I should’ve known better. I should be studying harbor seals’ native habits, not conducting my own research into mating rituals of the Navy variety.  He’s a jackass. A bad boy. An arrogant, womanizing, patronizing, Harley-riding jerk.  A one-night stand. One night of the most incredible sex I’ve ever had. Shane is trained to kill with his bare hands in 300 different ways—and he knows 300 ways to f**k me, too.  Now my father is engaged to his mother. And we’re heading to Mexico for the wedding. He’s threatening to ruin their big day if I don’t surrender to his demands.  Quit is not in his vocabulary. I hate him, but I know he’ll never give up until he gets everything he wants.  Screw that! I won’t give up—I’ll never submit to America’s cockiest badass.  Publisher's note: This is a full length, stand alone novel. Happily Ever After. No cliffhanger.",
