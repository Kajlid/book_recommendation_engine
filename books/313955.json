  "description": "A deadly crash changes the fate of one lonely vampire.Brotherhood of Blood, Book 1 Vampire enforcer Atticus Maxwell stands at the edge of his own oblivion...until the faint heartbeat of a desperately wounded mortal woman calls him back. The terrible crash that almost took both their lives has brought him a charming, intriguing woman who just might give him a reason to live again. Lissa was headed for a conference at a resort in a last-ditch attempt to find a job. Instead, on a rain-slick mountain road that almost killed her, she finds the love of her life. A love with the most eligible, reclusive vineyard owner in Napa Valley—one that isn't quite human. No barrier—not even breaking the news to Lissa's friends—seems too great to hold back their blossoming love. Until they learn the accident that brought them together wasn't an accident at all, but a murder attempt by an unknown enemy. Atticus saved Lissa once. Can he keep her that way in the face of a renewed threat? This book contains graphic language, hot neck biting, outdoor loving and a hot man with a killer smile. This book has been previously published and has been substantially revised and expanded from its original release.",
