  "description": "Buried deep under the ice of Antarctica is something that interests the U.S. government. Secretly, and in violation of international treaty, a team of scientists and military personnel have been working deep underground to reach it. Lieutenant Commander Malory Lovecraft, an irreverent career officer, has been reassigned to take command of the station. A decorated officer, Lovecraft is considering resigning her commission and trying to make a life outside of the Navy. This tour of duty in the Antarctic darkness is to be her last. Dr. Corky Rivers is no fan of the military. The station's only other woman is aghast at Lovecraft's language, tactics and hat choice. Instantly deciding to dislike the Commander, she slowly comes to appreciate Lovecraft's unique charms. Unfortunately, time might not be on their side when the team finds what it's been looking for. And, even worse, something more.",
