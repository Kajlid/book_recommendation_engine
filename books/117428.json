  "description": "RAVAGED BY WAR ...AD 71. After the battle at Whorl, Brennus of Garrigill is irrevocably changed. Returning to Marske, Ineda finds her grandmother dead, though Brennus is not. Snared by a Roman patrol, they are marched to Witton where he is forced to labour for the Roman IX Legion. Embracing his new identity as Bran, Brennus vows to avert Roman occupation of northernmost Brigantia. Ineda becomes his doughty spying accomplice, though sometimes she's too impetuous. Trading with the Romans lends excellent opportunities for information gathering. Over time, Bran's feelings for Ineda mar with his loyalty to Ineda's father. When she disappears, and cannot be found, Bran enters direct service with Venutius, King of the Brigantes.",
