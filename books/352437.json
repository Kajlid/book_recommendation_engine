  "description": "A blue moon's coming, and for shape-shifter Shannon McFelan, it's bringing nothing but trouble. Something she's got enough of already. Her body has mysteriously turned on her, going into Heat at the worst possible time. It will take all the cunning in her possession to survive this lunar cycle without finding herself mated. Vampire Nikolai Taranosky has waited centuries for his Chosen. He doesn't care that Shannon's a werewolf, and he knows exactly what's wrong with her. It's because of him that she's in Heat. By the waning of the blue moon she'll definitely be mated...to him! Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Dubious consent, sex while in shifted form, violence.",
