  "description": "This is not your cookie-cutter childhood best friend love story. We were best friends since as early as I could remember. We grew up together. We were next door neighbors. We shared each other's deepest secrets. When I was thirteen, we made a pact: if we were still single by the time we were 30, we'd marry each other. Today was my thirtieth birthday. I was single. I knew he was single too. But we were no longer best friends, and a part of me knew that he hated me. This is book one of a three book series. Books two and three will be full-length novels. Book Two: Promise to Keep Book Three: Promise of Forever ***New Adult Contemporary Romance **Mature Content** Recommended for 17+ due to mature language and adult situations.***",
