  "title": "Ten P's in a Pod: The Million-Mile Journal of a Home School Family",
  "description": "An endearing adventure of the Arnold Pent family who followed an unconventional path as what some have called \"the first modern homeschool family.\" In the early 1950s, Arnold Pent, Jr., and his wife Persis took their eight children out of public schools and began a million mile journey throughout the US and Canada together. Along the way, they presented their gospel message in churches, schools, and wherever they had opportunity. Central to the family's daily practice was in-depth Bible reading, study, and memorization. Their public programs featured music, preaching, scripture recitation, and always encouraged families to read the Bible together. The book was written by Arnold Pent III, the third child, who compiled it when he was 21 from his journals written as a teenager. A great story for those interested in home education, family discipleship, and evangelism.",
