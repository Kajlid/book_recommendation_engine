Cameron knows that deep inside him is a barbarian that wants to break free. The only problem is that no one else knows it. So he makes a drastic choice: a savage tattoo on the left side of his face.From that moment on, everything changes. His family is horrified. Women are intrigued. Friends are in awe. And the fantasy weapons world goes nuts. Cameron becomes an instantly-recognizable celebrity, and he thinks that this could be what he was missing all along.But what happens when the mask we show the world becomes a permanent part of us? And what happens when we start to believe the myth we have created?",
