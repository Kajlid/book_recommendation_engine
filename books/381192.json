His \"erotic visions\" of her indicate that she is his true breeder-mate. Nobody will dispute his claim.Leila Abdera hasn't submitted to a man in years. Now the Xylon Leader demands that she complete a sexual re-initiation to gain the ability to self-heal. She will need to submit to Erik…and to an entire Alliance of men during the rite.If the ceremony is successful a team of Warriors, all self-healers, will travel to the main moon of Xylon to retrieve a sterilization formula. Created by the Egesa Slave Masters—a half-lizard, half-humanoid race—the compound threatens the future of Xylon.Leila puts aside her fears and completes the re-initiation so she can go on the mission. Learning to trust isn't easy, but she falls in love with Erik and actually begins to crave his sexual dominance. And Erik learns that though he may control Leila's body, she holds his heart and soul in her hands.",
