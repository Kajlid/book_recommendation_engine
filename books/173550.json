  "description": "Like Jane Austen's Emma, Olivia Daly can't resist the urge to meddle, but her Bridget Jones touch means things usually go awry.Shop manager Olivia's well-intentioned interfering stems from a fear of change. When friends talk of leaving, she quakes in her stilettos (or sensible work shoes). These shoes must stay a step ahead to prevent this from happening.Commitment is not at the top of Olivia's 'To Do List.' However, four friends with learning difficulties, dubbed 'Olivia's Misunderstood Gang' (OMG),think otherwise. They devise a test for potential boyfriend/husband candidates. Olivia approves of the test, with the intention of using it to find ideal - and more importantly, - local matches for best friends Jasmine, Melissa and Sebastian.When enigmatic shop-fitter Connor gate-crashes her life and heart, Olivia conscientiously puts him through The OMG test, 'for anyone who may be interested,'refusing to admit how she feels.As the test progresses, Connor passes each aspect with flying colours. yet he does appear to be hiding something. But unless it's a wife and kids, does it warrant a fail? After all, there's no such thing as the perfect man...even women aren't perfect all the time...",
