  "description": "They survived the Grand Voyager. They believed they were safe. They were wrong.  After a violent ambush, the survivors find themselves thrust into a harsh, unrecognizable world. No communications. No shelter. No food. All they have is each other—a ragtag group of elites and misfits.  Amelia faces her deadliest test yet. Guilt-ridden Willow must save her brother at any cost. Gabriel seeks penance for his crimes, while Micah wrestles with his conscience even as he vows to protect his people.  With no rescue in sight, they begin a perilous journey in search of safety. Dangerous enemies lurk on every side. And someone—or something—is hunting them.  To stay alive, they’ll need answers—What is the Hydra virus? How can they stop it? And who can they trust when they can’t even trust each other?  In a hostile world falling to pieces around them, the only way they’ll survive is together.",
