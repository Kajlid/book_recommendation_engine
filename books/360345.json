  "description": "Songs and ballads of conviviality collected by Frank Shay. Magnificently illuminated with primitive woodcuts by John Held Jr.From the introduction written by Frank Shay:\"All Americans are two or three drinks below normal. This simple statement will not be at all startling to the ballad lover. He is only too well aware that without the immediate aid of alcoholic stimulant our landsmen cannot be induced to loose their tongues in song.\"A songbook written during prohibition wherein the author has collected folk songs and ballads from the 1800's and longs for the well oiled days of the 1890's when folks in saloons and homes everywhere gathered around the piano with a few drinks in them and belted out songs in shaky harmony and fellowship.",
