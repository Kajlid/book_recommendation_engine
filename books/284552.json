With only a few friends and an over controlling mother, Jade is just trying to get by in life until she can move out on her own. Then a beautiful stranger walks into her life. And another one. And another one. They say they understand her and promise to take her away where she can be herself. They say she is like them. But Jade has never trusted anyone before and doesn’t know how to start now.Until Jade is out of time and the guys make the choice for her.Just a heads up- If you like a dominating, opinionated, strong female lead- this is not the book for you. Jade starts this series broken, unsure, and naive. If you like strong, dominating, controling males, this is the book for you. This is a Reverse Harem novel with moderate language and moderate sexual content. Intended for young adult and mature audiences.",
