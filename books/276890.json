  "description": "An elderly pilgrim dies in Hawkenlye Vale. It is nothing suspicious, for he was gravely ill when he arrived. Meanwhile, Josse d’Acquin has a visit from Prince John, seeking news of a stranger, Galbertius Sidonius. Hurrying to Hawkenlye Abbey to enlist the help of Abbess Helewise, Josse finds she has a problem of her own—a decomposing body has been discovered, naked and killed by an expert hand. When Josse’s brother, Yves, arrives, the three are hurled into a mystery with roots that reach back further than the Second Crusade.",
