  "description": "New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Karen Hawkins pens a delightfully sexy tale of modern love in a small Southern town. \nAfter years of being the perfect Southern lady, all newly divorced Roxie Treymayne ended up with was a cheating husband. So she goes bombshell blond, gets a provocatively placed tattoo, and prepares to live it up as a Bad Girl. But then her mother falls ill...and Roxie is forced to return to Glory, North Carolina. Once the town bad boy, Nick Sheppard is now Glory's highly respected sheriff. When the hot blonde he stops for speeding turns out to be formerly prim Homecoming Queen Roxanne Treymayne, Nick doesn't quite know where to lookâ€”though he'd like a much closer one at the tattoo peeking from her shorts. Roxie and Nick had a steamy fling in high school, but a love affair between a Southern princess and a boy from the wrong side of the tracks was doomed from the start. Now they have a second chance. Can they get it right? Or will they just end up...the talk of the town?",
