  "description": "Medford lives on a neat, orderly island called—simply—Island.      Islanders like names that say exactly what a thing (or a person) is or does. Nothing less.      Islanders like things (and people) to do what their names say they will. Nothing more.      In fact, everything on Island is named for its purpose, even the people who inhabit it. But Medford Runyuin is different. A foundling, he has a meaningless last name that is just one of many reminders that he's an outsider. And, to make matters worse, Medford's been keeping a big secret, one that could get him banished from Island forever.     When the smelliest, strangest, unruliest creature Island has ever seen comes barreling right into his rigid world, Medford can’t help but start to question the rules he’s been trying to follow his entire life.     A whimsical fantasy debut about belonging, the dangers of forgetting history, and the Usefulness of art,  The Unnameables  is one of the funniest stories of friendship you’ll ever read, with a cast of characters you’ll never forget.",
