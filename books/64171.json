With Beatrice's blessing, she attempts to weave frequent quilt show judge Jo Paxton into their fold. As the town's irascible mail carrier, Jo delivers trouble wherever she goes. And with all that mail at her fingertips, she knows everyone's business. Soon Beatrice wonders if they've made the right choice. After a car accident sends Jo to meet her Maker, it's discovered someone tampered with her brakes. Meadow believes someone's out to eradicate the Village Quilters, but Beatrice isn't so sure. Now she and her fellow quilters will have to piece together the clues, or a deadly killer might strike again.... Includes quilting tips and recipes!",
