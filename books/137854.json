So, magicless and alone, Alex looks for a place to hide herself and chooses a place no one would ever a vampire seethe.Though House Vital and House Corana haven't had any issues in their past, that doesn't mean vampires like witches. Alex has to carefully navigate through the rules of her contract binding her to the seethe while keeping them in the dark about exactly what and who she is. Her magic will come back eventually, hopefully, but that doesn't mean whoever tried to kill her won't find her and try again. Liege Rafael Vital is also curious about what secrets Alex holds. After all, vampires don’t like secrets unless they’re hiding them.Alex's goal is to survive her trial...but no one knows how long that trial will be, or what will happen at the end of it.",
