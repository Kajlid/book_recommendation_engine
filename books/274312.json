  "description": "At the scene of the crime, Katina's dresser drawers had been dumped, closets ransacked, her desk had been rambled through and someone had even gone through her private safe. What was the perpetrator looking for? Who would want to take Katina's life? Princeton saw the long, ten inch, knife and knew Katina had fought for her life. There were pieces of glass all over the room, broken bookends and she had a black mask in her hands when they found her body in the bushes below her balcony. Princeton knew his wife's last vision was that of her attacker.",
