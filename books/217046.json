  "title": "Philosophy of Religion: Thinking about Faith",
  "description": "Is there a God? How can we know? What can we know about God? These questions are the focal points of the philosophy of religion. C. Stephen Evans wrestles with these issues, looking at the classical arguments for God's existence and examining the contemporary challenges to theism from sociology, psychology and philosophy. He investigates the meaning and significance of personal religious experience, revelation and miracles, and looks at how religious pluralism relates to individual commitment.",
