  "description": "A ringing phone at 1:17 am is never a good thing, but Homicide Detective Kate Springer doesn't have the luxury of ignoring the call. On the other end of the line, a confessor admits to murdering her husband. Dr. Nina Grace needs help, and Kate knows it's time to repay a debt. No matter the consequences, Kate must fight to keep the investigation from solely focusing on her friend. Jonathan Grace controls the people in his life like he does his business-with a chokehold. His insatiable appetite for living life on the edge leads him to a club where he's encouraged to act out his darkest desires. But what happens when one man's fantasy becomes another's nightmare? Did Dr. Nina Grace kill her husband or did Jonathan's secret life lead to his death? Detective Springer knows that no matter what her friend admitted, she couldn't be capable of the horrific torture and murder of her husband. But will Kate's blind loyalty be her downfall?",
