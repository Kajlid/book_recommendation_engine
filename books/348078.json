  "description": "From #1 New York Times novelest Scott Sigler—author of the Infected Trilogy, the Generations Trilogy, and the Sun Symbol Series—comes a nightmarish tale of AI-driven genetic modification.Every five minutes, a transplant candidate dies while waiting for a compatible heart, liver, or kidney. Imagine a technology that could provide those life-saving transplant organs for a high price, and imagine what a company would do to monopolize that technology.On a remote island in Lake Superior, a team of geneticists has unlocked this holy grail of medicine. By reverse-engineering thousands of genomes, they dial back the evolutionary clock to re-create the progenitor of  all  mammals. The method? Illegal. The result? An AI-designed creature whose organs can be safely transplanted into any person.There's just one these \"ancestors\" are not the docile herd animals the scientists envisioned. Instead, the project spawns something big, something evil... something very,  very  hungry.As creators become prey in an ultimate battle for survival, the research team must fight for their lives—even while government agents close in to shut the project down, and the deep-pocketed company backing this research reveals its own cold-blooded agenda.",
