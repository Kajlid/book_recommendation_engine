  "description": "The Christmas Lights is told from the point of view of Louis Éclat, a young man who just wants the right to marry the girl he loves. It doesn’t help that he’s poor, fatherless, and has vision so horrible that he might as well be blind. However, these barriers fail to stop the young man when the father of his love, Emmeline, proposes an ultimatum: if Louis becomes a man of wealth by Christmas, he may marry Emmy. Only, December is merely nine months away. With no time to lose, Louis hops the Atlantic and seeks his fortune in the unforgiving nooks and crannies of European cities: Paris, Switzerland, and London. Becoming wealthy is harder than it seems, but Louis accumulates an odd band of friends along the way. An eccentric artist, a Russian jeweler and two factory boys swear to help him on his quest. This nineteenth-century romance twists and turns as Louis must get home to Pennsylvania in time for Christmas—and not lose himself along the way.",
