Johnson's story, which was largely ignored at the time because Jessica Lynch became the media darling, is a gritty recounting of her capture, her wounds, and the challenges she faced when she came home. Post Traumatic Stress, treatment and the negative attitude from those who blamed her and her fellow soldiers for being captured in the first place.",
