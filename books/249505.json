  "description": "Unflinching portrayals of desire and alienation fill Bonnie Chau's award-winning story collection. Chau's short fiction explores the lives of young women navigating love, failure, heritage, and memory, and presents a fresh perspective of second-generation Chinese-Americans. Moving back and forth between California and New York, and ranging as far away as Paris, Chauâ€™s exquisitely written stories are bold, highly imaginative, and haunting, featuring characters who defiantly exert their individuality.",
