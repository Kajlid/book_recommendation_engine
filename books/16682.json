  "description": "He can give her satisfaction…if he can survive her kiss. Magical Sisters, Book 1 Allie Tristan’s older sisters get to have sex. She’s not allowed—not until she learns to control the ravenous appetite of her emerging succubus powers. Till then, she’s resigned to her sisters watching her every move, poised to intervene before her kiss drains a man of his life force. There’s something about local bar owner Tom Halloran, though, that tempts her to sneak away to have another taste of their deliciously electric connection. Love and marriage are not in Tom’s plans. Occasional hot sex with a willing partner, when his busy life allows it? Definitely on the menu. Yet Allie nails him to the wall with her smokin’ hot body, innocent blue eyes…and drugging kisses that leave him more than just weak in the knees. For the first time in his life, he pictures a woman in his life long-term, not just for one night. Along with hunger for raw sex, fear claws at Allie’s soul. Giving in to her raging need will kill him. Which leaves her only one risk everything to keep their love alive—or die trying. If you like flowery language, sweet sex and your heroines all sugar and no spice, do not enter. However, if you like lots of sex with a magical edge described in no uncertain terms, and hot women -with smokin’ men, enter and enjoy.",
