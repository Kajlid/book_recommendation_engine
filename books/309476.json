  "description": "Have you ever wondered if the person you are talking to is having a different conversation than you are? As if they are hearing something very different than what you are saying? Join Hannah and her two super silly brothers as they giggle through a farm adventure of epic misunderstandings! The three characters in \"Farm Fiasco\" are based on Anne's own \"characters\" (A.K.A. children) who feel that there is nothing funnier than a good misunderstanding. This book is part of Yehovah Yasha's ministry guide demonstrating that a family that blesses each other laughs together.",
