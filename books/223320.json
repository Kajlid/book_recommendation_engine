  "description": "The #1 New York Times bestselling original graphic novel by the critically acclaimed author Paul Dini! DARK A TRUE BATMAN STORY is the harrowing and eloquent autobiographical tale of Dini’s courageous struggle to overcome a truly desperate situation. It is a Batman story like no other and one that will truly resonate with fans, with art by the incredible and talented Eduardo Risso (100 BULLETS). In the 1990s, writer Paul Dini had a flourishing career penning the hugely popular The Animated Series and Tiny Toon Adventures . It was a golden era of television screenwriting, and Dini and his fellow writers were at the forefront of the glittering Hollywood scene. In one night, everything would change. Walking home one evening, Dini was jumped and viciously beaten. With several broken bones and a shattered face, Dini experienced an arduous recovery process, hampered by the imagined antics of the villains he was writing for television, including the Joker, Harley Quinn, and the Penguin. But despite how bleak his circumstances were, or perhaps because of it, Dini also always imagined the Batman at his side, constantly chivvying him along during his darkest moments. While most know the Caped Crusader as the all-abiding icon of justice and authority, in this surprising story, we see Batman in a new light—not as the dark avenger, but the savior who helped a discouraged man recover mentally from a brutal attack that left him unable to face the world.",
