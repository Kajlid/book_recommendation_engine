  "description": "Kat is alone with a secret she doesn't want to keep but can't risk telling. A victim of longtime sexual abuse at the hands of her family's trusted friend, Kat is torn between trying to protect herself and safeguarding her little sister, whom she fears might be next.  Greg is a clever and manipulative abuser who has Kat convinced that she is as much to blame for his behavior as he is. Caught in a tangled web of deception and self-loathing, Kat believes Greg when he says that no one will accept her word over his. Thanks to him, Kat is already isolated from her parents and at risk of losing her best friends. With no one to turn to, Kat keeps a secret journal where she writes the truth about everything that has been going on since she was a little girl. But now the journal is missing, and Kat's secret is about to unravel.",
