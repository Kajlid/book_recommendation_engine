  "description": "Brian Dubisar is an ordinary math teacher, but he’s hiding a monster within. As reformed serial killer, his past is a shadow that never fades. When a man-eating spider, a spinner, threatens his students, he makes it a devil’s bargain: it will only eat the humans Brian provides and leave all others alone. As the body count rises, he struggles with protecting his students while fulfilling his darkest desires. On the verge of killing innocent people, Brian must choose to shed his past or relapse completely. Spinner Azure is destined to rule his kind, but he yearns for the warmth and complexity of human life instead. His friendship with Brian is a lifeline to a world he can only dream of: having a man he loves, a family, and a real home. When the deadliest green spinner that isn’t supposed to exist emerges, Azure must confront his inner beast or Brian will be caught in its web. Can Azure become the monster he fears to save his only friend and newly found family?",
