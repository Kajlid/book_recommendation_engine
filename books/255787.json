The intransigent woman has spent the majority of her life squirreling away money and alienating her family.  It's hardly the first time Vi has spent the holidays with her aunt. She and her twin intend to do what they always do. Enjoy Aunt Aggie’s luxuries while ignoring the histrionics of the family trying to worm their way into the will.  Only this time, Aunt Aggie claims someone is trying to kill her. But how can that be true? Before Vi can find the killer, Aunt Aggie dies. Since Agatha never named an heir, why would anyone want to kill her?  To her shock, Vi finds herself embroiled in a murder investigation where she and her family are the suspects.
