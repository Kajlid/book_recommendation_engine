  "title": "The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: The Psychoses (Seminar of Jacques Lacan (Paperback))",
  "description": "Taking us into and beyond the realm of Freudian psychoanalysis, Lacan examines the psychoses' inescapable connection to the symbolic process through which signifier is joined with signified. Lacan deftly navigates the ontological levels of the symbolic, the imaginary, and the real to explain psychosis as \"foreclosure,\" or rejection of the primordial signifier. Then, bridging the gap between the theoretical and the practical, Lacan discusses the implications for treatment. In these lectures on the psychoses, Lacan's renowned theory of metaphor and metonymy, along with the concept of the \"quilting point,\" appears for the first time.",
