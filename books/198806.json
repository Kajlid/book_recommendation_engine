  "description": "Fourteen-year-old Jack is a loner who knows little about his family—except that they’re all cold-hearted jerks. When his parents send him to live at his grandmother’s rooming house, life looks to be taking a turn for the better, until he discovers that nothing at Glastonbury Manor is what it appears. Jack’s hopes of being left alone, and enjoying his last summer before high school, are soon dashed.Strange events and even stranger residents only add to a long list of unanswered questions. His grandmother isn’t a kindly old lady who bakes cookies, and her freakishly strong housekeeper never says a word. Jack’s fellow boarders are Ivy, a surly girl who knows nothing about modern technology, and Mr. Ryan, a soft-spoken ex-soldier with a remarkable number of scars.Jack gave up asking questions about the weird in his life a long time ago, but too much surrounds him at Glastonbury Manor to ignore. Things—he thought only existed in fairy tales—begin to seem possible. Jack tells his story without realizing that it’s just a piece of a far greater legend, that some doors shouldn’t be opened, and that sometimes… there are good reasons to stay out of a dark forest.Ivy’s Tangle is the first book in the Legend of the White Sword series. Readers who enjoy epic fantasy adventures will want to join Jack on his quest.",
