Learn how to open conversations and keep them going using very simple questions and ideas familiar to all of us.

Then see how the lost are impacted to be thinking about their eternal destination and thankful to have their questions answered. You'll be filled with incredible thanks for having given them the help they need and for honoring God by giving them the truth about salvation.",
