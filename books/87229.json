  "description": "John Adams is a special forces combat wizard. Trained to kill the things that go bump in the night by the very country that has betrayed him. Desperate for answers he seeks the one man he trusts the most. Hunted by Otherworld assassins and the U.S. Military, John sets out on a journey that will lead him on a path for answers. Only in the end may he yet find Redemption. John Adams learns that shooting first, ask questions later may not be the best practice as he is thrown into a world where his decisions may decide the fate of innocent men, women and children. Throwing around the forces of the universe have helped John stay alive while hunting and killing supernatural monsters, but when his life's work is shown to be not as clean-cut as he always thought, will John be able to do what is needed to give his life meaning again?",
