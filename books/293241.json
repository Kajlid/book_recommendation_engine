  "description": "Rafe McCaffrey, washed-up one-hit country music wonder, is coming home to northwestern Montana and the only man he’s ever loved—his best friend Jamie Crosby. But the years they’ve spent apart have been kind to neither man. Jamie, owner of the Lazy C guest ranch, has turned hard and bitter, just like his father before him. He can’t forgive Rafe for leaving him when he needed his friend the most. Hiring Rafe to work the ranch can only end in trouble...so why does Jamie do it? Ranch cook Lilah Montclaire wants nothing more than to forget the mistakes in her past and make a fresh start somewhere else, far away from the Montana valley where she was born and raised. But she’s grown attached to the Lazy C and its owner, and doesn’t know how to leave them. And this new guy, Rafe McCaffrey? He’s got charm and looks to spare. She sees how Jamie and Rafe look at each other, and wishes she could share in the heat between them. Can Jamie forgive Rafe? Can Rafe forgive himself? Can they give Lilah what she needs to heal her broken spirit and find a way to soothe their own seven year ache?  Don't miss the exciting sequel, Wild Horses!
