  "title": "Exposed for What He Is: Three Homoerotic SPH Short Stories",
  "description": "This is a collection of homoerotic short stories about cocky men with small penises, and how having their shortcomings exposed helps them accept that they are lesser men. Stories include Brian's Waterslide Humiliation, in which a High School Senior is pantsed and more by his buddies at a water park; Daniel's Jewish Wedding Surprise, where a young man is violated under the chuppah just before his wedding; and Jon Gets an On-Camera Prostate Exam, which features a guest on a masculine TV show taking things up the butt for \"a good cause\". Each story includes Small Penis Humiliation and Nightmarish Embarrassing Public Exposure, as the arrogant men are humbled and taught to lean their place.",
