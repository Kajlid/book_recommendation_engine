I kissed it, then did a prayer before climbing into the chute. \"This isn't about you anymore. I got something to prove.\"Rodeo is all Billy Ryan and his brother Cole have ever known -- until one deadly wreck changes everything. With their mom requiring full-time care and Cole dealing with his own demons, Billy needs to step up to take care of his family. So he walks away from his future as a champion bull rider. Convincing himself he didn't quit because he lost his nerve...Barrel racer Shae-Lynn, the sweet good-girl-next-door, grew up with the boys on the rodeo circuit. She's the only person who knows Billy better than he knows himself. She could help him get back in the ring, but there's a limit to how many times she'll watch him make the same mistakes. Especially when it comes to her heart.When Cole's gambling debts get out of control and the bills at home pile up, Billy has no choice but to enter a winner takes all bull riding event. He needs Shae-Lynn by his side, but that isn't going to happen unless he figures out a way to cowboy up and prove he's good enough for a woman like her.Intense, emotional and complex, this is Friday Night Lights meets Nicholas Sparks' The Longest Ride... with edge!",
