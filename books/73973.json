  "description": "The only thing that stands between the stuff of our nightmares and the real world is CRUSS, a coalition concerned with identifying and fighting the powers of darkness. Two of its top agents, Marisa Sukhostat and Paulus Vogel, have been assigned to track down Dalana, not only one of the world's most successful assassin vampires, but also a rare member of the elite Begotten of Old-- a race of the most cunning and dangerous vampires in existence.Dalana has come to Stockholm, Sweden on an assignment of her own: to take down Alexander Soigu, a powerful man who has been drowned, blow up, set on fire, shot at and doused with acid-- and somehow survived unscathed. She doesn't know that CRUSS is after him as well, suspecting him of a string of brutal murders. Heavily armed CRUSS teams are searching every corner of the city for both Dalana and Soigu, with orders to kill on sight. When an attack on Dalana goes awry and Marisa misses her target, destroying an entire family of young vampires instead, the only survivor of the massacre, Vasilisa, hires Dalana to carry out her revenge on Marisa.Now the hunted are hunting the hunters... and the streets of Stockholm will run red with blood.",
