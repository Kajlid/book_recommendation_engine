  "description": "Seven months, eight months, nine months ... a lifetime. Exchanging gentle kisses at the top of Mt. Tam, Jamie and Ryan declare their love for one another. Studying for exams and training for the AIDS Ride, they experience the tentative fumblings and frustrations of adjusting to a new relationship. Though Ryan is determined to proceed at a pace that is comfortable for her neophyte partner, their need for each other grows stronger with every passing hour- whether they are together or apart. \"We begin a magical journey. A journey of exploration, a journey of wonder, a journey of commitment. A journey we make together.\" The speech at the beginning of their 560 mile biking odyssey epitomizes their feelings about the Ride, and about the beginnings of the life they plan to share.",
