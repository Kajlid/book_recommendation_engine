  "description": "He can fix her sink, but can he wrench his way into her heart?Flynn McCauley never thought he’d be so cliché as to fall for the girl next door. But when Maddie calls him over to help fix her faulty sink, he’s a goner. Too bad the fiercely independent interior designer wants nothing to do with him. Even worse, he’s forced to rely on the advice of his nosy brothers — and his five-year-old nephew! — to figure out how to make her give him a shot.",
