  "description": "My name is Maize.Poisonous to the touch.The bastard child of one very dead Dark Fae King.A refugee of a war that freed me from my three-year imprisonment.Loyal to a kingdom that absolutely despises who I am.I was free. As free as someone like me could be, at least. At 22, I could go anywhere. Travel any realm. Yet, I chose to stay in the kingdom that saved me. I was loyal to a fault and now after a full year spent living within the castle walls, I was being transferred to the Red Masques academy. Not as a student. Not as a teacher either. I honestly wasn’t positive why I was going… a change of pace? Or maybe they had grown tired of me in the castle. Either way, I would be staying with the team of commanders that are in charge of the institution. It couldn’t be that bad right?Well, that was what I assumed before I met the men I would be living with. Yeah, not positive how this is going to work out… stay tuned.Finding Fae is book 1 in the Lost In Fae series. This PNR/Fantasy RH is part of an M.
