  "description": "This is a story about love, but not the kind of love you think.  You’ll see…\nIn the lush and magical Pacific Northwest live two best friends who grew up like charismatic, mercurial, and beautiful Aurora, and the devoted, watchful narrator.  Each of them is incomplete without the other. But their unbreakable bond is challenged when a mysterious and gifted musician named Jack comes between them.\nHis music is like nothing I have ever heard. It is like the ocean surging, the wind that blows across the open water, the far call of gulls.\nSuddenly, each girl must decide what matters friendship, or love. What both girls don’t know is that the stakes are even higher than either of them could have imagined. They’re not the only ones who have noticed Jack’s gift; his music has awakened an ancient evil—and a world both above and below which may not be mythical at all.  We have paved over the ancient world but that does not mean we have erased it. The real and the mystical; the romantic and the heartbreaking all begin to swirl together in All Our Pretty Songs, Sarah McCarry's brilliant debut, carrying the two on journey that is both enthralling and terrifying. \nAnd it’s up to the narrator to protect the people she loves—if she can.",
