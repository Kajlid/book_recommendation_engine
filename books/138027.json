  "title": "Escape Part One: Greece",
  "description": "*** Contains Sexual Content***  Former Baltimore accountant Michelle Murphy is supposed to be in hiding, tucked away on a lonely Greek island with a new look and a new identity while she waits to testify in the biggest federal corruption trial Washington has seen in years. Michelle’s not supposed to mingle with strangers, especially ones like the ruggedly handsome Jake Dasher, a fellow American who appears on Michelle’s quiet beach one day. Jake is friendly, outgoing, and much younger than Michelle—all the more reason to keep her distance. But the magnetism is too strong to resist, and Michelle soon finds herself in Jake’s arms.  When a threat from Baltimore casts a dark shadow over their romantic paradise, Michelle is forced to reveal her secret to Jake. But it turns out Jake has a secret as well, with his own reason for hiding out in the middle of the Ionian Sea. When Michelle learns why, she discovers that Jake might be the only man alive with the resources to save her.  Coming soon; Escape Part Italy and Escape Part Spain",
