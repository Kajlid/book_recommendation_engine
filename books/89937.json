  "description": "First English translation of an amazing debut novella by a major and incredibly prolific Japanese author.Bullfight is a Japanese modern classic, a tense story about post-war Japan and its people struggling to come to terms with a new epoch—available now in English for the first time. Three years after the end of the Second World War, Tsugami, the editor-in-chief of a newspaper, decides to organize a bullfight. But things are not as simple as Tsugami assumes: there are all kinds of logistical problems to overcome, and he has to go into an unwelcome alliance with a shady businessman. Tsugami's private life is also difficult, and as the bullfight approaches he must decide whether or not to remain with his lover Sakiko . . .Bullfight won the prestigious Akutagawa Prize in 1949, and Yasushi Inoue was consequently assured a place in the Japanese canon. This novel is translated by Michael Emmerich, who has translated much Japanese literature, including Hiromi Kawakami and Banana Yoshimoto. Pushkin Press will be publishing further works by Inoue, including the epistolary novel The Hunting Gun and the story collection The Counterfeiter.Contains a previously unpublished preface by Inoue himself.Yasushi Inoue (1907�1991) is one of the great Japanese authors. Born in Asahikawa on Hokkaido, he studied first law and then history of art. From 1936, he worked as a journalist for a major Japanese daily, until Bullfight brought him the Akutagawa Prize and national acclaim. His central concern is the loneliness of modern life and the complexities of personal relationships.",
