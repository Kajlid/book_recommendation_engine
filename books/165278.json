  "description": "Rebuilding is not an option. The world has ended. The few unlucky survivors live in armed camps scattered across the bleak English countryside. Foraging parties roam the ruined cities in search of food and supplies, sifting through the ashes and the useless wreckage of civilisation. Deep in the heart of East Anglia, one crew hits the jackpot; a huge treasure trove of provisions hoarded from before the days of the Breakdown. But who does it belong to and where are they now? And can they resist the temptation to double cross their friends and families in the camp back home? And can they resist the temptation to double cross each other?",
