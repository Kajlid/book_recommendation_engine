  "description": "The fourth entry in Geary's chronicling of famous XXth century murders tackles the extremely controversial case of Italian immigrants Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. Geary delves into his most political case yet in this series, however, all his favorite elements are there: the murders are unsolved, the attention of the media is tremendous, there are multiple theories as to what really happened. What's unusual about this particular event is how this polarized and galvanized the world. A possibly biased judge they could never get rid of no matter how many appeals, thanks to Massachusetts law, and a prevailing attitude, especially among the ruling elite, about eradicating anarchists and communists, may have contributed to what many decried as a monkey court trial. Many pieces of evidence were inconclusive, much testimony questionable. Riots erupted all over the world. They lived in a time when class differences were at a raw edge worldwide, the US included, and this struck far too many as more evidence of repression by the ruling elite. In this volume, we are not dealing with some outlandish fait divers but a clash of classes and a justice system that may have failed to treat these men with any equanimity. The tension throughout the book is palpable as a result.",
