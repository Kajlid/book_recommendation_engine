Is he brave enough to let himself love and be loved by the feisty redhead or is he just a coward in a brave man’s clothing? Denying Red is a hot Firefighter romance – book two of the Rayton Brothers Series – surrounding the inner torment and battles of Matthew and the lengths he goes to only to delude himself. Will Red make him change his mind and get him to claim her or will she let him deny her?",
