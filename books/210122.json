For a thousand years, the unfinished dreams—sex fantasies, murder plots, wishful thinking—from the City Across the Sea came to Echo Fjord to find sanctuary. Emerging from the soil, they took bodily form and wandered the land, gently guided by the fjord folk. But recently they've stopped coming, and Eartha wants solve the mystery. Without thought or hesitation—the city isn’t on any map, or in anyone’s memory—she ventures into the limitless waters, hoping to find the City.",
