However, all that gets turned upside-down when she meets her new client, Jack.Jack's a biker, and an arrogant one at that, who likes to be called Rogue. He immediately takes a liking to Brandy and her lush body but he scares the daylights out of her. But it's not his tough demeanor and his legal troubles that frighten her. It's the way he makes her feel, like she wants to do bad things, like she wants to get into trouble, like she can't resist Jack and will end up doing whatever he wants.But after a night of wild, frenzied passion, Brandy is confused by her feelings for the sexy biker and kicks him to the curb. She complains to a friend but instead of sympathy Brandy gets a shocking pep talk and some outrageous object lessons about life. Brandy learns that not being unhappy isn't the same as being happy. That living in fear of being judged by others isn't how to live her life. But can Brandy win back Jack and push aside her doubts? Can Brandy learn to be fearless?",
