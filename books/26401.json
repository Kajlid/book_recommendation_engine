  "title": "Sahih-i Buhari",
  "description": "All Muslim scholars are agreed that Sahih Al-Bukhâri is the most authentic and reliable book after the Book of Allâh. Sahih Al-Bukhâri was compiled by Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Ismâ'il bin Al-Mughirah Al-Bukhâri. There are 7563 Ahâdith in this great collection. Imam Bukhâri collected the Ahâdith over a period of 16 years. He stated that before writing any Hadith in this book, he performed Salât of Istikhârah (offered two Rak'at prayer for guidance from Allâh), and when he was sure of its authencity, he included that Hadith in his Sahih. Dr Muhammad Muhsin Khan translated this book in simple and easy language. We wish that all the peoples of the world, and the Muslims in particular, implement the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in their daily life.",
