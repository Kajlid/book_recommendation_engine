Losing is something Connor has never experienced and does not plan on his quest for Reagan's heart to be his one failing.Book Two of this eight part series focuses on the characters of the rough-around-the edges, Connor Holden and the fiery, Irish physician, Reagan O’Riley. Both characters introduced in Book One – The McKinnon, The Beginning have come back together in a dynamic love story full of misunderstanding, deception, and ultimately forgiveness. The growth they experience through the journey comes at a great cost as is usually the case when lessons are learned the hard way.Nic and Morgan McKinnon, Duke and Duchess of Seabridge are prominent players in Unfinished Business as it would not be completed without their rock-solid presence. Several more characters are introduced further layering the story more deeply and fully and propelling it forward through time. Join them on their quest to become The McKinnon Legends.",
