  "description": "Genny was six when her parents mysteriously disappeared. Raised by her grandmother, any adventurous spirit Genny showed growing up was always under indulged, leaving her to lead a lack-luster and cautious life. Susan, her best friend, was just the opposite. She was vivacious and bold and Genny could never say no to her. So when Susan asked her to go to the club for an evening of dancing, drinking and frivolity, there was only one answer Genny could reluctantly give. Romance was the furthest thing from Genny’s mind when she accidentally spilled her ice-cold mojito down the front of the young, Adonis-like, naval officer, Lance. It didn’t take long for them to realize that they were destined to be together, no matter what heartache their love brings.In Reflections of the Legend, a four part series, their whirlwind romance sends the young lovers on an unimaginable, remarkable and sometimes heartbreaking journey to the sixth century, and back again. Genny is determined to prove her parent’s legacy they left behind, that King Arthur really did exist. Her present and the past collide in the adventure of her lifetime and create a legendary love story that is rivaled by no other in history.(Previous Subtitled Passion of a New Day, New Subtitle of Guinevere & Lancelot)",
