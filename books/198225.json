  "description": "Nothing is as simple as it seems. All Cleodora Xenakis’ life, she has trained as a sorceress. Never did the sixteen year old guess she’d have visions and dreams of the future. Unfortunately, it is of other people. The thought of being a Sibyl frightens her. That wasn’t in her mother’s plans for her. Nor her own. All immortals are expected to have a promise bracelet on their wrists around sixteen to eighteen years old.With only a day’s notice, she is sent to the Mortal realm away from her top suitor. She is to join others on a team to learn more about half-vampire/half immortal, Antoinette Beaulieu. Too bad Cleodora rarely foresees her own future.For Aurick Rispen, being the grandson of legendary vampire hunter, Octavia Thaeon-Rispen has been advantage. His fighting skills are the best. Few suspect he has sorcerer powers and the ability to foresee the future. Those he inherited from his grandfather Geraint Rispen, ruler of Immortal Scotland. Unlike Cleodora, he can foresee his own future. Going to the Mortal realm is part of his path to his future destiny. Will he live to see the Immortal realm again and present a promise bracelet to the girl of his dreams?Both are on the Edge of Fate.",
