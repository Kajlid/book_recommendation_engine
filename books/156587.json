He tried everything to walk away, but knowing that she wanted him too, made for long sleepless nights. Now she's of age and is no longer willing to follow his every rule as her guardian; and when she forces his hand by running off to marry the son of his sworn enemy, he can no longer deny the lust and love that burns within him for her. The only problem is, she thinks she knows him, but there's a side to Zared Costakis that very few were privy to. Will the young innocent be able to handle the man and all his wants and desires? or will his appetites be too much for her to handle?",
