Can a seemingly innocent boat ride forever change the life of a former Marine? Find out when a Police Officer meets an eccentric scientist who claims to hold secret knowledge that has been hidden from the rest of society. Is this all truly happening, or is he slowly losing his grip on reality? Unfortunately, neither conclusion between the two worlds is better than the other as the clarifying line between reality and impossibility slowly disintegrates, turning his world upside down. He must dig thirty years into his past; deep beneath the veil and the mesh of murder, lies and deceit to find answers. Follow the trail of events that will forever shape his futureâ€¦ and maybe yours.",
