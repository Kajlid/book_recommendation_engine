  "title": "Werewolf versus Dragon",
  "description": "The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Beasts (RSPCB) operates a rescue center for werewolves, dragons, fairies, giants, sea monsters, and other fantastical creatures. The RSPCB has stopped crimes against beasts, but there are still some people out there who will do anything to get their hands on one of these mythic animals . . . even if that means crossing the members of the RSPCB. In the first book, Werewolf versus Dragon, a dragon’s mangled body arrives at the RSPCB, and the Society knows that they’ve got a real monster on their hands. Ulf, a werewolf-boy, and his friends must stop the most evil beast hunter before it’s too late. The adventure continues in the second book, Sea Monsters and Other Delicacies, for Ulf and his friends, Orson the giant, Tiana the Fairy, and Dr. Fielding. A sea monster has suffered a life-threatening injury, and it looks like the evil Baron Marackai is back—and this time beasts are on the menu. Ulf must stop him again—the future of the RSPCB depends on it.",
