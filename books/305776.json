How can a man I haven't seen in six years make me so crazy-in all meanings of the word?So the bird's worth a quarter million, and it turns out we're not the only ones who want it. Great. And Nick keeps looking at me with those eyes and kissing me with those lips...Oh, what the hell. There isn't a statute of limitations on love. Is there?",
