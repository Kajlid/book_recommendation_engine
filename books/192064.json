One nightmare later, she meets a stranger named Merrick who tells her she bears the mark of the order: only she - the Pom-Pom Princess of California cheerleaders - can stop the vampires before they engulf L.A. They're everywhere... she can't even trust her best friends! Merrick has brought her knowledge, physical and mental powers beyond her wildest dreams, and a terrifying enemy: Lothos, King of the Vampires, who is determined to have Buffy for himself! All she has are a stake, a cross and a mission: destroy the evil - even if it takes her own life!",
