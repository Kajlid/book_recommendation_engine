  "title": "Jo Returns to the Chalet School",
  "description": "Having left school the term before, an unfortunate chain of events finds Joey, having returned to school for a visit, unable to return to her sister's home Die Rosen. Joey settles down to enjoy her extended visit, but finds her stay becoming longer as time goes on. Somewhat unwillingly to begin with, Jo is pressed into service as a stand-in mistress when one of the staff falls ill. However, Joey comes to terms with the situation and the girls are delighted to have their beloved Jo returned to them for a while. Joey manages to complete her first novel in her free time, after a false start when she is put straight by an unexpected critic, and nervously sends it to a publisher. She is also instrumental in obtaining a new girl, Polly Herriot, for the Chalet School after a chance encounter in the Post. Having never been to school before, Polly's education has been with very old-fashioned methods, and she requires intensive tuition to bring her education up to date. She has also obtained some very unusual ideas about the life of a schoolgirl, from the school stories, which she was so fond of, before she arrived at the Chalet School. This leads to some unfortunate incidents, before she settles into the role of a true Chalet School girl. The term has its low points when the girls' beloved headmistress is taken seriously ill, but finishes on a high note with the customary Christmas play.",
