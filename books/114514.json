  "description": "After a summer spent trying to prevent a catastrophic war among the Greek gods, Percy Jackson finds his seventh-grade school year unnervingly quiet. But things don't stay quiet for long. Percy soon discovers that the magical borders which protect Half-Blood Hill have been poisoned by a mysterious enemy, and the only safe haven for demigods is on the verge of being overrun by mythological monsters. To save the camp, Percy needs the help of his best friend, Grover, who has been taken prisoner on an island somewhere in the Sea of Monsters, the dangerous waters Greek heroes have sailed for millennia. But rescuing Grover isn't the only only monumental task that Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson must tackle: if they don't retrieve the Golden Fleece from the Island of the Cyclopes by the end of the summer, Camp Half-Blood will be destroyed. It's a race against time--and monsters--in the thrilling, action-packed, and mystery-uncovering second book in the Percy Jackson series, now with cover art from the major motion picture",
