  "description": "*** A sweet romance *** *** A Short Story *** After a storm induced crash, the last thing Amber expected was to be rescued by her long lost best friend Johnny Benson. The ex-nice guy who’d become the town bad boy. The only thing worse is being trapped with him for the night.   Amber While he might not be an ax murderer, he was dangerous in so many other ways. The poster child for bad boys. Rough around the edges and tough enough to take it. Johnny Benson was only interested in three things. Fast cars, breaking rules, and girls. Not necessarily in that order. My heart skipped a beat when he held out a hand to help me exit my demolished little car. He pushed a branch out of the way and asked, “You sure you’re okay?” I looked up into his eyes. Nodding, trying to swallow, remembering the day in fifth grade when they came and took him from class. … He’d hesitated at the door for a moment and looked back at me. A weak, sad smile crossing his face making my heart break for him. I hadn’t seen him again for four years.  John Amber Jacobson! Of all the girls, in all the cars, in all the trees in the world. Why did it have to be her? I leaned my head back, closed my eyes and tried to slow my pounding pulse like that social worker slash shrink slash parole agent had tried to teach me but it wasn’t working. It never worked. The flush of terror when I saw Amber’s car buried in those tree limbs still pounded inside of me. A thousand grisly pictures had flashed through my mind. … Why her? Why now? Life can throw you some serious problems, believe me I know. But Amber Jacobson. There was no way I was going to make it through the night.",
