  "description": "Hunter MacLaine hasn’t had a chance to forget his demons, especially when one of them is his diabetes, and another being his responsibility over his nephew, Matty. Too stubborn to admit defeat, Hunter’s tightrope-walking his way to a very important decision – letting go of his regrets and focusing on Matty’s future.  Just when he thinks he has everything figured out, his sugar drops bad enough that he’s wondering if this is it, the light at the end of the tunnel.  When his next door neighbour, Sera Delos, saves his life, she changes everything for Hunter and for Matty. Her references to movies and shows has him constantly reeling, but her nerd shirts are the sexiest thing he’s ever seen.  When it becomes clear that Sera is everything he’s ever wanted, Hunter needs to ask himself: how can someone who’s never been loved get an awesome girl like Sera to fall for him?",
