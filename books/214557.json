  "description": "Haunted Love is the unholy spawn of \"Haunted Horror\" and \"Weird Love\"! Read the screams of terror from these creepy critics:  \"'Haunted Love' is an essential collection for any comic horror fan. This is horror with a heart--a beating, bloody one at that--with clear homages to the narrative construction of American horror literature, particularly H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe, in the tales of sinister romance.  \"'Haunted Love' is a fun, dark, and devilish exploration of love within horror--a fascinating look at the social and cultural representations of 1950s America through the uncensored medium of comics.\" --Big Comic Page  \"This is the stuff that made people burn comics in the '50s. This is the good stuff!\" --Comic Wow",
