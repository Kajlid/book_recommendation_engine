  "description": "I’ve got a secret  I’ve got bruises no one can see and the devil’s blood running through my veins. If I want to end my father’s reign, I’ve got to help Rocco Nomar with his daughter.  She’s broken, jaded. A sad, pretty little thing with a big heart and eyes that make me feel like I’m drowning. She’s not swayed by the social politics of Savannah, but she has my heart doing double takes.  I didn’t even know I was capable of love. I’m not a man that can be tamed. But Rachel Nomar just might change that.  As long as the devil in me doesn’t ruin her first.  Trigger Warning: This book is a dark romance that explores very dark themes. It does include scenes of violence, substance use, and non-consensual sex.  Authors Note:  Dear Readers,  Thank you so much for reading Cruel and trusting us to take you on another ride, this time with Godfrey Taylor.  This book hits some dark themes that might be triggering for some. Although there are no explicit rape scenes, this book dives deep into the mindset of a girl overcoming a trauma of that nature. We hoped to write a realistic recovery that shows her digging through the trenches of what happened to her, but coming out stronger than ever. We also wanted to show that everyone copes differently, and one person’s road to self-love and healing might look differently than another.  We poured a lot of hard themes into this book. We genuinely want you to proceed with caution and understand that this book focuses on the healing, not on the act.
