  "description": "\"Entertaining. . .[Clark] handles both ideas and characters with deftness and wit; in short, the outstanding living science fiction writers is romping\".-- \"Chicago Sun-Times\". In the year 2110 technology has cured most of our worries. But even as humankind enters a new golden age, an amateur astronomer points his telescope at just the right corner of the night sky and sees disaster hurtling toward Earth: a chunk of rock that could annihilate civilization. While a few fanatics welcome the apocalyptic destruction as a sign from God, the greatest scientific minds of Earth desperately search for a way to avoid the inevitable. On board the starship Goliath Captain Robert Singh and his crew must race against time to redirect the meteor form its deadly collision course. Suddenly they find themselves on the most important mission in human history--a mission whose success may require the ultimate sacrifice.\"Clarke is still at the top of his game\".-- \"The Detroit News\".\"As good as any anything he's written. . .for a hard-science-fiction treat, I suspect \"The Hammer Of God\" won't be topped\".-- \"Star Tribune\", Minneapolis.\"Classic Clarke. . .a good story\".-- \"The Denver Post\".",
