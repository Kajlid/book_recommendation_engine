  "description": "What is string theory? Why does it matter to our understanding of the universe? And what if it is wrong?\"The Trouble with Physics\" is a groundbreaking account of the state of modern physics: of how we got from Einstein and Relativity through quantum mechanics to the strange and bizarre predictions of string theory, full of unseen dimensions and multiple universes.Lee Smolin not only provides a brilliant layman's overview of current research as we attempt to build a \"theory of everything,\" but also questions many of the assumptions that lie behind string theory. In doing so, he describes some of the daring, outlandish ideas that will propel research in years to come.",
