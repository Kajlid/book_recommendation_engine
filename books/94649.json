  "title": "The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes",
  "description": "An expert treatise on the origin and evolution of dunes, this classic work was used by NASA in studying sand dunes on Mars and is appropriate for undergraduate and graduate students. The first book to deal exclusively with the behavior of blown sand and related land forms, its accessible style makes it an enduring reference more than half a century after its initial publication.The author studied the sands of North Africa for many years before World War II and is recognized as a leading authority on the subject. His three-part treatment begins with his wind-tunnel experiments, which he conducted to investigate the mechanism of sand transport. First, an account of the observed movement of the individual grains, followed by a chapter on the ground wind and its dependence on the type of surface over which it blows, form a comprehensive view of the interaction between wind and sand. Part Two considers small-scale surface phenomena, such as ripples and ridges, and the closely related subject of size-grading the grains.The third part uses the foregoing results to explain the growth and movement of dunes in general, and the peculiar characteristics of the two main dune types. A method of determining the internal structure of accumulated sand illuminates both the sand's carrying power for motor transport and its water-retention potential. A final chapter, derived from firsthand knowledge, examines the intriguing subject of \"singing sand.\"",
