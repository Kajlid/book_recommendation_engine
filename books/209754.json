  "title": "A Field Guide To Catching Crickets",
  "description": "The soul is not where it lives, but where it loves.  A countryside ranch, naughty notes and a neighbor boy. Kissing in silos and skinny dipping under a full moon. Ten years gone. An ocean, a tragedy...secrets and buried things. Letting go and hanging on. Remembering to forget.  My reality became his nightmare, but then my nightmare became reality.  Hawke Slater was not only my brothers’ best friend, he was a tender, sweet country boy. I never wanted to leave, but there was no choice for me. Two things kept my soul alive, and I’m hanging onto hope that one might be an option for my future.  I wish none of it had been my fault, but it was.  Sloan Story McQueen has returned. Why would I hold out an ounce of hope that she’d want me once she finds out what I do for a living. Some call it obscene, but I’m just chasing storms and rainbows.  She’s holding onto something big. If only it were me.  This novel contains adult content and is not intended for sensitive readers.",
