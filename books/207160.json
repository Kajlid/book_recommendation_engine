  "description": "\"I was all the things I had ever done. All the things that had ever been done to me. But I chose my path and I will be all the things I could be too.\"  The Athanate are meeting in Los Angeles, the city that feeds on dreams, leaving nothing but dust and nightmares. They must forge a new Assembly and reach a consensus before Emergence is forced on them. They have to reach out and include the Were and Adepts, and they need Amber to do it.  But Amber is deep in her own personal crisis. Can she find a resolution for herself as she takes on the tasks of the Assembly?  Los Angeles. Where you can toss away your old life like a bad hand... Or man up and play the cards you've been dealt.  \"Always made me smile, that phrase.\"",
