  "title": "The House",
  "description": "There are ghosts all around us. Once the body dies, the Spirit will go back searching for a familiar face, a familiar place they were attached to, looking for comfort. Other times, if Death was particularly traumatic, the Spirit will haunt those that have done them wrong, as well as the locations which have caused them sufferance. This is the story of such a place. Welcome to: The House.",
