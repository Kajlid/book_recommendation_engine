  "description": "Born in a breeding compound, Valena has never known a day of freedom. As a child, her master burned her retinas to prevent her from mind-controlling those who meet her gaze. But she still controls people’s thoughts with a touch. Sold to the Xelix Prime Blood Houses, she is forced to use her ability to keep the other slaves compliant. When Fate places a powerful Counselor in her path, she plots and schemes to use him to escape, until her feelings for him complicate matters.  As her master’s plans take on a darker turn, lies, betrayal, and tragedy threaten any hope she ever held of a better future.  (This book is standalone and the sequel to Escaping Fate.)",
