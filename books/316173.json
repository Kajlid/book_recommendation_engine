  "description": "I hunt demons.I don’t work for them.And I promised my mom one thing before she was murdered: Under no circumstances, would I ever go near the high demons.But I’ll break that promise over and over again if it helps me avenge her death.When my only lead winds up dead in the middle of demon territory, I’m suddenly in deep shit. Violence in Samael’s club is a death sentence… unless he can use you.And it turns out that the scariest demon in the Triangle has a use for little ol’ me.Demons are being slaughtered. His demons. And as a bounty hunter, it’s up to me to find out who would dare hurt his people.  I’ve got two weeks to find the killer, and if I fail, I’m bonded to Samael. Forever.Samael’s certain that I’ll be his, but I’m not the kinda girl who risks her freedom for a demon.I’m the kinda girl who won’t let anyone get in the way of her vengeance— not even the Machiavellian control freak who thinks he can run my life.The problem? I’ve pissed the wrong people off.Now I’m the one being hunted, and someone’s coming for me with everything they have.But I’m never more dangerous than when my back is up against the wall.And I’m ready to come out swinging.",
