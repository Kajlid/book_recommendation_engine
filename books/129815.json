  "description": "From New York Times bestselling author Stephanie Tyler, writing as SE Jakes.... Truth or dare. Ever since superspy Cillian moved into Prophet’s building, their game of Steal the Couch has been funny to Prophet, but a thorn in Tom’s side. Then Prophet gets bored one night during an ice storm and insists on playing another simple game with Truth or Dare. In exchange for one of Prophet’s truths, Tom steals the couch one last time. But Prophet’s truths are never easy—Tom should know that by now—and this one raises questions neither of them quite know how to answer. In response, Tom finds himself laying claim to Prophet in the most basic way he knows how. And also finds that he doesn’t mind it in the least when Prophet returns the favor. This novelette is set between books 3 and book 4 in the Hell or High Water series. Word 8,400; page 52",
