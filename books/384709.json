Greg's animosity and distrust forces Raven into an unpalatable position of safeguarding her mother's happiness. His arrogant assumption his father has been conned by a gold digger enrages Raven and she assumes the mantle to prove him wrong. Soon finding herself attracted to Greg, Raven is certain he's incapable of feeling anything deeper than the lust he makes no attempt to hide. Even if she is wrong about him, she can't extricate herself from her pretence and she's afraid he'll never forgive her deception, her lies. Can he ever understand her reasons for pretending to be engaged to his father? She was his father's fiancée, wasn't she? Greg discovers Raven's subterfuge within days of her arrival. His initial enjoyment of her antics quickly palls as his feelings for her deepen. Desperate to bring her lies into the open, he maneuvers her into a situation where she'll be forced to own up, only to have his scheme backfire. But Raven has other secrets. Secrets that could drive Greg away, forever.",
