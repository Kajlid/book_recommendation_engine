  "description": "Emily Albemarle is a Duke’s daughter from one of England's most ancient and powerful families. She knows what to expect when she comes of age: buy her first Season's gowns from the finest dressmaker in Paris, make her Come Out – and be married off to a gentleman with a title and a fortune to match her own.  Faced with a choice of suitors, she vows to marry the one who loves her the most. But how is she to discover who truly loves her, and who only loves her money?  Step in James Marsden, the ton’s most notorious flirt. He has no title, no money, no property – but he is an expert in matters of the heart. It doesn’t hurt that his experience comes with a devastating smile and eyes so blue, women have drowned in them…  Emily enlists James’s help in eliminating the false suitors one by one, until she is left with a choice she never imagined facing. Please her father by marrying into title and fortune – or please herself by choosing the man she has fallen in love with.  How will Emily persuade her parents, Society, and the man she adores that, for once, it’s time to let the lady decide?",
