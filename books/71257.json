  "title": "As The World Stopped Turning",
  "description": "Notwithstanding the title and cover photograph, as the world stopped turning... is not a post-apocalyptic novel, but a collection of 18 essays considering the final years of As the World Turns, the soap opera that redefined the genre when it premiered in 1956. Written by a lifelong fan of the show, these essays weave together the show's history, characters, storylines, writers and producers, to create a context within which to consider, not just ATWT, but all soap operas, past and present. Also included, Irna Phillipsâ€™ original proposal for As the World Turns.http://redroom.com/member/lynn-liccar...",
