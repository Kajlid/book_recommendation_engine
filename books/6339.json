  "description": "The 75th anniversary of Ayn Rand's powerful and passionate first novel.In this tensely dramatic story, Ayn Rand shows what the theories of Communism mean in practice.We the Living is not a story of politics, but of the men and women who have to struggle for existence behind the Red banners and slogans. It is a picture of what dictatorship-of any kind-does to human beings. What happens to the defiant ones? What happens to those who succumb? Who are the winners in this conflict?Against a vivid panorama of political revolution and personal revolt, Ayn Rand offers an answer that challenges the modern conscience.",
