  "description": "In a post-9/11 Chicago, a medley of Egyptian and American lives collides on the campus of the University of Illinois Medical Center.Among the players are an anti-establishment American professor of the sixties generation, whose relationship with a younger African-American woman becomes a moving target for intolerance; a veiled PhD candidate whose conviction in the code of her traditional upbringing is shaken by her exposure to American society; an émigré who has fervently embraced his new American identity, but who cannot escape his Egyptian roots when faced with the issue of his daughter's 'honor'; an Egyptian State Security informant who spouts religious doctrines while hankering after money and power; and a dissident student poet who comes to America with the sole aim of financing his literary aspirations, but whose experience in Chicago turns out to be more than he bargained for.Like his bestsellling The Yacoubian Building, Alaa Al Aswany's Chicago is a rich tapestry of everyday lives and devastating social commentary, and confirms his place as the major Arabic writer of his generation.",
