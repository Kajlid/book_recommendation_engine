  "description": "The very beginning of this affair, which involved me, before I was aware of it, in as much villainy and wickedness as ever man heard of, was, of course, that spring evening, now ten years ago, whereon I looked out of my mother's front parlour window in the main street of Berwick-upon-Tweed and saw, standing right before the house, a man who had a black patch over his left eye, an old plaid thrown loosely round his shoulders, and in his right hand a stout stick and an old-fashioned carpet-bag. He caught sight of me as I caught sight of him, and he stirred, and made at once for our door. If I had possessed the power of seeing more than the obvious, I should have seen robbery, and murder, and the very devil himself coming in close attendance upon him as he crossed the pavement. But as it was, I saw nothing but a stranger, and I threw open the window and asked the man what he might be wanting. \"Lodgings!\" he answered, jerking a thickly made thumb at a paper which my mother had that day set in the transom above the door. \"Lodgings! You've lodgings to let for a single gentleman. I'm a single gentleman, and I want lodgings. For a month-maybe more. Money no object. Thorough respectability-on my part. Few needs and modest requirements. Not likely to give trouble. Open the door!\"",
