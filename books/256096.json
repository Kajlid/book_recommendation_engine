  "description": "For ten long years, I stayed away to protect her.  I thought I’d successfully subverted my wolf’s instincts where Bethany was concerned.  But when I saw her on that dance floor, my inner beast took over.  I told myself it would be just one dance. One dance and I’d let her go.  I didn’t mean to bite her.  Or f*ck her in the middle of a crowded dance club.  Or kidnap her… again.",
