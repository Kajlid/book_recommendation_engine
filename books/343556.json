A gorgeously illustrated tale from the award-winning John Burningham.Every night Marie-Elaine’s cat, Malcolm, goes out, and every morning he comes back in and sleeps. \"Where do cats go at night?\" the girl wonders. So when she sees him at his cat door dressed to the nines, she begs to come along. And amazingly, Malcolm agrees — as long as she puts on her fancy clothes, gets small, and keeps it all a secret.
