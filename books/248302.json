  "description": "It seems like an eternity since old earth died. Water is scarce on most of the new planets, and not all of the neighbors are friendly, but life goes on much as it once did. Some things never change. Water is life, sex is the best thing since life began and rent is still due by the first of the month. Kensi loves her ship as much as she loves a good orgasm. Flying is freedom and sex is better than beer, whisky, or wine. Drunken sex on a star-ship is like spiritual enlightenment, there is nothing better.",
