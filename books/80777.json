  "description": "Imagine the man of your dreams. Now - imagine being married to him.For Nell Jones the dream wasn't to last, and after struggling for years to bring up her twins on her own, she returns home to her family and the picture-book Welsh village where she grew up.While Nell's daughter seems more or less a typical nine-year-old, her son isn't exactly average. No one can quite say why he is the way he is, until the village 'psychic' meets him for the first time. Suddenly, Nell has to question whether the husband who abandoned her seven years earlier was everything he seemed.One winter's night, he reappears in her life, throwing everything into disarray again and jeopardising a potential new romance. But whether she wants to or not, and regardless of the consequences, Nell is about to discover just how fine a line it is between fact . . . and fairytale.",
