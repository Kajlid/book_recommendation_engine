  "title": "A New Pair of Shoes...Step in Mine",
  "description": "This book is about a compilation of poetry that deals with the trials and triumphs I've experienced in my life thus far. There's a short story there to kind of give a hint of what I'm talking about. I hope that my book be a navigator, a motivator, and an inspiration to all who reads it. A navigator, to guide you through these rough valleys and ridged mountains. A motivator, to provide you with enough strength to go higher. As an inspiration, to inspire you to see the wrongs to make them right. Always know the purpose of your mistakes are to correct them and never make the same mistake twice.",
