  "description": "It’s the late summer 1966 in a small town in upstate New York when the body of eight year old Michael Vogel is found at the bottom of the deep end of the municipal swimming pool four hours after closing.At first, the townspeople believe the initial reports that it was an accidental drowning, despite the fact that the boy's body wasn’t discovered when the lifeguards searched the pool earlier in the day after his sister reported him missing.However, when an autopsy brings about an unexpected result, it sets in motion a search for a killer, in a town unaccustomed to murder.",
