  "title": "Lie Algebras and Locally Compact Groups",
  "description": "This volume presents lecture notes based on the author's courses on Lie algebras and the solution of Hilbert's fifth problem. In chapter 1, \"Lie Algebras,\" the structure theory of semi-simple Lie algebras in characteristic zero is presented, following the ideas of Killing and Cartan. Chapter 2, \"The Structure of Locally Compact Groups,\" deals with the solution of Hilbert's fifth problem given by Gleason, Montgomery, and Zipplin in 1952.",
