  "title": "Babies Come From... Where?!?: Funny Happens When Kids Explain Pregnancy & Birth",
  "description": "Babies Come From...Where?!? is the result of hundreds of interviews with children ages three to twelve, who were simply asked \"Where do you think babies come from?\" and allowed to answer freely, giving as much or as little explanation as they saw fit. It began as part of a larger class project by teacher Kristi Porter and the children of Happi Kamper Child Care, located in North Muskegon, Michigan. Each child was to create an individual gift book for his or her parents and Babies Come From...Where?!? was simply to be one chapter in each child's book. Now, the individual answers of the Happi Kamper Kids, as well as those of the children at Community United Methodist Preschool, and the kids of Power Play Childcare have been combined. Their candid, uncensored and often hilarious answers may surprise you, or even make you laugh out loud as you get a quick glimpse into the amazing and intricate minds of some of the most delightful and fascinating children around. Enjoy!",
