  "description": "Childrens This is NOT your usual Oliver and Jumpy book, but for early readers with more reading and less pictures. Oliver is an elegant tuxedo cat, who is full of himself. As a matter of fact he “I love myself!”, quite often. Naughty, isn’t he? But his best friend Jumpy, a kangaroo lady, is aware that he has a soft heart and will always want to help others. The great thing is Jumpy’s pouch, which Oliver loves to ride in! He calls her his kangaroo taxi! These little bedtime stories with their lovely illustrations are great for small kids. A parent can read the text and tell the child in his own words. These animal stories have sufficient text to keep early readers happy and provide some educational value. Love you all! Meow! Story 58: Down the Well – A frog gets philosophical.Story 59: Finding the Story – Do you like to write a story?
