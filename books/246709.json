  "description": "Mason Dying is easy. Living is hard. For eight years I’ve been teetering on the brink. Wondering when it would be my turn to finally leave this place and be reunited with the love of my life. I wasn’t looking to replace the kind of love Emily and I had. Never intended for it to find me either. Especially with someone so much younger, but something about her calls to me like a siren in the night. Before I know it, the memories of the love I lost are slowly fading and being replaced by memories of her.But is it worth fighting for?SofiaI’ve been in love with Mason James before I ever knew the meaning of the word. Our love wasn’t easy. The road to get here was messy and complicated, but all the good love stories are, right? Now someone is threatening to destroy all we’ve worked hard to build. Someone who is obsessed with taking down my cousin and will stop at nothing even if it means destroying those who get in his way. I’m forced to make the hardest decision of my life; agree to his proposition or watch the ones I love suffer. The decision is easy. The lying is hard.I just hope that when all this is over, Mason will be able to forgive me.*Coming May 15th 2020*",
