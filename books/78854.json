She's never cared for or even paid attention to boys much, unless they were tossing a ball in her direction, but when a new girl shows in up at her school during her senior year, all that changes. How does the new girl get so much attention just for wearing skimpy clothes? Becca discovers she does want the boys to notice her after all, and decides to find out how to make that happen. And what better place to start her experiment than at home? Because the person she wants to notice her the most just happens to be the man who raised her.</span></p><p style=\" left;\"><em><em>Selena Kitt Single<br>Short Story--Big Bang!<br>(approx 5500 words)</em><br><br><em> This title contains shamelessly wicked displays of the taboo so hot--careful!--it may just melt your e-reader!</em><br></em></p><h2 style=\" center;\">GET MORE STORIES LIKE THESE FROM SELENA KITT</h2><ul><li style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B0068UAZJW\">On the Bus</a></li><li style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B0068UBBYK\">In the Fold</a></li><li style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B007RZ5WFO\">Under the Stars</a></li><li style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B0068UAW0Y\">Dar... style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B007X6IHC2\">Tin... style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B00AFNO2JW\">Cla... style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B009XHUCBI\">Chr... style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B009AM5D5G\">Ann... style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/Becca-ebook/dp/B00AKNH0LY&...",
