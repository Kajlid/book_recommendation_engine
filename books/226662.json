  "description": "Most people don’t believe that you can find true love on a reality television show… but I’m here on Cupid’s Arrow ready to prove them wrong. But I have a secret … I’m not in love with this season’s bachelor. I’m in love with the show’s host, Sean. With broad shoulders, dreamy eyes, and experience—this older man has had me wet for years. Every time the show comes on my vibrator comes out. No one can know. The show will sue me if they find out I’m not playing by their rules. But I’m here for one reason and one reason only— to give Sean my virginity. He already has my heart, now it’s time for him to give me his arrow. His big, hard, arrow. I know just where I’ll put it.",
