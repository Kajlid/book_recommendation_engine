  "description": "When Alyssa Mason’s grandfather dies and leaves his jewelry store to her and the mysterious Garrick Samuels, she has some life-changing decisions to make. Should she pack up and leave without looking back? What about her clients and Max, the suave Frenchman she has been dating? She and her grandfather were always close, so she knows that if he wanted her to leave behind her career as a small-business consultant in New York and take over his business with the handsome stranger, it must be the right move. A few weeks after re-opening New Glory Gems, Alyssa stumbles upon a vault full of beautiful gems—stolen gems. As Alyssa and Garrick piece together what they know about the jewels, it becomes obvious that someone is determined to retrieve something of great value and is willing to kill for it. But who? Could it be Garrick’s long-estranged mother, who served jail time for jewel theft? Or Alyssa’s Uncle Andrew, who hasn’t spoken to the family in decades? Or is it someone else, someone much more dangerous? As Garrick and Alyssa spend more time together, the physical attraction they initially felt grows into much more. But neither one wants to start a relationship with danger and fear hanging over their heads. Will the mystery centered in the small jewelry store be resolved before it is too late?",
