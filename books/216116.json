  "description": "Zanele lived in a quiet African village where the sun shone brightly and the stars twinkled like billions of diamonds. Night after night, she asked herself the same \"Who made me?\" Finally, Zanele sets out to see her seven special friends, certain that one of them would be able to provide an answer. One after another, Lion, Giraffe, Baboon, Eagle, Zebra, Honey-guide, and Elephant offer their answers, each drawn from the animal's own experience and understanding, each wonderful in insight. After speaking with her final friend, Zanele \"Now I know who made me!\" This beautifully illustrated story will delight and surprise readers with its insights into God the Creator. Here is a book that answers one of the \"big questions\" children ask and that families will enjoy reading over and over again.",
