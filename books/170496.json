Now that she’s going to school at the Protectorate, she’s learning there’s more to life than fun and games.The truth is, she’s just become part of Earth’s only shield against the monsters of the warps.

Because there are sea serpents in the Thames, and Hallie has to close the doors that are letting them in. The problem is, they’re underwater, and they’re hungry. Now everyone is relying on her, and Hallie must find a way to do her job—with a brand new partner—before it’s too late. Because if she fails she’ll die, along with everyone who’s depending on her.Don't miss this prequel to Tash McAdam's new series, Warp Weavers, coming in 2016.",
