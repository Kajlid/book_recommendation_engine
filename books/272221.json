  "description": "Everything is coming together for Harper Grayson. She has a family she adores, a quaint little house that’s all hers, and a puppy to keep her warm at night. Plus, her lingerie shop, Kiss Me Goodnight, is successful. With her eyes now set on an expansion the moment the empty building next door finally becomes available, things are finally aligning perfectly for Harper. Until Latham Douglas walks through her door…Latham Douglas has been back from a long stint in the Army for mere days when he has his first run-in with a blast from his past. It’s a pleasant surprise to find Harper Grayson selling sexy lingerie just down the block from his family’s hardware store, but he won’t let the stunning woman he remembers from school derail his plans. His business needs the empty building next door, and he’s willing to do just about anything to secure it.Harper and Latham have the same dream. What happens when they realize they can’t both have what they want? Who will give, especially after business turns to pleasure? Can they keep their hearts out of it, or will the winner actually be the biggest loser of all?",
