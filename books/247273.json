  "description": "Tricky, like a fox. As a kitsune--a fox shifter--I have to be to survive. Sometimes it seems like the whole world wants me dead. Ironic, considering that’s my job--to kill people.  Thea Hunt, professional assassin at your service. But that’s not my only vice. I’m also attracted to the darkest denizens of the supernatural world, the men I should run from instead of fall for. Men like Mikhail, the leader of the assassins guild, Barrett, the local alpha wolf, and Nix, the skinwalking coyote that’s likely to bring the entire shifter community to their knees. And then there are my exes--Riot and Fin.  Somebody’s killing off old gods, stripping shifters of their ability to change. And a trapped shifter doesn’t last long without losing their mind. Nix knows; Mikhail wants me to kill him; Barrett wants me dead. Oh, and Riot and Fin are determined to make my life a living hell.  As the youngest kitsune to ever get nine tails, I should be able to trick my way out of this one, right? Right?!  THE NINE is the first book in the FOXFIRE BURNING series. It is a full-length reverse harem urban fantasy/paranormal romance with a spunky kitsune (fox shifter) main character and her six love interests: a vampire, a werewolf, a coyote shifter, and a few mysteries. This book includes cursing, violence, steamy scenes, and a whole lot of magic.",
