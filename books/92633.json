  "description": "Fallen Angel charts the exploration of an unseen world by Nicole Cannock, an average working mum, who has discovered that her liking for more “alternative” sexual practices leaves her feeling unfulfilled. Having dabbled for a brief period in the past, she decides one quiet evening to see if there was something more… and that brings her to Der Unterworld, a chat-site that caters for the BDSM and alternative lifestyles. After establishing herself as an obedient “submissive”, she draws the attention of DL, an enigmatic character that inspires fear within those chat rooms, yet that element of danger is irresistible for her. Despite warnings from the other women she allows herself to be pulled into his world, a world of dark desires, until the time comes where she has to meet him in person. That first meeting opens something deep inside her…a longing and release of primal urges, and so begins a journey into a twilight world of sexual submission and control. He claims her for his own, a gesture that is stronger than marriage in that world, and he slowly begins to test her to the very limits of her imagination. It was the last place she expected to find love; however the complex feelings that intense eroticism creates within both of them leads them down a path that cannot be denied. Nicole’s increasing frustration at the way DL keeps her at arm’s length, and his inability to express his feelings causes a rift that nearly becomes final; however, his growing realisation at how important she was to him makes him orchestrate a way for them to be together. Using his immense power and influence in the shadowy world he has created, he brings her back to his side in the amazing setting of a Grand Ball.",
