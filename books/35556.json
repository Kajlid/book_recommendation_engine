  "description": "Funny, touching, and inspiring! A book about really walking the Camino de Santiago!Perhaps it was the onset of middle-age or just too much diet cola, but in the Spring of 2010, Canadian boy, Randall St. Germain felt called to take on the 800 kilometer, or 500 mile Camino de Santiago pilgrimage from St. Jean Pied de Port, France to Santiago de Compostela, Spain.Seriously, what ensued was a dedication to his mother, a personal challenge, and a journey of cultural and historical enlightenment. A million footsteps, and a few pounds of gauze and tape later, he arrived in Santiago de Compostela, with a better understanding of himself -- and a newfound familiarity with snoring and flatulent pilgrims!Join St. Germain on his adventure in Camino de Santiago In 20 Days, an irreverently chuckle-inducing look at one man's attempt at the famed walk as he confronts apocalyptic weather, snarling dogs, epic blisters, an exhausted body, and his greatest paranoia in life--bed bugs. Along with his humorous reflections, there is practical insight into how he successfully prepared, packed, and then walked across the entire French Way in 20 days -- and in doing so, pushed far beyond his personal comfort zone.Never to be included on the final list of Pulitzer Prize nominees, or in Oprah's Book Club, Camino de Santiago in 20 Days is not your granddaddy's Camino book, either. One word of caution: Pilgrim Discretion is Advised.",
