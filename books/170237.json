Having just moved into her first apartment, in the desired Hollywood Hills, the intimidating characters next door are more than she bargained for, especially since her balcony, the very reason she'd rented the place was situated right next to theirs.Wanting to be left alone to wallow in self-pity, soul destroyed rocker, Wraith, is at the end of his rope. The last thing he needs to deal with is his sexy new neighbour's undeniable presence, something that he and his notorious bandmates have gone without for too long.When their annoying flirtations get out of control, will Wraith finally find it within himself to step in, or will he do nothing, much like he's done with his life these last two years? Will he become the hero that Emma desperately needs or is there more than meets the eye?",
