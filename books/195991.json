  "description": "Toril and Malena barely complete wedding vows before their future crumbles. War ignites the borderlands; conspiracy stalks the young clan chief. Attackers raze their town, assaulting Malena and leaving her near death. Whoever commissioned the violence kidnaps dozens of children, with plans to sacrifice them in taboo acts of blood magic.Legend says an ordeal might give the couple power to fight back--but its price is as mythic as its potency... Can they battle real and inner demons, sacrifice prized dreams, trust each other, and tap the greatest magic of all in their quest to put things right?Cordimancy is a character-rich fantasy novel with a totally fresh milieu. Against a backdrop of high-stakes action, it explores themes such as hope in the face of grief, the true nature of forgiveness, the foundations of meaningful romance, and how to understand and accept the self and others.",
