At the top of my game as a Moto Grand Prix racer, I'm used to the entire world watching me. But the truth is, beneath this polished smile, I'm hurting—physically and emotionally. Longing for my family and the girl I left behind, I need a break from the Moto Grand Prix world. A chance to heal.So the moment I'm free from the press circuit, I bolt home for some R&R—determined to win back Taryn Ledell's heart if it's the last thing I do. Problem is: she's got plans of her own. As a World Superbike racer, she's on the brink of making it big. It's going to take all the sweet-talking charm I've got to convince the girl of my dreams that she can have everything she wants if she's willing to be fearless.",
