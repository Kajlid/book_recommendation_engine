  "description": "*An earlier variation of one of the scenes in this story was previously published as Taken by Annika Rhyder* Sometimes, it only takes one chance to fall in deeply, madly, wildly in love...  Harris: I’m a hard charging billionaire who has built up an incredibly successful company... but with Valentine’s Day coming up, I realize I don’t have anyone meaningful to share it with.  On Monday morning, as soon as Gemma got into my elevator, I knew I wanted her luscious curves.  After her presentation in the boardroom, I knew I needed her clever mind.  Gemma’s been married to her work. Now its time that she marries me.  I’ve got a very special first date planned for us, complete with a ring.  All week, I’ve been trying to get her alone to ask her out... as soon as I see that she’s the only one in the elevator— well, good thing I can move fast—  Gemma: Is it Valentine’s Day again? Really?  Not a big day for me given that I’m married to my job, and haven’t dated in at least a year.  I’m prepared to go home to spend the holiday on my couch streaming movies with my cat, when Harris Blaine, billionaire CEO, and man of my dreams, jumps into my elevator just before the doors close.  Just the two of us standing next to each other as the elevator starts going down.  Yeah, those thoughts totally went through my head.  Me and the unbelievably gorgeous guy... alone... together...  But it’s not like I would ever act on a fantasy like that... I’m a workaholic bookworm who’s a mom to a cranky cat... I don’t do hot encounters.  I wasn’t expecting the elevator to really stop though.  And I definitely wasn’t expecting that kiss...  Does my biggest crush really want to marry me?",
