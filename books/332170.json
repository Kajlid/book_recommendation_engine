  "description": "Kaci Skiles Laws new collection of poetry and prose, Summer Storms, is \"for the child that dies inside us all. It is slow, everything gradual\" (from \"I Tell Him I Will Never Eat Him\"). Summer Storms begins reflecting on motherhood and how the author's relationships changed once she became a mother. The highs and lows and family dysfunction are duly noted before the reader goes bouncing back to a place in time when the author was just an observer of the adult world and adult things.",
