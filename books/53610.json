  "description": "Jacqueline lives a double life. By day, while her husband is at work she spends her entire day in Chinatown. To get away or simply because she feels at home here, it doesn’t matter, her reason is subconscious, it roots to the fact that she just can’t be happy or allow herself to be happy, until she meets Sung Ming.He introduces her to a highly sexual world filled with tests and submission games. He is playful, possessive and confident. She falls in love with him right away and he soon falls for her. But this does not affect his sharing her with his best friend Edison Chan.Edison is harsh, cruel, arrogant, and he does not believe Jacqueline is worth the trouble nor does he think her love for Sung is genuine. He finds it impossible to believe that someone can commit adultery and in the mist of that possess true love for another. So he tests her, painfully, in mind and body.Unconventional, and daring, Chinatown is a complex psychological story about what goes on in the mind of a woman torn between her religious beliefs, guilt, and giving in to her dark desires.",
