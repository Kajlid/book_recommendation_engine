  "description": "The Flying Beaver Brothers are back, and this time they're hot on the trail of another Fish Stix  Environmental Manufacturing. When Fish Stix sets up shop, most of the islanders are thrilled. After all, Fish Stix are the most popular, best-selling sticks around AND they're good for the environment! But this eco-friendly facade is just a cover for a nefarious plot involving dirty money, fish who walk on dry land, and a great big smoking volcano. It's up to the dauntless beaver brothers to set things right—and they better do it fast or the island's forests are history! Now if only Bub can stop napping and they can all make enough pancakes to save the day. . . .This second installment to Max Eaton's new graphic series ups the ante in terms of both action and humor. The Flying Beaver Brothers are poised to take off as beloved comicbook heros.",
