  "description": "The Devil’s Dictionary defines love as “a temporary insanity curable by marriage.” (Ambrose Bierce, 1906). Today, love isn’t only just as crazy, but also deeply perplexing, complex and straight up petrifying. Fall head over heels and then break-up with this collection of short stories and other stuff on the relatable yet conveniently broad topic of love. Time Travelling in the Name of Love takes us back to the golden 1920s to discover whether romance was indeed more alive in the past—slicked hair and cloche hats notwithstanding. Psychic in the Sheds asks the age old question that nobody would you want to see a picture of your one true soulmate even if it could not be guaranteed that you two will ever cross paths? While Love Me Dead proves once and for all that even ghosts need a metaphysical shoulder to lean on. LOVE ME DEAD & OTHER STUFF is an assortment of witty, oftentimes thought-provoking, and occasionally cynical short stories from Australian writer Patrick Sarkis (Has-beens, Ace).",
