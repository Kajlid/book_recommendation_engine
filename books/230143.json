  "description": "From The Creator Of The Blood Coven Vampires...Some Fresh New Blood...Bestselling author Hannah Miller knows how to steam up the pages and make fans swoon. But in real life, things are a lot less dramatic. Still haunted by one terrible night in her past, she's become a recluse, holed up in her apartment, hiding out in her stories. Keeping real life locked outside. Until one night--when Logan Valcourt walks into her book signing, dark and broody and looking disturbingly like the hero in her books. When he makes a bet with her--saying he can prove vampires aren't just fictional--she finds herself unable to say no. Now she's been thrust into a world straight off the pages of a bestselling book. Of blood and vampires. Betrayal and murder. It's completely terrifying--yet completely exhilarating all at the same time. Especially the look she sees growing in Logan's eyes. A dark desire that's becoming all too real. Will Hannah ever be able to return the pages of her old life? Or will she decide to start a new chapter...once upon a vampire?",
