  "description": "Nothing in this world or any other competes with the thrill of soaring through the skies on a griffin's back ...A thrill sharpened by the knowledge that one wrong move, one lapse in concentration can prove fatal ...Only the elite are selected by Griffin Master Romulus to patrol the skies of a mist shrouded Britain. But that's okay with Neb, because even a lowly orphan has ambitions, and he plans to be recruited as a groom. So when selection day dawns, he works extra hard to ensure all the griffins in his care look their best. All goes well, until with a flap of his wings, Balkind, the most mischievious griffin ever, ruins both their chances. Telling himself and anyone else who'll listen that Balkind deserves a second chance, Neb steals the beast and flies off after Romulus, determined to change the old warrior's mind. As Balkind soars above fields and villages, Neb tries not to think about the punishment for theft and tries even harder not to fall ... unaware that there's more than one way to fall and he's about to fall hard.",
