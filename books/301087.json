  "description": "As one house dies, another is formed…\nNear the overworld city of Sicyon, a female drow monk, VHAIDRA, helps her house escape the evil machinations of a rival house of the underworld, only to arrive at what appears to be sudden death at the hands of the mortal enemies of the drow, the high elves. But a zealous male human cleric of The Way, NIKODEMOS, is witness to the attack and could be the one thing that changes her DESTINY forever. VHAIDRA’s troubles have only just started, and they will only multiply in the overworld, where most people don’t trust or like her kind.DESTINY soon has them meet a flirtatious female gold wood dwelf, TI’ERRA, and a stern male half-orc wizard, ELDER DIONYSIOS, just as the Cult of the Jet Fist drives our adventurers out of Sicyon. Will this diverse group be able to co-exist? Will they be able to form a cohesive team to fight the goblins, ogres, dragons, cyclopes and other creatures that they encounter on the way? Will they ever be able to return home? Find the answers to these questions and more as the goddess known as the DARK MAIDEN starts drawing a line of DESTINY from the past to the future intersecting with the lifelines of VHAIDRA and NIKODEMOS!",
