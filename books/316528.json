And maybe getting sent down would seem insane to some, but I’m Rosalie Oscura, champion underground cage-fighter and alpha werewolf from the infamous Oscura Clan. My family wrote the book on criminal organisations and I’ll be ruling this place by the time the next moon rises.Then I just need to get to work on busting us the hell out of here. ‘Us’ being me, the lion shifter I’ve loved for ten long years, and the most notorious criminal in here - a sinful incubus who’s been condemned to isolation for committing an unspeakable crime.What’s the worst that could happen? I mean, short of being rejected by my mate, the black-hearted werewolf who rules over my sworn enemies, or getting myself noticed by the sinister vampire guard who has a dark vendetta against me. But how likely is that?The trouble is, I need the help of those four alpha males to get out of here. And they happen to hate each other almost as much as they hate me.But I always did love a challenge. And I never did learn when to back down.So how hard could it be to make them accept me as their leader?Caged Wolf was previously titled ‘Darkmore Penitentiary’ and is a dark, shifter RH with rejected mates, age gap romance, enemies to lovers, psychos, violence and steamy scenes recommended for readers aged 18+It is set in the world of Solaria after the events of Zodiac Academy and Dark Fae and contains some character crossover but can be read as a standalone series without having read the other books.",
