  "description": "Fearless. Soulless. Good. Evil. Angel. Demon. Warlock. Reaper. I’ve met them all, but what am I? My name’s Cassandra (Caz). At least that’s the name I’m going by this month. I’ve just aged out of the foster care system. I have no money. No memories. No future. No past. I was chased by an angel and a reaper who said I belong to them - they have my soul. I thought I was crazy until a demon and a warlock captured me and claimed I’m one of them. They say I don’t need a soul. I thought I was fearless. Didn’t know I was soulless. Now, I’m caught in the middle of an ancient war between good and evil, angels and demons, and both sides believe I was promised to them long ago. Am I even human? I don’t know who to trust. I don’t even know if I can trust myself. A Reverse Harem/Paranormal Romance.",
