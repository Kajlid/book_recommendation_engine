  "description": "Some of the finest horror stories ever written. Arthur Machen had a profound impact upon H.P. Lovecraft and the group of stories that would later become known as the Cthulhu Mythos. This first volume of Chaosium's Arthur Machen collection begins with the chilling \"The Three Impostors\" in its complete form, including the rarely seen sections \"The Decorative Imagination\" and \"The Novel of the Iron Maid.\" Rounding out the first volume are \"The Great God Pan,\" \"The Inmost Light,\" and \"The Shining Pyramid,\" all are excellent tales.",
