  "description": "In J.D. Griffo's fourth Ferrara Family Mystery featuring a multi-generational Italian-American sleuthing duo Alberta Scaglione and her twentysomething granddaughter, murder is on the menu at Tranquility, New Jersey's local diner...Alberta Scaglione thinks her cooking is better than anyone's in Tranquility, New Jersey--but she doesn't mind an occasional visit to Veronica's Diner. During the breakfast rush, waitress Teri Jo seems stressed out. Not surprising on a busy morning, though Alberta, her sister Helen, and her granddaughter Jinx find it odd when Teri Jo asks them to deliver a package for her \"just in case.\"Minutes later, Teri Jo rushes back to their table--not with a check in her hand but with a knife in her back. Veronica is upset but says she knows virtually nothing about her employee's past, and the ladies aren't sure whether to view her with sympathy or suspicion. Then they find an unusual figurine on the ground while snooping in the vicinity, and it becomes clear that this is a case for the Ferrara Family. With such a crowd at the crime scene, there are plenty of potential murderers on the menu, and the Ferraras will travel everywhere to figure out exactly where that figurine fits in...",
