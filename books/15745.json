  "description": "Dashing, decadent, and deliciously seductive, the notorious Lords of Vice indulge their every desire―from dusk until dawn…Christopher Courtland, Earl of Vanewright―known around London as \"Vane\"―is the very picture of a rich, handsome ladies' man. Why shackle himself to just one lady when he's free to sample them all? In spite of his own mother's attempts at matchmaking, Vane has sworn to stay single. Until he has a chance run-in with Miss Isabel Thorne… A modest and refined beauty, Isabel is a lot more brazen than she appears. When a pickpocket tries to make away with Vane's bejeweled snuffbox, Isabel attempts to thwart his escape…and manages to steal Vane's heart. But the harder he tries to seduce the sharp-tongued, strong-willed Isabel, the more she resists. Now it's up to this tried-and-true bachelor to find a new way to play the game…or risk losing the one woman who's ever captured his heart.",
