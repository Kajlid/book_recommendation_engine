  "description": "Originally published to glowing reviews in 1972, Dow Mossman's extraordinary debut is a sweeping coming-of-age tale that developed a passionate cult following. It recently inspired the award-winning documentary film \"Stone Reader,\" described by Peter Rainer of \"New York\" magazine as 'a marvelous literary thriller that gets at the way books can stay with people forever.' Rendered with breathtaking artistry and emotional depth, \"The Stones of Summer\" captures the beauty and pain of postwar America. Its vivid evocation of culture-void Iowa in the '50s and '60s reveals in layer after layer of richly observed detail the maturation 'the very soul' of an artist. Its rediscovery was the catalyst for one filmmaker to confront his faith in the power of great literature to endure, and it can now be embraced by readers everywhere.",
