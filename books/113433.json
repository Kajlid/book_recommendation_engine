  "title": "I Will Never Forget You...: Frida Kahlo to Nickolas Muray",
  "description": "In the fall of 1938 Frida Kahlo traveled to New York for her first solo exhibition. There she met photographer Nickolas Muray whom she had first met in Mexico, and they started a passionate affair. Muray, born in Hungary, was a successful New York fashion and commercial photographer known for his portraits of celebrities such as Fred Astaire, Marlene Dietrich, F. Scott Fitzgerald, George Bernard Shaw, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Claude Monet. Having experimented with color from early on, Muray found his most colorful model in Frida Kahlo. Their liaison yielded a series of breathtaking, mostly color photographs, most of them never published. Our book for the first time presents a large selection of this series, with excerpts from the Kahlo/Muray correspondence and an essay by Salomon Grimberg.",
