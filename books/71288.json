  "description": "Alicia, wife of a senator, finds herself at the mercy of the State when she is accused of the murder of her husband. Incarcerated in a tough remand prison, she soon discovers that warders and prisoners alike have a vested interest in humiliating a high society woman like herself. She is relieved to discover that White Knights in shining armour still exist as her own personal saviour, in the guise of attorney Bendon Caldwell, gallops gallantly to the rescue. Her relief is short lived as a new and more sinister side to his nature reveals itself once she is released into his custody. Trapped in a situation she is unable to rectify without returning to the horror of State prison. Alicia finds herself spiralling downward into a world of Benson's dominance and her own semi-willing subservience.",
