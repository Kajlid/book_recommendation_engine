  "description": "When Janie Ryan met Nate Lexington sparks flew. He was the hottest guy she'd ever seen and she knew she would do anything to get to know him better. Even if that meant pretending to love chess or dragging her best friend to late night parties. Janie thinks that Nate is the one. He's the guy that she was meant to meet and live happily ever after with. Only fate never quite works out as we like and Janie might be in a little over her head with Nate. That Guy is the prequel to The Hookup.",
