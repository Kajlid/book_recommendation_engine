  "description": "The fast-paced, funny sequel to the best-selling Son of the Mob.Vince Luca is in heaven . . . he's off to Los Angeles, to attend the University of Santa Monica's film school. College should be fantastic, but he is more thrilled about being 3,000 miles away from his mob family.But as it turns out, college brings its own problems: from other film students moving in on his girl, to a kleptomaniac roommate, to having to get a job on campus to help pay tuition. It's a fair amount to handle, though nothing Vince couldn't easily manage - if he didn't keep finding himself with unexpected guests from the East Coast. It seems Vince's dad may just be ready to expand operations to L.A.With the popularity of shows such as \"The Sopranos,\" the mafia is a topic of intrigue for young adults. The fast-paced plot, hilarious dialogue and Korman's keen understanding of teen issues, made this a bestseller and a critical success.",
