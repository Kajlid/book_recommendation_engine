  "description": "Ex-Navy SEAL, Zachary Norcross, is a wounded man. Not only is he recovering from injuries suffered in an explosion on a frigid mountain in Afghanistan that killed his comrade, he's also struggling to get over the shock of his wife leaving him for another man. Following his discharge, Zack settles back in his rural Texas hometown where he begins to put the shattered pieces of his life back together.  Evaline Montgomery is a woman on the run from a dark past. She pulled up stakes in the dead of night, leaving Chicago and a world of danger and suspicion behind her for good. Eva doesn't stop until she reaches Texas, where she stays with childhood friends in the hopes of making a fresh start once and for all.  Things are off to a good start after Eva accepts a job making pastries at the local cafe. Zack is settling in, too, painstakingly restoring his family's estate to its former glory when he's not training and competing in the local MMA circuit. When Zack and Eva are introduced by mutual friends, they form an immediate connection and the sparks kindle a heat they can't deny.  \"Rural Texas has never been this sexy.\" ~ MichaelBeas  \"Between the strong characters, fast but simple dialogue, and buildup of action, Fierce Protector turns out to be much more than an ex-SEAL and a damsel in distress in Texas. So much more.\" ~ Readers Favorite  \"Fierce Protector creates a world of thrills and suspense as our hero finds himself up against the mob, crooked cops and mysterious pasts that intrude on the present.\" ~ MGagnon",
