  "description": "What's a guy supposed to do when his best friend since freshman year decides he wants to go get his freak on and get paid for it by an amateur gay porn studio? Confused by the changes in his absentminded buddy Cody, Aaron decides to check the place out for himself.Twentysomethingtwinks.com is nothing like Aaron thought it'd be. Professionally run and staffed by friendly, personable -- and hot -- talent, it's a heck of a temptation even for someone who's never thought about getting down with a guy before. Trouble is, Aaron finds he likes the action more than he thought he would -- and he's starting to see Cody in an entirely different light. What's a guy supposed to do now?",
