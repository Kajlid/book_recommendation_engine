  "description": "Two bitter rivals go head-to-head in this age-gap, enemies-to-lovers hockey romance. Michael Sato is used to fighting. An undersized defenseman, Mike had to be tough, clawing his way up from the minors by taking down one ferocious player at a time. No way is he going to lose his spot on the league roster, especially not by giving in to his attraction to a hot, infuriating rival. Daniel Garcia is used to fighting, too. Enforcer Danny is the biggest, meanest player on the ice. A target for anyone trying to make a name for themselves, he doesn’t show weakness, nor is he going to risk his last seasons for a sexy rookie who nearly knocked him on his ass. When their intense physical connection explodes outside of the rink, Mike and Danny learn they just might be able to build something real, but only if they can let down their guard—and their fists—long enough.CONTENT WARNING: Game Misconduct contains descriptions of alcohol and drug use disorders, alcohol and drug usage, depression, under-negotiated kink, and discussion of a past sexual assault.",
