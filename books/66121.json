  "title": "The Happy-Unhappy Bridegroom: A Ghost Story",
  "description": "A tumbledown Victorian house, a neglected, overgrown garden, a deep, stagnant pool full of choking weeds - a strange first home for a newly-wed young couple. But their morbid relationship is more gothic still. Addicted to suppressing and being suppressed, neither can be happy unless the other is miserable - but when death overshadows them, will they finally find release from their tyrannous love, or is that love-cruelty strong enough to endure beyond the grave?",
