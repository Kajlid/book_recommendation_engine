  "description": "One of the more remarkable but little-known campaigns of the Vietnam War was fought inside the 200 miles of secret tunnel networks around Saigon between Viet Cong guerrillas and special American forces known as \"Tunnel Rats.\" This is the harrowing account of American soldiers of great courage who volunteered to enter black tunnels armed only with pistons and knives, and often fought in deadly hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. This is the gripping account of brave men whose stories of heroism have never been told.",
