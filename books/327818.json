He does not want to be owned, and certainly not to be sold from Harryâ€™s Pet Shop. Luckily, Whiny Wendy receives his distress signals from afar and jumps on her broomstick to rescue her furry friend. This is not so lucky for catnapper, Harry Horner.Moral of the story: always respect animal rights and, definitely, witches.",
