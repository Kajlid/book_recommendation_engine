  "description": "On the island where they first met two lovers from opposite sides of the tracks are reunited. Now jaded and broken, Alex and Matt still canâ€™t deny their sizzling connection or the memories of one perfect, uninhibited year together. At twenty-two, Matt Tarrington is rich, good-looking and destined to be powerful, but behind that confident exterior lurks a man who resents the life his family thrust upon him. Wanting an escape, Matt heads to Mirabella Island off the coast of Florida for a year of relaxation and a few wild nights with vacationing party-girls. Matt never expected to find real passion in the arms of Alex Hunter, a handsome, laid-back local. Alex is gay, but closeted. Knowing Matt should be off limits, Alex finds the deeply-in-denial rich boy too tempting to ignore. Especially when a bet has them working together, fighting the heat in the rundown, beachside cafe where Alex sweats for every dollar.Their love felt inevitable until youth left them vulnerable to hatred and greed. After six years of hating the lies they live to make others happy, they will have to risk it all for the second chance they both desperately need.Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find objectionable: male/male sexual practices.",
