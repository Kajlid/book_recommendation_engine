However, he probably doesn’t lust after them the way he lusts for Rose Jackson. She’s young, bright and everything he wants - but can’t have. After all, she’s in charge of a multi-million dollar corporation and he’s just the hired help.Rose is more than a little aware of the hunk of masculine perfection guarding her body. She’s indulged in a few fantasies herself, time permitting. Now that she has chance to take a night off, she decides to scratch that itch the professional way - at an exclusive resort where pleasure is the only goal. It’s expensive, but discreet, as is the man she plans on meeting. He’s a trained escort and it’s about time Rose got a few bells rung by an expert.Problem is, she has to take her bodyguard. And there, in the middle of the sensual elegance and decadent boudoir awaiting her, Rose learns an interesting lesson about her own needs - and the hired help.",
