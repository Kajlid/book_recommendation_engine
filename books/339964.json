  "title": "Exploring the Levels of Creation",
  "description": "Have you ever wondered about life and Creation? Is there life after death? Why do we have to go through these trials and tribulations? Why do we have thoughts and dreams that run from the sublime to those that are nightmarish and bizarre? Why do goodness and evil go hand in hand in life â€¦ or do they? The answers to these questions and more are brought to light by author and spiritual teacher Sylvia Browne. She once again shares her psychic gifts and years of research in order to enlighten us and give us more insights into God and the realities of life. This time she tackles the structure of Creation by showing us that there is purpose and order in our sometimes seemingly chaotic world and existence. She outlines the structural levels of Creation of not only life as we know it; but the reality of the afterlife and the heretofore-unexplored structure of the Lower Levels of Creation. From the beautiful and perfect life of the Other Side to the wondrous, weird, and strange Lower Levels, to the everyday intricacies of life on this planet, Sylvia takes us on another journey of exploration and truth.",
