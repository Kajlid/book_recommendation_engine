  "title": "Healthy Relationships 101: Relationships Don't Have to Be so Difficult",
  "description": "Do relationships have to be so difficult? Maybe not. Don't we all want to be more satisfied in our relationships with everyone in our life? Friends, family, co-workers, husband, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, these are the relationships we most value. When we look at the news, what do we see? Endless stories about how we're all getting along? No! Most of what we see is about all the fighting and the disruption in our world? We can choose to be a part of that or we can choose to have relationships that flourish harmoniously.Â If you drive a car, you bring it in for a tune-up. You take care of your health with check-ups. Where do you go for a relationship check-up? This book is about cultivating and sustaining healthy, thriving, fulfilling and meaningful relationships. The key to this is greater awareness. And it doesn't have to be so difficult.",
