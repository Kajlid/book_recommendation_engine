They also left an inheritance to set me up for life. And more than one person is trying to rip it out from under me.Between the grief of losing them and dealing with a family that certainly don’t act like they give a damn, I’m barely keeping my head above water. The only good things right now are the handsome neighbours who help me see beyond my loss. And they come with hateful wives and bitter exes.My new job has me delving deep into the underbelly of the glittering Gold Coast. It puts me in the crosshairs of some people who would rather see me dead than digging into their affairs. Now I’m racing against the clock-and a tropical cyclone-to find the evidence to stop those who are gunning for me.Will I win and get to live the life I’ve always dreamed of? Or will I become just another victim of the Gold Coast underworld?
