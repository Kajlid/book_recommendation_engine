  "title": "Wildlanders' Woman: First Possession",
  "description": "After a devastating betrayal from the man she thought loved her, Ava Cosgrove is judged to be no longer worthy of living in Arcadian society, even though she’s not yet reached the age when all girls must marry or face exile. She’s sent from her country to be a Tribute Bride to the Wildlanders, the savage race of warriors that live outside Arcadia's walls and provide protection from the dark forces beyond. Upon her arrival, Ava faces a way of life unheard-of in her peaceful, orderly homeland. Instead of one husband, she will be joined to a Clan of four men to whom she must act as wife, serving their intense physical needs and bearing their children. Her wedding ceremony will consist of her massive, muscle-bound husbands taking her virginity in a public ritual, using her body in ways she’d never imagined were possible. Through all of this, Ava is assured that she will come to embrace these ways and find happiness, but she’s not so sure. Will the ecstasy she finds as her body is awakened be enough to quell her fears?This book is an introduction to the Wildlanders' Woman series, and is offered free to readers as an introduction to Jenycka Wolfe's work.",
