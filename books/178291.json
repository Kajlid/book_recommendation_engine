  "description": "No one expects to run out of love. We fall for neighbors, strangers, celebrities, and gods, but we rarely consider the consequences of being so careless with our own hearts. To Demi Harper, the thought of running out of love is nothing more than a cautionary tale told by her older sister, to protect her from heartache. But the loss of the only person in the world who loves her in return proves that it may not be so ridiculous a thought, after all. A gasp, a pain, and a foreboding silence within her chest leads Demi to a dark place, outside of possibility and time: Yesterwary, the land of fallen hopes. Void of happiness and love, the town is filled with reminders of everything that is left behind by those who give their hearts to those who do not want them.",
