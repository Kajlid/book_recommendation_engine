  "description": "Chef and selfless human Willow Harper thought she had found a forever love with Kanyon Hills. His emerald eyes penetrated her soul and he didn’t steal just her heart—he owned everything about her. Then, without reason he announced they were over and created a crevice where her heart used to be. For five years Moriah Weston was on a search to find the man with a griffin tattoo and emerald eyes like the daughter he had never known–her first love, Kanyon Hills. Kanyon has prided himself on being an honest and moral member of society, until he finds out about the fateful night he and Moriah created the bubbling Grace Ily Weston. Will Kanyon grow from his past mistakes and choose the woman who fills his heart’s crevices, or will he sacrifice his own heart to the woman who had his child? Can Willow learn to put herself first and find her own happiness with or without Kanyon?",
