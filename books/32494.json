  "description": "Playing with genre and form, this poetry collection evokes a fantastical dream world as myth intersects with reality in verse. Themes of role reversal, shape-shifting, and gender-bending occur throughout, giving a feminist edge to this collection of poems replete with dark humor—as well as an unexpected ending. Whether running with the wolves, or sleeping with them, the poet uses sly words to turn everyday conventions inside out.",
