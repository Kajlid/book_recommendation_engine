  "title": "Tarzan, Volume One",
  "description": "After being shipwrecked on the coast of Africa and separated from his parents an infant English aristocrat is raised in the jungle by a female ape. There he becomes more animal than human-learning to survive in the wild, communicate with jungle creatures and fight against dangerous predators. He is Tarzan of the Apes. In strength and courage Tarzan is the equal of any ape, but his greater intelligence eventually promises the leadership of his tribe and dominion over the jungle. Then other pale skinned creatures like him enter his world, bringing with them the savage ways of men-and the only pale skinned woman he has ever seen. In the second novel, The Return of Tarzan, our hero returns to the jungle after a time in the world of men. Here he learns of the fabulous Opar, city of gold. Ignoring the dangers, Tarzan and a band of warriors set out for Opar, and a further round of adventures that could only have been imagined by the inimitable Edgar Rice Burroughs begins.",
