However, no one—not even the Council—knows my ultimate purpose. But time is running out for me to figure out how to also oppose the secret and powerful Aleph. Will I embrace the destiny the Source created for me in time to stop it? Or will my failure bring about the end of Heaven itself?Warring Angel is the final book in the Fallen Redemption trilogy, featuring an angel coming into her power, an evil older than the Earth itself, and a war that will change the face of Heaven and Hell forever.
