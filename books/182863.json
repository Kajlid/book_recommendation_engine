  "description": "Formerly titled  Revival's Golden Key (9780882708997).Jesus was not afraid to shake people up. He spoke openly of their sinful nature and the righteousness of God. He forced people to confront their sin head-on, and He brought them face-to-face with their need for salvation — because He loved them.Who do you know who isn't saved? If they died tonight, where would they spend eternity? Do you care? If so, what are you doing to help them? The Way of the Master will put a great tool into your hand and will teach you how to share the message of the gospel simply, biblically, and without fear — the way Jesus did! You will become equipped to confidently lead anyone — friend, family member, coworker, neighbor, or stranger on the street — to a clear understanding of repentance and what it means to be a true and active follower of Jesus Christ.",
