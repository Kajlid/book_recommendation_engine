  "title": "Churchill's Iceman: The True Story of Geoffrey Pyke: Genius, Fugitive, Spy",
  "description": "After his suicide in 1948, Geoffrey Pyke was described as one of the geniuses of his time; only now can this biography reveal the full extent of his strange achievements. The epithet 'Iceman' referred to a 1942 project to have Churchill build an aircraft carrier of reinforced ice; he also thought up Mass Observation, earned a fortune on the stock market and wrote a bestseller; but MI5 had material suggesting he was a senior Soviet Comintern official and a spy.",
