  "title": "Aristide",
  "description": "The charming Dionysia de Beaumais conceals more than her face behind a scarf. Despite her pleas for mercy, she is betrothed to a man with whom she shared pleasant conversation at court, and she dreads the inevitable disclosure of a painful past and her most intimate secret. But the giant knight is not what he appears, and he wins her heart. When an old enemy resurfaces, threatening her newfound happiness, Dionysia risks everything to save Aristide.  Reconciled to an arranged marriage, Nautionnier Knight Aristide de Laurentiis takes matters into his own hands and expresses interest in a mysterious but modest lady blessed with sharp intellect and wit, and His Majesty obliges the one-time Templar. When Aristide discovers the cruel truth his gentle wife hides behind her veil, his insatiable lust for revenge threatens to destroy them. Can love conquer evil and heal old wounds?",
