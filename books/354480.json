  "description": "Introducing Camelot—the home of kings, queens, noble knights, magic, Fremsley the Royal Whippet, some very aggressive lavatories, and a very spoiled and unpleasant once and future king In the days when dragons roamed the earth turning people into toast, a mighty king ruled the world. This king lived in the great castle of Camelot in the beautiful island of Avalon. Guided by the great wizard Merlin, this king became a legend. His name was Arthur. The trouble with legends is that every time their stories are told they become more and more fabulous, so useless twits are often turned into super heroes. This is not one of those stories. This is the true story of King Arthur—who was most definitely not a super hero. He was a nasty little spoiled brat who nobody could stand—or was he?",
