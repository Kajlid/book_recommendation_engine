  "description": "More mayhem, madness, and mystery ensue in Tim Dorsey's seventh entry in “Florida’s hottest helter-skelter, hallucinogenic freak show” ( Publishers Weekly ). Though he may not always show it, lovable serial killer Serge Storms has a romantic side. Sure, life as a fugitive on the Overseas Highway has been fun. But it’s been lonely too, especially now that he’s hit the beautiful Florida Keys. Serge wants a bride. And nothing will come between him and his soul mate ... when he finally hunts her down. On the road to finding Ms. Right, Serge will hook up with an astonishing array of scoundrels, schemers, and hoodlums, including an old accomplice he thought was long dead; a gaggle of irregular regulars at the No Name pub, a remote bar in the Keys’ back country; a drug kingpin with a penchant for solitude and brutality; and a notorious real estate swindler who sets Serge’s heart aflutter. And while the course of true love is never smooth, things soon go wildly out of control with a lovesick Serge hilariously leading the way.",
