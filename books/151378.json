  "description": "A confident but inexperienced cat is certain she has scared all the mice out of her house, but things are not always as they seem.Clemmie the cat knows everything about how to catch a mouse, and she would prove it, too—except that she’s never actually seen a mouse. Perhaps, she thinks, they’re all afraid of her. But wait . . . is that a pink tail, or a dangling ribbon? A whiskery nose, or a spider’s legs? Kids will love spotting the pesky mouse throughout this sprightly picture book and will root for Clemmie to discover the mouse under her nose once and for all.",
