  "description": "Craig Tennant hates his job as an estate agent, loves a girl who has a boyfriend and lives in a London flat he can't afford with a university friend he wishes he'd never met. That friend is Mark Hunter, an inept corporate fantasist whose bank balance is shrinking as fast as his waistline expands. With economic meltdown looming, Craig is forced to reassess who he is and who he wants to be, but can he escape his dead-end career, tell the girl how he feels and save himself and Mark from financial ruin? Clapham Lights is a hilarious portrayal of two young men's attempts to find professional and personal success, a book about doomed relationships and redemption which brilliantly captures life in Noughties Britain. An outstanding first novel, Clapham Lights is the funniest and sharpest read of the year.",
