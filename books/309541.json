  "title": "The Rage of Innocence: How America Criminalizes Black Youth",
  "description": "A brilliant analysis of the foundation of racist policing in America: the day-to-day brutalities, largely hidden from public view, endured by Black youth growing up under constant surveillance and persistent threat of physical and psychological abuse by police.Drawing upon twenty-five years of experience representing Black youth in Washington, D.C.’s juvenile court, Kristin Henning confronts America’s irrational, manufactured fears of Black youth and makes a powerfully compelling case that the crisis in racist American policing begins with its relationship to Black children. She explains how discriminatory and aggressive policing has socialized a generation of Black teenagers to fear, resent, and resist the police, and details the long-term consequences of racism and trauma Black youth experience at the hands of police and their vigilante surrogates. She makes clear that unlike white youth, who are afforded the freedom to test boundaries, experiment with sex and drugs, and figure out who they are and who they want to be, Black youth are seen as a threat to white America and are denied healthy adolescent development. She examines the criminalization of Black adolescent play and sexuality, and of Black fashion, hair, and music. She limns the effects of police presence in schools, and the depth of policing-induced trauma in Black adolescents. Especially in the wake of the recent unprecedented, worldwide outrage at racial injustice and inequality, The Rage of Innocence: How America Criminalizes Black Youth is an essential book for our moment.",
