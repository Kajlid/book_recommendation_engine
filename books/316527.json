In this book, the author inspires readers to set out on their personal, spiritual odysseys where they can understand the self even more deeply and awaken their spiritual energies. Bringing her personal experience and vast spiritual knowledge into the writing, the author articulates on a variety of important topics, capturing spiritual concepts in language that is accessible and delivering practical steps to awaken consciousness, unlocking secrets to spiritual and personal growth, and finding the tools to heal and transform from within.\" - Divine Zape for Readers’ FavoriteAnya Goode... \"makes clear, though, that she wants readers to discover their own authentic beliefs rather than to become inculcated with hers. That refusal to preach sets Goode's book apart form the pack, as does the warmth and clarity of her guidance. Whether breaking down the \"anatomy\" of emotion (\"Guilt as a control mechanism\") or the \"dark night\" of a difficult spiritual awakening, Goode emphasizes forgiveness, gratitude, boundary setting, and above all else that revealing and healing the self is a challenging, ongoing process. Rather than tell readers what to think and believe, Goode strives to unveil what's already in us.\" - BookLife by Publisher's Weekly",
