  "description": "What better place to rersearch haunted theaters than along the Cultural Coast of Florida? With more theaters per capita than New York City, this area also should have more than its share of supernatural tales. It does! You will find them within these pages. Talks with actors, directors, playwrights, costumers, designers and all manner of people who haunt such places in life yielded hundreds of tales of those who seem to haunt such places after life. That is the stuff of Haunted Theatres of Southwest Florida.",
