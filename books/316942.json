  "description": "Will Everson is a gifted artist whose life has been shattered by a devastating illness. Will thought he had nothing to live for, then Tori Somerset came along and transformed his world with her vibrance. Tori made it her mission to help Will die at peace, but the two fell in love, and in the midst of a brush with death, Will chose life instead. Conquering his cancer will be the fight of Will’s life, and he’ll have to depend on Tori every step of the way. Tori and Will decide they can face this together—a choice that will test the strength of their fledgling relationship. But the decision to fight doesn’t come with a guarantee of victory. The road to health and happiness often involves taking one, slow, painful step at a time. And sometimes that journey leads to even deeper truths.",
