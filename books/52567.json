  "description": "Once upon a time, fairy tales were for children... But no longer.You hold in your hands a volume of wonders -- magical tales of trolls and ogres, of bewitched princesses and kingdoms accursed, penned by some of the most acclaimed fantasists of our day. But these are not bedtime stories designed to usher an innocent child gently into a realm of dreams. These are stories that bite -- lush and erotic, often dark and disturbing mystical journeys through a phantasmagoric landscape of distinctly adult sensibilities... where there is no such thing as \"happily ever after.\"\nThe \"Snow White, Blood Red\" Collection\n#1. \nSnow White, Blood Red\n#2. \nBlack Thorn, White Rose\n#3. \nRuby Slippers, Golden Tears\n#4. \nBlack Swan, White Raven\n#5. \nSilver Birch, Blood Moon\n#6. \nBlack Heart, Ivory Bones",
