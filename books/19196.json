  "description": "All college freshman Shella Danforth wants is to be normal--which is impossible when she's got a blood-thirsty wolf sharing her body. Shella's spent the past four years trying to forget the night of her first shift. The night she--her wolf--killed a man. But her nightmares won't let her. When a string of unexplained disappearances rocks the city of Orlando, Shella is sure something supernatural is responsible. Forced to team up with lifelong nemesis and fellow shifter Tran Dashner, Shella discovers that the culprit may be closer to her than she'd like to believe. To unravel the mystery, Shella must face her tragic past head-on and learn to control her wolf - before it learns to control her.",
