  "description": "I’m just the dirty, poor girl … … with a junkie for a mother.  Now I’m the new girl. My mother’s in rehab and the last person I expect to see takes me in so I don’t end up on the street. Except… BAY FALLS HIGH is like nothing I know. Rich. Power hungry. A$$holes around every corner. Liars. Cheaters. And if that wasn’t enough…  I have three of the hottest and baddest guys in school after me. I didn’t mean to see what I saw to get their attention. And I swear to them I won’t say a word. But they don’t believe me.  I’m not a prize. I’m a toy. I know once I’m broken they’ll leave me alone…  … but maybe for the first time in my life I’m done with being broken. Plus, when I find out what they really want from me, I realize that maybe I can be the bitch calling the shots.",
