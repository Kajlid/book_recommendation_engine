  "description": "No, David!David's teacher has her hands full. From running in the halls to chewing gum in class, David's high-energy antics fill each school day with trouble—and are sure to bring a smile to even the best-behaved reader.In 'David Goes to School', young David shows up late to class, goes wacko at the blackboard, chews gum in class, yells answers out of turn, pulls pigtails, stares out the window, cuts in line, has a food fight (\"I don't care who started it!\" says the teacher), lingers at recess, and more. Colorful, hilarious, childlike illustrations examine our strangely appealing demon-boy at eye level.David, the out-of-control monster-child from David Shannon's Caldecott Honor Book \n'No, David!' (1998)\n is back... and ready to disrupt the class. Shannon remembers the word \"no\" all too clearly from his childhood, and, as he says in his introduction, \"It seems that kids haven't changed much over the years, and neither have school rules, some of which date back even further than the invention of sneakers.\"\nDavid Shannon\n is the award-winning writer and illustrator of many books for young readers, including 'How Georgie Radbourn Saved Baseball' (1994), a New York Times Best Illustrated book, and 'The Amazing Christmas Extravaganza' (1995), an American Bookseller Pick of the Lists. He also created the illustrations for Audrey Wood's 'The Bunyans' (1996), a School Library Journal Best Book of the Year and an ABC Children's Bookseller' Choice award Winner.Ages 2-6+Edition MSRP: $14⁹⁵ US / $21⁹⁹ CAN (ISBN 0-590-48087-1)Printed in Mexico [Reinforced Binding]",
