  "description": "Boyfriend VS Boy FriendCURTISMy relationship with my girlfriend, Kennedy, is almost perfect. The only problem is Kennedy’s best friend, Liam, who hates me. Well, I hate him too. I hate that he’s taller than me, I hate that he’s so confident, and I’m sure he’s trying to ruin my relationship because he’s secretly in love with Kennedy. When Kennedy invites me to her family’s beach house for the school holidays, I think it’s the perfect opportunity to spend quality time with my girlfriend. Until I find out Liam is coming too. LIAMIf spending two weeks with Curtis wasn’t bad enough, Kennedy has also made me promise to be nice to her boyfriend. I won’t let her down, even if trying to be friends with Curtis makes me want to pull my hair out. But through sharing a bedroom, beach soccer games and sailing disasters, I realise that I might have been wrong about Curtis. But I can’t get too close to him. That would be dangerous.",
