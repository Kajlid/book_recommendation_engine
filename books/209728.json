  "title": "Destination Earth- A New Philosophy of Travel by a World-Traveler",
  "description": "More a guide to travel than a travel guide, Destination Earth transforms how you view travel and its relation to Life. It also provides a philosophical framework for embarking on more meaningful and purposeful travels, whether it is an around the world journey, or an exploration of a region, or even a city. Destination Earth is the product of the author's unique 6.5-year continuous around the world journey, during which he visited 70 countries on 6 continents and treated the world as if it were a single destination. From Chile and Argentina to Thailand and Japan, Destination Earth explores the delicate and invisible interconnections of nations and countries, people and cultures, and delves deep into all aspects of travel and its transformational power:· Why long-term and world travel is the ultimate university· How to create a wise-line of travel through any region· How to go about capturing the Soul of a country· How to deal with the unpleasant realities of the world while on the road · Balance the relationship between travel planning and spontaneity· How a Travel-Journey is related to our Life's-Journey · Practical advice on how to plan the exploration of regions and countries· 23 inspiring travel stories from the author's journey that augment the main text· 60 color photos from various places around the world Ideas, experiences, stories and photographs are interwoven into a newly created Philosophy of Travel that is practical and easy to read.",
