  "description": "Each millennium, the passing occurs, a quick and painless crossing of three realms. The one firmly fixed on Earth, the utopian Lux, and the dystopian Umbrae. The passing has always been a smooth transition. A means to collect souls, light and dark. The year 2000 was when it all changed. The worlds collided.Present Year: 2065; very little human life is left. The Earth is overrun with darkness and all existing light is being snuffed out.There are those among us who serve as protectors, but protecting an entire species might be more than anticipated.",
