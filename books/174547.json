  "title": "I, Peter Wood",
  "description": "Peter Wood was sixty-four years old when his assistant found him on the lounge chair in his office with a glass of half finished, eighty-year-old brandy clasped between his frozen fingers. His head was slumped forward on his chest, and his eyes were peacefully closed, his intention merely to sleep, when he was unexpectedly snatched from the land of the living.He leaves his broken family a set of strict instructions they don't understand, and hesitantly follow, in an effort to get to the bottom of who Peter Wood really was. On the hunt for someone they once knew and all long for, they find themselves releasing secrets and potentially risking it all on their journey for truth about a man, now becoming a small boy known as Peter Rabbit.",
