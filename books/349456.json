The half-breed Santee Sioux bears the twisted scars that made him the fastest, deadliest gunfighter in Texas.

She's a dazzling ray of light -- and the bride-to-be of Hurd Kruger, the man who scarred Diablo. What better way to destroy Kruger than to capture, dishonor, and dump his greatest prize? It's a perfect plan, except for the one thing Diablo never counted on...the only thing that could turn him away from the dark side, the angel who could save his bedeviled soul...",
