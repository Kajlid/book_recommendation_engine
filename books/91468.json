  "description": "What really happened on Good Friday? There's \"Gospel truth\", and then there's another kind of truth, based on facts and historical research. Jehoshua - the original name of Jesus (and pronounced Josh'-ua) - tells the story of the critical early years of Christianity following the crucifixion of Jesus. Jesus was not yet a God, and the apostles were not yet saints. Important figures like the apostle Peter, and Paul of Tarsus, argued publicly over their different views about what happened to the body of Jesus after his death. Their arguments come alive in Jehoshua: Signs and Wonders, the first in a chronological series on early Christianity by author Garrett Glass. This is compelling story-telling, in which historical Biblical figures are given real lives, not mythological ones. If you have any interest in how this new religion actually developed, you must read Jehoshua: Signs and Wonders. It will change forever your view of Christianity.",
