  "description": "He's collected Archangels like Pok√©mon. He's battled monsters all over the country. Now he's fighting his way through all the Circles of Hell to save a friend. In Sympathy for the Devil, The Quest for Glory concludes as Harker and Co. literally go through Hell to get Glory's wings back! It's been a two-year quest that has spanned the continent, and now Quincy Harker, Charlotte, NC's favorite (and only) Demon Hunter is crossing dimensions to do battle with Lucifer and restore his Guardian Angel Glory's divinity. Harker and his band of merry angels, monsters, and humans set off to keep Lucifer from re-starting the War on Heaven, but things go sideways right from the jump. How will Harker navigate the tortures and temptations of Hell to save his friend and the world? Can Harker keep himself together in the face of everything Lucifer and his minions will throw at him? Is he really hero enough to stand toe to toe with the Devil himself and come out alive? Or will he fall prey to the \"man of wealth and taste?\" Sympathy for the Devil finishes up The Quest for Glory and is the final installment of Quincy Harker Year Four.",
