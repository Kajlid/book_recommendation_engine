  "description": "A collection of fictional short stories designed to encourage creative thoughts and alternative thinking. Radi Radev has a futuristic style of writing and puts imagination into these stories.“Here you will find brave experiments in all areas supported by author’s superb style. Even more… The author let himself play a tricky game walking on the edge… There is a man in our folklore, which, in his fear, starts running in all possible directions simultaneously. The book of Radi Radev is a strong argument that a simultaneous movement in all directions is not only possible and interesting in the fantasy literature but is also a good promise for his following books.”Nikola Kesarovski (1944-2007)",
