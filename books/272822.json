Soon, both Tim Drake, Bruce Wayne's newly adopted heir and Alfred, Wayne's faithful butler, find themselves targets of this genetically perfect and very angry child.Is Damian really just a misguided boy trying to prove himself to his fatherâ€”or have long years of Talia's indoctrination left him an operative solely designed to destroy Batman?Under the masterly skills of Morrison and Kubert, BATMAN AND SON is one of the most intriguing Batman tales ever told.This volume collects Batman #655-658 and #663-666.",
