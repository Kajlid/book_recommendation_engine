  "description": "It was after he had found a curious silver medallion in a cave along the Ohio River that Dave began seeing the oddly dressed boy on the way to and from school. At first he envied his long hair and exotic clothes -- until he saw that they were both wearing identical medallions and the boy was in his own double. Envy turned to alarm, then panic when, accepting the boy's proffered medallion in exchange for his own, Dave changed places with him and was thrust eight hundred years back in time, to a castle in medieval Wales.",
