  "description": "A blood moon is rising above Abalon. Werewolves, once heard of only in whispers around the borderlands, have been spotted in villages and towns mere miles from the capital, and the king is worried – worried enough to send Lincoln Clarke to find help. But hunters this far from Abalon aren’t exactly keen. Lincoln’s gone through half a dozen leads before he finds Moira Ashe lurking in the corner of a tavern, her dark eyes glinting in the candlelight. It takes a bag of gold for Moira to agree even to tell Lincoln what she knows, and more still for her to allow him along on a hunt. But what should have been a simple job turns out to be anything but. With a suspect Moira can’t pin down and a string of bodies piling up in the beast’s wake, Lincoln finds himself doubting Moira’s skill. And with time running out and the full moon approaching, failure is not an option. But Moira has her own secrets to protect, and the beast she and Lincoln are hunting may not be the biggest threat after all…",
