He’s promising himself to another woman, taking himself off the market and committing to someone else.Fate was just messing with her this time; if he was the one she was meant to be with then there would be some signs to show that. He wouldn’t be that easy to cut out of her life. But even when the signs start appearing, Kayleigh chooses to ignore them, going against everything she’s ever believed in her life. Instead, she tells herself that fate is what you make it, fate is about choices, and she chooses not to be with him. But is it really going to be that easy?",
