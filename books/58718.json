  "description": "High on a remote butte, a young Sioux waits. Though daring in battle, skillful, and strong, he cannot be a man until his spiritual vision comes. When it appears, he must interpret it correctly to know who he is, and he must deserve it, or continue to be called No Name. No Name has his vision, a glowing white mare who walks among the stars. She tells No Name his destiny and how to achieve it. He must pass through hostile camps, storm, and fire, risk his life many times to become Conquering Horse, chief of the Sioux. Conquering Horse is the first of Frederick Manfred's five volume series, the Buckskin Man Tales.",
