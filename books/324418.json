He’s got his hands full, trying to keep his errant family in line while lording over the unruly dead in a dark and fantastical land.But even all-powerful Gods have enemies, and Death will have to rely on his quick wits and merciless drive to reclaim his throne as life’s ultimate villain, even if it means sacrificing those closest to him.God of Death is a prequel to River of Shadows, an adult dark fantasy romance based on Finnish Mythology. Though it is set before River of Shadows, it can be read before or after the book as added insight into the Underworld and the character of Death.",
