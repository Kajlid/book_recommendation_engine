  "title": "Pandemic Blunder: Fauci and Public Health Blocked Early Home COVID Treatment",
  "description": "The US public health system and federal agencies failed to support and promote early home/outpatient treatment for the COVID-19 virus. The result was a pandemic blunder of massive proportions... Pandemic Blunder contains considerable medical information and data to support a number of proven safe, cheap generic medicines and protocols that knock out the coronavirus when given early. Read about the pioneering, courageous doctors who have been using innovative approaches to prevent their COVID patients from needing hospital care and facing death. The book includes many expert opinions from doctors who support the view that 70 to 80 percent of COVID deaths could have been prevented—and still can be. Don’t be victimized by disinformation and propaganda from leftist media. Learn how corrupt forces are aiming to make billions of dollars from expensive medicines and vaccines, and how hundreds of thousands of deaths could have—and should have—been prevented!",
