  "description": "HIS RESTLESS HEART BEAT TO A RHYTHM OF ITS OWN- a rhythm that had once been so prevalent in the core of his soul, but had long been lost under the thick layers of routine, expectation, and responsibility created by a quiet, civilized life. Konrad Quintero de Leon, a young American man, having just returned home to New York after his schooling at Oxford University, decides to venture west to rediscover that lost rhythm and peel off the layers that have muffled it for so long.Set in the 1840s, some of America's most restless years, Konrad begins an endless journey in search of his own \"manifest destiny.\" He embarks on a westward expedition with the famous explorer John C. Fremont and legendary mountain man Kit Carson. He roams the wild Texas frontier with the Texas Rangers and fights in the bloody Battle of Monterrey under the command of General Zachary Taylor. But the life of a restless wanderer is not an easy one, as Konrad discovers when he falls in love with the beautiful and exciting Anastasia Carriere-the fiancee of another man. He is cast into a desperate battle where he must choose between the woman he loves and the adventure that he craves.",
