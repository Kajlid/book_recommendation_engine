She thought since they had gone through so much together, nothing can ever come in between them. Once in London, she got sucked into a different world building friendships and seeing life through different eyes. It didn't help that her roommate was friends with the most beautiful man she has ever laid eyes on, Blake Knightly. As the months progressed, she and Blake became close friends. But even though Sienna's attraction to Blake was evidently strong, she wasn't about to give that up for Kyle. She loved Kyle and always will. But one phone call will change all of that. A call that will change her life forever.",
