  "description": "The Stalker Between the StarsI smelled the strange winds that roar between the worlds, bearing the odors of darkling planets and the souls of sundered stars. I felt about me the emptiness of remote and infinite vacuums of space, and their coldness. I saw, blazing on a panoply of jet, unknown constellations and nameless nebulae stretching out and away through the light years into unthinkable abysses of space.Finally, winging through the nearer voids, I spied that enigmatic coffin-shape recognized of old, and again, as in delirious dreams, I heard my lost friend's voice.I yelled in spontaneous response and would have answered yet again, but then, swelling out of the blackness in the wake of Crow's weird craft, bloating up in a green glow, filling my entire view in an instant, there came...A shape! Cthulhu!",
