  "description": "Six persons of uncommon backgrounds are about to be seamed together by a common thread. Circumstance has led each individual on a journey. And though each began on a different route, mapped out by their individual lives, they are now arriving at the same destination and the lesson will soon be learnt that sequential actions can precipitate untold tragedy and the decision of one, can change the lives of others.",
