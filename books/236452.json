  "description": "Senior Irish diplomat, Marty Ransom, is torn between duty to his country and loyalty to the Anglo-Irish tradition in which he was raised. In a land divided into north and south, Planter and Gael, Catholic and Protestant, Marty’s life has been spent walking a tightrope. When he meets Alison, a Home Office employee now transferred to the British embassy in Dublin, Marty’s fidelities are once again split. Lured ever deeper into the lethal world of counter-espionage, he finds himself in fatal conflict with his cousin and childhood friend. As this deadly endgame unfolds, Marty must choose between all which he loves and holds dear, and his allegiance to a past that remains just beyond his reach.",
