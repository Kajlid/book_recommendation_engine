It got itself dart-gunned into a cow butt by a frog man in a porn store! Two stoners are corrupting it on Twitter! And that’s just the first three pages!!Join our dork of destiny as he channels the Collective Unconscious—his psychic superpower—in a harrowing tale of high drama, romance, betrayal, revenge, Jesus chickens, cocaine, weirdos, magicians, ninjas, NFL spies, and disco ball water torture administered to the tune of Rapture, by Blondie.
