As the Big Witch is leaving to pick up her new dress, a visitor, Gloris, arrives to fill in for Cook. While the Big Witch is away, Dorrie helps Gloris prepare dinner. Dorrie quickly becomes suspicious of Gloris, and rightfully so. Gloris does her best to get Dorrie out of the way, and even conjures up an imp to replace Dorrie.",
