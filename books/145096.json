  "description": "Life-Changers is a literary short story with a diverse cast. It is told in short scenes, all related to each other in some way, that each takes on a new point-of-view character who faces a moment that changes their life--some for the better, but some for the worse. It explores what it means to be human and all the different ways we experience the world.",
