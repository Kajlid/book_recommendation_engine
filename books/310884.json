  "description": "Magic always has a price.The legendary kingdom of Lyquirz. A kingdom of life, magic, and death. Ruled by a queen with an iron hand so stiff that no one even dares speak her name, the people hide their magic lest they be recruited into an army and forced to fight in a battle that leads only to death. But there is one. Regina Laelia, a girl cursed by birth, an herbalist in training, and the kingdom's only hope. Her magic is the darkest kind, shadow magic, capable of manipulating people against their will. Day and night, she hides her magic to avoid detection, but fate can't be avoided for long. Destruction, fire, and death throws her into a desperate race for survival, one that she has to win at all costs. She's not alone. Joined by her childhood friend turned doctor with an insatiable flirty attitude for the ladies, a blind ex-knight who seems determined to protect her at every turn despite his hatred for magic, and a baby dragon that can't stand her in the least. She has to learn that sometimes you have to be a little bad to be good, and that her past and her future is more mysterious than she knows.",
