  "description": "Who will you be when no one is watching... when the lights go down?\nPenny\nI don’t know who I am anymore. It’s been so long since I’ve been allowed to think for myself. And now that I can, all I can think about is him. My protector. His massive build which should frighten me but makes me feel safe. And his intense eyes that linger on me when he thinks I’m not looking. But why would he want me? I’m broken.\nShapiro\nI vowed never to get close to anyone again. Do the job, get paid and survive. That’s all. Then she’s thrown into my life, needing a place to hide. She thinks she’s damaged, but she just needs someone to show her how strong she really is. Damn if I don’t want to be that man. But I’ve got a past of my own, and no good deed goes unpunished.",
