  "description": "Being smart in Hell isn’t a blessing, it’s a curse. Poor Adexios, he just can’t live up to his dad's reputation—nor does he want to. He’s got bigger dreams than ferrying damned souls the rest of his life.Problem is Lucifer’s up to his matchmaking tricks again and is determined to pair him with a violent Amazon warrior—with bodacious curves.Dragged into the wilds of Hell, Adexios is supposed to locate demons and conscript them to the legion, but instead discovers a malignant force is at work, and if they’re not careful it might claim their lives.",
