  "description": "There is a path to heal from addiction, and a light to guide your way.You can debate whether addiction is a choice, a disease or whether it is a mental illness. But there is one thing that cannot be contested. Addiction is a sign of great suffering. Somewhere, something triggers a person to embark on a path of self-destruction, and there are many casualties along the way.So what is the cause of this suffering? Where did the war begin? If we can find the cause of the addiction, then we also have in our hands the seed of true healing. I know that each individual has their own unique struggles and traumatic stories to tell. However, through extensive research and analysis, I have found one common cause. With the help of ancient wisdom and modern neuroscience, I have identified the root cause of addiction. It all begins with a disconnection from our true and beautiful spirit. Our spirit is that part of us with no physical location, yet it is our very essence. It calls us to be the best that we can be and live a life sharing our talents and passions. Our spirit defines our true and awesome nature, and yet it is boundaryless and connects us intimately with the world around us.When we deny or suppress our spirit, we begin a war with ourselves, and addiction, with all of its devastating physical and psychological consequences, is the result. The Addiction Healing Pathway presents this ground-breaking revelation. Still, more importantly, it provides a clear route back to the spirit to achieve real freedom from addiction and inspire you to live a life of love and joy.The Addiction Healing Pathway walks you step-by-step through the journey of healing from addiction. It begins with addressing the physical wounds and the immediate needs to gain physical energy and thought clarity. Armed with these resources, the journey moves to challenge limiting beliefs and gain the courage you need to work with distressing emotions. All of these stages move you towards rediscovering the light that has always been there for you and will always be there for you – your spirit. It is a journey of courage and empowerment, teaching you how to reclaim the most important relationships – the connection with your true self.It is time to stop wandering and take the road to find the real you.",
