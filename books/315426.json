  "description": "As Boston's most eligible nanny, I'm nurturing, trustworthy, and professional. Until my one-night stand turns out to be my new boss.  Hawks defenseman James Ryan is Boston's most eligible single-dad. He's solemn, gorgeous, and an incredible father. But I'm drawn to him for other reasons. James's eyes reflect the same grief and hurt I'm drowning in. His twins struggle with the same pain that once destroyed me. Living with the Ryan family and caring for James's twins are both a salve and a curse.  Soon, what made us click one summer night over whiskey is wreaking havoc on our commitment to remain professional. Our friendship blossoms into something more. Something searching, healing, and unbelievably complicated.  Falling in love with Milly and Mason Ryan is easy. Falling in love with their father is something I never saw coming.  If I give my heart to James, will he put it back together? Or will I end up more shattered than I already am?***The Defender is a deeply emotional, single dad romance, with sensitive subject matter.",
