  "description": "Based on the authorÕs own experiences as a cadet at the exclusive United States Military Academy at West Point, Battle Dress is the brutally honest tale of seventeen-year-old Andi Davis, who views her acceptance at West Point as a chance to escape her dysfunctional family and prove to herself that she has what it takes to survive ÒThe Beast,Ó insider terminology for Basic Training. But nothing could have prepared Andi for the rigors that followÑor for the inner strength that she will need to succeed as a woman in a nearly all-male society. Compelling and powerful, but never militaristic, this is a tale of triumph that wonÕt fail to move readers.",
