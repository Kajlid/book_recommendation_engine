  "description": "Who knew the man who claimed to be Neen's long-lost uncle was a big drug lord? Nobody told her what he did for a living. She didn't find out until the night of the raid, when Uncle Julio's men tried to shoot her. She got away, but she's been on the run for the past three years, staying one step ahead of the killers. Former DEA agent Adam Gregory tried to get Neen out before the raid, but he was stabbed in the back by one of his own people. Greg is desperate to find the dirty agent who stabbed him and protect Neen from the killers. He finally finds her in the cemetery, visiting her mother's grave, but the killers have spotted her, too. Greg takes Neen on a wild ride across the country, protecting her from the killers, but not from his love. She tries to keep her distance, but the macho dude cop is hard to resist, and he's determined to make her love him again.",
