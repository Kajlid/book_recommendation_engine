First published in 1972, it was based on the BBC television series about which the (London) Sunday Times a critic commented: \"This is an eye-opener in more ways than one: by concentrating on how we look at paintings . . . he will almost certainly change the way you look at pictures.\" By now he has.\"Berger has the ability to cut right through the mystification of the professional art critics . . . He is a liberator of images: and once we have allowed the paintings to work on us directly, we are in a much better position to make a meaningful evaluation\" —Peter Fuller, Arts Review\"The influence of the series and the book . . . was enormous . . . It opened up for general attention to areas of cultural study that are now commonplace\" —Geoff Dyer in Ways of Telling.",
