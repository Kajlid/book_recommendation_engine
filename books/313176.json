  "description": "HeartEND\n is about how we experience love and some of the journeys we embark on when love strikes our heart. It’s about the numerous complex phases and ever changing stages of the purest human emotions. It might be a first kiss, a new romance, a guilty pleasure or a sense of loss but love always helps us reach the heavens or crash down upon its shores. Love gives even when it takes, it heals and embeds its mark and sculpts us into who we are. “We all open our hearts and in the end this is the love we bleed.” _hydrus",
