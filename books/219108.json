  "description": "Considine stuck up the bank, lit a shuck for old Mexico with a sackful of gold coins and a posse hot on tail. He had a good chance to make it, clean. But he cut the trail of a girl he'd seen a couple nights eariler. He remembered her face, and now he knew he wanted her. Only she had a band of Apaches closing on her!Considine didn't have much choice, he pulled out his rifle, checked the shells, put his spurs to his horse and left the gold behind him in the desert…He knew his chances were pretty damn thin—but so were the girl's!",
