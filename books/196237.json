  "description": "Winter Wishes Sexy Santa was never on his list, but Caleb Gilden stopped writing a Christmas wish list long ago. Santa had always come up short in fulfilling his wishes. That’s why he’s put all of his money and time into his gift shop—at least others can get what’s on their wish list. Reeve Stone wishes for a different outcome of a day when his parents died in a horrific car crash right in front of him and his sister. He knows that isn’t going to happen, so he’ll just keep a smile on his face for his sister’s sake. But when he meets the green-eyed gift shop owner, and is forced into donning a Santa suit for a sick and disadvantaged children’s holiday party, will he finally grant a wish for Caleb? And will Caleb help Reeve through the hardest day of the year only to discover love is what they’ve both been wishing for?",
