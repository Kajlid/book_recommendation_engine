  "description": "Dark Romance (Standalone) She grew up with love but tragedy took everything away from her. He was forced into a life that he hated and was drowning in darkness. They both lost hope...They both looked for ways to numb the pain... To him, she was unpredictable and alluring. To her, he was a dark knight with a shady past. What happened next was unexpected. Their chance encounter was not chance anymore. As their worlds collide and their impenetrable walls are infiltrated, these two dark souls are forced to face the one thing on earth that scares them the mostâ€¦ Love. ***This is a standalone novel and does not need to be read with books one and two of the Twisted Series. ***Warning-For mature audiences only.Wild Cards is a love story of the greatest and most epic proportions. However this love story faced many bumps in the road and in order to tell Luc and Vicky's story I needed to touch on the scene of aggravated sexual assault. I feel it is my job to advise the reader of this violent episode. This aspect does not define the whole story and the book is not about violence rather about two dark souls saving each other while finding true love.",
