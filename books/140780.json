  "description": "When James Riley transfers to Cloverley University, he is instantly on the radar of the most elusive secret society on campus, the Lappell. James is an artist. A loner. A free thinker. He doesn't believe in secret societies and wants nothing to do with them. That is, until everything changes. Until he meets her. Anais. The girl who changes it all. The girl who makes him willing to do whatever it takes to own her heart. But the deeper he falls in love, the deeper he sinks into the secret society that has a hold of her. And the further he gets caught up in their world, the more he scrapes the edges about a past he knew nothing about. James has no idea how much of his life is a part of a story that once broke down the walls of the Lappell, many years ago. Who can he trust when love and lies collide? And what happens when the past becomes the present? Secret Societies. Romance. Mystery. This is Jamesâ€™s story. The spin off story to the PIECES OF LIES trilogy. Can be read as a standalone series. Fiendish Play is new adult romance. It will be part of a two book series and contains some mature sexual content intended for 18+ readers.",
