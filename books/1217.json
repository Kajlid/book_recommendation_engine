At the time of his death he was Professor of Linguistics at the University of Chicago and a noted translator of poetry from the ancient Tamil. This volume of his collected poems, the first such collection to be published, includes poems out of the three books he published during his lifetime, and a fourth collection left unpublished at his death.Reflecting his lifelong interests in folklore, anthropology, structuralism, and biculturalism, the poems will be welcomed by all lovers of contemporary poetry.",
