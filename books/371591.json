  "description": "Tough, book-loving Denver homicide detective Cliff Janeway wants to nail Jackie Newton--a suspected psychopath who just barely beat the rap for a series of vagrant killings. Janeway is certain his sleazy, sadistic nemesis is to blame for the recent murder of a down-and-out rare book hunter--and treats Newton to a rather brutal helping of off-duty justice that ultimately costs the overzealous cop his badge. A civilian once more, Janeway now has time to pursue his true passion--the buying and selling of valuable first editions--and to get to the bottom of the unfortunate bookscourts still-unsolved slaying. For somewhere undercover, in the bizarre, cutthroat world of bookmen and collectors, someone is dealing death along with vintage Chandlers and Twains.",
