  "description": "Perry has the courtship from Hell—literally. Too bad that isn’t her only problem.Ever since her powers as an earth sorceress came to her, every living thing nearby becomes insanely fruitful. It’s embarrassing when people fall into clinches in Perry’s wake, and plants put on months’ growth when she walks by. Then the sorcerer Hadis kidnaps her, whisking her away to his bleak, barren realm. Caught between a grieving mother who’s ravaging the living world and a powerful sorcerer blinded by a love spell, Perry must discover what exiles Hadis to his terrible domain. Only when she learns where her wild magic fits into the puzzle can she free both herself and Hadis—and find a way to make her unexpected love for him possible.Springtime in Hades is a modern retelling of the Persephone and Hades myth.",
