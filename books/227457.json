  "title": "Karmesin: The World's Greatest Criminal -- Or Most Outrageous Liar",
  "description": "Gerald Kersh (1911-1968) wrote amazing novels and hundreds of short stories about the weird and wonderful people he met during his lifetime. The most intriguing was Karmesin, a master thief and self confessed genius. His robberies, cons and double crosses involve split second timing, almost supernatural foresight, and spine-tingling nerve. But is he telling Kersh the truth? For the first time all 17 short stories are collected in a single volume so that you can decide for yourself.",
