  "title": "Erotism: Death and Sensuality",
  "description": "Taboo and sacrifice, transgression and language, death and sensualityâ€”Georges Bataille pursues these themes with an original, often startling perspective. He challenges any single discourse on the erotic. The scope of his inquiry ranges from Emily Bronte to Sade, from St. Therese to Claude Levi-Strauss, and Dr. Kinsey; and the subjects he covers include prostitution, mythical ecstasy, cruelty, and organized war. Investigating desire prior to and extending beyond the realm of sexuality, he argues that eroticism is \"a psychological quest not alien to death.\"",
