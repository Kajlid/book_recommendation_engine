  "description": "“From a little spark may burst a flame.” ~ Dante AlighieriMadeline~Life’s lessons taught me well.Dreams and happy endings are simply illusions our mind creates to soften life’s blows. I am no longer a little girl who believes in fairy tales or the existence of knights on white horses.While I never intended to return to Chicago or to see him again, the decision was out of my control. Now I am here, and I can’t or won’t allow the spark in his piercing blue eyes to reignite my heart the way his predatory gaze sets fire to my body.Patrick Kelly is my past—a childish attraction.We are no longer children.Patrick~I may have started as nothing, but that is history.Today I’m part of the royalty—a duke, a lord, or perhaps a knight—anointed by and within the upper echelon of the Sparrow dynasty. The wide-eyed tourists entering Chicago have no idea of what lies beneath the surface as they stare at the shimmering lake and shiny buildings.Nothing is as it seems.Sparrows control everything—no one enters our realm without our knowledge or catches us unaware.No one until her.Now that she’s here, there is too much at stake to give in to the spark that seeing her rekindles within me. Surely if it were allowed to burn, the flames will consume both of our worlds, leaving only ashes.From New York Times bestselling author Aleatha Romig comes a brand-new dark romance, Spark, set in the dangerous world of the Chicago underground. It's time to get caught up in this new and intriguing saga, Web of Desire.SPARK is book one of the WEB OF DESIRE trilogy that continues in FLAME and concludes in ASHES.Have you been Aleatha’d?",
