  "description": "Jenny is a single mother. She has raised her children as best she could while carrying a secret that grew harder to tell with each day that passed. Enough of those days passed where it became impossible, and then unnecessary, to reveal what had been thrust upon her all those years ago: she had almost forgotten herself.As adults, Jennyâ€™s children are polar opposites; one craves success, the other lives from one day to the next.As a family, they will be confronted with truths that will weaken and then galvanise. Tragedy strikes, but the suffering is endured, and bonds will be forged that will heal what were their weakest moments.",
