  "description": "You Don’t Choose The Academy. The Academy Chooses You.   The last of the Culling Trials is here. I foolishly thought I’d survived the worst.  My team is falling to pieces around me and my heart is shattered for the losses I’ve endured. But I can’t stop when I’m so close to the end. There are too many people depending on me.  I foolishly thought there wasn’t much more I could lose…until the nature of my bloodline comes to light.  I’m not what I thought I was. Not what anyone thought I was. But to tell people the truth would be to kill us all.  To fail the trials will mean death, but to succeed might damn me for life.",
