  "description": "Out of Dynamite Entertainment's critically acclaimed title, The Boys, comes a special story featuring everyone's favorite pint-sized Scotsman, Hughie, with The Boys: Highland Laddie, written by Garth Ennis, with covers by Darick Robertson and art by Herogasm artist John McCrea. Mind reeling from cataclysmic events in New York, Wee Hughie heads home to Auchterladle - the semi-idyllic Scottish seaside town where he grew up. All Hughie wants is some time to himself, to return to the bosom of family and friends, and get his head together after two years of unimaginable chaos. But our hero's luck has always been more cloud than silver lining, and the familiar surroundings he craves are not all they might be. Old pals are warped beyond recognition, strangers in town are up to no good, and a figure from Hughie's recent past has come back to resolve some unfinished business. You can go home again - but whether or not you should is another matter entirely. The Boys, Vol. 8: Highland Laddie collects issues 1-6 of the hit mini-series, The Boys: Highland Laddie by Garth Ennis and John McCrea, and features all of the covers by The Boys co-creator, Darick Robertson",
