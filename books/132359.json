  "description": "Gloria Larsen knows only three things about her birth mother: she was over forty, she lived in Rosewood, Nebraska, and she was accused of murder in 1974. When Gloria is offered a job as newspaper editor in the small town, she jumps at the opportunity to discover the identity of her birth mother. Digging into the past, she finds a story of the disappearance of a judge's wife and four friends accused of murder. Gloria tracks the now-elderly women to an assisted-living facility. This is Gloriaâ€™s chance to write the story of a lifetime and finally know her heritage. Even if she can't learn the truth of her origins, she must find out what really happened to Naomi Waterman Talbot.",
