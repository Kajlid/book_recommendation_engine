  "description": "As we journey toward 2024, we expect that the impacts of deploying digital technologies will become less predictable and manageable. Significant and disruptive advances in technology areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), together with wider societal and environmental shifts, will lead to a variety of disruptions that we refer to as Cusps and Event Horizons. These have the potential to derail even the most established business models and ways of living. Technology is not only a source of disruption but can also be an enabler of the flexibility and adaptability required to successfully negotiate the challenges of Cusps and navigate the uncharted territories of Event Horizons. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed some businesses that were quickly able to repurpose their capabilities to respond to the crisis, and some that found themselves unable to effectively continue their operations. There were some who believed they had effective digital strategies, but who could not scale up in areas like remote-working, online-services and supply chains. Those businesses that had already embraced web-scale IT architectures and adopted platform ecosystem models (for resilience, data-driven automation and value exchange), were best placed to ride the storm. The widely anticipated economic slowdown, market fragility, shifting attitudes away from globalization, and the environmental sustainability imperative will all contribute to future unpredictability. They will bring potentially dramatic shifts in business and society, and we are likely to see them materialize in areas such as:• Redesigning of supply chains and value ecosystems (as a part of resilience and replacement strategies);• Renewed approaches to data privacy regulations, allowing insights of critical national and global importance to be derived. This will need to go hand in hand with robust cybersecurity strategiesNew business partnership models and disruptive merger and acquisition activity, together with an increased willingness to collaborate and co-innovate;• A sharp focus on sustainability, decarbonization and circular economy models;• An accelerated uptake of technologies like 3D printing and business automation to boost enterprise flexibility and agility;• A shift in emphasis toward remote working and technology enabled skills augmentation;• A reformulation of IT strategies, to deliver scalability, security and sustainability by design;• A more deliberate and integrated approach to AI and knowledge management that embraces the need for explainability and ethical operation;• A reassessment of what is considered to be essential and what might be dismissed as unnecessary luxury. Will we see a rebalancing of the current wealth divide?• A re-evaluation of the core purposes that underpin enterprise, government and societal activities. The question remains as to how business and society will respond to the challenges that lie ahead. How will economies respond to previously unseen levels of national and personal debt? What will be the result of anticipated advances in areas such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence? What skill sets (both hard and soft) will be most relevant in this ever-changing world?It is likely that meaningful responses will involve enterprises rethinking the core of their nature and purpose, introducing a strength of alignment between 'Consensus', 'Collective' and 'Potential' in a context that is wider than ever before. The resulting underlying purpose will then embrace the kind of thinking which people can intuitively and emotionally align with, and which will enable the negotiation of even the most disruptive of Event Horizons.",
