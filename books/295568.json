  "description": "There's no turning back. I can't go home a failure--again. Everyone wants to use me, make me their pawn, but I have other plans. I will win this election or die trying.  Randi Sawyer It started with a shady business proposal I should've turned down. Now here I am pretending to be someone I'm not, and bonus, I'm at the mercy of a man whose joy comes from my failures. The deeper I sink into DC's seedy political scene the more I realize I can't trust anyone if I'm going to make it out alive. Until him. Secret Service agent Trey Benson is bitter, jaded, and oh so hot with his mischievous smirk and cocky attitude. He hates me, just like everyone else, but he might just be who I need to survive this mess I've landed myself in. Trey Benson Forced onto her protection detail, I'm certain she's just another Political Barbie in this city. I should know--I've dated most of them. Except she's not. Funny, foulmouthed and crazy as hell, not to mention drop-dead gorgeous, Randi Sawyer just might be the one person who can make a difference in DC--and in me. Too bad the boss says she's off-limits, that it's too risky for her career and mine. Good thing I've never been great at sticking to orders. Power Play is the first book in the five-book Power Play series. Each book cannot be read as a standalone. All five books follow one main couple's relationship as it grows through a five-year time period. It's suspenseful, steamy, and oh so unputdownable. If you're a fan of Tiffany Snow, Meghan March, and Skye Warren then this series is for YOU!",
