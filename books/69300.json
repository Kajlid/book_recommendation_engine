  "description": "Quarterback Tyler Harris is about to find the woman who can get past his defensive line and reach his heart.With two championships in as many years, superstar Tyler Harris is the best quarterback in the league. Gorgeous and rich, he's at the top of his game. But everyone's looking to take him down. There's a building media frenzy around an unfortunate accident, and the only safe place seems a rundown mansion deep in the San Juans and owned by his late great uncle. There, Tyler gets sacked by the sassy redhead next door. It's more alive than he's felt in years.Lavender Mead has a good reason to dislike jocks, namely an absentee father who deserted the family to coach college football. Maybe that explains her penchant for bad boys who play ball for a living and break hearts for a hobby. Her new neighbor seems just the type. Yet, something is different about Tyler, and sometimes love requires a Hail Mary. You draw back your arm, pray...and give it all up to fate. And sometimes you win your ring.",
