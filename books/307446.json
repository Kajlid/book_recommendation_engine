  "title": "Slaughter Daughter",
  "description": "I'm being framed for murder, but I've got three great reasons to fight: Jag, Braedon, and freaking self-respect. My parents are serial killers. At least according to the cops and the media. Never convicted, nor arrested and charged. Tell that to the media's nickname for me: Slaughter Daughter. The infamy follows me wherever I go. I won't give in to the bullying and, despite how it looks, I'm not a murderer. Problem is, the copycat killer on campus is doing his or her best to frame me. And as if I don't have enough problems, I've got two hot guys angling for a spot in my bed. Terrible, I know. Is it wrong to enjoy them vying for my affection? To give them my trust? Their betrayal leads to me finally discovering the secret behind everything. If only the truth didn't come at the cost of my life--and my only chance at love. Contains mature themes.",
