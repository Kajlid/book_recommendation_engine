  "description": "The Animals, a Memoir is an unsentimental exploration of the terrible burden of meaning and emotion carried by the animals in the author's life - the forbidden childhood pet, the disastrous attempt at pig farming as her high-powered marriage fell apart, the deaf Akita (\"dog of the divorce\"), the violent cat acting out the family violence, and Ben, the beautiful, adored Border Collie who spirals into madness.",
