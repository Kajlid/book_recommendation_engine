  "description": "It came as a shock, when self-styled ‘ghetto queen,’ Geneva, was contacted by lawyers who claimed that Stanley Walters, the deceased uptown financier, was her father. His will contained several conditions that had to be met before she could inherit what was left to her. One condition was that she had to live with her sister, a girl who was the same age as Geneva, for a full year to forge sisterly bonds.Geneva left Froggie, her ‘ghetto don,’ behind and found herself in the rarefied atmosphere of uptown living. She had to contend with Pamela, her father’s widow, and the attention of a suave up-towner, Justin, who was determined that she should forget her past and move on with him.",
