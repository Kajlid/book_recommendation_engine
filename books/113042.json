  "description": "The Honorable Logan Makefield has hired two new judicial law clerks -- Olivia Sullivan who is hard-working, responsible and determined to make a difference and Drew Pierce who is confident, charismatic and determined to make a name for himself. Fierce competition transforms to reluctant cooperation when the two young attorneys find themselves in the middle of some decidedly nonjudicial proceedings. Meanwhile, evidence of their irrefutable attraction leads to admissions, discovery and some very interesting motions. Can two people with nothing in common, figure out a way to make it work, while working together? Find out in Judicial Misconduct.",
