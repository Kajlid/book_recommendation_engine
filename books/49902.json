  "description": "Rocco Mamione has possibly the best wingman in the world—his grandmother. He had no idea that when his nonna was fired from the job she’d had for thirty years, she’d demand the best employment lawyer in London. And that lawyer just happens to be his ex-girlfriend. His Nonna had been giving him the “where are my great-grandbabies goo-goo eyes for some time now. The only person he’d ever imagined having those with was Anna. To get her back will be the ultimate challenge, but Rocco is nothing if not Sicilian resilient.Anna Taylor is not an Ice Princess. She was just burned pretty badly, and anyone can talk about it, if they want a biro in their eye. Smart enough to avoid further heartbreak and a potential conviction for murder, Anna is sure that nothing will take her down the Mamione path again. Definitely not his crazy grandmother or her crack-addictive cakes. Not Rocco’s hard body underneath those tailor-made suits. And absolutely not the fact that she’s still in love with him. The truth could just about do it.The third book in the Italian Knights series encompasses a good sponge, endurance, redemption, and letting go so you can get what you need. If he happens to be Sicilian, then so be it.",
