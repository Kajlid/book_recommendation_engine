  "description": "This is a coming of age book about a gay teen. It’s not a story about supernatural beings or a Christian text. Bullied and friendless, with little love or support from his parents, seventeen year-old Adam has reached his breaking point. Just as he’s about to take the irrevocable last step, he meets Angel, who helps him see another path.Angel’s life has been a series of tragedies and barriers. He has no time to take on other people’s problems, but when he recognizes Adam’s desperation, he can’t turn away. On the spur of the moment, he becomes the younger boy’s protector and introduces him to a new group of friends who help Adam develop the strength and self-confidence to confront and overcome his fears. The two boys from different backgrounds have little in common, yet their newfound friendship propels them both toward achieving their dreams. Angel embarks on a road to independence while Adam, for the first time, finds love. But just when things can’t get much better, Adam is faced with his worst nightmare and has to make a life-altering choice.This book contains themes that may trigger negative responses in readers, such as attempted suicide, discussion of a death of a background character, physical and verbal bullying, discussions of sexual practices, including safe sex, and potentially offensive language. Some themes in this book may not be appropriate for readers under fifteen years of age.",
