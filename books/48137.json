  "description": "…A split second later in the same galaxy as before, but pretty far away… Rake and Ravil have escaped Earth and the Empire, towing the rest of their friends and new allies with them/ They flee to an abandoned Empire colony known only as Seed Planet 15. Out of fuel and common sense, they crash and nearly wreck their ship, stranding them in the middle of a seemingly endless swamp. On first glance the place looks mostly harmless, but what they've landed on is anything but. Seed Planet 15 has a nasty history. The planet has more hidden in the mist than just ghosts and rumors. And if the crew doesn’t get off the planet soon, there will be nothing left of them but spare parts and a rusted ship. Book 2 of the Wastes Series. 154,000 Mature - language, sex (consensual and non-consensual), graphic violence",
