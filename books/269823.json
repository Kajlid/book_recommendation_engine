  "description": "An exploration of connections, You Deserve More dives into the twists and turns of relationships. Too many times we settle for relationships that are harmful, toxic, and do nothing but break our hearts and cripple our souls. This is a book of prose and poetry that teaches us not to settle for less than what we deserve. You Deserve More is a raw representation of the hearts turmoil, the journey of constant realization, and the road to immeasurable healing. There will be moments that seem to break you. But you are bending, you are folding into who you are meant to be. All my life I have been told that God never gives you any situation you can’t handle. Sometimes the way my heart breaks I’m not sure I believed that. But I always got back up on my feet. Life continued. Wounds become more of a saving grace than a crutch. There is nothing you can’t get through, no matter how impossible that seems. You will make it, you will be ok, and you will be alright. Trust yourself and trust that this journey is one that is a part of your becoming.",
