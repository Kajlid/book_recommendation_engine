Most last only a season or two before they die. Even Richard St Vier, the finest swordsman in the city, lives his life at swordspoint.On the Hill, the elite of the city—the beautiful Diane, Duchess of Tremontaine; Lord Horn, a languid, aging libertine; the dangerous Lord Ferris, one-eyed Dragon Chancellor of the Council of Lords; and the young rake Michael Godwin—throw sumptuous barge parties, attend the theatre, plot and scheme, slip in and out of romantic liaisons. But there is a plot afoot to gain control of the city, and the chosen instrument is Richard St Vier.And if St Vier does not wish to be used, they will force him, even if it tears the fabric of the city apart…",
