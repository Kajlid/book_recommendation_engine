  "title": "The Story of Sex: A Graphic History Through the Ages",
  "description": "The first graphic history of sex chronicles sexuality and human intimacy through the ages, from our primate pasts to our robotic futures.Humans have had sex on the brain since pre-civilization either for pleasure, power, revenge, a desire for children, or simply because it isn't allowed. Today, sex is all around us but it's rarely explained and almost never taught. In The Story of Sex, sexologist Phillipe Brenot combines anthropology, sociology, psychology and history with witty comics by Latetita Coryn for an in-depth explanation of this essential aspect of humanity. Organized chronologically into sections like Babylon: Free Love, The Middle Ages: Heaven and Hell, and The 20th Century: Sexual Liberation, Brenot explores what eroticism really is, how our ancestors behaved sexually, when the first couple was established, how superstition and morality laws shaped sexuality, the use of pornography in the digital age, and how some ancient civilizations were far ahead of their time when it came to gender equality.Full of fascinating details like Cleopatra's invention of the vibrator and a Dutch shopkeeper's accidental discovery of the existence of sperm - all accompanied by hilarious comics and dialogue - The Story of Sex is informative, unique, and entertaining book.",
