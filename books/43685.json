  "description": "“This is why I read romances - to escape into a world that is magical and where good triumphs over evil.” ~ BookAddict ReviewsAfter years in foster care, Breanne Gallagher has the stable life she’s always wanted, living with her foster sister and working as a chef. Then one devastating night, a hellish creature invades her apartment and shatters her fragile existence. Shifting between monster and man, it slaughters her foster sister and assaults Bree. Alone, wounded, her beloved home tainted by gruesome memories, Bree flees to a tiny wilderness town, following her only clue to her past.Shapeshifting warriors, Zeb and Shay move from one pack to another, hunting the hellhounds which prey on their kind. Assigned to Cold Creek, they manage a decrepit fishing lodge for their \"human\" cover. Their first renter is a pretty human female who trembles at the sight of them—yet stands her ground. She’s foolishly courageous, ferociously determined, and heartbreakingly hurt. Although shapeshifters aren’t attracted to humans, this female’s beauty and compelling scent ignites longings neither loner ever expected to face.Bree is healing, learning to shoot the biggest pistol she can find, and overcoming her fears, especially of the two deadly, disconcertingly attractive hunters. Her life is back on track…until she tries to save a little girl from a hellhound and discovers that everything she knows about herself is false.",
