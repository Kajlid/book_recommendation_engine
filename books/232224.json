  "description": "Here together for the first time in one volume are the first two books in Terry Brooks’ enthralling epic, The Heritage of Shannara.Since the death of the Druid Allanon, the Four Lands have changed profoundly, with magic strictly forbidden in the Southland, now under totalitarian rule. In Book One, The Scions of Shannara, Par Ohmsford, descendant of the fabled Shea and possesor of the power of the Wishsong, accidentally brings a mythic horror to life, and a man calling himself Cogline drives it away. Cogline brings a message from Allanon: venture to the dread Hadeshorn, along with the other Scions of Shannara– Par, his brother Coll, Wren, and Walker Boh. On the way to the Hadeshorn, they must face the dangerous Shadowen. When they finally arrive, Allanon's spirit reveals a dangerous secret. In the future, all life in the Four Lands will be destroyed. To prevent this terrible fate, Allanon commands Par to recover the long-lost Sword of Shannara, a task that is next to impossible.Ancient evil forces remain in control of the Four Lands in The Druid of Shannara. To restore the Keep of the Druid Allanon, Walker Boh sets out on a journey to find the black Elfstone. After narrowly escaping death, he learns that the Elfstone lies in the hands of the Stone King. Now Walker Boh must venture into perilous, unknown lands with a strange band of fellow travelers that includes Morgan Leah, whose once-magic sword has been broken; Quickening, the daughter of the ancient King; and Pe Ell, an assassin who hatches his own dark, sinister plot. Can they capture the black Elfstone and restore peace to the Four Lands?",
