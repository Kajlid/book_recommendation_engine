  "title": "Five Plays: Antigone / Eurydice / The Ermine / The Rehearsal / Romeo and Jeannette",
  "description": "The great French playwright Jean Anouilh (1910-87) wrote both \"pink\" bittersweet comedies and \"black\" tragic dramas. Jean Anouilh Five Plays ― the finest English-language anthology of his works ― crackles with both his sharp wit and his icy cynicism. In Antigone , his preeminent play and exemplar of his themes and style, he creates a disturbing world in which fate may be no more than a game of role-playing. Eurydice , The Ermine , The Rehearsal , R omeo and Jeannette are the other plays included in this edition.",
