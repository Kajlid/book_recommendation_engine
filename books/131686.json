Well, you decide to celebrate them, that’s what!At least, that’s what George Mahood did. He had a nice, comfortable life, with a job, a wife, and three young children. But he felt like he was missing out on a lot of what the world had to offer. The calendar is full of these quirky, weird and wonderful events, and George realised that somebody somewhere had created these holidays, believing that they were important enough to warrant their own official day. Surely he should therefore be more appreciative of their existence? He decided to try and celebrate them all, in the hope that it would turn him into a happier, more intelligent and more content person. Follow George on his hilarious, life changing adventure as tries to balance his normal life with a wealth of new experiences, people, facts and bizarre situations.
