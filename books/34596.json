  "description": "It’s been three years since a devastating pandemic transformed most of the world’s human population into vicious, wild animals. Ed Brady and his two sons have relied solely on each other in order to survive a world completely devoid of stability and structure. Their goal: reach the city by the river where they may have some chance of finding salvation.As Ed and his boys travel across the wasteland that was once the Midwestern United States, they encounter other survivors along the way: Trish Connor, who discovers that some of the worst monsters in the new world aren’t the infected. Dave Porter, his wife and their friend, who eke out a living scavenging houses until their survival is threatened by two gunmen. Brenda Peterson and Tammy Koch, misfits in the old world, whose friendship will be tested by new acquaintances. And Mitchell Burdette, a grizzled old gunslinger who finds redemption and purpose after losing everything to the virus.As their paths inevitably intertwine, Ed must remain steadfast that his sworn mission to see that his boys know safety and happiness is not compromised. Surrounded by the constant threat of attack, can they make it to the city before their luck runs out? And if they can, what will be waiting for them there when they arrive? Will the city be the safe haven they so desperately need, or will it be just another ruined metropolis teeming with hordes of the infected?",
