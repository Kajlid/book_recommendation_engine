  "description": "Evangeline Webster is a woman who knows what she wants and how to get it. Her bar, Temptation, is her life, leaving her no time for any sort of romance unless it’s a quick and dirty one-night stand followed by a side of never-see-you-again. The last thing she expects is for a ghost from her past to wander into her bar, threatening everything she’s worked so hard for.Beau Jenkins' whole life changes with a diagnosis. He gives up his studies and his life in order to care for his ailing mother. When fate eventually snatches her away, he loses not just the woman who raised him single-handedly, but also his foundation. He’s revived by a chance encounter with the woman who has haunted his thoughts for years. She brings him back to life, but his fears and regrets stand in the way of him chasing what he always wanted with her.",
