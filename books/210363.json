  "title": "27 Truths: Ava's Story",
  "description": "From USA Today Bestselling author, MJ Fields, comes a gripping story of love and it's many truths.  Ava Links was raised seeing the different sides of love. The beautiful and the broken. Through it all, she knows the journey she is taking will lead her to the man she is destined to be with. The man she has always loved, Luke Lane.  But as we know, there are no guarantees in this world, no promises that can not be broken, and no way you will know what tomorrow brings.  **** A note for the readers****  At present time, this story is slated as a duet. In the writing process things change. This story has been begging to be told for two years. Although not necessary, The Love series, The Wrapped series, and The Burning Souls series can be read before The Truth About Love.  This is not Steel or Caldwell, but at the core is a strong family just the same. It does not promise an HEA or laughs. This is heart, heat, and will evoke feelings that are not always pleasant.  To the lovers of my first works. You have been patient. You have been... persistent. The wait is almost over. After you read this, please remember you asked for it. Love you anyways.",
