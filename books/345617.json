  "description": "“The vivid flashes of lightning that shot every now and then through the cracks of the closely shuttered window, making a skeleton of its framework, added not a little to its terror, there being no other light in the room save that....”An abandoned inn, a crime that took 16 years to be discovered, a generational story of love and betrayal all await the listener in this rendition of Anna Katharine Green’s The Forsaken Inn. A bride arrives on her wedding night and leaves the next day...or did she? Sixteen years later her long-deceased corpse is found at the inn and the unraveling of the mystery of her death begins.Anna Katharine Green (1846-1935), a prolific author and “the mother of the detective novel,” wrote The Forsaken Inn in 1889. It is a standalone murder mystery with hints of gothic paranormal influences.©1909 Anna Katharine Green (P)2020 Voices of Today",
