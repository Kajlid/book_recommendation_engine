  "description": "Throughout her life, Loretta Veney has chronicled family events through journals, photos, and videos, seeking to capture every moment. After learning that her beloved mother Doris was the first female in the family to suffer from dementia, Loretta began documenting the details of doctor visits, and recording people, places, and things as a substitute for lost memory. Loretta, a motivational teacher and trainer, who has delivered speeches and presentations and conducted workshops throughout the U.S. and Europe, through her book, her first published work, offers a wealth of encouragement. “Being My Mom’s Mom” invites readers on Loretta’s personal journey before and after the onset of her Mom’s dementia. Personal vignettes highlight the heartache and humor in this life-changing disease. She offers strategies from real experience for building the best care team for loved ones, increasing one's capacity for patience, and making the most of every day. Loretta confirms the difficulty of acknowledging when it’s time to become the “parent of a parent”. She also offers hope that loving relationships with dementia sufferers can continue, even in the realization that the past is forgotten, and the future is the present.",
