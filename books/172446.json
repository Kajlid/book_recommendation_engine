  "description": "Things are not going so good in Heaven. God has been away for a couple of thousand years, busying Himself creating billions of galaxies, and son Jesus has been left to handle the goings on down on Earth. Unfortunately it hasnâ€™t gone too well. The humans have messed everything up. Big time. Jesus is in a state of despair. God returns, finally, to discover His human experiment has fallen apart. To top it all He finds a motley bunch of protesters outside the Pearly Gates demanding His head. And everyone waits, with bated breath, to see what The Almighty is going to do about it.",
