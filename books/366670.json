  "description": "A Tale of Two Daddies is a playground conversation between two children. The boy says he heard that the girl has two dads. The girl says that is right--she has Daddy and Poppa. True to a child's curiosity, practical questions follow: \"Which dad helps when your team needs a coach? / Which dad cooks you eggs and toast?\" To which she answers: \"Daddy is my soccer coach. / Poppa cooks me eggs and toast.\" This picture book is intended for 4- to 8-year olds, and introduces a type of family increasingly visible in modern society and reflects a child's practical and innocent look at the adults who nurture and love her. It becomes clear that the family's loving bond is unburdened by any cultural discomforts.",
