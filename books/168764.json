Combining the themes of three classic wonder tales \"East of the Sun, West of the Moon\", \"The Black Bull of Norroway\" and \"The White Bear King\" this exquisite fairy tale takes its roots from the Scandinavian tradition, but its story and its message (\"where there is no trust, there can be no love\") are universal.",
