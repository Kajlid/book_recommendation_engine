Part captor, part benefactor, Jim calls her Evie and tells her he's hiding her to protect her. That she did something terrible one night back home in Melbourne -- something so unspeakable that he had no choice but to take her away. The trouble is, Kate can't remember the night in question. The fragments of Kate's shattered memories of her old life seem happy: good friends, a big house in the suburbs, a devoted boyfriend. Jim says he'll help her fill in the blanks -- but his story isn't adding up. And as she tries to reconcile the girl she thought she'd been with the devastating consequences Jim claims she's responsible for, Kate will unearth secrets about herself and those closest to her that could change everything. A riveting debut novel that fearlessly plumbs the darkest recesses of the mind, Call Me Evie explores the fragility of memory and the potential in all of us to hide the truth, even from ourselves.",
