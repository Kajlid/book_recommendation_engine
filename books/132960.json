  "description": "The wrong girl is sometimes The Right One.Charlotte Samuels thought she’d be stuck waiting tables at Marlow’s until all her debts are paid off—in about ten thousand years or so.She definitely didn’t expect a marriage proposal from the arrogant Brandon Maxfield who was mysteriously blackmailed by his father to make her his wife if he didn’t want his least favorite cousin to run Maxfield Industries.Charlotte’s instinct was to say HELL NO! but she’s stumped by a few obstacles:\t1.\tHis old man Martin Maxfield is dear to her heart and has been recently deteriorating in health. \t2.\tShe gets a million dollars if she stays married to Brandon for a year. \t3.\tShe rather likes the opportunity to teach the attractive but awfully rude man a few lessons he didn’t think he needed from a ‘teenage gold-digger’—his term of endearment for her on their first date—er, business meeting. So what’s a girl got to do, right?Sure, she’s young and a little rough around the edges but there’s something her would-be husband didn’t know about her yet—she’s nothing like he ever expected.Thrust into the glitzy world a standard-issue Mrs. Maxfield would fit perfectly and rule with impeccable social grace, Charlotte will either have to force herself into the mold or break free of it, risking what little she has left for everything that she can gain.*Currently free to read in Wattpad",
