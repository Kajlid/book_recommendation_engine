Twenty years later, when the now-famous pop star returns home to coastal North Carolina, Alyssa gets a second chance to make a first impression on Michael. On sabbatical from his failing marriage, Michael agrees to an interview with Alyssa, a journalist for the local tourist magazine. When the chemistry between them ignites, Alyssa and Michael are hit with the harsh reality that he isn't yet free to love her.
