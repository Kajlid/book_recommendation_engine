  "description": "Fix-ups are the worst for Katelyn “Kate” Gray, who hasn’t trusted a man since her father took off when her mother was pregnant with her and her twin brother Jason. So when the gods send Kate back to ancient Rome and into the arms of a famous gladiator, she’s certainly going to have something to say about it. Even if he is, for all intents and purposes, her soul mate!Losing has never been an option for Crispinus “Crispin” Agallon, the champion gladiator of the thriving Roman metropolis. But when he happens upon a woman standing in his chambers – a woman he finds himself very much attracted to (and thusly acts on such feelings) – she immediately flees, leaving him with burning questions he wants answered, and a small chest containing a king’s ransom in rubies. Without considering love – a fool’s illusion, he believes – Crispin sets out in search of the bewitching beauty that snared his attention earlier that day. Kate never wanted a guardian, especially some overbearing, loutish, uncouth gladiator who calls himself “Crispinus”; and yet she can’t help but admit that having this big, strong, and strikingly handsome brute at her side feels, surprisingly, right… Crispin thinks he knows what to expect of his new companion (all women are the same, aren’t they), only she surprises him with her undeniable innocence, her sweet spirit, and her love. Who is this strange foreign woman, and how will he stop himself from losing his heart?",
