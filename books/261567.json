  "description": "Cara has known her whole life that she was different than those around her. She excelled at school and sports with little effort and oftentimes felt that she did not belong, but on the night of her sixteenth birthday, everything changes. A mysterious tattoo burns its way onto her wrist. Her Aunt refuses to answer any of Cara's questions, and she is left with no answers as to what or why this mark appeared. She is lost and unsure as to what is happening to her, until two years later, when everything comes crashing down.  Cara meets the handsome and dark stranger, Silas, who shares the exact same marking on his wrist. Elated to have found her, Silas explains that they are Godlings, descendants of the goddess Aphrodite and blessed to find their soul mates and gain immeasurable power. But with every new discovery also comes danger. Godlings, powerful as they may be, are hunted by soul reapers, descendants of Hades, ruler of the underworld, who are hell-bent on taking the powers that come with killing a Godling, and they have Cara in their sights. Now, on the run, Cara and Silas will do anything it takes to make it out alive.",
