  "description": "Gwyn ap Nudd - newly crowned King of the Unseelie Kingdom - is saddled with a broken Court, not knowing who he can trust, while the bright Seelie Court bears down upon them, seeking to depower the Unseelie Kingdom once and for all. His lover and Advisor, waterhorse Augus Each Uisge, is unloved by many, fielding multiple assassination attempts. Drifting away from each other as life threatens to completely fracture the tenuous connection they have, they must both find allies and a way to survive in a world of fae fraught with chaos.While officially the sequel to Game Theory, this has hopefully been written in a way to allow newcomers entry into the Fae Tales Verse with minimal pre-reading necessary.
