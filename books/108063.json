  "description": "Ellie Garrett never planned on being a divorced, single mother-she also never planned to get married again. Ever. Her ordinary life changes when the house across the street is sold. The new owner is Nick Coulter-quarterback and MVP for the Sacramento Defenders. Oh yeah, he's also one of People magazine's top 100 most beautiful people and America's most eligible bachelor. So why would she pick him to have her first crush on since her divorce?Recently retired from the NFL, Nick is more than ready to find a wife and start a family. He's tired of his high-profile lifestyle and moves to Pleasant Wood, Colorado, hoping to finally settle down and focus on his foundation Kids Come First. It would just feel nice to be a normal guy. Of course being rebuffed by Ellie the first few times he meets her makes him feel a little too normal.As Nick and Ellie become acquainted, their mutual attraction is hard to ignore. But Ellie's been hurt before by her womanizing ex-husband. She's not sure that Nick has left behind his playboy reputation. Can she risk falling in love with the celebrity football player or will she miss her chance at scoring big in the game of love?",
