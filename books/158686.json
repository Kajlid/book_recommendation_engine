  "description": "The air hung heavy over the flat Kansas prairie, dense and feverishly heated as a sick person's breath. As the afternoon progressed, ominous black clouds encroached on the Western skyline, and violent gusts of wind - like the wracking coughs of an invalid - stirred but failed to cool the crowd below.\"Miller!

It's past time for your act, and the crowd's waiting for you.\"\"Don't make him do it, Benjamin!\" the girl pleaded, throwing her arms around the well built stunt rider. \"The wind's too bad! The radio said there's gusts up to 30 miles per hour!\"",
