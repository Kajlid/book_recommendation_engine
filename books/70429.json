  "description": "Emilian's Finest is an old-style circus put together with a purpose. This isn't their shows. Our sarcastic storyteller from The Book of the Forsaken hides in the circus and awaits for the rest of them to make their move.\"Jaelle the Fortuneteller and Emilian the Ringmaster are the ones guarding the circus from anyone who's not being nice. The Bringers of Death want to kill. The Magi want to know. The Upyri want to kill and then know. They all suspect I'm in there, hiding, scheming, mocking them. They are coming for the book, for the ones who sleep; they are coming for me. Let's see what happens.\"",
