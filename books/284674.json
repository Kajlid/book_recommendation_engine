  "description": "LOST IN HIS ARMS...After her father's sudden death, lovely Amanda Lennox had no money for the long trip from Boston to the ranch she'd inherited in faraway Seattle. When she saw a the advertisement for a \"wilderness expert\" to escort eleven-year-old Roger Bannister III to Montana, the adventure-loving beauty jumped at the chance, never guessing that she'd end up lost in the wilds of Idaho...with a twisted ankle. Then an arrogant halfbreed on a palomino stallion came to her rescue and comforted her with his healing touch. Amanda offered him a chaste kiss in gratitude, but the savage's sensuous gaze and rippling muscles aroused her maidenly passion. Tomorrow she'd be back in the saddle, but tonight she'd surrender to his fiery caresses and let him carry her over the threshold of ecstasy, lost in his wild, rapturous embrace!LURED BY HER CHARMS...Rugged ranchhand Jacob Blackhawk Chandler knew from past experience that prissy white princesses meant trouble. He'd seen Amanda Lennox's type before-haughty and citified and utterly unequipped to survive in the wide open country. He couldn't just ride off and leave the lovely minx alone and hurt, but he sure wouldn't be taken in by that sweet come-hither smile! Then he lifted her from her horse, laid her on the soft ground to tend her swollen ankle, and felt a jolt of desire. Tomorrow he'd point her in the direction of Montana, but tonight he'd kiss that luscious body from head to toe, capture her heart in a storm of passionate caresses, and show the Boston belle a night of ecstasy she'd never forget...no matter what state she was in!",
