As a leader of the hybrid Hahtta Alliance, he was also one of the most hunted men in the universe. After a brutal defeat where he nearly lost his life, Luhc abandoned his mission… until the night she entered his dreams...\nHe believed her to be a figment of his imagination. But when fate (with a little help from an ancient meddling witch) brings them face-to-face, he is compelled to risk everything to save a peculiar woman who awakens his soul, and threatens all he holds dear!",
