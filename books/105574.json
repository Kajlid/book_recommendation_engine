  "title": "Glazed Man & Rat Girl: The Origins",
  "description": "A superhero who gets his super powers from donuts, and a girl who keeps turning into a rat no matter how hard she tries to stop herself. Together, they stumble their way through a story of heroic adventure and bad eating habits. When the evil RoboCreep threatens their city, Glazed Man and Rat Girl are the only two people brave enough and foolish enough to stand in his way. It's a classic tale of good vs. evil starring the lovable but dim-witted Glazed Man, and the good hearted but totally berserk Rat Girl. Fast paced action meets side-splitting humor in this chapter novel that includes 100 illustrations, taking superhero storytelling to a whole new level. This book is targeted at young readers, but sophisticated enough for readers of all ages who like a good laugh along with their adventure.",
