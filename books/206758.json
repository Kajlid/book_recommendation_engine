Until she receives a summons from her estranged father to help solve the gruesome murders of werewolves and shifters that live in his city's forest.  The last thing Morgan wants to do is see the man who threw her aside when she was a child, but even she can’t let bitterness and resentment keep her from helping put a stop to the murder and mutilation of innocents.  But solving the murders will be the least of her worries. Alex – a man Morgan finds herself getting terrifyingly close to – has a personal stake in this case, one that Morgan fears will tear them apart for good.
