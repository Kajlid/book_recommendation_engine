  "description": "The U.S.S. Merrimack space battleship was on the galaxy’s edge, patrolling the Perseid arm. Rumor said it had become home to an underground subversive faction of the Roman Empire—the followers of Romulus. The United States was not an ally of Rome, favoring neither Caesar Numa nor the fallen Romulus, who had declared war on the U.S. two years ago and caused great devastation before his defeat. Then the Merrimack suffered an unprovoked attack by what seemed to be a Roman ship. Was it an unexpected move by Numa, or the opening salvo by the forces of Romulus?The Twice and Future Caesar is the sixth installment of the hard-hitting military science fiction series set in a future when Earth's Terran Empire and the Roman Palatine Empire vie for control of the galaxy.",
