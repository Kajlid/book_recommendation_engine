  "title": "Making It Big",
  "description": "A funny, wicked satire on Size Zero, celebrity weight obsessed magazines, the fashion industry, the advertising industry, high society and Hollywood - no area of media fuelled ''body perfection''; bullying remains unscathed! A delicious, page-turning novel that highlights press manipulation, and hits back at the 'skinny insanity' currently gripping the western world. Formerly published as Fat Chance, now revised and updated with a new finale.",
