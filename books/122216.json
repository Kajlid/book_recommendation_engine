  "description": "Robert Chester Ruark was one of the mid-20th centuries \"larger-than-life\" characters: journalist, author, world traveller and big game hunter and in this, his last work, it is impossible to fathom where Ruark finishes and Alex Barr, the principal character, starts. In \"The Honey Badger\", first published (posthumously) in 1965, Ruark—thru his hero—searches for a purpose to his existence in a tapestry encompassing the restaurants of New York, through wartime London to the plains of Africa.And just what is a honey badger? A mean little animal which, when cornered, attacks straight for the balls!!Immensely readable.",
