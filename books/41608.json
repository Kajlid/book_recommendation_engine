  "description": "In 2025, life seemed normal until devious plan was set in motion. The rulers had a secret plan to move to the Moon and turn the Earth into their slave colony. First they switched off the electricity and faked their deaths, so no-one would notice their relocation. Vibrations from the Moon dumbed people down, making them into obedient savages, too stupid to see the plot. Generations accustomed to the internet, television, phones, and technology, reduced to basic animal behavior.But few people paid attention to their thoughts and managed to save their minds from the influence. They were arrested and taken to the Moon as slave prisoners, but no-one noticed they were different. No-one human, that is. Native inhabitants of the Moon saw their potential, and after Rosie, Eric and Ann helped the Mellny save their children from the rulers' hands, the Mellny decided to return the favor.With powerful minds and fully evolved, Rosie, Eric and Ann will go back to Earth and try to make a difference. But what can three people do?",
