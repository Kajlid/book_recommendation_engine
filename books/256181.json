  "title": "Bob: A Picture Book",
  "description": "A rooster learns his sound(s)Inspired by a pep talk from a cat, a rooster named Bob who's been spending his days merely clucking and never crowing flies the coop to find his true voice. Along the way, he meets many animals who teach him their sounds - but unfortunately not the one he's looking for. Away from the farm all night long, Bob is greeted early in the morning by just the right noise. It's dark by the time he gets back to the henhouse, and when a dangerous fox intrudes, Bob has an urgent reason to try his new crow before daybreak - but \"cock-a-doodle-do\" alone may not be enough to do the trick.The tongue-in-cheek text and lively pictures will make this book a perfect story-time selection.",
