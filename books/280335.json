  "description": "It’s up to me to stop the apocalypse, and... I got nothing. My friends want to quit, my allies don’t believe me, and the only ones willing to help me are criminals. Someone wants to burn this city to the ground, but I don’t know who, I don’t know why, and I don’t know how to stop them. And, fun fact, they are not the only villains! If you enjoy diving into pulse-pounding action, puzzling out clues, and rooting for the underdog--you will love Raven’s adventures in Villains, the fourth book of Superpower Chronicles. For fans of Spider-Man and The Teen Titans. Get your copy today!",
