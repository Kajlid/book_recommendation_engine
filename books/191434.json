  "description": "Graham, Wallace, and Harry will have one glorious week of pure freedom in the outback. No teachers, no school, no homework, no parents breathing down their necks! The boys are elated until they accidentally start a fire that quickly gets out of control in the dry underbrush. No one is prepared; no one can quite believe what is happening. As the adults in a nearby town bumble their way into helping to fight the fire, a group of children is inadvertently trapped by flames and separated from outside help. Pippa and Peter and Gramps and others must make their own way through the conflagration. Separately and together, they all find out what inner resources they have. There are no heroes or villains, just people caught and humbled by an awesome and catastrophic force.",
