  "description": "Zahra spent a good portion of her life fighting to fit into her father’s world. Always toeing the line, his rules dictated her every move. Lessons and legends her mother and grandmother taught her were pushed aside for more practical pursuits to suit her new lifestyle. A teak jewelry box, its appearance unassuming, changed all of that. Accused of its theft, she’s tossed out of her job and into danger. Her possession of the chest has awakened the artifact housed inside and now she must take responsibility of magic it held and the warriors charged with its safe keeping. Her sexy next door neighbor Fynn seems to have all the answers, but they come at a price. Can she trust him with her life, or more important her heart?Centuries of punishment and not once had he forgotten his duty. What was it about this woman that shattered through his defenses? Fynn kept his distance from Zahra, fighting an attraction he knew didn’t belong in his dangerous world. His tribe had been sentenced to search for their stolen artifact and Zahra’s possession of it plunges her head first into his world. How is he supposed to fight his attraction when the very reason to keep his distance is gone? Zahra’s past crosses Fynn’s, as an ancient magic weaves together their future in a bond neither can escape. Will she be strong enough to handle the power the artifact has unleashed, and will she be strong enough to claim Fynn and the destiny she has awakened?",
