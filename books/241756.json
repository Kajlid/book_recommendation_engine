Citrine represented everything that Nicole hates - greed, violence, corruption... Self-tasked with taking it down, the Marvelous Kea Girl took to the streets to fight injustice. Yet when Citrine CEO Lana Latham appeared asking for her help, Nicole found herself entranced - and surprised at how much their own goals were the same. Agreeing to help Lana reform Citrine into a force for good, or burn it to the ground trying, the pair become partners - professional at work, deeply in love at home.When Lana's missing brother reappears, bringing a bloodthirsty vengeance and decades of frustration with him, Lana and Nicole find themselves in the fight of their lives. The friends they've assembled may not be enough to see them through - and that's a lot of pressure to put on their relationship.Don't Tell Me is a queer novella for young adult (and up!) audiences and third in the 'The Marvelous Kea Girl' New Cloud Heroes sub-series.",
