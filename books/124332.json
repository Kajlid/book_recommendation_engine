  "title": "From Meidelach to Matriarchs ~ A Journal: Jewish Women of Yesteryear to Inspire your Today",
  "description": "In recent years, journal writing, or engaging in expressive writing, has been proven to have a positive impact on the participant. It helps one to be more mindful, to be grateful. It helps improve focus and alleviates stress. But studies have shown that simply writing onto a blank page doesn't necessarily produce positive benefits. As with everything else, it's the intention that matters. It's about introspection and connection. In this journal, you will have the opportunity to become acquainted—or reacquainted—with one hundred Jewish women of yesteryear. You will have one hundred opportunities to motivate your creativity, your philanthropy, your Jewish observance—your Jewish identity.Jennifer Wulff, Certified Spiritual Director, states, \"Expressive journaling becomes a sacred and holy space where you can explore your deepest questions and strengthen the connections between yourself and the Divine.\" Take a few minutes each day. Allow yourself to be inspired. There are prompts to jot down your thoughts, but use the other space to scribble a few notes, ask G-d for guidance—put things into perspective. There is no pressure, no judgement. That’s the beauty of this journal. No one needs to know; it’s just between you and the Woman of Valor that lives inside you.This is an enlightening resource and a lovely gift for all Jewish women.
