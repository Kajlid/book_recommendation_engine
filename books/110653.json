So when even-tempered Boris the Siberian tiger goes into attack mode, Grace knows there’s more to the story. Something is agitating the big cat. As she uses her telepathic ability to calm the tiger, she realizes he has witnessed a theft—not of something but of someone. A teenaged volunteer at the animal rescue facility has been taken…kidnapped. The problem is Brooke Ligner’s parents believe their troubled daughter ran away and Grace can’t exactly reveal her source.

Now, as Grace searches for solid clues to rescue the missing teen, it’s the human predators she’ll need to watch out for…",
