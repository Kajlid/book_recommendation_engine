Our union would solidify the bond between his pack and my coven. I should be thrilled… and I was.Until he told me he mated someone else.AleksandrMy pack is my father's legacy, and I honor him every day.But Greer makes me question everything, including what kind of male I want to be.She’s the most incredible thing I’ve ever seen… but she’ll never be mine.There’s far more at work than she knows. I would sacrifice our happiness for her safety, even if she hates me in the end.Because I was made to love the brilliant witch, and there’s a fine line between love and pain.Note: Zephyr is a deliciously dark and steamy paranormal romance.

Each book in the Immortal Coven series has an HEA for the couple, but the series has an overarching plot.",
