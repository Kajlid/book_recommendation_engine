Many hunters were injured, and loved ones were murdered. More than that, there is a loss of security and peace since the hunters' safe haven was breached and invaded. Chloe and Drew struggle just to get along and understand each other without Luke there to guide them.During this period of uncertainty, Chloe and Drew both try to live a normal life as teenagers by going to the New Year's bash, she with Gavin and Drew with Christina, Chloe's recent rival. Chloe is, once again, reminded that nothing is 'normal' in her life any more, when she begin to show signs she's developing supernatural gifts from her father's bloodline, too.The bash does little to lift her feelings of guilt and responsibility for the attack on the community, because she knows it's her presence there that caused the vampires to attack the hunters.

She doesn't want to put anyone else she loves at risk.Before she has time to put any plans into action, a surprise phone call from someone unexpected sets the wheels in motion. Chloe now knows what she must do...",
