  "description": "Giovanni did not know whether she was drunk or not, but only felt that her pure and seductive actions made his body become hotter and hotter, and finally could not resist clasping the back of her head, turning passive into active, and opening his mouth to let her kiss continue deeper.The two people's breathing unconsciously, both became a few heavy, Michelle Smith also forgot what she was actually going to do, just involuntarily tighten his neck. This long and sensational kiss, I do not know how long it took to end, but the heat of the two bodies, and not because of the end of the kiss fell!Michelle Smith leaned on his shoulder, panting lowly, the hot air of her breath sprayed right on his ear, and did not notice that his big burning hands had plucked her clothes, just whispered into his \"Giovanni, I love your kisses ...... \" Giovanni lips slightly hooked, eyes dark, large palms on her body slowly roaming, ghostly rhetorical \"just like my kisses?\"\"You're a monster, Giovanni!\" --- Michelle Smith\"Don't monsters deserve to be loved too?\" --- Giovanni* Note - this book has strong sexual themes, strong language, violence, and gore. It would leave you on the edge and get you screaming for more.So if you can't handle the burn, drop it without abusing me in the comment box (I won't take it lightly if it does happen).If you can handle the burn, then welcome to the Mafia world!",
