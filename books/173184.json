  "description": "Hotel full of SF fans taken into space   \nA hilarious and affectionate look at science-fiction conventions, a wondrous mashup of Galaxy Quest and Bimbos of the Death Sun, a fast-paced and laugh-out-loud funny treat for SF fans everywhere. ~ Robert J. Sawyer, Hugo Award-winning author of Red Planet Blues\n  When convention official Dave Lorne realizes the whole hotel is lifting off the ground after a silver sheened man enters something on a strange tablet, he blurts out,  \n“Put us back!”\n  The silver man looks at him with a curiously cocked head and says with something like regret,  \n“I can’t do that, Dave.”\n  In a metaphysical novel of SF fandom, the convention culture, and the treasured tropes of science fiction, time-traveling androids kidnap a hotel full of SF fans and take it for a trip around the moon.  Welcome to AbductiCon",
