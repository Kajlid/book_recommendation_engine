  "description": "The ordinary life of a grad student has lost its appeal for science prodigy Ariane Dempsey. Sure, she's engaged to a gorgeous fellow science brainiac and research is going OK, but she's been in school for 16 years and sees nothing else ahead of her but the same. She has no idea she's only one step away from a whole new world - a world of darkness and decay, of death and blood and predation. When Orfeo Ricari comes into her life, she sees an opportunity learn more about his world than she ever dreamed possible. But the closer they get, the lower she descends, and her humanity itself is at stake.For Ricari's is the world of the undead, the vampire, a world far beyond the myths and legends that the living think they know - a world of cold-blooded slaughter more horrifying than the living could suspect. From the nightclubs of San Francisco to a deserted Hollywood hotel known as Rotting Hall, the denizens of this land of darkness hold sway over the night. And as seductive and erotic as these predators may be, Ariane will soon discover that a little knowledge can be a very dangerous thing indeed.",
