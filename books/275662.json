  "title": "Rainbow Zebra: A Children's Book Written & Illustrated by Children",
  "description": "Targeted for children ages two through ten, this book was written and illustrated by children, ages five and eight. Rainbow Zebra was born with multi-colored stripes, but other zebras his age think he is weird and won't play with him. He wishes he has black-and-white stripes so he will be accepted. But the students who call Rainbow \"weirdo\" and other mean names learn how differences can come in handy during a crisis. The book teaches valuable lessons about accepting differences and remaining true to who you are. Besides the fictional story, the book details some facts about zebras, including whether there really are zebras with stripes of different colors than black and white.",
