  "description": "Home, he thinks, Where the heart bleeds freely.A hell of a boxer, he earned the nickname 'Fist' back in the day. But during the past eight years, he's transformed into somebody he no longer knowsâ€”a weak, pitiful, and passionless office drone.Barely hanging onto the last thread of his self-respect, he returns home one night to discover Hell has truly crossed its threshold.And Hell has lessons to teach him through what fragments remain.Slivers of dark light.Knowledge in blood.Forgiveness, clarity and redemption in commitment.",
