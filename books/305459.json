But when she finally came of age and confessed her love to the dashing smuggler, he treated her like a childâ€”dismissing her \"juvenile crush.\" Embarrassed and hurt, Phiny fled to France, hoping to forget about his cruel rejection, unaware that Phil had realized too late, the precious gift he had cast aside. When fate brought them together again, Delphine had inherited a title, and a noblewoman's responsibilities. Now she seems beyond Philibert's reach forever. But beneath the poise and grace of the beautiful countess beats the passionate heart of a woman who will never give up her one true love.",
