And, y'know, words.I know you're used to seeing me on the Internet, but here I am, coming at you in book form. You might be asking yourself, A Book? You? Why?Great question! Why did I write a book?Listen, I'm as surprised about it as you are. But I have a story to tell that I believe will help inspire people who are going through tough times to not only persevere through those tough times but to excel in them. And I couldn't be the only YouTuber without a book, could I?So, welcome to Ryan Higa's How to Write Good , by me, Ryan Higa.This is the story of how I went from being a relatively happy kid to being depressed and angry and filled with dark thoughts. This is the story of how I thought I had only one way out of this cruel world. This is the story of how I found a better way.But wait, there's more! You're not only getting my story but you'll also learn how to write good--I mean well--from a college dropout who struggled in basic-level English classes and still became a legit, published Best Sailing Author. (That wasn't a typo. I plan to buy a boat one day...but probably not anytime soon. This book might not cell good.)",
