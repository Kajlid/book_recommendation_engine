  "description": "Sometimes, in life, you find everything you're searching for right where you started. Third book in the Jamesville series. Gunned down in the line of duty, New York City cop Patrick O'Rourke returns to his hometown of Jamesville to recuperate from his physical and emotional wounds. His partner is dead and his career depends on his ability to recover from his serious injuries. He doesn't plan on staying for long, so the last thing he wants is a relationship. Shannon Brooker's life certainly didn't turn out the way she'd planned, and she's returned to Jamesville to help her aunt run the local diner. She's not looking for a man. All she wants is some peace of mind. When her abusive ex-husband starts a campaign to terrorize her, Shannon turns to Patrick O'Rourke, the man she had a teenage crush on many years ago. She wants to hire him as a bodyguard, but their relationship quickly becomes more personal than professional. With Shannon wanting a small-town life and Patrick wanting to return to the life he loves as a New York cop, there seems to be no way for them to build a permanent life together. As the threat against Shannon escalates, they are pushed closer together, igniting a passion that will alter their lives forever. This title contains the explicit sex, graphic language, and violence.",
