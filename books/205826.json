  "title": "Life Lessons: Two Experts on Death and Dying Teach Us About the Mysteries of Life and Living",
  "description": "Ten years after Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s “An inspiring…guide to life, distilled from the experiences of people who face death” ( Kirkus Reviews )—the beloved classic now with a new introduction and updated resources section.Is this really how I want to live my life?Each one of us at some point asks this question. The tragedy is not that life is short but that we often see only in hindsight what really matters.In this, her first book on life and living, Elisabeth Kubler-Ross joins with David Kessler to guide us through the practical and spiritual lessons we need to learn so that we can live life to its fullest in every moment. Many years of working with the dying have shown the authors that certain lessons come up over and over again. Some of these lessons are enormously difficult to master, but even the attempts to understand them can be deeply rewarding. Here, in fourteen accessible chapters, from the Lesson of Love to the Lesson of Happiness, the authors reveal the truth about our fears, our hopes, our relationships, and, above all, about the grandness of who we really are.",
