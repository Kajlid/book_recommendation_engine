  "description": "The call comes from a troubled man. Someone, he says, is trying to kill him. He can't divulge more over the phone, but Felix Berg wants to meet. At midnight. Out by the lighthouse at Howth. Reluctantly, Saxon agrees. Soon former FBI agent-turned-true-crime-writer Saxon is plunged into the heart of a series of apparently motiveless murders that is gripping the city. Four times the gunman known as the Marxman has struck and four times the Dublin Metropolitan Police murder squad have drawn a blank. Could the answer be found in the dark eye of Felix Berg's camera Wherever the trail leads, Saxon is determined that this time the Marxman will not escape. And she's ready to step into the line of fire if that's what it takes.",
