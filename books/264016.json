  "description": "Impulsive and Obsessive.  Two words people use to describe me. What does that mean? I impulsively jump into hobbies and get…obsessed. Rock climbing. Bungee jumping. You name it. Why? Because I need to keep the glass full. There’s no time for romance or sticky relationships. It’s just not who I am.  -Perrin Michaels  Bitter and Broken.  Two words everyone uses to describe me. What does that mean? I’m fucking broken and bitter over it… Leave me alone. War vet. Life failure. You name it. Why? Because I don’t fit in here anymore. I don’t want to care about someone else when I’m stuck. It’s just not who I am.  -Emiliano Espocito  Can two people really heal each other, or does it only work one way?",
