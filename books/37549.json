Beset by insecurities and scorn, she longs for nothing more than acceptance. Mytra is an isolated paradise in the Galactic Core, founded by radical humanists determined to live out their ideals. Inhabited entirely by men, socially engineered to be homosexual, the planet is governed by tyrannical AIs who will stop at nothing to preserve their Makers’ dreams. Alex, a Mytran boy enslaved by his robots, has four months remaining until his coming of age ceremony. If he refuses to become a man, the very robots who raised him will carry out his execution. Alex and his small Order of resistors have no hope of survival, until Sarah’s ship arrives in orbit. Against tyrants who would kill their own people before losing a single soul, how will Alex and Sarah free Mytra?",
