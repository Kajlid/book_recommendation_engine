  "description": "They think they're fooling their parents, but really, the joke's on them. Kayla Ames's parents could win an award in meddling. Every time she turns around, they're setting her up with someone new. Try as she might, she can't convince them to butt out of her love life. Ryan Newell isn't looking for love. After having his heart torn to shreds by his ex, he's determined to never again fall in love and leave himself that vulnerable to being hurt. His parents, however, believe he just needs some help finding the right woman, and their friends' daughter, Kayla, might be a perfect match. Realizing they both have the same problem—parents who won't stop nagging them about finding a partner—Ryan and Kayla agree to an arrangement of sorts. All they have to do is pretend to date, and they don't even have to see each other, they can discuss the details of their \"dates\" via email. But then the email conversations lead to real dates, and Kayla finds herself struggling to keep her feelings for Ryan in check as he's made it clear love will not enter into the equation for him. Then Kayla's parents suddenly announce they're getting a divorce, and she begins to wonder if maybe Ryan has the right idea. When it all gets to be too much for Kayla, she has a hard decision to make—agree to stay with Ryan and never experience love, or walk away for her chance to find it.",
