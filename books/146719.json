  "description": "A man with a fetish for women hockey players starts stalking a women's team -- and fixates on Janis Trevor. In this hilarious short story, Janis already faces man problems. Her husband has walked after only a few months of marriage, and now she has a boyfriend who won't commit. As the troll-like stalker sticks to her like wet ice, Janis has to skate her way to freedom. Or maybe a commitment. You can never tell how the game will play out.",
