  "title": "The Company of Darkness",
  "description": "Cady and Ethan beat the bad guy and saved the day... or did they? Cady has been touched by evil, polluted by unbound demon blood, will she ever truly be the same? Asherik the demon is bound but not destroyed, and Ethan's moods have taken on a distinctly darker turn since absorbing his power. Detective Lucas hasn't left his investigation behind either, and Cady will have to use all of her wiles to throw him off the scent for his own safety. And then there's The Company - how much will Cady come to regret showing up on their radar? There's no mistaking Rikard's interest, but does it stem from duty or something more personal? In a world where demons thrive in shadows, preying on the innocent, there is one organization that stands against the enemy in the darkness. But what happens when The Company tasked with our salvation becomes corrupt with its own darkness?",
