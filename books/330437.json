  "description": "Rome, 63 BC.Offered up by her parents at the age of six to become a Vestal Virgin, one of six hand-picked women who symbolically protected the Roman Republic, Aemilia has spent her entire adult life in the all-female Temple of Vesta, under the strictest guard.But temptation has led her to commit a mortal sin, and she is sentenced to death as Virgins must die, buried alive in a pitch-black tomb. As the end draws near, Aemilia looks back over her claustrophobic, restricted life: the intense friendships she formed; the implacable enemies she made; and, finally, the passionate but forbidden romance which caused her downfallâ€”and yet may be her only hope...A tantalizing glimpse into a little-known, forbidden world, The Virgin's Tale is the moving, erotic and highly-charged story of a woman who dared to risk everything for love.",
