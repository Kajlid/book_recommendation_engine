  "description": "If Sunaya and Iannis thought there would be time to rest after returning from their last mission, they are sorely mistaken. The Minister sends them to face off with yet more dangerous enemies—this time in a lawless port in remote Garai, where pirates and slavers thrive, and everyone is fair game.To hide their undercover mission, Sunaya and Iannis travel to Garai as official guests to a state funeral. But Sunaya’s luck runs out when she finds out her father is on the guest list, and worse, runs straight into him and his family. For now, her deadly secret is safe. But once they discover her true identity, they may not be willing to suffer her alive. . . .",
