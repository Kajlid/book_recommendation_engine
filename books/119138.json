  "description": "Guadalupe Muro, recipient of the Raul Urtusan-Frances Harley Scholarship for Young Emerging Artists from Argentina, has always had her own unique way of experiencing life. When applied to her writing, Muro says she finally \"felt like a dog deciding to be a dog.\" Muro's Spanish publications have achieved strong acclaim, and now, BookThug is proud to introduce this remarkable new talent to the Canadian literary market. Air Carnation features an absorbing narrative that bridges non-fiction and fiction, poetry and song, as Muro explores themes of independence in love and the writerly life. With sojourns in Argentina, Buenos Aires, New York, Washington, and a cross-Canada train passage from Edmonton to Toronto, Air Carnation is an affecting work that will have readers laughing, crying, and all the while, enjoying this fascinating meta-fiction that sings of hippiedom in Patagonia.",
