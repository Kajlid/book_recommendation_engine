  "title": "Hello American Lady Creature: What I Learned as a Woman in Qatar",
  "description": "Lisa Kirchner was 35 when she married the man of her dreams. They moved to Qatar for one last adventure before starting a family, but things quickly derailed. As the marketing director for Carnegie Mellon University's branch campus in Doha, she ran into challenges supervising Muslim men. Like when she learned it's haram, or forbidden by the Quran, for a man to look at a woman who is not his wife. As a self-described \"friend-dependent,\" she often felt a crushing loneliness. Then she learned she'd never have children. At least they had each other. 'He pulled me close and said, \"Baby, I didn't marry you for your ability to reproduce.\" I never wanted anything more than to be loved like that.' If only the story ended there. At the heart of this narrative is a magical place and time in history - Qatar at the turn of the 21st century - that shaped her own radical transformation. Told with powerful insight and dark humor. It's the author's first book. LISA KIRCHNER was once simultaneously the dating columnist for an alternative newsweekly, bridal editor for a society rag and the religion reporter for a gay and lesbian newspaper. She lives in New York City.",
