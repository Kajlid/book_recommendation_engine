  "title": "Men in the Off Hours",
  "description": "Following her widely acclaimed \nAutobiography of Red\n (\"A spellbinding achievement\" --Susan Sontag), a new collection of poetry and prose that displays Anne Carson's signature mixture of opposites--the classic and the modern, cinema and print, narrative and verse.In \nMen in the Off Hours\n, Carson reinvents figures as diverse as Oedipus, Emily Dickinson, and Audubon. She views the writings of Sappho, St. Augustine, and Catullus through a modern lens. She sets up startling juxtapositions (Lazarus among video paraphernalia; Virginia Woolf and Thucydides discussing war). And in a final prose poem, she meditates on the recent death of her mother. With its quiet, acute spirituality, its fearless wit and sensuality, and its joyful understanding that \"the fact of the matter for humans is imperfection,\" Men in the Off Hours shows us \"the most exciting poet writing in English today\" (Michael Ondaatje) at her best.From the Hardcover edition.",
