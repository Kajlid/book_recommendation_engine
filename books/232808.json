  "description": "“When you think of Las Vegas, what comes to mind? Most likely it’s fine dining, extravagant shows, and lots of gambling. Not in my world. Not when you’re surrounded by alpha males with a penchant for violence who ignore your meticulously crafted itinerary and expect you to ‘go with the flow.’ Why does nothing EVER turn out like I plan?”Come along for the ride with ex-mafia enforcer Rocky, his germaphobe girlfriend Violet, and a few of their friends as they take a little excursion to fabulous Las Vegas. Emotions run high, loyalties are tested, and danger lurks around every corner. With new villains emerging and game changing opportunities presented, their vacation is anything but relaxing.Please note: This story contains a zombie survival paintball course, popcorn eating fish, several curse words (the heroine has a fondness for swearing), and a few descriptive bedroom scenes. Vegas has a tendency to bring out the wild side in some of us…and things that happen in Sin City can get pretty exciting. This 96,500 word full length novel is the second book in the Dirty Detour series, but can be read and understood as a stand-alone story. Each and every one of my books has a Happily Ever After, no cheating, no cliff hangers, and a butt load of humor. Sit back, strap in, and enjoy the journey!",
