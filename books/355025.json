  "title": "The Art of Murder",
  "description": "Welcome to an art scene where realism has reached a new level, where each painting is literally alive, where the model is the canvas. And for the gorgeous men and women lining up for the privilege—to be painted and posed, bought and rented by collectors—there is one artist to whom they are all the Dutch master, Bruno van Tysch. A young female model is brutally murdered, and the detectives assigned to the case may have little interest in modern art, but they’re going to have to acquire an appreciation quickly. Van Tysch is about to launch a major exhibition in Amsterdam—the imitation of 13 of Rembrandt’s masterpieces—and rumors are that the killer is about to strike again.",
