  "description": "It’s the early 1990’s and Ace Stone the dashing charming fight promoter come businessman and financier, barely escapes the London landscape of crime, murder and dubious underworld connections. He heads to the promising shores of America and exploits his financial talents with an organised crime family based in New York; Ace works parallel with their business operations in Las Vegas and starts a new life in Sin City. But life suddenly spirals out of control as Ace becomes involved in an elaborate fraud involving a high-ranking member of the mob family and a haul of millions of dollars in cash, which places him in an unrelated trap and spurious hit-list. Ace has to avoid being hunted down, tortured and killed by a hired gun, but only if he can relinquish the loves of his life and trust a cold assassin whose loyalty is unknown.",
