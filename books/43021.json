Liam knows the human beauty is his intended mate the moment he sees her, but December is far too strong-willed to accept his protection.December, whose brother is the town sheriff, has every reason to mistrust shifters after one killed her youngest sibling. But the forceful and handsome Liam has gotten under her skin in a way she hadn't thought possible, and the desire she feels for him is almost too much to bear.When a radical hate group targets all humans known to sympathize with paranormal beings, December is attacked in her bookstore.
