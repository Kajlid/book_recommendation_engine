  "description": "(This story contains characters from previously published novel 'Nothing Special' but Embracing His Syn is a stand-alone novel.)Sergeant Corbin 'Syn' Sydney transferred from the Philadelphia Police Department as soon as he'd heard there was going to be an opening on Lieutenant Cashel Godfrey and Lieutenant Leonidis Day's Atlanta Narcotics Task Force. Syn’s primary goal in his life has been to be a great cop. There has been no time for relationships, romance, or especially love. Syn was dedicated to his new force, focused and ready to back up God and Day as their third in command, but what he wasn't ready for was the feelings he got from seeing the love they had for each other. Syn's all prepared to accept his lonely fate until he walks into a small pub and meets long-haired, tattooed, bartender, Furious Barkley. Before he can even understand why, Syn's feeling things he barely recognizes: passion, yearning, cravings; and if the dark, lustful gazes are anything to go by, Furious might be feeling the same things for him.Just one thing needs to happen before Furi and Syn can give each other what’s been missing from their lives for so long...Syn needs to allow happiness into his world and Furi needs to learn to open his heart and trust again.God, Day, Ronowski, and Johnson are still as entertaining as ever...You'll swoon over God's massive take-charge attitude...You'll laugh hysterically at Day's never-ending wit...You'll fall in love with Furious' mysterious, sexy demeanor...and...You'll embrace Syn...
