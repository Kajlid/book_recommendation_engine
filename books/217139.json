Four years after being diagnosed with debilitating disease, her love life is nonexistent. A series of failed blind dates - courtesy of her friends - has left her depressed and defeated. Intent on turning to her best friend for a vent session, Emma sends off a rapid fire instant message, except her message ends up in someone else's inbox. The inbox of hot Navy man, Bryan Sampson. Her friend Mel’s best friend, and Emma's secret crush.  Bryan Sampson has only met Emma Taylor one time during a night of karaoke while on leave, but in one night, she managed to make an impression. She seemed timid and uncomfortable in her own skin, but underneath it all, he saw how strong she had to be in order to cope with her disease. So when he her message caught his eye, he opened it without a second thought, and realizes almost immediately it wasn’t intended for him. Now that he’s read it though, he can’t turn his back on her and feels duty bound to help the cause. Besides what else is he supposed to do with his free time? He vows he will help her find love never suspecting that the more he talked to her, the more he would find out about himself…the more he would think about her.  Emma is determined to face her demons thanks to Bryan's help, but little by little she begins falling harder for the one person who isn't ashamed of her or her disease. Can she put her heart on the line and take the risk? Can she convince Bryan that love, her love, is worth it?  Sometimes all it takes is one person to expose the person within.",
