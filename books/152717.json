  "title": "Lyovitalis",
  "description": "Set during the early days of World War I, Lyovitalis follows the journey of the young and spirited doctor, Audrianna Foster, as she travels to Switzerland to continue the research of her recently-deceased father. Her object is to find a cure to the mysteriously fatal disease called lyovitalis, which not only killed her mother, but also a slew of young women in the idyllic town of snowy Zurich-where Audrianna comes to reside. In Zurich, Audrianna falls into the treacherously seductive company of Lorna and her regal family, the von Traugotts. Racked by incipient sexual desire for the salacious Lorna and a near-obsessive drive to uncover the seeming conspiracy around lyovitalis, Audrianna's quest unfolds within the riveting pages of a medical mystery of the highest order. As Audrianna delves deeper into the science of lyovitalis, she is forced to dive deeper into herself-her desires, emotions, and insecurities-and what she discovers on the other side will change her life (and her universe) forever. Lyovitalis is the thrilling and captivating prequel to the genre-bending, smash success The Children of Gavrilek. Every page sings with energy, intrigue, and emotion as talented author, Julie Chandler, expands the Gavrilekian Biverse through exquisite prose and masterful storytelling. Each page is a challenge to the reader, daring you to put the book down. Succumbing to Lyovitalis' narrative force is your only hope.",
