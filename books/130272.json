  "title": "The Bone Eaters",
  "description": "A vampire, a werewolf and the Detroit Police Department's most incompetent Inhuman Crimes Unit officer walk into a bar. Oh, and so does the CEO of a pharmaceutical company which is hiding a terrible secret. And also the charismatic pastor of a Detroit mega-church/casino who is enraged that the corpse of one of his flock may have been reanimated as part of a mafia-run zombie fight club. And let's not even get into the young pharmacology researcher conducting a controlled experiment to figure out why men never call her for a second date. In The Bone Eaters, newly minted private eye, Nick Slipwick, joins forces with Lieutenant Amato to unravel these mysteries. They discover more than they expect: vampires weren't driven from North America 200 years ago after all, the werewolf fences that surround every town and city may not be as effective as everyone thinks, and a creature is stalking the night who is completely unlike all of the regular monsters you learn about in social studies. And not just because he is somewhat obsessed with Dirty Dancing. The Bone Eaters is a fast-moving, genre-skewering comedy lovingly satirizing horror, mystery and 'chick lit.' The novel brings together multiple interwoven story lines into a fun and satisfying conclusion. Just like we're praying George R. R. Martin does. The Bone Eaters: 50% humor, 50% horror, 50% mystery, and 50% romance. It's twice the entertainment of a regular book.",
