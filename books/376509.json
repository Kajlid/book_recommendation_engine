Clouds gather over Camelot, threatening to destroy all that Arthur and Guinever have built, and Gaheris may be all that stands between Arthur's noble kingdom and disaster.Award-winning fantasy author and mediaeval historian Kari Sperring has woven a powerful tale of passion and intrigue featuring some of the lesser known members of King Arthur's court.",
