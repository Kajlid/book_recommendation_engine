She is sent to a training class at the Meadowland Lodge in Colorado where her childhood friend Werewolf Nash Porters lives and works along with his pack.

However, problems seem to follow Ash and it turns out no different in Colorado, when the Sheriff has a problem with his brother’s mate. It’s the Alpha’s only chance for happiness, but Ash doesn’t know if she is right for the man, she doesn’t want to come between him and his brother.  When young girls are kidnapped from the neighboring packs, Ash’s help is needed.
