  "description": "Choose between the rich boys. I’d rather face the Harpies than make that choice. How can my four years at Burberry Prep really be coming to an end? No, Tristan, Zayd, Creed, Zack, and Windsor are everything to me right now. My strength, my passion, my heart, my empathy, my joy. Love is a cruel master, but I have no one to blame for this but myself.  ***  We fell in love with the charity case. Idols of the school, the kings of the campus, and we’re nothing without her. Marnye Elizabeth Reed. This girl has twisted our world upside down, but the Infinity Club is about to knock us all on our asses. Big money, political ties, family bonds, obligations: shit is going down at the academy. The rest of our lives, the rest of her life … it all comes down to this one, final moment.  ***IN THE ARMS OF THE ELITE is a 95,000 word reverse harem/dark high school bully romance novel. This is book four of four in the series. Contains foul language and sexual scenes; all sex featured is consensual.",
