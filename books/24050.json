  "title": "The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries",
  "description": "With a new introduction by Carl McColman, this new edition of the classic study of traditional Celtic spirituality ties ancient Paganism, medieval myth, and traditional Fairy beliefs into a powerful celebration of Celtic wisdom and magic. The author, W. Y. Evans-Wentz, was best known as the translator of The Tibetan Book of the Dead. In the world of Celtic spirituality he made his mark through The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries. This magnificent book is a collection of stories, anecdotes, and legends from all six of the regions where Celtic ways have persisted in the modern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man. It examines how Fairy spirituality survived in the face of hostility caused by modern science and religion. It celebrates how beliefs (which only a century ago were dismissed as quaint and superstitious) were, in fact, powerful principles of ancient Pagan magic that remained essential features of the Celtic world for generation after generation.",
