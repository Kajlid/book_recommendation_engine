  "description": "Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, (1860-1904), was born in Russia at Taganrog on the Sea of Azov. His name has become synonymous with a certain literary style much admired and widely copied since his death. Typically, a Chekhov story is a \"mood\", a state of mind, usually with regard to relations between one person and another. Under the influence of the constant, infinitesimal, and unforeseen pinpricks of life, there occurs a gradual transformation of that state of mind. His writing is at once fluid and precise. Most of his stories end on a minor note, instead of the dramatic flourish. Today, Chekhov is regarded as Russia's greatest writer, and his narrative works continue to attract an ever wider circle of readers worldwide.This volume includes the following unabridged works with music and sound effects: The Kiss The Two Volodyas The Lady with the Dog Fear The Darling Chameleon OystersFinally, \"An Essay On The Life of Chekhov\", by Dimitri Mirsky, takes us on a tour of Chekhov's life and career. This critically acclaimed work of scholarship is clearly and concisely written to bring into perspective the life of one of Russia's greatest literary figures.",
