  "title": "The Blood Lure",
  "description": "By all logic, Ella should not have magical abilitiesâ€”she was born in Idaho of all places. But once she's swept off her feet by the mysterious Eireden, this average American girl finds herself thrown into a perilous adventure that will push her to find the source of her hidden magic. Only once she does, her life takes a terrifying turn as she becomes enmeshed in a deadly, magical game where lives and hidden kingdoms hang in the balance and where no one asks who she is, instead they wonder what she is.  To be precise, she is bait.  Beautifully written, deeply romantic and extraordinarily suspenseful, The Blood Lure captures the struggle of a girl who is forced by fate into the hardest of choices: love or honor.  What the readers say about The Blood Lure:  \"A beautiful love story...\"  \"I thought I was done with the whole \"love triangle\" business, but The Blood Lure brings it back nicely.\"  \"Meredith spins a magical, adventurous tale of love that hits home...\"",
