  "description": "Kay and her life partner lead six very dissimilar women on a two-week trek into the Ozark mountains, designed to teach basic survival skills to these tenderfoots. Lu and Desiree have been together twelve years; Desiree plans to use the occasion of this trip to reveal a secret that will change both their lives. Poppy Dillworth has lost her precious Irma after thirty-six years of happiness. She sees no reason to go on living and has chosen this trip for her own special purpose. Marcie is a fledgling missionary out to prove her worthiness for assignment to South America; she has deep concerns about Poppy. And there's Jane and Ramona -- conventional women who have led the most conventional of lives, until they share the intimacy of a tent in the wilderness.",
