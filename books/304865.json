  "description": "When Norah discovers she can see beyond the rift, the barrier between mortals and the supernatural, her life quickly spirals out of control. Her family is killed, leaving her orphaned and on the run with a power she never wanted. Then she meets Sylas, a half-demon hellbent on hunting monsters. Five years later, Norah has changed from the hunted to the hunter, but even demon slayers have enemies. A powerful demon is amassing an army in order to disrupt the balance of the supernatural world and crown himself ruler. To stop the demonic threat, Sylas and Norah will have to enlist the help of others, a band of misfits. But will their combined power be enough? Or will they fall before the coming darkness?",
