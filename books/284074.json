Marine Sergeant Ronaldo Salvatore's platoon comes home to a powder keg that could ignite a civil war.While some see the coming collapse as the end, others see opportunity. Fleeing Naples after rival crime lords decimated his family, Don Antonio Moretti settles in Los Angeles to rebuild his criminal empire. But he is far from alone in his ambitions--the cartel and rival gangs all want the same turf, and they will sacrifice their own soldiers and the blood of innocents to get it.As open warfare erupts across the states, Salvatore fights his way back to LA, where his son has joined the police in the battle for a city spiraling into anarchy. Family is everything, and the Morettis and Salvatores will do what they must to protect their own. But how far will they go to survive in a new economy where the only currency is violence?",
