  "description": "I love you, Sam. Just four simple words. Easy, right?Oliver Ellison’s heart knows the words are true. Sam Reynolds is the love of his life, and Ollie wants nothing more than to tell his boyfriend how he feels. But trauma and pain from a brutal assault nearly two years ago have kept Ollie from being free to say the words out loud—or to express his love through physical intimacy.Sam understands. He was there at the beginning, after all. He was the one who took care of Ollie during the aftermath, and he’s been there ever since, with his sunshine-filled smile and endless support. Healing is a long road, and Sam is committed. However long it takes.But when a family emergency on the opposite side of the country forces them apart, Sam and Ollie might need all the strength of their love, and much more than just words, to help them get through.More Than Words is an emotional, angsty MM contemporary hurt/comfort romance that tells a story of deep love, living with PTSD from past trauma, and building a forever through life's ups and downs. It features PTSD/trauma and healing, an established relationship, found family, virgin MCs, and a guaranteed (and very sweet!) happily ever after.Trigger references to off-page assault, PTSD with flashbacks, implied homophobia, food aversion/eating disorder; see inside preview for additional content warnings.",
