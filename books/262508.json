  "description": "Anya Volkov was everything I wanted and nothing I could have.  I was never supposed to love her. My future has been set in stone since birth, down to who I am expected to marry. With our inner circle now compromised from my bastard of an uncle, it looked like my future had arrived earlier than expected.   Cristiano Vitucci walked away from me without a backwards glance, deciding power was more important than me.  I accepted that and moved on. Now he was back, ready to take over for his sick father, and no longer someone elseâ€™s husband. He says he wants me back. He tells me he still loves me, that he never stopped.   But how could I trust him when there is so much more at stake this time?",
