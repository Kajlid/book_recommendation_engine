  "description": "Nearly raped at her photo shoot in Milan, Molly Moncrieff escapes only to lose her luggage, her clothes, and her remaining money upon her arrival in Rome. Knowing no one but a young long-haired American she’d just met by a fountain late at night, she has no choice but to accept his kind offer of a place to stay. Certain that she will have to perform to his advantage, remarkably, no advantage is taken, and she sleeps the night in the comfort of clean sheets and safety in the young man’s apartment…the rich and ancient villa of his mother, an Italian Contessa. Waking, she is swept away into his world of antiquity, art, literature, music and culture with a loving, sweet and innocent man eight years her younger. Desperate for salvation and reclamation, she uses her every physical attribute and sensual talent to attract and capture his attention, all the while unaware that it is he, with his intellect, and in his innocence, who is capturing her heart and mind. Set against a background of the ancient city, its art and monuments, piazzas and fountains…and the café society of the early 70’s, this summer romance comes to define who these two people are, and will be, as their lives are forever changed by the encounter.",
