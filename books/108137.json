  "title": "Raanseed's Return",
  "description": "The past decade has been almost trouble free for the White Sparks, but when the Gloom Riders free the dark sorcerer Raanseed, events take a sudden turn for the worse. Raanseed begins his hunt for a long time enemy, while the Gloom Riders make plans to expand their territory, which can't be good for their neighbours. And then Ethan Bentley has a chance encounter with a witch called Faye, who explains that heâ€™s a sorcerer and begins to teach him how to use magic. When they begin delving into Ethan's past, Faye and the Sparks' leaders are shocked to discover that he's an unusual sorcerer, one who possesses an almost unique form of magic; a type of magic, which might someday be the only thing standing between them and a terrible fate at the hand of Raanseed and the Darks.",
