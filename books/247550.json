  "description": "James Whitaker grew up in a Christian household, but fell into the temptation of teenage rebellion. After spending several years in prison, he returns home to Washington, D.C., yearning only to spend time with his devout, long-suffering mother. However, several harrowing events thwart his homecoming plans. A fellow halfway house resident attacks him and forces him to escape from his halfway house. A distraught father targets him for revenge for the disappearance of his young daughter. An old friend resurfaces --someone he hoped he would never see again. These events threaten to destroy James' life and the lives of his family and friends. A church social worker may have the solution to James' problems, but her efforts to help him exacerbate her own struggles and yearning for companionship, and put her, too, at serious risk.Could these events have something to do with a prophecy he received as a child? Or are they the natural repercussions of a fateful decision made several years ago? In this novel set in the gritty urban environs of the nation's capital, drama, suspense and romance come together to create a compelling and realistic story of love, vengeance, and how decisions made in a few seconds can affect the rest of your life.https://www.dovechristianpublishers.c...",
