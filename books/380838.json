  "description": "The definitive account of a bestselling rock band’s glory years Since its initial publication in Australia, Highway to Hell has established itself as a classic of rock writing. It’s the definitive account of AC/DC’s rise to fame, when the ribald lyrics and charismatic stage presence of singer Bon Scott, along with the formidable guitar work of brothers Angus and Malcolm Young, defined a new and highly influential brand of rock’n’roll. Drawing on many first-person interviews and featuring a gallery of rare photos, Clinton Walker traces AC/DC’s career through the life of their original front man, from the Scottish roots he shared with the Youngs to small-time gigs to recording studios and international success—right up to Bon Scott’s shocking death in 1980, just as the band were attaining the worldwide recognition for which they had worked so tirelessly. AC/DC’s undiminished superstar status today—and their lasting influence on such different genres as hard rock, grunge, and rap/metal—ensure that Bon Scott’s presence continues to be felt. Now Highway to Hell offers the full story of this seminal rock figure. Highway to Hell has previously not been available outside Australia, and the author completely revised the text for this first American edition.",
