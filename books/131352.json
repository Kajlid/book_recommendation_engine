The room with the revolving door of females.I know he's a bad idea for me. He's cocky, a manwhore, and way too self-assured for a sheltered girl with secrets.But when he smiles at me, I lose my freaking mind.I don't want her in my home.She's too sweet for a prick like me. Too innocent.Too f*cking much.I have more baggage, secrets, and commitments than she could ever understand.I need her gone, dammit, but I keep pulling her back in.I'm blurring lines with this girl.She's a temptation I can't resist, and I'm losing my head.I'm so goddamn screwedâ€¦Break My Fall is the first installment of the bestselling Broken series.
