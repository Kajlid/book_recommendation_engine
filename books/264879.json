  "description": "Poetry. \"Although Grandmother never uses the first-person pronoun, the voice in these poems is hers. Hence the title. None of the poems here retells any existing Native story; Native peoples tell their own stories. Some such stories are, though, alluded to\" --J.D. Whitney, from the Preface. \"Who's this 'Grandmother' Whitney is channeling, anyway? Seems like the playful spirit, life, energy of the organic world itself, an embodiment of multi-formed always-changing life; that lives whatever comes, with all the hard-won lessons and teachings\" - Gary Snyder.",
