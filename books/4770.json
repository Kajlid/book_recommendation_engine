Maria gets involved with the Paris Commune in 1871 and rallies behind the new socialist government, thinking it will end inequality, but it doesn't. Violence soon erupts when troops break through the barricades on April 2nd and begin a bloody week to overthrow the Commune. Maria tries to speak for the people, but ends up in front of a firing squad. Will she manage to escape death and bring equality to Paris, or will her hopes and dreams die with her?",
