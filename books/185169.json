  "description": "What happens when you go against the rules? The rules in your world, the rules the whole of the gangland live by, and the rules you set as King of that world yourself? Mason Fox teams up with his daughter, Katie, in a bid to bring back his little warrior from the hell she finds herself in. But it’s set in stone that ‘squealers’ always pay… with their lives. And now Mason must hand his life over just so that his soulmate can once again taste freedom. However, what he doesn’t understand is that Katie Fox doesn’t live by rules. The Mafia’s rules, her own father’s rules, or anyone’s come to that. The only rules Katie follows is that of her trusted lust for revenge. Free spirits know no fear. And with no fear comes slaughter and harmony… The only two laws that Katie understands. Sometimes, love is just that little bit too ferocious.",
