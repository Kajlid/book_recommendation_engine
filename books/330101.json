  "description": "Anna's pony float is sure to be the main attraction at the town's Pony Parade...until one of Tommy Rand's pranks goes too far.Anna has a great idea for the town's first ever Pony Parade. Ten lucky artists get to paint a lifesize copy of a pony. The painted ponies will be auctioned off at the Fall Festival and the money goes to the local fire department. The Pony Pals think Anna is a sure winner. She's the best artist in school! But Anna's mother has other ideas. No parade until Anna finishes her research paper. Ugh! And to make matters worse, Tommy Rand is up to his old pranks. Would he really sabotage all of Anna's hard work and destroy her pony design--just to be mean? Not if the Pony Pals can stop him!",
