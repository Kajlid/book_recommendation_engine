  "title": "Loco's Love",
  "description": "Laid-back Loco Remeere lets Cecil, the Alpha's mate, talk him into helping with a harebrained scheme, but this time Cecil's adventure leads him right to his own mate. Tangee Highland works two jobs to survive, and dating is just a far-off fantasy. Rushing in late as usual for his job at a tattoo parlor, he stops dead at the sight of a gorgeous silver-haired man who attracts him like no other. Tangee quickly indulges his desire for silver-haired Loco's touch, but mating for life is a bit extreme for a first date. He denies Loco, insisting the relationship move slowly. Everything changes when Tangee's mother is in an auto accident and the responsibility of his five-year-old sister now lies with him. Will Loco still want him with a kid sister on his hip? Or has Tangee already voided the claiming? Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
