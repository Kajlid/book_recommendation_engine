  "description": "Ryan, Tyler, Avery, and Jacob are high school football stars. Everyone looks up to them. They're living the life that young boys and men dream of and are right at the point of having it a state championship, college paid for, a chance for big money and even more glory in the NFL. It's all there in front of them; the future they and everyone expects. Then something happens that could bring it all crashing down. And they can't tell the truth because it's even worse than having to keep the secret for the rest of their lives. They make a pact to cover it up and never tell. Hiding the truth fuels their escalating addictions and pushes them in different directions as they try to erase the past, deal with the present and hope for the future. But at some point, in some way, there's always a price paid for lies told.",
