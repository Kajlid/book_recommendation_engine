It’s no place for a modern guy and he wants to leave, try his luck on the greener pastures of ‘anywhere’ else.That is until he realizes one thing. Deep down he’s just like everyone else, a country guy through and through. That realization comes just in time, because on a moonlit night a green glowing spaceship lands in Wilson’s field. Aliens, it seems, are real. But why are they in Pembroke Eve of all places? Pembroke is a nowhere place. And why is everyone acting weird all of a sudden, even more so than usual? Are the aliens’ friendly or do they have a more sinister reason for being here?It seems Jacob is the only one who can see what’s really going on. But why him? What’s so special about a gay guy living in a small town? Sure, he’s never had a boyfriend, never been kissed for that matter, so why? Curious, he goes to investigate the spaceship and gets far more than he bargained for as soon as he gets over his back fence. His life will never be the same again.",
