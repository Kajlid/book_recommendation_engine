You'll love it or you'll hate it, and it will just maybe tear your heart out. At the same time, It might very well change the way you see the world. Through the cadence of each connection and the rhythm of the stories told, this book is a place you'll be glad you stumbled upon. Temptation, betrayal, hope, faith, success, triumph, and redemption--it's all here. It is the noise of the heart.",
