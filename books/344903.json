Each an extension of her personality, they are lost to her when she is forced to return to Earth. But they are not gone.The time will come when Margaret, fully grown and wed, must leave this dying world as wellâ€”this Earth so denuded by thoughtlessness and chemistry that its only viable export is slaves. For now Margarets are scattered throughout the galaxy. And their creator must bring her selves home . . . or watch the human race perish.",
