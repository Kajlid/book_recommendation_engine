  "description": "Kay  One look at Evan playing his drums and I fall hard. Instant crush. That is until he opens his mouth. Every snarky comment he makes, has me so mad that I just…well I really want… he deserves a good… kiss?  Evan  She is so beautiful that my teeth ache which is why I have to protect myself. Girls like Kay have always spelled heartbreak for me. The more I push her away, however, the worse I feel. And when she steps under the mistletoe, I can’t help myself. I just have to collect one little kiss. Which is a terrible idea. Didn't high school teach me anything?  This is a sweet and clean standalone romance with a lovely HEA. Enjoy!",
