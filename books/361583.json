  "description": "Bestselling author Lori Copeland ( Outlaw's Bride and A Kiss for Cade ) weaves together elements of another classic Western romance with themes of redemption, forgiveness, and second chances. Abandoned by his fianc√©e hours before their wedding, Walker McKay is determined to never let a woman near his heart again, but he needs an heir to inherit his ranch after he is gone. Courting someone new is out of the question, so he'll have to find a wife another way. Wealthy heiress Sara Livingston wants to be married, but her suitors are deemed unsuitable by her unreasonable father. When the opportunity to fill the bill for a mail-order bride comes her way, she grabs onto it with both hands. Will Sara's deception and Walker's wounded heart keep them from finding what they are looking for? Or are they truly meant for one another? Formerly titled Marrying Walker McKay, rewritten for the inspirational market.",
