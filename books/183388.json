  "description": "Itâ€™s the wrong night to be alone. Living with her daughter, Valerie, Emily Kemp can hardly tell the difference. With an empty tea cup, a wealth of mess, and a photo of her ex-husband on the entertainment unit, Emily makes for bed. Awoken half way through the night, half of the bed unoccupied, Emily thinks it sounded like a bang. Wobbly feet carry her to investigate, satisfied breaths carry her back to bed after abandonment. She stops in the doorway. And then she sees it.",
