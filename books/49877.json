  "description": "Welcome to the future, where you'll be able to take an elevator hundreds of miles into space, the internet will be in your contact lens, nanobots will scan your DNA for signs of disease and you'll be able to control computers with your brain - and even rearrange the physical world itself.It may sound like science fiction but, as physics guru Michio Kaku shows, this is the shape of things to come. Based on interviews with over three hundred of the world's top scientists who are already inventing this future in their labs, Physics of the Future is a time-travelling tour through the revolutionary advances in medicine, computers, quantum physics and space travel that will forever change our way of life - and alter the course of civilization itself.",
