  "description": "Peri Winger was quite content as a single woman, occasionally having fun at area swinger parties. Then she meets Lila, who introduces her to the Free Spirit Connection – a new religious movement with a radically positive view of sexuality – and the charming Andrew who would join them in an open triad. Peri finds ecstasy as she communes with others in this spiritual community, and in time becomes a leader and defender of the faith. But they also face scrutiny from more puritanical elements in their city, who do not approve of how fast the Connection is growing. And when Peri and her friends discover a dark secret, it could lead to all-out holy war!",
