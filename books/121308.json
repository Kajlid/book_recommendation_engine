  "description": "Greg was comfortably moving into the next stage of his life. He would finish grad school, take a university teaching position, and snuggle into academia. He and his wife, Lana, would be happy. That was the plan. Yet while enjoying a cave dive, Greg came across a canister buried in the silt. Within it he discovers an ancient artifact, a scroll containing extraordinary revelations. A discovery that would alter their lives forever. Suddenly they find that their lives are in danger. Seeking safety and answers on a trail that takes them from Florida to Chicago to Wyoming, they find Tom, a Teacher, a link in an ancient chain of knowledge. Tom and Greg must go to New York City to protect the artifact and end the pursuit by those who wish them harm. Along the way, Tom reveals the Teachings of the scroll, the Great Work, the transformation of human consciousness. They encounter bears, bikers, muggers and pot dealers as Tom expresses the ideas of eastern philosophy, martial arts, dimensionality and psychology to explain the Teachings. Greg and Lana gradually discover that everything they thought they understood about themselves and the world around them was a fiction. The plan changed.",
