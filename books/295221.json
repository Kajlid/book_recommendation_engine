  "description": "My twin sister’s best friend is off limits... But that hasn’t stopped me from being in love with her for the past five years. Every chance my sister get’s she reminds me and Lo of my manwhore ways. Obviously, this was long before I ever knew she existed. Now I only have eyes for her. But I’m keeping my hands to myself. After her horrific sexual assault, Lo is sleeping in my bed, living in my house, and invading my every thought. Now that she’s away from my sister, whispering in her ear, warning her away, she’s too fragile for me to think about starting something that may wreck us both. She’s not ready for me and the longer she’s here, the closer my past mistakes come back to haunt me, making me realize I might never deserve her.",
