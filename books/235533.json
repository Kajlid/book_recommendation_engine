  "description": "Life and death of Krishnamurti is a brief but absorbing account of Krishnamurti's life-and in it the author seeks to understand his death (and his death itself)in terms of his own words on the subject. The author claims no more than to introduce Krishnamurti's teaching but, by studying his own explorations into it's origin, she is able to give help to the reader who wishes to delve deeper, as many will.",
