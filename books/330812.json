He's even started stealing your underwear.The only thing keeping you safe from his claws is your enchanted locket.You've told the police, but they're useless. So, one evening, you set up your phone to record him and then you go to sleep.The next morning, watch the recording to find a man with black wings rushing toward you before hitting an invisible barrier. Then he flies into a rage and tears up everything he can find.As he reaches your phone, you press pause... To find the most beautiful man scowling into the camera.Intricate black tattoos cover his muscular body and he's clutching your underwear in his huge hands.But you're too busy staring at his forked tail that glistens with faerie dust.It's time to capture the boogie man.",
