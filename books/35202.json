  "description": "When a hedge fund billionaire hires Stone Barrington to talk some sense into his wayward son, it seems like an easy enough job. No one knows the hidden sins and temptations of the ultra-wealthy better than Stone. But as Stone and his former client and protégé, Herbie Fisher, probe deeper into the case, an old one comes back to haunt him.Stone soon realizes that even he may have underestimated just how far some people will go to cover up their crimes … and plan new ones.From Manhattan’s mahogany-paneled law offices to its modern penthouse lofts and dimly lit nightclubs, the trail of entrapment and murder leads to a shocking act that no one could ever have anticipated.Librarian's note: the characters, settings and other information are complete as best possible (corrections are welcome!) for: #1, New York Dead, 1991; #2, Dirt, 1996; #3, Dead in the Water, 1997; #4, Swimming to Catalina, 1998; #5, Worst Fears Realized, 1999; #6, L.A.
