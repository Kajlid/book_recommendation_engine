  "description": "\"Meyrink's short stories epitomised the non-plus-ultra of all modern writing. Their magnificent colour, their spine-chilling and bizarre inventiveness, their aggression, their succinctness of style, their overwhelming originality of ideas, which is so evident in every sentence and phrase that there seem to be no lacunae: all this captivated me, and seemed to me to provide antidote to all the adjectival prose and shallow, false romanticism of the immediate preceding generation.\" - Max BrodContents:The Ardent SoldierThe BrainIzzi PizziThe Violet DeathTerrorPetroleum, PetroleumThe Curse of the Toad - Curse of the ToadThe Black BallThe PreparationDr. LedererThe OpalThe Man on the BottleBlamolThe Truth-DropDr. Cinderella's PlantsSt. Gingolph's UrnThe Ring of SaturnThe AutomobileThe WaxworksFeverWhat's the Use of White Dog Shit?Humming in the EarsBal MacabreRupert's DropsCoagulumThe Secret of Hathaway CastleChimeraA SuggestionThe InvalidG.M.Wethergoblin",
