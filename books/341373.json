  "description": "Were things getting too hot to handle...?When Victoria Hamilton's \"no strings, no last names\" vacation fling resulted in a baby, she knew she had to begin a new life far from her family's corrupting influence. Now her father has been murdered, her half brother, Jared, is the prime suspect and Tori has no choice but to return to Colorado Springs with her young daughter. She'll do anything to prove Jared's innocence. But confronting her past when she opens the door to her new private investigator and comes face-to-face with John \"Rocket\" Miglionni sure isn't what she had in mind.Tori isn't the only one who's in for a surprise. Thrilled at first to find the woman who rocked his world six years ago, the rugged former marine takes one look at her little girl with his dark eyes - and Tori's panicked expression - and gets the shock of his life. In one fell swoop he's found the woman who haunts his dreams and discovered he's a daddy. As tough as they come, John now has two females holding a big piece of his heart, a troubled teenager who expects the worst from the adult males in his life...and a second chance to make it right for all of them.",
