The boy who watches mob movies to remind himself that trust means betrayal. A clock of two weeks ticks away until they spend another three hundred and fifty-one days trying to forget each other. Until next year.As the passion between them rises with the summer temperature, Evie can’t help but feel his embraces are like a sunset: beautiful and temporary.Above all, Evie must not forget one very important lesson: If he is hot, he can burn you. Better get the aloe. *Though this book begins in young adulthood, it transitions with summer time-jumps until the characters are new adults in college. As a new adult romance novel, the story contains mature situations and sexual scenes.",
