From the moment she laid eyes on Master Xanthos she was intrigued by this man. Now, she finds herself being trained to be Master Xanthos’ submissive. The awkwardness of being in the same BDSM community as her son is something that can’t be easily overlooked. The growing love she feels for Master Xanthos scares her. And now, Xanthos wishes for her to help Master Rex with his female submissives. The undeniable attraction Georgia feels for Rex is something she can’t allow to happen. Rex is the same age as her son Damien. Master Damien is happy that his mother has found love with Master Xanthos, yet he is uneasy about her being Master Xanthos’ submissive. He is willing to deal with his uneasiness so that Georgia may find some happiness. However, when he notices that she acts very differently around Master Rex than she does around the other Masters in the community he will not accept his mother being with the most brutal of pain Masters in the community.

Zen has taken Lash’s submissive and lover from him before what will stop him from doing it again. Lash loves his big brother, he was all Lash had when he was younger.
