  "title": "Rediscovering God in America: Reflections on the Role of Faith in Our Nation's History and Future",
  "description": "Rediscovering God in America is my invitation for you to join me on a walk through America's capital city, Washington, D.C.This walking tour is not just a look at the architecture and beauty of our nation's capital; it is a tour of American history, of the great men and women, the great events, the great documents and great institutions, the great ideas—all shaped decisively by the genuine belief that we are a nation under God—that are at the heart of our freedom as Americans and our identity as a people.The next time a friend or colleague says that religious expression has no place in the public square and that discussion of God has no place in our children's history and government classes, you will only need to tell them about what you experienced on this simple walk to remind them of God's role in America's history—and America's future.",
