  "title": "The Last Ditto",
  "description": "A nameless man with a feather-light grip on reality, a loner, a drifter, a thinker, but certainly not a doer, seeks therapy through the recordings of his highly lucid dreams. Until he discovers a message hidden within his meticulous records, a secret set of instructions, for life, death, and everything in between. The Last Ditto is an account of one man's journey through decades of deep sleep exploration, into the outer reaches of the subconscious, to the very fringes of death. Exploring the psychology of being, with the aid of a whistleblower from the other side, delving into the effects of the laws of observation, the power of received truth over the subconscious, and their major contribution to a worldwide existential crisis. The Last Ditto is the story of a man who has broken ranks with humanity, to seek an exit from reality, and leave this place behind, forever.",
