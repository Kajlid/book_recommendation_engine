  "description": "We all have things in our lives - a sudden death, a new baby, chronic pain, a divorce, the new school year, the loss of a job, a near-fatal accident, even just moving to a new house - things happen that shake us up, knock us for a loop, throw us spinning into confusion, and fear and not knowing what's next.Sometimes the thing that shakes us and wakes us is our own boredom. We aren't challenged at work, we don't engage in anything exciting in our free time. We live our routine, park ourselves in front of our technology and, even though we don't love it, we think that life is fine.And then something happens and suddenly fine is no longer enough. We know we want to make a change. But we don't even know what else we might want.HEART SPARKS: 7 Practices For Loving Your Life offers seven do-able practices that will guide you to discover what else you might be wanting in your life:Grounding. Quieting. Exploring. Getting Clear. Letting Go. Imagining. Taking Action.Within the framework of these seven practices, Ruth shares engaging stories with compelling questions, challenges and meditations that invite you to remember what you love and how to bring more of it into your daily lives.",
