  "description": "Dylan Anders is making amends. After hitting rock bottom, he's got something to prove and this time, there's no looking back. Unfortunately, looking forward has him trying to volunteer for a literacy campaign where he has to win the approval of the one woman who seems unaffected by his charm. He never expected it to be easy, but he certainly never expected to have to work quite so hard to win one woman's approval.Ambitious Paige Walters is ecstatic when she's hired to recruit musicians for a literacy campaign-it's her chance to prove she's got the chops to make it in the family business. When Dylan steps in, she immediately dislikes him and vows not to let the fallen idol screw it up. But as the work brings Paige and Dylan closer together, their attraction grows...and so do their challenges...Shaughnessy Band on the Run seriesOne More Kiss (Book 1)One More Promise (Book 2)One More Moment (Book 3)What People Are Saying about Samantha \"Classic, thoughtful, and sometimes as lyrical as the stars.\" -Kirkus for A Sky Full of Stars\"A delight for readers...a classic love story.\" -RT Book Reviews for This is Our Song\"So much more than just a romance.\" -Night Owl Reviews for Always My Girl",
