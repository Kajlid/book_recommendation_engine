With her stunning beauty and overwhelming charm, Manuela Aloe seemed like perfect girlfriend material, but when many strange things occur, Britt Rainstar begins to have second thoughts about his angelic--or demonic--love. If he can survive the attacks of a devil-possessed dog, a trigger-happy skeleton, and a mystery person who pushes his wheelchair down the stairs, then maybe Britt can escape Manuela and the evil that followers her.",
