  "description": "He says it was foretold, an inescapable way to bring them together. All Laurell Pittman knows is that ungovernable need surges through her body whenever Axiom is near. Who is this godlike stranger who appears out of nowhere to steal her away from home? She ought to be terrified. Instead, his kiss awakens unimaginable feelings, sensations of invisible hands stroking her body, a longing she can't deny. If she believes his claims - and in his arms how can she not? - she is destined to conceive a very special child...and he is the appointed father. As he fights off demons trying to prevent the child's birth and patiently teaches her how to use her own undiscovered powers, she finds her heart going out to this Balancer who is equally at home with good and evil, teetering on the edge of temptation, eternally caught...Between Light and Dark.",
