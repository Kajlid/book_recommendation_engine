  "description": "Newly Updated! For the first time in paperback--the wit and wisdom of the former President and a revealing look at the private man behind the public persona A charming collection of excerpts from the former. President's speeches and other writings, Heartbeat reveals the basic ideals and beliefs that have served George H. W. Bush throughout his public and private life. He speaks often of what he calls \"heartbeat.\" It is a simple word--a code word--referring to personal bedrock values concerning service, duty, honor, friends, faith, and particularly family. As the Bushes prove themselves to be one of the most important political families in U.S. history, this warm and revealing look into the former President's guiding principles could not come at a more important time. Culled from Mr. Bush's speeches over the course of his presidency and after, Heartbeat discloses a surprising personal side to the forty-first President. In chapters such as \"1989: A New Breeze\" and \"1993-2001: Did It with Honor, \" the book is entertaining, eloquent, and emotional. Heartbeat additionally has been updated to include Bush's response to September 11th. It also gives remembrances of Stephen Ambrose and Lionel Hampton as well as reflections on the \"Greatest Generation, \" baseball, and other presidents, including his son. This remarkable collection paints a poignant portrait not just of the former President but also of a man and a family.",
