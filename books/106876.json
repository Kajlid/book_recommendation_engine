  "description": "The story about a girl who lived, died, and met a guy…in that order. Is it possible to find true love while condemned to purgatory until the end of days? Olivia Brennan isn't looking to find out. Her afterlife is nothing special — her days spent working for a division of Purgatory and Associates, her nights usually occupied with reruns or a good book. Everything changes when her best friend coaxes her into a girls' night out one fateful evening. The handsome stranger eyeing her from across the club seems too good to be true. Drake proves to be witty, charming, and considerate to a fault, despite the all-too-familiar sadness that lurks behind his eyes. It seems Fate has finally brought Olivia a kindred spirit, someone she can truly relate to. But can she move past her own dark regrets from the life she left behind? Or will falling for him demand the ultimate sacrifice—her soul?",
