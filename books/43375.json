  "description": "Halfway through his famous play on injustice, Andher Nagari Choupat Raja, Bharatendu Harishchandra What is the duty of a writer - to depict reality as it exists or to project what it should actually be Unable to decide, Bharatendu abandons the play and releases Govardhan, the main character who is unjustly condemned to death, from drama to real life. The noose still hangs over Govardhan's head as he walks out of prison as a representative of all those who are victims of the ruthlessness and absurdity of justice. He questions everyone he encounters and raises a storm which gains momentum as he journeys through space and time. The lines between fact and fiction blur as a host of people from mythology, history and literature join him, some asking questions, like him, and others opposing them. As we follow Govardhan's meanderings, we realize that his journey will never end, for with the passage of time he will find more places to visit and more people to meet, even as the ever-present noose tightens around his neck. Ultimately, there can be no escape for the Govardhans of this world.",
