  "description": "Can airplanes fly to the moon? This one can! Above the clouds an airplane flies into the sky. On the ground a small boy looks up. A young boy sees a plane overhead and imagines himself in it, traveling all the way to the moon. What does he see on his way?  With characteristically spare prose, Caldecott Honor winner Peter McCarty invites readers along for an imaginary trip from the earth to the moon and back again, visiting trains, planes, and boats along the way. McCarty's luminous illustrations make the boy's fantasy into a dreamlike journey that ends in his mother's arms, a perfect way to end the day. Moon Plane is a 2007 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.",
