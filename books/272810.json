  "title": "New Moon by Half: A Lifetime in Poetry",
  "description": "Drawn from material written over five decades this book brings together a remarkable body of work, a lifetime in poetry.Within these pages Scott Oury explores with honesty moments easily overlooked, and those difficult to ignore: family, love, the human connection with the natural world and beyond, an unoccupied space, a chance meeting in an airport, a forgotten wristwatch—and other instances of unexpected beauty. In the words of the author, “All of it, and much more—whatever captured my eye, or ear, and stirred feeling—got put into words.”Evocative, lyric and intimate, these poems celebrate the grace found in the mundane, the painful, and the overlooked, forging a new way of seeing for both writer and reader.",
