  "description": "This book is the follow-up to Pack Your Bags and Get Out by Dave Clarke. That story told of a 3,500 mile motorcycle trip around the coast of Great Britain in 2007 in what was the wettest June on record up to that date.That was my story. This is my wife, Elizabeth’ A true story told in her own words as precisely as she recalled it, with help from her sister Jean’s recollections of dates and family history from the early years and how, as a member of a large young family, living in an austerity filled world of poor housing and social degradation, she faced the early trials and pitfalls of growing up, whilst witnessing first hand the gradual demise and eventual collapse of her parents’ stormy marriage. Then the even bigger trials of meeting and marrying ‘Biker Dave’ at such a young age and how she managed to successfully juggle home, work, family commitments and money, on her own special journey through life.Dave Clarke",
