  "description": "With The Big Fat Kill Frank Miller is at it again with another comics packed with guns, lovers, losers, and surprises. In Sin City's Old Town, the prostitutes run the show. \"The cops stay out. That leaves the girls free to keep the pimps and the mob out.\" Sounds like an OK place, right? It is until a pushy, loud-mouthed guy who has had one too many drinks comes into Old Town and gets himself killed by the ladies. When they find out who he is, they realize that \"it'll be war. The streets will run red with blood. Women's blood.\"",
