  "title": "The Ladies from St. Petersburg",
  "description": "The three novellas in this slim but potent collection explore the psychic price of immigration and the rigors of enduring hardship alone. Russian emigre Berberova (1901-1993) first moved to France in the 1920s, then settled in the U.S. in the 1950s, where she taught at Princeton University. Schwartz's fine translation should help acquaint a larger audience with this writer, best known for her earlier works about life in Paris, including The Accompanist (which was turned into a film), The Tattered Cloak and Other Novels and her biography, Aleksandr Blok: A Life.",
