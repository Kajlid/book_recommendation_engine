  "description": "23rd Century Britain. No oil. No electricity. It's been 150 years since The Collapse, and the Information Age has long gone. The clouds of data that once drove humanity are little more than ash, the knowledge once held in their servers lost in the mists of time. The few remaining people get by as best they can, improvising and living off the land, or scavenging through long-derelict cities for scraps and trinkets. This is the world of the Kingsmen, elite law enforcers with the power of life and death.Sixteen year old Flick Carter has saved the life of an injured Scav. But it's not just the Kingsmen who want to get their hands on the boy and his secrets; there are forces far more dangerous who will stop at nothing, not even murder.For Flick, the small Oxfordshire town of Faringdon is no longer safe. Wanted for murder, and with no one left she can trust, she must run. Or die.Note: Contains scenes of death and violence, and very occasional swearing.",
