  "description": "Pastor Jonathan Phelps believes in angels. Yet, the idea of unseen beings actually roaming the halls of Grace Community Church never entered his mind. Angels surely had some kind of purpose somewhere, but never in an unimportant backwater like Thyme, Texas. The thought of a warrior showing up in his office would have shaken him to the core! Angels never do things like that. Do they?It’s been 700 years since JaKobe worked on earth, but when his curiosity is piqued by Rachael’s strange request, he finds himself once again on assignment doing the very things he once thought were behind him forever. Serving Adam’s offspring and advancing the Kingdom while enemies multiply on every side is all in a day’s work. And, this specific assignment is one job JaKobe is determined to finish before midnight.",
