  "description": "Pre-med student Tyler Dufresne is way too inexperienced to deal with this magical crap. The spectre he finds after exploring a strange mausoleum linked to the inexplicable suicides of two of his relatives scares the hell out of him. Then, within days, he’s lied to by a priest, attacked by a knife-wielding madman, and accosted by a psychic who hates him just because she met him. Seriously.Ty needs to focus on his own life, and not becoming a redshirt in someone else’s story. Besides, countless Dungeons & Dragons games have taught him that newbie adventurers get stabbed more often than not. Problem is, he may be a novice, but he is a real-life necromancer, making it hard to ignore the storm of the Afterwold’s spirits growing in the sky. The trauma of the accident which incited his magical powers has held him back for years, but now he needs to learn about his abilities. Fast.Worse, the rest of Toronto’s supernatural underside is apathetic to the threat. Ty knows he’s no big damn hero, but wilfull blindness is something Ty just can’t stomach. The only clues are a haunted misericorde and three surivors of the cult it once belonged to. The misericorde’s also the most recent murder weapon, and - of course - it’s missing.Meanwhile, the spectre grows stronger with every ‘suicide’ it causes. With All Souls’ Day fast approaching, there isn’t much time left before the cult survivors gain absolute power over a force of Death unequalled this side of the Veil.And, as if threatening the friends, family, and city he loves wasn’t enough, they also want Ty as its host. Yeah, over his dead body - but that’s kind of the point.",
