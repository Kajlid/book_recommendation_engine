When his band rips the school concert on the eve of his 14th birthday and a record producer wants to sign him, it’s happy days. Until his mum Egrainne announces they’re leaving the Welsh town of Celidon to which they’ve only just moved.Art finds out his father was Merlin and his Mum is King Arthur’s sister. Merlin was killed by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse – hideous Angel of Death, battle-scarred W.A.R., snot-dripping Plague and skeletal Fest. Before he died Merlin gave his powers to Egrainne to hold for Art until he turns 14. She fled Camelot with baby Art in a time machine and they hid in the 21st Century. Now the Horsemen have found them. They want Merlin’s powers. Time to go.Art thinks his mum has totally lost it. But before he knows it he’s back in time with unsuspecting girl-friend Megan, seeking a sword and a stone. Camelot’s under siege. King Arthur imprisons them. Art realizes his mother loathes magic and wants the power to die in her so he can stay normal. But Art's not sure that's what he wants. These powers are a chance for him to be a hero. With Merlin’s powers, the Four Horsemen will destroy the world. Art must decide. His birthday is just hours away.",
