  "title": "Alien Nightmares: Screen Memories of UFO Alien Abductions",
  "description": "Extraordinary true-life chronicles of a UFO alien abductee as revealed through vividly creepy dreams and screen memories. Walk the scary trails with me, haunted by creatures who followed me for decades with night terrors, monstrous visitors, bizarre visions, and fright nights that had me turning on all the lights afraid to go to sleep.Journey with me into Alien Nightmares full of the dreams, memories, and vivid imagery which led me to believe that extraterrestrials had come calling.I lived in an amazing world full of terrifying creatures, whirlwinds, bizarre tasks and puzzles, and night visitors who took me and left me feeling drugged. UFOs flew in and out of my dreams for decades and I'd wake up knowing that this dream was not like the others, especially when they left me utterly terrified. There was no such thing as a safe place and I knew it.Who were they? What did they want? Remember the old saying, \"judge not, lest ye be judged?\" Well it's coming home to roost and it's riding in on a UFO. Are the aliens the antichrist that the Bible warns of? Or are they our lifeboats to a brave new world? Do they bring a message of empowerment, or are we just rats in a maze? Whoever they are, one thing is certain: we cannot handle their truth.If you are a believer, you'll see screen memories from an abductee. If you are a skeptic, you'll see a child with a big imagination and an adult who experiences extraordinarily vivid nightmares. Either way, God help you if the nightmares ever come and haunt you...",
