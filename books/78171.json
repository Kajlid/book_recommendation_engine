  "title": "The Ascent of Rum Doodle",
  "description": "First published in 1956, The Ascent of Rum Doodle quickly became a mountaineering classic. As an outrageously funny spoof about the ascent of a peak in the Himalayas, many thought it was inspired by the 1953 conquest of Everest. But Bowman had drawn on the flavor and tone of earlier adventures, of Bill Tilman and his 1937 account of the Nandi Devi expedition. The bookâ€™s central and unforgettable character, Binder, is one of the finest creations in comic literature.",
