  "description": "Traci Wells has never thought about dating any of the men from Make You Sweat, her local gym, until he catches her eye--the sexy blue-eyed stranger with the most unbelievable body she has ever laid eyes on. However, Traci promises not to let herself fall for Zack, but that vow is put to the test as the two of them grow closer and closer. Zack Drace isn't usually the one who approaches women for dates, but when he spots the alluring mocha skinned beauty Traci Wells, that policy goes out the door. He wants to make her his more than anything in the world. He isn't going to allow the opinions of his brothers or her sister to stand in his way.",
