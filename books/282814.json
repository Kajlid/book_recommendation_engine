  "description": "After spending the vast majority of my life lonely, I came to this town to find answers about my mother, and instead, stumbled upon a secret society full of monsters I never knew existed outside of dark tales.  Now I've built a sanctuary, gotten in the middle of an ages-old feud between various monster factions, and somehow ended up with an ancient, queen-like tyrant targeting me, because my life sucks sometimes.  I don't know how these things keep happening to me. They just do.  Tensions keep climbing, and everyone's on edge while waiting and watching to see what Idun Neopry does next.  In the midst of all that, the secrets spill, the lies unravel, and the half-truths finally come to full fruition. It's been one hellish snowball ride to make it this far, and I'm mostly ready for anything that comes next.  That's a lie, actually. But I'd like for it to be the truth. For now, hoping for the best is all I have. Well, I guess that's a lie too. Hope's not all I have.  I also have a Van Helsing, who can slay a small army without wrinkling his shirt. Then there's a Morpheous, who can toy with my mind in ways I never imagined. I've got a wolf, who makes it a goal to keep me human-ish. And there's a vampire, who enjoys killing and stabbing.  Ancient alphas, old vendettas, super-complicated histories, mass-death threats, and a lot of personal baggage. That's become a Tuesday morning coffee break to me by now.  Like I said, my life sucks sometimes.  **Reverse Harem Romance **Language Warning **Adult content **Dark Humor",
