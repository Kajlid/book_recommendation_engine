But, in the sleepy woodland village of Greenwood life goes on just as it always has, comfortable and commonplace-until an ancient power awakens in the heart of the old forest and summons to it an exiled princess, a gifted magician, a gorgeous vagabond. Soon a twisting, turning nightmare will descend on all the lands, and a young Greenwooder by the name of Emilyn Sayer will begin a journey that will take her into the heart of a darkling realm of beauty and terror, where lies the key to discovering the talisman that can turn the nightmare back.",
