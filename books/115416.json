  "title": "Horseback: A Memoir of My Early Life with Horses",
  "description": "Award-winning author and trainer Lisa Wysocky writes of her early life with horses. From her start with Snoqualmie, the intelligent mare she describes as a “sister,” to her dutiful colt, Ben, Lisa takes readers through her adventurous teen years working at a dude ranch. After college, Lisa became a farm manager and brings alive a number of horses––including the colt who would not come out of the trailer, and her loving but tumultuous relationship with a mare who (almost) won a world championship––along with the many lessons she learned in the process. Horseback is a touching memoir that brings both laughter and tears, and is a must for any lover of horses. Lisa Wysocky writes with skill and nearly unparalleled knowledge of the equines she dearly loves. ––Horse South Lisa Wysocky is an expert horsewoman and trainer, and she bathes her story in interesting explanations of just what that type of lifestyle entails. ––Midwest Book Review",
