  "description": "The secluded forest cabin was meant to give Sophie a place to hide, to heal, and to be safe.  But from the moment she arrives, she’s not alone. She glimpses dark shapes from the corner of her eye, feels phantom touches, and her dreams are filled with seductive shadows. What she first mistakes for delusions of her traumatized mind soon prove to be so much more…  An ancient, mysterious, dangerous entity lurks in the woods — and it wants Sophie. ---------- **Trigger Warning: This book contains sexual explicit scenes and violence, including a history of domestic abuse.**",
