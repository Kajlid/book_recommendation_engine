  "description": "Conflict is plentiful between Homicide Detective Kate Kincaid and Special Agent Nate Quinn. The FBI computer techy has never investigated a murder and the steely-nerved detective has never worked undercover much less in a strip joint. In a frantic race to catch a killer, Kate plunges into her assignment and the dark side of a haunting past while Quinn, wary of Kate’s game plan, learns she never existed until sixteen years ago. From the despairing city streets to sleazy nightclubs, Kate and Quinn follow the twisted trail of greed, murder, and corruption breaking the law to enforce the law. But now powerless to outrun the secret that stalks her, Kate must reveal her past to gain Quinn’s trust. And as the case heats up in a chain reaction of explosive events, the fugitives are one heart-pounding step ahead of the cops and the killers with an unquenchable thirst to expose the truth.",
