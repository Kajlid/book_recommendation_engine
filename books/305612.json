Though a daughter of a princess and a count, Mariana has grown up as a peasant girl in an obscure village. Suddenly she finds herself thrust back into elite society and must take her rightful place as an aristocrat. But Mariana wants to do something more meaningful with her life. Trained as a nurse, she refuses the easy life of a Russian socialite and goes to the front lines in Manchuria to care for the wounded soldiers. There she is confronted with the horrible realities of war and death. And she discovers something else—a renewal of her relationship with American reporter Daniel Trent. But Daniel betrayed her trust once before…can she learn to trust him now? Back in St. Petersburg, revolutionary forces are gaining momentum in their quest for freedom—a quest that will certainly end in bloodshed and heartache. And one man, bent on an old revenge, plots to kill Mariana, her family, and everyone she loves. Against the tumultuous backdrop of pre-revolutionary Russia, a compelling story of God’s power to bring love and freedom.",
