  "description": "ASIN B07CPWT3H9 moved to this edition.\nIn a world where we have government of the rich by the rich for the rich…\nAmerica in 2105 is beset with mass inequality, poverty and increasingly large numbers of the poor. This, combined with the breakdown of families and marriages has led to huge economic and societal burdens. A fractured and divided America ushers in an authoritarian government that promises to solve all these problems in one stroke with a radical solution.Welcome to the CRAS: the Child Redistribution Adoption System. Also known as the cure for America’s failing economy… and the bane of nineteen-year-old Robin Sylvone’s existence. Under the System, not all parents can expect to keep the children they bring into the world: families who are not self-sustaining have their children taken and given to the rich. And as a single teen mother, Robin fell within the scope of the scheme and lost her baby two years ago. After being forced to drop out of school and become a factory worker in order to support herself, she doesn’t see much light in her future—or hold any hope of seeing her child again. Until she stumbles upon a group of misfits who share her frustrations and desire for change. An underground movement that operates in some rather clever yet unconventional ways… By day they still call me Robin Sylvone. Factory worker and upper class reject. But now, by night, they call me Robin Hood…",
