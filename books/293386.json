Trained by his master to endure pain and to seduce and satisfy any man, his cruel life experiences have honed his instincts on nothing but survival. Highly intelligent and with a ruthless streak, he is desperate to fight his way out of slavery. Sabina Borealis is the beautiful pampered daughter of the wealthy and influential senator Fidecius, patriarch of one of the oldest and most respected noble families in Rome. Owing to her father's influence at the imperial court, she is betrothed to Draconius, a nephew of the emperor and the heir to the throne.One fated night brings Pliny and Sabina together and sets in motion a series of events that brings Pliny closer to danger...and possible freedom.To Pliny, all those who own him are just replaceable pawns. He is willing to justify all means to ensure his own interests...until his evolving feelings for his mistress Sabina starts to complicate his life.A predestined, twisted love story that combines the decadence, intrigues, and ruthlessness of HBO Rome with the dark sensuality of Fifty Shades of Grey.",
