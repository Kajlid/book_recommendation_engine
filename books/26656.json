  "title": "Lahaina Noon: NƒÅ Mele O Maui: Poems",
  "description": "Poetry. Lahaina Noon is the moment when tropical sun shines straight down. No shadows darken that astonishing moment of illumination, and Hawai'i is where it happens. LAHAINA NOON, Eric Paul Shaffer's fifth book, contains poems of Maui that reveal a clarity and a sense of place as clear as lines of Billy Collins, profound as Gary Snyder, and direct as Jim Harrison. Shaffer received the 2002 Elliot Cades Award for Literature. \"The arrival of a new collection of Shaffer's precise, graceful, witty, luminous work makes for a happy day in the Fowler household. No one is better at peeling away a single, ordinary moment until the whole world has been revealed\"--Karen Joy Fowler.",
