  "description": "Anne Ehrlich is a dedicated guidance counselor steering her high-school charges through the perils of college admission. Thirteen years ago, when she was graduating from Columbia University, her wealthy family---especially her dear grandmother Winnie---persuaded her to give up the love of her life, Ben Cutler, a penniless boy from Queens College. Anne has never married and hasn't seen Ben since---until his nephew turns up in her high school and starts applying to college.Now Ben is a successful writer, a world traveler, and a soon-to-be married man; and Winnie's health is beginning to fail. All of these changes have Anne beginning to wonderâ€¦Can old love be rekindled, or are past mistakes too painful to forget?With all the wit and perceptiveness of Jane Austen's Persuasion , Jane Austen in Scarsdale is a fresh and romantic new comedy from a novelist with \"a knack for making modern life reflect literature in the most engaging manner\" (Library Journal).",
