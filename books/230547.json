  "title": "An Asian Minor: The True Story of Ganymede",
  "description": "This novella by acclaimed author Felice Picano is Ganymede's true life story--unapologetic in its ribald and risque details of Greek gods trying to seduce a the most beautiful young boy in the world. An unhibited Ganymede, at only twelve, displays the perfect proportions that make him unique and utterly desired by every man that spies him. Hermes may be the god that seduces the boy and takes his virginity, but other immortals--Ares, Apollo, even Zeus--soon demand his affections. A intergenerational, man-boy classic tale.",
