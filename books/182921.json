  "description": "Traveling nurse Mercy Mares needs three things in life: the unconditional love of her daughter, her best friend and mentor's constant wisdom, and a new engine for her twenty-year old car. A new job posting halfway across the country promises to satisfy one of those needs, but when her patient's spouse dies within minutes of meeting her, she will soon find out that she's going to need a lot more than car repairs. What was touted as the friendliest town in America soon turns on her and it will be up to her to connect the dots and find the true murderer, but doing so will be no easy feat. With memory impaired witnesses, a meddling medical staff, and a cast of characters dead set on keeping their community free of strangers, Mercy will need a little help from her loved ones and a lot of luck to get herself out of this jam or risk losing everything she's worked so hard to achieve. Find out what happens when mayhem becomes synonymous with Mercy in this humorous, slightly irreverent Cozy Medical Mystery novel!(This a previously-published edition of ASIN B010EJQT6K, which is located at: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4....)",
