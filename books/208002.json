  "description": "Kai, heir of the dilapidated clan who's established residence in the most dangerous mountain on Gaia to avoid persecution, has enough problem on his plate. For starters? Finding enough food. Lack of running water. Keeping the kids alive - and out of the slave trade. The torrential snow. But when he sees that innocent, defenseless girl who persists in staying in the cold wastelands all by herself, he can't close his eyes, she becomes his to care for.  Eira has spent the last seven hundred years asleep. Before that, she'd had a two century long nap. While she's occasionally awoken over the course of the last two millenniums, nothing has kept her interested long enough to stop her from going back to her long slumbers.  This time should have been no different; Eira returns to her lands, intending to go back to sleep, but damn Kai doesn't get the meaning of \"leave me the hell alone.\"   She's the last full fledged goddess residing in Gaia and that mortal wishes to save her. Men are stupid.",
