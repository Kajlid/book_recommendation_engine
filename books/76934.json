  "description": "A group of well-bred English people are confronted by a situation which is outside their experience. their reactions are both unexpected and violent. The catalyst is the marriage of the widowed Lilia Herriton to an Italian twelve years her junior, and the contrast between the vitality of disreputable, violent, pitiable Gino and the narrowness and lifelessness of the English forms of the central theme of the story. Told with sympathy, a lightness, a grace of touch and a radiant atmosphere of humour, E.M. Forsters's first novel shows what was to become his characteristic mastery of dialogue and character.",
