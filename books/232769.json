  "description": "In a world full of super powers, Felix has a pretty crappy one.  He has the ability to modify any item he owns. To upgrade anything.  Sounds great on paper. Almost like a video game.  Except that the amount of power it takes to actually change, modify, or upgrade anything worthwhile is beyond his abilities. With that in mind, Felix settled into a normal life. A normal job.  His entire world changes when the city he lives in is taken over by a Super Villain. Becoming a country of one city. A city state.  Surprisingly, not a whole lot changed. Politicians were still corrupt. Banks still held onto your money. And criminals still committed crime.  Though the black market has become more readily available.  And in that not so black market, Felix discovers he has a way to make his power useful after all, and grasps a hold of his chance with both hands.  Warning and minor spoiler: This novel contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/partial harem, unconventional opinions/beliefs, and a hero who is as tactful as a dog at a cat show. Read at your own risk.",
