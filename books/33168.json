  "title": "A Handful of Dust",
  "description": "Laced with cynicism and truth, \"A Handful of Dust\" satirizes a certain stratum of English life where all the characters have wealth, but lack practically every other credential. Murderously urbane, it depicts the breakup of a marriage in the London gentry, where the errant wife suffers from terminal boredom, and becomes enamoured of a social parasite and professional luncheon-goer.",
