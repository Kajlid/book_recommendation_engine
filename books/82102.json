  "description": "Caleb McEllis recently moved to San Diego to start a new life...he was going to go to college, make new friends, hopefully go on a date or two, but most importantly, he was leaving Twentynine Palms, and never looking back! He wasn't quite that lucky however, and when his financial aid doesn't work out, he is forced to get a job in downtown. His life was finally starting to settle into a pretty stable pattern, which of course means that all hell is about to break loose, and as Awakened begins, Caleb is just about to find out how off track his life is going to become. On his way to work one night, Caleb is run off the road by a shadowy creature, and during the ensuing chaos, he finds out that most of what he knows about himself and his life is based on lies. As they begin to unravel, he must decide if he is willing to embrace the truth and become what he is meant to be, or continue to live with the lies and risk dying.",
