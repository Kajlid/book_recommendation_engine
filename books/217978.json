When Zeke crash lands on an uncharted world, he is rescued by an angel who nurses him back to health. Zeke quickly realizes the secret community located beneath the surface of this inhospitable planet is the only known uninfected colony of humans in the galaxy. He must protect them. Likewise, he must protect Angela - his angel - the one woman he wants like no other in the universe. He needs her with an urgency he has never before known. He needs her love and her passion, for the rest of his life. But the enemy stalks them. Zeke must find a way to protect his mate and her people. Humanity is rallying and he suspects this small group of uninfected humans will be the key - along with the Sons - to rebuilding the human race. Michael is a Dominant Son of Amber, commandant of the human fighting forces and in charge of Atlantia Station. When he learns a smuggling ring is kidnapping human women and transporting them to the jit'suku galaxy, he goes undercover with his executive officer to uncover the rats in their own kitchen. But playing the role of submissive female is something Leah, his competant XO, isn't sure she can do. Michael proves to her she not only can, but will enjoy the Dominant games he plays so well for benefit of the smugglers they must convince.",
