  "description": "Find Her. Is the ancient directive that has once again reawakened in the hearts of those who hide. Kill Her!  Is the frantic command of those who fear their rise.  Aelia returns from a vacation that did not go quite as she expected, to a life she does not feel at home in but that is, at least, hers. Or so she thinks. Within days of returning she is targeted by a killer and she has no idea why.  But then neither does he. All Kyle Rhys knows is that to protect humanity, this woman must die. At least, he thinks, killing her will be easy. After all, the organization that raised him has prepared him for her death his entire life.  So why can't he kill her? In an impossible turn of events, both killer and target find themselves on the run from those who would stop at nothing to destroy them, to those who hold a truth that would overturn their entire world, taking their very identities from them forever.",
