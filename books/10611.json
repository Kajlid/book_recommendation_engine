  "title": "Introducing Vivien Leigh Reid: Daughter of the Diva",
  "description": "Leigh can think of a million ways she'd rather spend a summer besides visiting her movie star mother, Annika. But her dad insists the two need some \"mother/daughter bonding time,\" and packs fifteen-year-old Leigh off to Ireland, where she'll be her mom's personal assistant on the set of her latest film, \"Danny Boy.\" It could be worse. Annika may be a distant, self-absorbed diva, but Sean, the young, hot co-star, has a brogue to die for, and things heat up when Leigh lands a bit-part in the movie. Soon, Leigh and Annika are sharing scenes, scripts--and the spotlight. With tensions rising on the set, Annika and Leigh must finally grow into their most demanding mother and daughter.",
