  "description": "Just because Fate brings you your perfect mate doesn t mean it ll be easy.A Cascadia Wolves story.Could there be any worse fate than a road trip from Seattle to L.A. with one s mother to attend a wedding? Why yes, when one isn t married yet, like Megan Warden. Toss in a grandmother and a carload of already married sisters and it s a recipe for sneaking sips of special coffee while someone else drives.Shane Rosario has better things to do than attend a wedding where his father s relatives will be at him nonstop about getting married and having children. If it weren t for seeing his anchor bond, Layla, he d have taken a pass on the entire weekend. It would be easy, since he s become adept at hiding who and what he is.When the two weren t even looking, Fate steps in and before they know it, their bond is sealed. Bonded pair, married in the eyes of their people. Two people tied together in every way. Trouble is, Shane s not sure he wants all that comes with Megan. And Megan s certain she s not willing to live outside her pack, pretending to be human.The distance between them is more than geographical. It s a widening gulf rapidly filling with resentment an emotional divide only acceptance could bridge. Can Shane can accept himself to cross it? Only if they let love take control.\"",
