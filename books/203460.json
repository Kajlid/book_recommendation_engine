  "title": "Liars For Jesus: The Religious Right's Alternate Version of American History, Vol. 1",
  "description": "Liars for Jesus debunks many of the historical lies invented and used by the Christian nationalist history revisionists in their efforts to further their far right political agenda and destroy the wall of separation between church and state in America. Liars for Jesus is not a book about religion. It is a history book, presenting and fully documenting the true stories and historical facts that are distorted in the \"Christian nation\" pseudo-history promoted by the religious right.",
