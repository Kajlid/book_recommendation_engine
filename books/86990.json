  "description": "A young superhero. A legend reborn. And a whole mess of zombies.Failstate (a.k.a. Robin Laughlin) thought his life would get easier after he'd earned his superhero license. But now a legendary superhero has returned from the dead... along with a horde of shambling horrors who want to eat his brains.New Chayton's other licensed heroes are indisposed, meaning that the whole weight of protecting the city has fallen on Failstate. And nobody thinks he's up to the challenge. At least he has help from his older brother, Gauntlet, and his best friend, Veritas. Or does he?As if the zombie apocalypse weren't enough, complicating things are not one but two beautiful girls vying for Failstate/Robin's affections-and his own powers are doing something... interesting.In the superhero business, interesting is bad.Legends walk the streets of New Chayton. If Failstate can somehow survive the next few weeks, he could become one of them.",
