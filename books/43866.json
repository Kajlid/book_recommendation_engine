  "description": "All future astronomer, Memphis Holland wanted was to quit smoking. The pressure to complete her dissertation on Ophiuchus the lost astrological sign and receive her PhD in Astrophysics has been high. She visits a hypnotherapist to rid her of her cravings and instead is given the ability to see the future and to teleport. To anyone else this would be a wonderful trade, but she doesn’t see it that way. These strange new powers and the fact that there is a serial killer piercing women in their Third Eye chakras and leaving their bodies all over New York City has her highly stressed. Yoga doesn’t help and neither does her new position at Sign of The Times, a New Age newspaper run by her best friend Jill. Her mysterious coworker Lawrence, the reporter covering the murders, puts her even more on edge. He is nothing but kind yet there is just something about him; he has this uncanny ability to know exactly what she’s thinking. Her astrological predictions for the newspaper are well received. But the eerily accurate personal horoscopes that are sent to her by an anonymous astrogirl88 are not. As the secrets and predictions from astrogirl88 unfold Memphis is led down a dangerous path to find out who she really is and the unsettling truth that her destiny may have already been written for her.",
