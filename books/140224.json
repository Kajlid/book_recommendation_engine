  "description": "To: Uncle Ben From: Mia Re: Thanks to you, we have a whole new family! Moving to Chestnut Grove was the best thing to happen to Mom and me. It's so neat that a few months ago Mom didn't know she had a half brother - you! And I can tell she likes Jonah Fraser, this really cool carpenter. I always tell Mom she's got to believe in the power of prayer. But now I have my own special prayer - that mom and Jonah get together to make this the best Christmas ever!",
