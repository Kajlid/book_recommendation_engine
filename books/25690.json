  "description": "I wish I knew why I was born with the mark of a half-moon, but I was abandoned at the edge of a forest as a baby. Leading my forest army into war and fighting for my people is all that matters. I don’t need family and friends because I love my bow and arrow and I certainly don’t have time for relationships or sex.At least, it’s how things used to be. Nothing has been the same ever since the pretty witch, Marwa, chased me until we fought. Now I can’t sleep without thinking about how she kissed me or the embarrassing way she played with my body. And I allowed her to do those things! I should be ashamed of myself, but I can’t stop thinking about her.There’s more. The river and trees are dying and the moon has cracked into two halves. Everyone says the witches are to blame. How can the rift be healed? My people and Marwa’s have been enemies since time began. Is it too late to stop the rot?",
