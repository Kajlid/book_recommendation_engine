  "description": "One accident - a freaking car crash. Thatâ€™s all it took to send my life into a tailspin. Little did I know that out of the wreckage, everything would fall into place. I would get everything I had ever worked for. Little did I know that I would find the woman who would cross check my life, flipping everything upside down. Even though she's melting the ice that surrounds my heart, I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop. Will I ever be able to find my footing or am I destined to stay pinned against the boards?  Note: Cross Checked is the second book in the Shots On Goal Series. It can be read as a standalone, has a happily ever after, and does not have a cliffhanger. There are character crossovers from Hat Trick (book one in the series) which is also a standalone with a HEA and no cliffhanger.",
