  "description": "Nine weeks ago, Selena Perez voluntarily underwent a double mastectomy to save her life. Despite it being her choice (well, kind of), she's now struggling with her body image and her femininity. The last thing that she needs is a man, even if he is dark, dangerous and devastatingly sexy... and will do anything to get her.  Three years ago, Luke Rhodes lost his left hand in Afghanistan. Now, he barely thinks about it as he goes about his daily life as a cook and bartender at Dangerous Curves. After all, he has most everything that he wants... everything except Selena.  The depth and breadth of their passion takes them both by surprise, and Selena surrenders to Luke completely. What she doesn't know is that Luke is hiding something from her. Well, not something - someone. Worse, this someone threatens to destroy all of Selena's belief in the man that she's trusted with her body - and her heart.",
