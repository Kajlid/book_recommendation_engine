  "description": "In this third book of The Antares Codex Series, the “Fourth Reich” activates its plan for world domination. Little did Aidan Carter’s Private Investigation Agency know they would play a large part in it. Duped by the seductress daughter of the “Fuhrer,” Aidan unwillingly passes on vital information aiding in their success. But to accomplish the ploy, the “Fourth Reich” needs one more thing – the DNA of Star Children. They get what they need from Carina, a young girl, and friend of the Carter Family, and Jonathan, her school mate. When they are kidnapped and brought to New Moon City, their DNA is used to create an army of Replicants. As a show of strength, the “Fourth Reich” destroys the Capitol Building in Washington in preparation for the invasion of Earth. When Aidan goes to New Moon City to find Carina and Jonathan, he runs smack into the chaos as the Replicants run roughshod and capture the city. He is powerless to stop the Replicants. The only hope rests with the Star Children. Bob lives in Tucson, Arizona and enjoys writing Fiction and SyFy novels. You can find him online at www.coop1334.wix.com/Bob-Cooper.",
