Slowly we wander home, too tired to play, / Sun-kissed and happy from our lovely day.\" After a day full of excitement, a parent and child mouse head home, knowing that the lullaby moon will shine down on them all through the night. With lyrical text and cuddly pastel illustrations, this is the coziest way to ease into bedtime.",
