  "title": "Castles Burning: A Child's Life in War",
  "description": "This steely account of a childhood on the run, first from the Nazis and then as a refugee in postwar Europe, serves as a fitting memorial to the author, who died in December 1996, shortly before the book was published. Magda Denes settled in America and became a psychoanalyst, which may explain her total lack of sentimentality about her youthful self. The fierce emotions of childhood—exacerbated in this case by the danger she faced as a Jew in fascist Hungary—have seldom been better portrayed.",
