  "description": "As her senior year begins, Jennifer spends six weekends being a fair maiden at the Renaissance Fair in Minnetonka, Minnesota. She finds in her romantic role a welcome escape from family problems. Abandoned by her father and stepfather, terrified of her psychotic brother, and largely ignored by her busy mother, Jennifer is vulnerable. She is both victim and eager participant as an attractive older man, John the lutanist, singles her out with his love songs. They become intensely but briefly involved; but the anticipation of the affair is more fulfilling than the reality. Jennifer quickly learns that John cannot give the security she needs, and, with a friend's help, begins to understand and appreciate the broader aspects of love. Hall sensitively evokes mood and setting while creating an engaging character who makes mistakes as she moves tentatively toward adulthood. The love scenes are discreetly done, leaving much to the imagination. A captivating, thought-provoking romance sure to appeal.Kirkus",
