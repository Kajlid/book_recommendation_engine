  "title": "Dracula: A Symphony in Moonlight and Nightmares",
  "description": "A sparse retelling of the classic Dracula story, with changes to the original story of the sort comparable to a film adaptation. Muth's version of the tale is accompanied by his fantastic watercolor paintings, which at times replace the text altogether and propel the story forward almost like a graphic novel without any word balloons.",
