  "description": "Where there is NO life - there's Hope... Hope has always been a bit of a freak. But when her mother crawls from her grave and her undead corpse goes MIA, Hope's last thread of normal snaps with a vengeance. Enrolling in a militia-style school for monster hunters seems her best bet for tracking down Mommy-dearest and putting what's left of her mother to rest. But the stakes are raised when she's partnered with three unique male recruits - each with their own personal demons to slay if they want to survive basic training. But does Hope have a true killer's instinct? If she finds her mother, will she have the guts to do what must be done to save her soul? In a place like Le Manoir, all bets are off. ___\"What could be creepier than hunting down your own zombie mommy?....A single page in, I was hooked.\" Jacqueline Mitchard, author of What We Lost in the Dark and The Deep End of the Ocean\"Killer's Instinct is going to knock other YA monster-battling books off the shelves.\" Gary Braver, bestselling and award-winning author of Tunnel Vision",
