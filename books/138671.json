  "description": "Everybody knows the Twelve Days of Christmas , and this is Napoleon Dynamite's inimitable take on the beloved traditional carol. Napoleon's version reflects his world, so the customary bells a-ringing and Lords a-leaping, etc., give way to Nessies swimming, quesadillas and, of course, FIVE DE-LIC-IOUS BASS. Anyone familiar with Napoleon will instantly recognize the offbeat humor that made the movie a cult classic. Pretty much the perfect stocking stuffer!Napoleon Dynamite and 2007 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and Paramount Pictures Corporation. All Rights Reserved.",
