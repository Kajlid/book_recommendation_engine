The one of how Rory and I fell in love, supposedly, even if she couldn't handle it in the end. You know how it all went.Or you think you do.You only know her side. But I have my own point of view, and even Rory couldn't know my thoughts in those few months it took for her to go from being a stranger to my whole entire world.Every moment is permanently ingrained in my memory. In my goddamned soul. From the moment I stumbled upon the girl panicking outside of calculus - the one with the tight little body, the angelic face, and the fierce attitude - to the night she abandoned me in Miami. It was the sum of those moments that changed me irrevocably.Our story isn't over. I won't let it be. But this, this is what happened so far, the way I saw it.I'm Cap. Or Sam, to Rory. And this is my story.",
