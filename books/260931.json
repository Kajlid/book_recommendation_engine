  "description": "The Hundred Heartbreaks of Harlan Halifax is set in the cornfields of Trinity, Indiana. The small community is verily owned by the ancient and reclusive Harlan Halifax. In the shadow of the Halifax mansion, lives young Addison Yates.  With his mother recently deceased, and a father who is on the ropes financially, Addison's world consists of his friends and an aging farmhand who now resides at the Yates' home. After an unfortunate lapse in judgment, Addison's path crosses with that of Harlan Halifax. He learns how the other half lives as well as the secrets behind Harlan's desire to remain a shut-in.  Through Harlan, Addison meets a girl from Afghanistan who is a refugee of the war-torn country. Captivated by a pair of brown eyes under a hijab, Addison is thrust on an inward journey that causes the small events in Trinity to take on much larger significance.  In this coming-of-age tale, the desperation of poverty meets the legacy of wealth. Youth clashes with age. Knowledge battles ignorance. Friendships attempt to withstand abuse, prejudice, and loss.  In a world ripping at the seams, Addison learns of love's many forms, while also awakening to the hatred that ignorance can breed.",
