  "description": "For a human race on the cusp of extinction, breeders are the most prized men in the world. One in three thousand are born to the wealth, privilege and status of the position. A life in the lap of luxury, the chance to be anything and do whatever one wants, and all that’s required is to do one’s civic duty and aid in repopulating humanity. Of course, if you’re Rohan Mathews, that’s not going to be easy.As a student of the tower where breeder males are taught, kept and tended to, his greatest concerns are passing his classes, avoiding trouble with security, and of course keeping his secret relationship with best friend Kaden completely secret. After all, what use is a breeder who won’t breed?That ceases to matter when Rohan finds his mother wounded and on the run from security. When he’s handed a small flash drive and told to escape, keeping secrets and passing classes are the least of his troubles. All the while, the Overseer of the tower will stop at nothing to recover Rohan and his mother’s data. Against the Overseer and all her power, all Rohan has is his mind, his silver-tongued friend, and the warnings of his traitorous Get out.Trust no one.Run.",
