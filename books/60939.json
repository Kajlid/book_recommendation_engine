  "description": "Edward Banks, Lord Watson has known most of his life that one day Regina Harris was to be his bride--but somebody forgot to inform her... An avid academic and aspiring scientist, Edward is pleased to find that he won't have to bother with the nonsense involved in courting a young lady. Young and naive, it doesn't take much for her social-climbing father to convince Regina the gentleman she's to marry has requested her hand out of love, but devastates her when she learns the truth. Now, it's up to a gentleman who's more comfortable in a conservatory than a drawing room to prove to Regina that she's more than just the proverbial sacrificial lamb that helped gain her family their foot in Society's door and that he--if no other gentleman--is trustworthy. But he just might be the one doing the learning as he'll be forced to acknowledge that sometimes the most combustible elements aren't the ones you control, but sometimes the ones you don't.",
