  "description": "“Open your eyes birdie. The lion wants to play.” Fear is all Sarah Rosenwal has ever known, and Maximus Castlemaine is everything she fears. Scars from her past have yet to fade when mist of dark lies and darker deception begin to gather around Sarah’s one chance to a new life. And the only path that leads out is through the arms of a Rogue. But where her mind tells her he is far more dangerous a bet, her heart whispers another. Maximus has put countless hearts to fear, but the sight of it in a pair of green eyes pure as virgin jades changes something vital in him. He yearns to be the one to chase her fears away. Burns to see her melt at his fevered touch, his heated kisses. But for his every step forward, she takes two back. As secrets and betrayals rage, Maximus is done waiting for the dice of fate to roll in his favour. He would carve a path through hell to her, but Sarah will be his. Passion and innocence melded against each other are drawn to the brink.And the price of what you wish is often the same as what you want.",
