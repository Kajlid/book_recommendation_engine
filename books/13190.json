  "title": "Operation Blackout",
  "description": "Don't judge a digital short story by its cover. This is the story of what happens to a man that gets downsized after putting 25 years of his life into a company that sends him to the scrap heap. The pain, anguish and at times euphoria of freedom from his emotional bondage are all naked and raw for us the reader. Enjoy the birth of Dribbles the Squirrel and all that he is to become and used to represent.",
