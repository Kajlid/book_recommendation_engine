  "title": "Crazy Salad: Some Things About Women",
  "description": "The classic \"Crazy Salad,\" by screenwriting legend and novelist Nora Ephron, is an extremely funny, deceptively light look at a generation of women (and men) who helped shape the way we live now. In this distinctive, engaging, and simply hilarious view of a period of great upheaval in America, Ephron turns her keen eye and wonderful sense of humor to the media, politics, beauty products, and women's bodies. In the famous \"A Few Words About Breasts,\" for example, she tells us: \"If I had had them, I would have been a completely different person. I honestly believe that.\" Ephron brings her sharp pen to bear on the notable women of the time, and to a series of events ranging from Watergate to the Pillsbury Bake-Off. When it first appeared in 1975, \"Crazy Salad\" helped to illuminate a new American era - and helped us to laugh at our times and ourselves. This new edition will delight a fresh generation of readers.",
