  "title": "Within These woods: a collection of Northwoods nature essays, with original illustrations by the author",
  "description": "With the eye of a biologist and the soul of an artist, Tim Goodwin guides the reader on a personal and educational journey through the Northwoods of the Great Lakes Region. He reflects on the elegance of the evolutionary process and the interconnectedness of all living things. At times a microscopic examination of the forest floor, and at others a far-reaching gaze into the wonders of a night sky. Goodwin explores this enchanted place and the delicate dance its history, geology, and organisms have performed since before recorded time. Along the way, he asks the hard questions about stewardship and spirituality that only connecting to nature and understanding our place in it can begin to answer.",
