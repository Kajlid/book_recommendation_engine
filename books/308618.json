It shouldn’t have happened, but now, all bets are off.A stranger shoved his tongue down my throat. A first! The out-of-place cowboy gave me a taste of my own medicine after I stole a sloppy kiss in a Parisian club. I was out of line. He was unapologetic. My assumed straight orientation didn't erase how my body ignited under his touch.  Months later, we're face-to-face again; well, mouth-to-mouth!I want to hate him. I hate to want him. So much...Troy Hunter presents two options... Not an ultimatum, just his favorite game. This? As in, explore. Or that? As in, move on. Picking one will be a challenge.For now, we can give in to our insane chemistry. We have an expiration date, so it’s better this way. But in the end, what do we really want?
