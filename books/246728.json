  "description": "Author and singer/songwriter Cave's first book, which collects early lyrics from his recordings with The Birthday Party and the Bad Seeds (up to and including the Bad Seeds' record, \"Your Funeral, My Trial\"), short stories and short plays. Cave's dark vision, coupled with his strong connections to primitive folk and blues music, and murder ballads in particular, has yielded an artist whose music rivals the intensity and integrity of Tom Waits and Johnny Cash.",
