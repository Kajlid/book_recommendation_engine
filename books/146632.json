  "title": "Soul Messages: Lavish Love Notes for the Soul",
  "description": "Soul Messages are fifty loving messages from the Universe to you. They are loving reminders that we are greater and more powerful than we have been lead to believe. They challenge us to expand and revise our ideas about how the world really works and counter the limiting beliefs that are at the core of your difficult situations and unhealed life patterns. By working with a Soul Message card daily, weekly or even monthly, you gain a deeper understanding of these core (and often universally held) beliefs and learn practical tips for how to heal them. If you are looking for greater self esteem, fulfillment, confidence and self expression, the Soul Messages will guide you with uncanny wisdom, unfailing gentleness and down-to-earth good humor. Originally designed for use in a workshop setting, the Soul Message cards and book are ideal for personal, group, or therapeutic use and enhance the healing atmosphere of treatment rooms and waiting areas.For readers who love Dr. Wayne Dyer and Louise Hay, Soul Messages is an inspiration oracle deck and book set that will transform their lives by helping to expose and heal outmoded beliefs that are keeping them small and unfulfilled.",
