  "title": "Marilyn Monroe : Private and Undisclosed",
  "description": "This valuable new biography, by the President of the UK fan club, contains the fullest ever collection of primary source material on Marilyn Monroe, covering all stages of her life. It includes over 70 fine-reproduction rare and unpublished photographs. The photographs show Marilyn's real world, the world away from the fans, the studio heads and general public. They reveal a different side of Marilyn from the celluloid invention - relaxing at home, living her everyday life. They include locations from the various stages of her life - the schools she attended as Norma Jeane, the ballroom where she danced with first husband Jim Dougherty; the street where Marilyn claimed she was attacked by an intruder; and candid shots of her on the sets of films. Michelle Morgan has also interviewed every single person accessible who knew or was related to Marilyn in any way, including the main players in her life - family and friends, as well as work colleagues, and more casual acquaintances. More than 50 interviewees are featured, many never put on the record before, including a large number from her orphaned childhood and early years - details of which until now have remained mysterious and patchy. Documentary sources range from the private testimony of her gaenocologist, to the previously undisclosed Laurence Olivier papers relating to Marilyn's time in England. Following a series of sensationalist biographies of the Marilyn Monroe in recent years, this comprehensive, meticulously researched volume brings an important fresh perspective to the many controversies in her life, and will serve as an essential sourcebook of documentary and photographic evidence.",
