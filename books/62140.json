  "description": "Security Forces Lieutenant Maya Lopez is right at home in a war zone: she's been fighting all her life. A hard-won commission in the air force has brought her to Afghanistan, and if she plays her cards right, she could end up with an FBI job. It won't be easy, but that just makes her more determined.Jackson Thatcher is a protector in all senses of the word. A pararescue jumper with Southern-boy charm, he easily captures Maya's interest, but her trust is another story. He's sexy, strong and caring, but she makes it clear she's no damsel in distress. She's never relied on any man, and she's not about to start now.When Maya and Jackson become pawns in a radical warlord's deadly game, they find themselves on the run and must depend on each other if they want to make it out alive.",
