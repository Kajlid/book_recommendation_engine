  "description": "Life has held nothing but pain and guilt for Susannah Walsh since her children died in an accident and her marriage fell apart. When a friend offers her a vacation house in Maine for some relaxation, she thinks it’s the perfect chance to escape from her grim reality—for good.But fate has other plans for Susannah. Shortly after she reaches the retreat, she’s attacked and knocked unconscious, only to wake in the bed of a handsome but unfriendly stranger. As it turns out, her troubles have just begun, for the year is 1905… Adrian Sinclair doesn’t know what to make of the distressed woman he saved from a raging storm. Her speech and clothing are odd, her behavior is very impertinent, and most peculiarly, she claims to be from the future. But when his withdrawn son, Corey, quickly bonds with the woman, he agrees to let her stay at his family’s estate.As Susannah gets to know the Sinclairs, she finds herself passionately attracted to Adrian and powerfully drawn to Corey. Can a woman with no future change her fate in the past? Or will the dangerous secrets lurking at Blue Hill Manor turn deadly?",
