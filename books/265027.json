  "description": "Robert Payne was the creator of Drummer Magazine, a publication that brought gay leather culture to a new level of prominence in the 1970s. This magazine was the first publication to feature Aaron Travis, John Preston, and many other classic writers of leather bdsm erotica. But Robert Payne's fiction has long been out of print. The new Robert Payne Collection will make many of the author's most memorable stories available for the first time in decades.",
