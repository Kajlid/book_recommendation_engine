  "title": "Capitalism for Democrats: Why The Country Needs It Now",
  "description": "In 2020, Democrats will choose a candidate for President, who may or may not be in favor of maintaining the capitalist economic system in the US. Many people do not understand capitalism very well. It has been historically and can in the future be a force for good, promoting economic growth and better living standards. And it can be moral, as well. That good kind of capitalism relies on consumers, through the marketplace, to set prices and allocate resources. In order for consumers to do that, the system needs regulation to protect consumers and competition. And it needs to be accompanied by an adequate safety net for people who do not succeed and government guarantees of fundamental human needs, such as health care. Capitalism for Democrats explains how this good capitalism works, how different it is from some of the capitalism that we have now, and why it is morally superior to systems that rely on elites to set prices and allocate resources. This is a fairly short book that reviewers have said is \"concise\" \"Plain English\" and \"enjoyable.‚Äù Almost all reviewers also have said that Capitalism for Democrats is not just for Democrats--it's for all Americans and for anyone else who wants to see how a good capitalism works.",
