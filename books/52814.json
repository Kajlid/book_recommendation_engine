  "description": "Cartoonist, screenwriter and playwright Jules Feiffer's long out-of-print classic, \"Tantrum\", returns in this Fantagraphic edition, featuring new covers by Feiffer and an introduction by acclaimed Sandman creator Neil Gaiman.The story of suburban disenchantment, \"Tantrum\" is the story of respectable and responsible businessman, Leo Quog, who, in the throes of a mid-life crisis, willfully regresses to the age of two. Having been two before, Leo demands his rights as a toddler: cuddling, cooing, tummy rubbing, and, most importantly, piggyback rides. In Leo's case, youth is definitely not wasted on the young. Feiffer has the uncanny ability to capture the frustrations of everyday life, while showing the lengths we'll go to escape from it.",
