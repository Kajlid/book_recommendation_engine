  "description": "[Siren Everlasting Classic Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, vampires, shape-shifters, HEA] Dudley has been taught that shifters are savage beasts that will sooner tear out a vampire's throat than mate them. He was also taught that shifters would rather let vampires starve than feed them. When he discovers his father has lied to him his whole life, Dudley starts chasing after his mate. Sloane Brac has been very patient with Dudley, coaxing the vampire gently into their mating—until Dudley calls a hit down on his head. He feels he can never forgive the man, but then Dudley shows up at his newly purchased home in a panic. Sloane forgives his vampire and tries to start a new life with him, but Dudley's brothers show up to finish what they started…or so he thinks. Can Sloane convince Dudley that their mating is something sacred to him, or will Dudley run in the other direction when his father comes to exact his revenge against the wolf for claiming his son? Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection focuses on a different romantic couple. To enjoy the overall story arc and crossover characters, we recommend reading the series in sequential order. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
