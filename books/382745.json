  "title": "Synchronicity: The Bridge Between Matter and Mind",
  "description": "As physicists search for a unified field theory, so Carl Jung and others searched for synchronicityâ€”the unifying principle behind meaningful coincidence, individual consciousness and the totality of space and time. Now, F. Peat joins these two quests into one intriguing journey to show the connection between quantum theory and synchronicity, and to open the way to an exciting new understanding about the bridge between matter and mind.In exploring the nature of energy, time, chance, causality and coincidence, Peat draws on the works of Jung, Wolfgang Pauli, Ilya Prigogine, David Bohm, John Wheeler and others. What emerges is evidence of a hidden order, of a creative universe that expresses itself in individual lives.With fascinating historical anecdotes and incisive scientific analysis, this important work combines ancient thought with modern theory to reveal a new way of viewing our universe that can expand our awareness, our lives, and may well point the way to a new science for the twenty-first century.",
