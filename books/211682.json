  "description": "\"I do not want ten million dollars. I do not want to visit Ireland. I do not want to end a Tobin family feud. And, above all, I do not want to court my eighth cousin, once removed.\" Even as he says the words, \"Toby\" Tobin, Irish-American computer hacker, knows it's useless to resist. His late great-uncle's will must be obeyed, and his family is determined to make him respectable by his twenty-fifth birthday. Encouraged by a photo of his cousin, Sara Anne Elizabeth Tobin, with her gorgeous black hair, blue eyes, and pale skin, Toby checks his computer for travel arrangements to Ireland. He finds himself chatting with an unusual travel agent, Raphaella, a very modern angel, who's been surfing the net for someone to look after. Raphaella gives him a new passport and first-class plane tickets out of O'Hare, and the encouragement and good humor he'll need on his quest for a living grail--the beautiful, mysterious, troubled, young Sara Tobin. He must marry Sara within the month (and solve an ancient mystery and elude a threatening thug) in order to claim his inheritance. Angel Light is based on the Book of Tobis in the Old Testament, one of the sweetest love stories ever told.",
