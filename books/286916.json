  "title": "\"The Woman Who Forgot Her Agenda\"",
  "description": "Ana Sanderson had settled into a comfortable suburban life, raising her daughters and taking care of her husband. Then the unthinkable happens and her husband runs off with another woman leaving her penniless. Ana's world comes crashing down as she contemplates her future as a single middle-aged mother who has been out of work for two decades. We follow Ana as she struggles to adapt to her new situation and make sense of the path that led her to a life that seems empty and without meaning. As she struggles to regain her youth, Ana realises that she has forgotten who she used to be, and she sets out to fulfil her agenda. Like a butterfly, Ana comes out of her cocoon and discovers her purpose, one that is separate from her roles as a mother, wife, and dutiful employee. Through painful experiences and failed undertakings, Ana finally understands and celebrates her beautiful life in what is a story of personal growth from youth to middle age.",
