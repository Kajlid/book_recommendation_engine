  "description": "Juvenile (mid-grade) novel. Maree Webster is an 'almost-emo' from the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia. She hates school and only has a few friends. She has an infatuation with Angels and Fallen Angel stories. Life was boring until she one day decided to steal a famous painting of angels from a small art gallery.Her life will never be boring again. She meets a stranger at the gallery who seems to know her. She stumbles into a world where cities float in the sky, and daemons roam the barren, magma-spewing crags of the land below. But not all is well. Maree is turning into something she loves but at the same time, fears. Most fearful of all is the prospect of losing her identity, what makes her Maree, and more importantly, human. She has ties to the human world that she can't bear to sever.Guardian of the Sky Realms takes the reader on a journey through exotic fantasy lands, but also across the globe, from Sydney to Paris, and the Himalayas to Manhattan. It is about transformation.Painting component of cover: artist, Penina Gal.",
