  "description": "With her remarkable flair for storytelling, Leslie LaFoy is back with another irresistible romance, as a spirited cowgirl with a sure aim is hurtled back through time into passion and peril....Riding hard against a Kansas prairie storm, rancher Glynis Muldoon makes a sudden leap--and lands in the year 1832 in the forest hideaway of a rogue Irishman with a bounty on his head. Stranded in time, Glynis wages her own battle against a hunger she cannot deny for a man she cannot afford to love, a man whose destiny was decided long before. Carrick des Marceaux, \"the Dragon,\" is an outlaw indifferent to death--for, in the ruby of the Dragon's Heart, he has foreseen his own. Now, in the shadow of the hangman's noose, Carrick lives only for his cause. And Glynis must gamble with fate and death itself--to win a once-in-a-lifetime love.",
