  "description": "When Black voices are stifled, the reality is transformed into fiction, history is twisted into folklore, and heroes are turned into myths. Harriet Beecher Stowe published Uncle Tom's Cabin, holding a brief account of Eliza Harris, in 1853. Now, 170 years later, learn the actual tale of Eliza's harrowing escape from slavery and her unwavering bravery to live a life of freedom. Eliza risked everything to cross the semi-frozen Ohio River in the dead of night and save her baby from a slave's life.Indomitable is a work of historical fiction based on real events and Eliza's firsthand narrative. While one branch of the author's family owned Eliza, the other branch risked their lives to rescue her. We cannot undo the past, but we can recount the tales of those who fought for liberty and assure that their sacrifice was not in vain.",
