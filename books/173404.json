  "description": "Todd Camford went from Marine sniper to owning a beachfront surf shop in Florida, and he couldn’t be happier. Unfortunately, the programming from his training hasn't quite been eliminated. His ex called him an unfeeling cyborg, but he's a free-flying, unfettered hawk, damn it. Relationships are out of the question... And then she comes into his shop. Everyone knows who Abigail Kelly is—mega rockstar, tabloid fixture. Still, nothing prepares Todd for Abby's smoky gray eyes or the swift breathlessness of their instant chemistry. He'd be an ass (or possibly insane) to think he can resist her. Just for today, maybe he'll keep an eye on her to make sure she doesn't get mobbed. Because really, how much damage could one day with a super-hot, kick-ass celebrity really do?",
