  "description": "Survival show star Foxxe Wylder thinks his season ending show in Yellowstone may be as stale as his career, and he's ready for a break prowling the urban jungles back home. He didn't plan to hit a coyote on the road, nor that the charming little canine would turn his world upside down.Reno never wanted pack life, and the idea of finding a mate and raising a litter of pups isn't on his wish list. Neither is being hit by Foxxe's SUV. Then, Foxxe's producer gets an idea -- Foxxe will release the cutest coyote on TV back into the wild, now that the vet has taken care of him. However, one stubborn coyote has ideas of his own.",
