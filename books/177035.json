  "description": "Gia Falconetti was taken by the Tyranns in the first wave of invasions on Earth, and sent to the holding cells. But she was lucky. She got away from the men who had taken her as their sex slave. When the opportunity comes to work in the Ministry on Sera, writing down her experiences for the people of both Sera and Addo, she jumps at the chance to help others understand what is truly happening on Voyeur Moon. Addonian warriors Thane and Rune have come to work in the same department as consultants. They fall hard for Gia, but she has demons that might prove too much for the men to help her overcome. When Thane and Rune go along on the mission to rid Voyeur Moon of the Tyranns forever, their most fervent wish is to return to Gia, the woman they have grown to love.",
