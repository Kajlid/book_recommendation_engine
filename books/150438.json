  "description": "They say opposites attract but in the case of a preacher and a man of science, things get downright incendiary. Mark (Pappy) Rafferty is an ex priest recently moved to Apishipa Creek to start his own church in the beauty of the Rockies. Nathan Lee is the smooth talking Atheist doctor of the town’s clinic. They start jogging together every morning for safety but their hearts become in peril from one another.Dayton Binx is a submissive actively searching for a Dom. Travis Walton feels a kinship to the younger man because of their similar backgrounds but soon passes the pain in the neck off to Pappy. Pappy, who believes nothing can come of the overwhelming attraction he feels for the doctor, takes the sub on and begins to fall in love with him. A slip of long awaited passion between he and Nathan threatens to tear Pappy’s sub from him, but never underestimate a sub on a mission! With more intrigue, suspense and hot action between sexy men, Apishipa Creek heats up once again as three men find an uncommon bond while two others are ripped apart because of stubborn pride. Can everyone live happily ever after or will those wishing revenge complete what they started and kill those who get in their way?",
