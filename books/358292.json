  "description": "Nathan's Run will touch the heart of anyone who's ever reached out for a helping hand, battled against impossible odds, or searched for a sign that they, too, matter. Beginning with a savage killing at a suburban Virginia juvenile detention center, Nathan's Run hurtles 12-year-old Nathan Bailey through a terrifying gauntlet. Accused of murder and branded a cop killer, Nathan becomes the target of a nationwide manhunt even as a vicious hit man is closing in on him. Orphaned and alone, Nathan has nowhere to turn for help. To stay alive he can count only on himself: on his agility, natural cleverness and honesty. Ironically, the latter proves a formidable weapon as the boy endears himself to a national radios talk show host and, along the way, pleads his case to a rapt nation. Still, \"justice\" will not be denied, and as an army of police and a dogged contract killer draw closer, Nathan is tested to the very limits of his endurance.",
