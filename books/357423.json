  "description": "Locked away from life in her tower prison, Adriana Bordeaux can only dream of finding the love she so desperately yearns for. Desolate in her loneliness, she offers up a plea to Morpheus, Guardian of Dreams--for legend holds that a maiden who is pure of heart may summon the Lord of the Night and he must grant her heart's desire. Astride his fiery night mare, Despair, Morpheus comes, as he must, but it his wrath Adriana has called down upon herself. For the Lord of the Night is not pleased that he is compelled to answer the summons of a mere mortal. Into her dreams he steals with punishing kisses and rough caresses, only to find himself as surely caught in the web of passion that he has woven as Adriana--the mortal woman destined to steal his heart--and his life. Rating: Contains graphic explicit sex and language.",
