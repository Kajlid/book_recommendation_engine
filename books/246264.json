  "title": "A Flicker Of Shadows",
  "description": "In 1890, a remote mountain castle in eastern Europe is host to two conflicting realities. In one reality, a Police Inspector and a lunatic approach a crime scene from opposing ends. In the other, a bat has succumbed to delusions of grandeur and plans a life beyond the bounds of his supernatural world. When the bat claims the abandoned mountain castle for himself, he sets the two realities onto a collision course. Within that impact, a creature is forged and unleashed upon the mountain communities. Not only are lives at risk, but so too is the light of childhood innocence within the minds of the Inspector (Murnau), the Lunatic (Onno) and the Bat (Morton). Their understanding of reality will be irrevocably corrupted among the flickering shadows cast by the castle creature.Told in the epistolary format of letters, journal entries and interview transcripts, A Flicker Of Shadows is a psychological mystery with a slow burn. It is written to appeal to New Adult and Adult audiences by purposely mashing what appears to be a childrenâ€™s story with an adult tale of folklore monsters and classic horror beats. But, do not let that fool you. This is not a story for children; it is a tragic story for adults that once were.For more information, please www.mnseeley.ca",
