  "description": "SHOCK AND AWEMischief is on the wing and perhaps deliverance for a flock of San Francisco, fringe-dwelling creatives. A precocious and rebellious African grey parrot lands on the shoulder of an elephant whisperer and begins to spout about the Bush White House and Saddam Hussein, soon provoking a madcap, desperate blackmail attempt. \"A beautiful story that evokes radical Berkeley, the magic of the Sacramento estuary, and life among a memorable family of performers in San Francisco's North Beach.\" -- Phil Aaberg, award-winning composer and musician\"A riveting story about America that harkens back to the rise and fall of Vedic Civilization. It relates the story of the weightless Hamsa Swans, the baffling disappearance of the Sarasvati River—and most beautifully—the role of elephants as guardians of the Floodplain of Natural Wonder.\" -- Satish Kumar, Resurgence Editor\"So rich with the details of elephant consciousness and why we must do everything in our power to stop their abuse.\" -- Katherine Connor, Founder, Boon Lott's Elephant Sanctuary\"An abomination. The bird must be silenced.\" -- Richard Nixon (as channeled by Nixon actor, Darrell Duffey)\"SADDAM'S PARROT looks deep into the soul of animals, helping us realize our great mission to protect them. What a beautiful, lyrical story.\" -- Dagy Galliethner-Steiner, equine artistFollow Alex's squawks @SaddamsParrot",
