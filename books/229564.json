  "description": "Sixteen-year-old Zephyr's world was turned upside down when her father was drafted into the Confederacy in April 1862. Paralyzed by hysteria and violent mood swings, she’s learned that her worst enemy isn't the Union army or even the Rebel recruiters who took her father. It's herself. When a band of Union cow rustlers charge Zephyr's home in rural northern Florida, threatening to take more than just her cattle, her worst fears become reality. Meanwhile, surrounded by soldiers who desperately need hope in their lives, Ezra Darson, Zephyr’s uncle, is bound by pressure to defend his homeland in a way he doesn’t agree with. When the Army of the Tennessee faces one of their worst defeats during the Battle of Missionary Ridge, he must choose how far he is willing to go for his beliefs. Two people face difficult decisions, in a time when everyone seems to be an adversary. While one must try to find the peace he desires while facing a dangerous enemy in the field, the other must face the relentless enemy within.",
