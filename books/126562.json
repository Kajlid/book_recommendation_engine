  "description": "He just might take being a bad boy a little too far.Eloise Mason keeps everything arranged to her exacting standards. A stable job, a non-existent dating life, and a perfectly maintained home in just the right neighborhood. Nothing unexpected ever happens and that’s how she likes it. Ethan Callaghan moves in next door and destroys her vision. Late-night parties, roaring motorcycle engines, and charming smiles were nowhere on her schedule, and she isn’t in a hurry to forgive him when he causes a scene in front of the neighbors. She hates him until his persistent interest begins to win her over, but when someone close to her is murdered, it becomes apparent that her softening heart is more of a threat than she realized. As the stakes rise and the killer closes in, Eloise will have to decide if trusting Ethan will save her life or be a death sentence.",
