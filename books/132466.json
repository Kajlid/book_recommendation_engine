  "title": "God's Equation: Einstein, Relativity, and the Expanding Universe",
  "description": "Are we on the verge of solving the riddle of creation using Einstein's \"greatest blunder\"?In a work that is at once lucid, exhilarating and profound, renowned mathematician Dr. Amir Aczel, critically acclaimed author of Fermat's Last Theorem , takes us into the heart of science's greatest mystery.In January 1998, astronomers found evidence that the cosmos is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. The way we perceive the universe was changed forever. The most compelling theory cosmologists could find to explain this phenomenon was Einstein's cosmological constant, a theory he conceived--and rejected---over eighty years ago.Drawing on newly discovered letters of Einstein--many translated here for the first time--years of research, and interviews with prominent mathematicians, cosmologists, physicists, and astronomers, Aczel takes us on a fascinating journey into \"the strange geometry of space-time,\" and into the mind of a genius. Here the unthinkable becomes an infinite, ever-expanding, ever-accelerating universe whose only absolute is the speed of light.Awesome in scope, thrilling in detail, God's Equation is storytelling at its finest.",
