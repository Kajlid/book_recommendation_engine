  "description": "Falling for my parents' worst nightmare . . .My mom's getting remarried (again). Bad enough, right? Nope. She insists on finding me a suitable date to her la-di-da wedding. Why? Because my obnoxious stepsister-to-be is bringing her teen model/rock star boyfriend. Like I care. Okay, I do, a little. But I've found my own escort, thank you very much. Someone totally inappropriate. Someone who'll mortify them! Someone I'm not supposed to like this much. . . .",
