He’s so horrible he considers faking an injury to take himself out of the game.Jack is a quick-witted, comic book loving gentleman—not an athlete. DO NOT DATE YOUR ROOMMATES CRUSH.When her roommate brings home a random stranger, Eliza is shocked when he makes himself at home; he’s strapping, strong and watching a movie at the end of her couch as if he belongs there.It makes her uncomfortable in the best way possible. But if there is one thing she believes in, it’s GIRL CODE: No girl may date her friend's ex, past crush, or guys who have humiliated/used her. And she most certainly may not date any guy her friend currently fancies... DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK. Jack and Eliza are two of the good ones—it’s going to take a miracle to keep them apart.",
