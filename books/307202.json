  "title": "Unreported Truths About Covid-19 and Lockdowns: Part 3: Masks",
  "description": "Former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson offers the third installment in the best-selling series that offers an honest counterpart to credulous media coverage about the risks of the coronavirus and ways to stop it. Unreported Truths Part 1 focused on the way we count deaths from COVID-19. Part 2 explained lockdowns. But Part 3 covers a topic even more central to our lives every day - the evidence that masks do or do not work to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. For months, public health experts have proclaimed, \"My mask protects you, while yours protects me.\" Governments all over the world now make people wear face coverings in public. But the proof that masks do any good is far weaker than almost anyone understands. Like Parts 1 and 2, this section draws on primary sources like Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization reports, along with news articles, government documents, and scientific papers. It will give you a new perspective on whether masks work - and the truthful and accurate information you need as the debate over mask requirements rages on. Please This booklet contains only the third section of Unreported Truths. Parts 1 and 2 are available separately.",
