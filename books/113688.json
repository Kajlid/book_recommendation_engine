Not just dumped, but dumped on his head. The resulting injuries have, somehow, opened the door to the here-after. Dead people, Blake believes, are talking to him. Are the victim's really begging the last gumshoe for help from the other side of the grave? Is he hallucinating? Or has he lost his friggin' mind?
