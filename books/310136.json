  "title": "Shortbread: Glasgow Tales",
  "description": "Shortbread is a biscuit made with plain floor, butter and sugar, originating in Scotland. Tasty bitesize chunks of enjoyment, just like the stories in this ebook, bitesize, that is. Among the tasty delights within are:Fearless Francis - Francis a wee boy living in a tenement in Glasgow in the 1950s. Children didn't know they were poor in those days, they just got on with it and made do with what little they had. Often they just used their imagination, just like Francis, with his head full of nonsense creating his imaginary adventures, usually ending up getting himself into trouble.The remaining stories are about visiting places of historical interest, only to be sent back in time to witness events unfolding in front of me. Did I really wake up kneeling in a puddle on the Bridge of Sighs? Or did I nearly get run over by a tramcar recently, considering that the trams stopped operating in 1962? How about being hit over the head and then getting chucked out of a cathedral for snoring?Some of these stories contain historical facts, embelished somewhat by my own imagination, so I have provided external links that are devoid of fantasy, where appropriate.So, make a cup of tea, get out the shortbread fingers from the Scotty Dog tin and while away a wee hour reading this ebook.",
