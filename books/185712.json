  "description": "Werewolves don't exist, Cade Forrest is straight, and Kyle Bennet doesn't do random hook-ups. These are the facts as Kyle knows them. When Cade, Kyle's old high school crush, struts up to him in the gym - with his big muscles, cocky attitude and a bulge in his shorts that verges on the obscene - the facts as Kyle knows them just might have to be reconsidered... Cade has known that Kyle is his mate since they were in high school, back when he was in the closet and his reputation meant more to him than making his wolf happy. Now he's both older and wiser, and when he unexpectedly runs into his mate at the gym - weeks before he'd intended to make his move - his wolf takes over and demands that he finally lay claim to what is his... (This is the complete version of the Alpha's Human Serial It features a cute accountant and a dominant alpha werewolf who wants nothing more than to claim, love and cherish him forever.)",
