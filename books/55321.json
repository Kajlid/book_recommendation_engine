  "description": "The first playwright of democracy, Euripides wrote with enduring insight and biting satire about social and political problems of Athenian life.  In contrast to his contemporaries, he brought an exciting--and, to the Greeks, a stunning--realism to the \"pure and noble form\" of tragedy.  For the first time in history, heroes and heroines on the stage were not   as Sophocles himself said, Euripides shows people not as they ought to be, but as they actually are.",
