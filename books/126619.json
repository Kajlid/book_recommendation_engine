  "description": "Anna Mandretta is a young woman on a submarine-like vessel submerged in the waters of an alien moon. By night, she enters a mandatory lucid-dream that causes her to take on the life of an alternate reality, in which she is an acclaimed surgeon at the Miskatonik University Hospital. Unable to save the life of an infant afflicted with a hideous, hissing tumor, she is assaulted by the boy’s parents, who claim he will be reborn to eternal life to rule the world in the name of an ancient deity, Azag-thoth. This gothic space fantasy follows Anna as she shifts between her horrific reality as a medic on the front lines of a war against the mysterious Xax and the supernatural life she leads in the recurring dream that draws closer to becoming her waking world. The multilayered graphic novel—in which the true meaning of the events seems constantly just beyond the reader’s grasp—bridges horror comics with a blend of military sexism, mind control, political commentary, and quantum string theory.",
