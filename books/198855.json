  "description": "Southern Zombies Three Book Box Set. Featuring A Story of Survival, Southern Hospitality and Southern Blood.  The world we live in now is one where you have to fight or die. There are no exceptions. Sometimes, fighting against the people who want to take what you have is harder than dealing with the walkers. The world may never be the same again. Iâ€™m thinking it won't. How could it be? We have lost 75% or more of the human population. Since there are no communications, that number doesn't even include the whole world. No one knows how it is in other countries. We have always said the government was incompetent, well they finally proved it with the zombie outbreak.",
