Jax doesn't stop until he gets what he wants.  Seems like a match made in heaven. Until an unexpected development—of the 'call me Professor Cook' variety—makes their attraction-and what they did last Saturday night-a lot more forbidden.  Now, committing a work violation has become a forgone conclusion and the chase just became a lot more complicated.   Lucky for Ronnie, Jax loves breaking the rules. Lucky for Jax, Ronnie does too.***Work Violation is a full-length, friends to lovers, professor/adult student, house flipping romantic comedy that can be read as a complete standalone and is book 2 in the Cook Brothers series.",
