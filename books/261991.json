  "description": "“I was in free fall the moment we met, and I just keep falling.” Small town police officer Silas Sloane knows every resident of O’Leary, New York. He’s earned the love and respect of its citizens, though living under the small-town microscope grates on him. But though he’s good at his job, there’s one thing he’s not good at: commitments. Until Everett. Widower Everett Maior, O’Leary’s newest citizen, came to the small town kicking and screaming. He never wanted to become primary caretaker for his grandfather, and has no interest in living a provincial life. Snarky and superstitious, he’s proficient at keeping people at a distance... Until he lays eyes Silas Sloane. Strange occurrences are plaguing O’Leary, but even as danger looms, Silas and Everett find their growing attraction undeniable. Can they remain safe…and together…despite everything that threatens to tear them apart?",
