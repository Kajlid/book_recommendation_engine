  "description": "IN A SACRED PLACE, UNHOLY PASSIONS LEAD TO MURDER....Sunlight shone on the dark crimson blood, making it shine like a jewel....thus the body of Gunnora, a young nun from Hawkenlye Abbey, is found with her throat cut. Felons have been released from English prisons at the command of the new king, Richard Plantagenet, and suspicion centers on them. But when Josse d'Acquin, the king's knight, arrives from France to investigate, he discovers treacherous currents of lust, greed, and anger flowing closer to the Abbey, and in the haunted Weald of Kent, whose woods hide strange secrets....With the help of the worldly, beautiful Abbess Helewise, Josse ferrets out an array of suspects. Their one precious piece of evidence is a gold, rubied cross. But the shocking truth of Gunnora's death is an elusive-and far more dangerous-prize.AUTHORBIO: ALYS CLARE lives in Tonbridge, England, in the area where Fortune Like The Moon is set. This is the first in a series of medieval mysteries set in the Weald of Kent.",
