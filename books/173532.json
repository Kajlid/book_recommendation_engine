  "description": "In his first anthology of short stories, Keith Anderson uses his creative, inventive and wonderfully descriptive writing style to explore territories and fantasies not for the timid. With six short stories like 'The Game', 'Downhill From Here' and 'All You Ever Wanted', plus a special sneak preview of the first chapter from his upcoming novel, â€œKinky in Flatland', Keith wades into the hot waters of BDSM, spanking and erotic romance. An anthology that's sure to please and yet leave you wanting more, 'Pretty When You Cry' will be sure to excite your passions and perhaps give you a few new things to think about when you go into the hardware section of Wal-Mart. Just sayin'.  Warning : This book contains spanking, sex and BDSM elements. If you object to any of these things, please do not buy this book.",
