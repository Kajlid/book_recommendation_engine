  "description": "The past fifteen years have not been kind to Celebre, the greatest city on Dodec. Its security was threatened and its Doge humiliated by the evil Bloodlord Stralg Hragson. The Doge's children were kidnapped and taken over the Edge to Vigaelia. And if you think Stralg is bad, wait until you meet his sister Saltaja, a fanatic who sees no human cost as too great to keep her family in power and her goddess, the Mother of Lies, appeased. But there are a few great hopes for the future of the city. The Mutineer, Marno Cavotti, who will not stand to see his hometown destroyed, is massing a powerful liberation movement inches beyond Stralg's grasp. And the four heirs of Celebre are wending their way back over the Edge to their birthplace. Of course, even as Marno and the Celebre children work towards the common goal of defeating the Hrags, they're all painfully aware that, once that hurdle is crossed, only one of them can wind up on Celebre's throne. Continuing the storyline begun in Children of Chaos , Mother of Lies is a fierce, kinetic romp that will keep readers guessing until the last blow is dealt.",
