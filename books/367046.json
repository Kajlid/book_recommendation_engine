  "description": "Rupert Carsington, fourth son of the Earl of Hargate, is his aristocratic family's favourite disaster. He is irresistibly handsome and irretrievably irresponsible. Wherever he goes, trouble follows. Still, Rupert's never met an entanglement - emotional or other - he couldn't escape.Only now he's a prisoner in Cairo's most infamous prison, and his only way out is accepting a beautiful widow's dangerous proposal. Scholar Daphne Pembroke wants him to rescue her brother, who's been kidnapped by a rival seeking a fabled treasure. Their partnership is strictly business: she'll provide the brains; he, the brawn. Simple enough in theory.But as tensions flare and inhibitions melt in the blazing desert heat, the most disciplined of women and the most reckless of men are about to clash in the most impossibly irresistible way.",
