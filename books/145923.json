  "description": "In the past few years Kaye Park Hinckley has emerged as a major talent in what Paul Elie calls, \"the literature of belief.\" Hinckley translates grace in a world on edge, sees a double beginning and ending in everything, literally everything, including the unspeakably awful. Like her novel, A Hunger in the Heart, the stories in Birds of a Feather--several of which have won substantive awards--take us to the heart of the matter.",
