  "description": "MP3 CD Format Join a courageous group of teens as they make their way in a post-apocalyptic adventure story of survival after an EMP has virtually shut down modern technology across North America.Setting out on foot with nothing more than some soon-to-be worthless cash and a little advice from a trusted teacher, Alex, Quinn, Josh, Cooper, and Dara walk through a burning city that has come to a halt. The devastation they see as they make their way out of the city is a small part of the horror that the nation will become. As the days go by with no food deliveries and no water flowing from taps, civilization will start to crumble and it will be survival of the fittest. With 1500 miles to cross they will need to plan well, count on each other, and pray for a little luck. Even with that, chances are slim of getting home when you are stranded.",
