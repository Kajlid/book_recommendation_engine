  "description": "MateoI kept my distance from people, living alone, being celibate. And that made me content, happy. I was known as the Bogeyman in Thickwood, Colorado, and I was fine with that title if it meant I wasn’t bothered. But then I saw her. And at that moment, I knew I had to have her. Curvy and thick, young and innocent, Charlotte was everything I didn’t know I wanted in life. I was instantly obsessed. Something changed in me in that moment, this need, possession, territorial desire that claimed me until I knew it wouldn’t go away until she was mine. So that’s what I’d do. I’d make her mine. I’d show Charlotte that she was meant to be claimed by me. And if I had to throw her over my shoulder like a caveman and take her back to my isolated cabin to prove that, I’d do it without shame or guilt. I’d do it with pleasure. And by the time I’m done with her, Charlotte would know the lengths I’d go to keep her, not only in my life as my woman but also in my bed… sated.",
