  "description": "Cynthia Heimel has been described by the Chicago Tribune as \"perhaps our funniest war correspondent on the war between the sexes\"; her wisdom on dating includes such gems as: \"My new rule is to never believe a person is interested until you feel his tongue down your throat.\" If You Can't Live Without Me, Why Aren't You Dead Yet?! shows Heimel at her wicked best. When sex pales in comparison to watching sports, when ostensibly adult men still don't understand why women need to work, when city-chic black and arugula salads have been taken over by Middle America, Cynthia Heimel is there to remind us that if we can't remake the world (or even the loved ones who are driving us crazy), we can at least laugh at it. Like a hip Erma Bombeck or a Dorothy Parker for today, she is an antidote to an absurd world for smart, sane women. If You Can't Live Without Me, Why Aren't You Dead Yet?! -- now a national best-seller -- has caused The Boston Globe to hail Cynthia Hiemel as \"a goddess and a role model.\" \"Brilliant, ballsy ... wise and loving ... She makes me feel militantly on my own side. What pleasure; what relief.\" -- Mademoiselle",
