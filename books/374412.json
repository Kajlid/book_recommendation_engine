  "description": "Meet Bridget, a klutzy, desperate to publish writer postponing her return to academia. Find Kelsey strumming her guitar through marital calamity and trying not to botch her responsibilities as a working mom. Add Dani, their broodingly analytic, art loving friend, and join them for a Mother's Retreat on Martha's Vineyard, that splendid island off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Once there, discover the stolen painting of the handsome artist you've just had the pleasure of meeting in a stirring sculpture garden. Now what would you do if that stolen painting became the urgently sought treasure to all the islanders because there became an enticing fiscal reward? The tourists mingle with the residents and, with an intimate look at the Vineyard's infirm but passionate heart, the reader becomes acquainted with a new point of view and subsequently a new suspect for each remaining chapter. Homeless Hal calls out to mend our wounded earth. Holden Gould is the poet paying tribute to our transcendentalist forbearers who wakes to the summoning of his tragic past His petulant landlord and sculptor will have you only ever wanting to live in the moment. Yet a salacious reporter will reveal how global appeal confronts an island's quandary during a community arts festival, replete with the frenetic horns of a ska surge of reworked classics. This is one party you won't want to miss!",
