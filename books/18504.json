  "title": "The Superiors",
  "description": "Two hundred years after a stronger, faster, nearly invincible race takes over the earth, the Superiors rule humanity with scorn and an iron fist—or iron fangs. Though Superiors raise humans simply as livestock to sate their hunger and sustain their immortal lives, Draven Castle, a discontented, lower-class Superior, will never have the funds to purchase his own human. One night Draven captures Cali, a human runaway, and defies society’s strict laws by feeding on her. The continuing consequences of his one small criminal act forever alter the course of his mundane life. Draven returns Cali, but she has already ensnared his interest. He tries to protect her but finds himself helpless to stop other vampires from feeding on her. He vows to purchase her no matter the cost. Soon he begins to take more and more risks to ensure her safety and gain possession of her. But will he risk everything, even his life, for a chance to own one human girl?",
