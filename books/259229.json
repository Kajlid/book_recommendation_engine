  "title": "At Death Do Us Part: A Grieving Widower Heals After Losing his Wife to Breast Cancer",
  "description": "After your spouse dies, how do you go forward?This beautifully-written memoir faces the realities of a loved one dying.Following a long fight with breast cancer, Tracy's death ended their 13-year marriage. In the months after his loss, Frederick Marx wrote about their time together (falling in love, their shortcomings, her illness, and how they made each other better). Marx recounts his relationship with his partner--not as a saint, but as a person. Then he describes his struggle to go on without her. Marx shares an intimate, soul-searching look at love and loss. With exquisite honesty, his story is inevitably full of pain, but also has great warmth and beauty.Ram Dass, author of Be Here Now, said: \"This book shivers with the frailties of what it means to be human, enfolding loss in all its forms, finding a way through acceptance back to love.\"",
