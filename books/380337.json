  "title": "Journey to Jo'Burg : A South African Story",
  "description": "This is the story of love, commitment and the flowering of the human spirit against the background of South Africa's apartheid. Frightened that their baby sister Dineo will die, thirteen-year-old Naledi and her younger brother Tiro run away from their grandmother to Johannesburg to find their mother, who works there as a maid. Their journey illustrates at every turn the grim realities of apartheid -- the pass laws, bantustans, racism, the breakdown of family life. The opulence of the white \"Madam's\" house contrasts starkly with the reality that Naledi and Tiro face -- that their baby sister is suffering from starvation, not an incurable disease.",
