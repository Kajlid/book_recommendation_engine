  "description": "She needs to escape.  AMBER  His assistant hired me on a whim, thinking I would be just what he needed. Boy, was she right. I bounced into his dressing room and discovered the famous actor held dual personalities – a nasty player and the naughty gentleman.  I won’t say which one I fell in love with but when I least expected it, the bastard broke my heart. Now, fifteen years later, the last man to break me is the only one who can save me.  His heart takes her captive.  DALE  After an intense twelve-week love affair, I lost the only girl I ever loved—all to save her—to keep her safe. What she doesn’t know is I’ve been watching her every move, guarding her from a dangerous world she knows nothing about.   Keeping secrets for so long with only a promise, the wall I built around her crumbles to the ground. In the ruins, the only question that remains is… Will she still answer to me?  Ride or die in the love affair of Mae East & Cyclone Blonde.  *INCLUDES BONUS SCENES*",
