They’re moving across the country.It gets worse: They’re going to be moving in with her mom’s new “employer” Bryant and his two teenage sons.And worst of all: Harlow is being sent to a private academy for the rest of high school.As if moving to a different state on short notice wasn’t bad enough, Bryant’s two sons and their chaotic friend group cause a world of trouble for Harlow.
