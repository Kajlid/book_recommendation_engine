  "description": "noun, Tradescantia. The people's radiation monitor; fifty times more sensitive than a dosimeter. Chuckle with nostalgia and outrage as you relive the Sixties. From Woodstock to Three Mile Island, this book is fast becoming a Ã§ult classic' During the construction phase of Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant, an angry Viet Nam veteran and a stoned hippie are paired together in the work force, and a jack Amishman weighs the potential benefits of technology against his love for the land. The fury of hurricane Agnes, charged by an added dose of surrealism, LSD style, becomes a catalyst to expose the bigger-than-life nemesis of the nuclear peril. This is a horror novel. The monster is frighteningly real. The zero tolerance necessary to achieve nuclear power combined with man's unlimited capacity for error make for a reading thrill that will captivate all. \"Bravo! A Book that should have been written\" - C.R.O.W. Magazine",
