  "description": "It's been sixty years since the last Omega died. Pack alliances have crumbled and rogue wolves are at an all time high.  Robert, an outcast in his Pack, is delivered to Glenoak Pack for execution in retribution for a murder he had no hand in. But Sebastian, their strong, kind Alpha, has other plans. And though Robert tells himself he's not worthy of the Alpha's attention, there's no denying that there's something between them.  Sebastian, under pressure to continue his Pack's Alpha line, is reluctantly considering a marriage of convenience. Until fate quite literally throws Robert at his feet. There's something different about Robert, underneath all the fear and mistrust, that draws Sebastian to him.  Then Sebastian catches sight of a mark Robert bears. A mark not seen in generations. And everything changes.  The Alpha's Touch is a complete, 31,000 word paranormal romance novella with a happy ending. It includes some intimate scenes not suitable for readers under eighteen.",
