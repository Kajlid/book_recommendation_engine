Try as she might, she can’t make a single move without her uncle’s permission—and Charlie will stop at nothing to keep her from Luke (even if that means putting her behind bars for an hour or two).

And Julie is on a diehard mission to change things that are completely out of her control… even if that means betraying the man she loves.",
