  "description": "Step 1: Control your anxiety. Step 2: Conquer the world.Anxious people have always been treated as weak, despite fighting their inner demons on the daily. It’s time for a shift in perspective, one that gives props to the millions of “worry warriors” out there. The Magic of Overthinking encourages today’s reader to embrace and own their stress while highlighting the benefits of being in tune with their feelings and fears. Studies confirm that anxious people are more in touch with their emotions, proficient in following their instincts, and ready for anything—thanks to a lifetime of inner struggle. With prompts that leverage the healthy aspects of anxiety and take away all the shame, The Magic of Overthinking takes a fresh approach to a popular self-help topic. Designed for consumers who are done feeling bad about themselves, this supportive journal offers empowering self-reflection, techniques for using anxiety as an advantage, and a sense of pride in who we are and who we can become as individuals, anxiety and all.",
