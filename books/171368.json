So too the Benardinos. Yet their problem is of a very unusual nature. Despite running out of places to store the bodies of previous unwelcome guests, gin-soaked mother Virginia has organised a party to celebrate her fifty-fourth birthday. Will anyone get out alive?  BROWN BREAD is a laugh-out-loud light-hearted satirical take on a genre that the whole family can enjoy. Not literally of course!  Pete Brassett is also the author of the thrillers KISS THE GIRLS and THE WILDER SIDE OF CHAOS, the murder mystery PRAYER FOR THE DYING, the personal memoir YELLOW MAN and the heart-warming romance CLAM CHOWDER AT LAFAYETTE AND SPRING, all available on kindle.",
