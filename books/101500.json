  "description": "It's 2066 and not much has changed about the world... Except the South has planned to succeed from the union and U.S. Is now referred to as United with four Sectors. The world is on the brink of war and the path of destruction, but the heart-wrenching romance of a teenage boy and girl can alter it all. Only if Persephone and Sayer can battle the racism, religion, and the fate that's in their distant future, but also the daunting hurt in each of their pasts. But is their relationship strong enough to unite Sector 4 back to United or will they destroy themselves within and bring United with it. This gripping tale of young romance is not what you think it to be. All they want is for the world to be like it used to be, with the black and white that you can't see.",
