  "description": "THE FINAL TALE IN THE INTENSE SCABS TRILOGY I was created by human emotion; love, elation, hate, fear, desperation. On occasion, I awaken and become aware. It is always triggered by humanity's cry for help. ~ Kokumthena Scott, Warren and Missy Walsh did not understand what their roles were to be when the omnipresent light first blinked on. They believed their only obligation was to find a safe place for their small family to escape what was happening all around them. But fate would not allow them to hide away in the North Carolina cabin for long. Now, with their number hovering near a dozen survivors, they must work together – along with Koku, the flawed, self-aware Goddess with a long-term memory problem – to preserve Earth for humanity’s occupation. Earth Canyon Retreat is their sanctuary for the moment, but as the invaders make adjustments, so must the survivors. As the winged, clawed and fanged monsters ravage all life forms on Earth, working toward their goal of total annihilation, these ragtag remnants of humanity must find some way to drive the interlopers from the planet. For when humanity dies, so do its Gods ... once and for all.",
