For readers of Orange is the New Black and Girl, Interrupted, this riveting memoir is about a girl finding strength in the most unlikely place.In 1979, Liz Pryor—a girl from a good family in the ritzy Chicago suburbs—fell pregnant during senior year of high school. Her parents made what they thought to be the right decision: to keep the pregnancy a secret.For six months, Liz lived in a dismal government facility for impoverished pregnant teenagers, hiding from everyone she knew. She was a fish out of water—a girl from privilege surrounded by girls from the foster system and juvie.This is a story told through the eyes of a 17-year-old girl, with tenderness, humor, and an open heart: a story about unexpected friendships and the moments that shape us for the rest of our lives.Rich with wisdom and insight, this is also a universal story about the weight and anguish of the mistakes we make—and how we ultimately rise above them.",
