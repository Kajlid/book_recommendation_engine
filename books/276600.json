  "description": "Lieutenant Azure Lynwood’s latest mission with the Space Corps is turning into a complete disaster. A routine inspection of a remote outpost on Titan unexpectedly turns into a murder investigation. Then a blizzard hits, trapping the five crew members in the tiny base, cut off from any contact with civilisation. And now, without access to his supply of hormonal suppressants, Azure realises he has only a couple of hours until he goes into heat.  Without medical assistance, omegas in heat experience twelve hours of the worst pain imaginable. The thought of what he has to endure is terrifying, but Azure knows that being mated wouldn’t necessarily be any better. Alphas in rut are notoriously violent and aggressive, and matings invariably leave omegas with brutal injuries and emotional scars that can last a lifetime.  But just when Azure thinks his situation can’t get any worse, he finds out one last, staggering piece of news. Major Tor Savan, his commanding officer, and one of the most respected men in the Space Corps, is an alpha. And once he gets a whiff of Azure’s heat pheromones, there isn’t a force in the entire galaxy that could keep them apart.",
