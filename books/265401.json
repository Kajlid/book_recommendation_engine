  "title": "The Antarctic Forgery",
  "description": "When an ancient map of Antarctica is found to be a forgery, it reveals an enigma of history and a terrifying modern-day threat. For the past two years, Gail McCarthy has been a constant source of danger and chaos in the lives of Dan Kotler and his FBI partner, Roland Denzel. Her vast smuggling empire empowers her to move about in the world without the worry of capture, as she spearheads criminal activities on a global scale. Guns, drugs, human trafficking—there's no black-market industry she doesn't touch or flat-out control, and she has the power to continually stay ahead of the world's top law enforcement agencies. Now she has her sights set on a new treasure—one that could fuel her rise to the status of a world power, and make her invincible. Kotler and Denzel race the clock to solve the riddle of the Antarctic forgery and stop Gail from getting her hands on a weapon that Hitler himself once coveted. The Antarctic Forgery is the fifth full-length novel in the Dan Kotler Archaeological thrillers.",
