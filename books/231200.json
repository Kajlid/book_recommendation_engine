  "description": "“You don’t know how much you meant to me.”   \nDespite the present, I can’t forget my past.\n  Eight years ago, seventeen-year-old Robby St. James was on a path of self-destruction. Only the guidance of his teacher kept him alive—until one devastating kiss ruined everything. Now Robby is working his dream job as a rising star in broadcast journalism. It’s only at night that he lets himself indulge in fantasies about the man who got away.  \nWhat doesn’t ruin you makes you stronger.\n  Dean Hartnett has two rules: loose lips sink ships, and the past belongs behind you. Eight years ago he lost his job and was viciously outed when a student’s crush went too far. Now he’s climbed back to the top of his field to become an award-winning reporter—and he won’t let anyone or anything get in his way. Sometimes that means his love life suffers, but as his ex-boyfriends like to remind Dean, he lives to work.  \nWe can’t go down this path again.\n  One fateful day, Robby is assigned to Dean’s news division. Robby wants nothing more than a second chance—and Dean just wants to keep the past buried. With so much heat and so many broken promises between them, coming together is inevitable.  This time, it may ruin them both.  Just One Kiss is a steamy second chance gay romance, with no cliffhangers!",
