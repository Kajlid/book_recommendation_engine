  "title": "A Reasonable Doubt",
  "description": "A Reasonable Doubt is life during Reconstruction, an era when every southerner wore the oppressive yoke of Yankee invaders. In an attempt to throw off this yoke, ex-soldier Bill Tanner faces deadly peril and the injustice of a corrupt government. Along the way he encounters gentler invaders, a homeless widow named Abigail and her young son Jacob, who seek refuge on Billâ€™s land. Woven into the tale is the true story of Sidney Wallace, a man known both as villain and hero in a place where carpetbaggers control politics, elections are rigged, and one small town in Arkansas becomes nationally known as Bloody Clarksville.",
