  "description": "When Michael \"Coop\" Cooper gave up his Gift, he was told it'd be forever. And he accepted it. Years later, the sacrifice doesn't seem so terrible: heâ€™s learned to survive without it, he's gained the necessary intel to begin building a Gifted army, and he found the woman he intends to claim for his own.In the middle of their recruitment process, his Gift comes back. Unexpectedly. But rather than celebrating the impossible, Coop's carefully laid plans are about to come to naught... unless he can find a way to survive and make it right.",
