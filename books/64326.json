  "description": "‘ADVERTISING IS A PEOPLE BUSINESS. SO IS CANNIBALISM’This is the book that gives you the naked varnished truth about the glamorous, cut-throat world of advertising in the 1980s, where the goals are money, sex, power, awards – and finding a great new place for lunch.Everything is here, from the disaster behind the making of those familiar TV commercials to the bitchy in-fighting (‘The Orient Express leaves for Venice at noon. Be under it’); how to get in, how to get out, how to market Old Thames Water twenty-six classic ways; all the dark secrets of that strange trade, whose slogans and images are our modern myths. For, as Oscar Wilde said, ‘Only fools don’t judge by appearances.’Plus! The slogans they couldn’t use (‘People are sticking to Kleenex’, ‘Hail Jaffa, King of the Juice’, ‘Fly to Bangkok and Phuket’), Great Hiccups and Cock-Ups, the Advertising Cost of Living Index, and much, much more can be found in this book from former ad man Martyn Forrester.",
