Her father leaves for the war in Vietnam, her history teacher gives an assignment that has the whole school searching for clues, and the townâ€™s most mysterious resident shares a secret with Bets that has been hidden away for decades. When a peaceful protest spins out of control, Bets is forced to reconsider how she feels about the war her father is fighting and her own role in events taking place much closer to home.",
