  "title": "The Shaping of Art History: Meditations on a Discipline",
  "description": "In this provocative book, Patricia Emison invites the reader to consider and reconsider how past thinkers―from Pliny and Alberti to Freud and Fried―have conceptualized the history of Western art. What a book review attempts to be for a book, this extended essay attempts to be for several hundred years’ worth of books in a an indicator of problems with the old attempts and hopes for the new ones. It is a defense of art history for those outside the field who question its reliability or even its importance; it is a critique of art history for those in the field who may have been preoccupied with looking at trees but who might be interested in trying to see the forest.",
