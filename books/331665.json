But her arrival in to Hartford Cove doesn't come with the warm welcome she hoped for. The town holds dark memories for Rowe of a night in the woods and death, and the way the sheriff looks at her makes her feel like prey even as she's drawn to him.Then ghosts from her past return in the flesh, making Rowe question everything she thought she remembered about that night in the woods all those years ago, when she watched her mother and her best friend be brutally mauled by a monster out of nightmares.Nothing in Hartford Cove is as it seems. It hides secrets, not just to her past but to the true meaning of why the town even exists. Is there any hope of Rowe finding safety in this small town? Especially when she has secrets of her own? Because everywhere Rowe looks, she still sees monsters, and she's beginning to think they're not just her imagination anymore.Magic encircles the town, howls fill the woods, and a curse lives in Rowe's blood that everyone wants. But who is friend and who is foe in the feud between the wolves and the huntsmen?A Red Hiding Hood Retelling that features a spunky heroine with questionable sanity, a scary—but sexy—sheriff, a gentle mayor, and a wolfdog whose more than just his bark.",
