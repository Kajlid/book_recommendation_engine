  "description": "A veteran of the war in search of a hero’s welcome, Collin finds himself S.O.L. The man he could have fallen in love with didn’t come home with him, and Collin’s left without a direction. What does a soldier do when the fight’s over?Why, he finds a new challenge. Or, in this case, a challenge finds him. One of the mysterious dragons that appeared during the war to circle the skies snatches Collin from his home and carries him to the dragon lands. The dragon, Zacharei, claims he’s “returning” Collin to his dragon lord. But how can this be, when Collin’s never visited in the first place?Collin begins to understand when Zacharei leaves him with “his” dragon, Avalier, a beast who’s the exact duplicate of Nyas -- and who thinks Collin is his “Kay-lin,” a doppelganger who disappeared during Avalier’s own last battle. Mistaken identity has never been this sexy -- and a mix-up has never been so perfect a solution for the lonely hearts of two soldiers.",
