  "description": "She’s a visionary with a secret fear. He’s an upstart goldminer hoping to hit the motherlode…again. Will their dreams coalesce or crash and burn?  Frontier beauty Magda Clarke knows exactly what she wants in life. Freedom. Her father’s love. And to open her own business right at the heart of Crown Vista. A man isn’t on the list—and would probably just get in the way. But when Alex Herd rolls into town, she sees a kindred spirit—and a handsome one at that. But special as he is, she knows that one small town isn’t big enough for two big dreamers.  Alex is already rich from his last wild windfall. When rumors rise of the next big gold rush in a little town out Dakota way, he doesn’t hesitate. Sure, he’s in it for the money, but more for the adventure. But when he bumps into Magda, he begins to see not all buried treasure can be dug out with a shovel.  They both have skyhigh hopes. Falling in love was never part of the plan—and could ruin everything. Can they both find what they’re looking for, or will they end up losing it all?  Heart of Gold is the first book in a trilogy of sweet historical romances. If you like to see downhome cowboys falling for heart-of-gold heroines, you’ll love the first installment in Journey Jackson’s Westbound Hearts series.",
