  "description": "The people passing through Annalise’s life are like zombies feasting on parts of her heart, and not even duct tape can fix that.For Seventeen-year-old orphan Annalise Kerrigan, waking up in strange places isn’t unusual. Abandoned at age two, Annalise bounces from one fake-parental to the next. It’s always the same story, just a different day until Annalise wakes up someplace stranger than usual. On the worst day of her life, Annalise is given an antique locket. On the second worst day, she wakes up-not in a modern bed-but on a cold floor in 1920 Chicago. If traveling ninety-some-odd-years into the past isn’t bad enough, landing in the middle of a mob hit makes it worse. After rescuing the Irish bad boy, Reilly O’Regan, from Vintroni’s thugs, Annalise reluctantly relies on him as her guide through twentieth-century Chicago. While dodging gangsters, bullets and the police, it becomes clear the locket isn’t what it seems. A journey for answers leads them to an ancient legend of Triskel Devices and on a search for a promised place known only as True North. Will the Triskel Locket send Annalise back once her True North is found? Or will she give up her future to save Reilly from his enemies in the past?Only time will tell. . .",
