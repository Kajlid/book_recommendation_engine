  "description": "From their earliest years, five very different girls were as close as sisters—sharing everything, even secrets and lies—until their friendship and their lives were ripped apart by a devastating act of betrayal from one of their own.Twenty years have gone by, and one woman has more cause to regret her estrangement from the group than the rest. An old promise leads to a reunion, which unearths memories, mistrust, and hidden agendas as the former friends—grown up and grown apart—reconnect and realize the impact they've had on each others lives. Real and perceived betrayals jeopardize the entire event...as well as the hopes of a rekindled romance.The bonds of love and friendship can be as strong as steel. But are they unbreakable.",
