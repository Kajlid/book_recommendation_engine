  "description": "Panda Demick can do something that no other panda has been able to do before −he can talk to animals, children, and itsy-bitsy viruses. Though sad things are happening in the world around him, Demick is a good friend who is willing to do what is necessary to keep all of his friends safe. An uplifting children’s story about listening to friends and healing nature so we can all live happy and healthy together. Beautifully drawn illustrations that include pandas, elephants, lions, eagles, sparrows, giraffes, camels, whales, toucans, koalas, frogs, sea turtles, hippopotami, bees, ladybugs, ants, sloths, flamingos, cats, dogs, frogs, and loving humans makes Panda Demick a uniquely heartwarming treasure to be handed down and enjoyed with future generations. Written in loving memory of those lost worldwide to Covid-19.",
