It is filled with the fast-paced action required in a good thriller.” –Goodreads Reviewer\"Russell Brooks has created an action-packed book that begins and ends with conflict. A very enjoyable action thriller for someone who enjoys reading Jack Reacher and the Bourne books.” –Goodreads ReviewerPandora's Succession is a great spy thriller. The storyline was well-written and pulled me in from the beginning. The way it played out was awesome. Full of action, drama, intense scenarios and on-the-edge-of-your-seat adventure. –Goodreads ReviewerCIA operative, Ridley Fox, never stopped hunting his fiancée's killers—a weapons consortium called The Arms Of Ares. When Fox follows a lead to one of their top-secret bioweapons facilities in Chechnya, he barely escapes alive. However, he's learned that Ares has weaponized a hyper-deadly microbe called Pandora. The trail leads Fox to Tokyo, where he teams up with an old flame and fellow operative, Nita Parris. Aside from Ares, they must contend with rogue agents who'll stop at nothing to get Pandora. This throws Fox and Parris into a deadly game of spy vs spy, as they must rely on each other to locate Pandora. For if it's unleashed, it could mean the end of humanity.",
