He wants to prove the existence of King Arthur, and Emmaâ€™s task is to bring forth this proof, in an item of King Arthurs, to present-day. The old wizard, vowing to right a wrong, is determined fix a mistake in history, but in trying to do so, history itself is changed. Merlin understands too late that he has altered history, and now Camelot is not as anyone remembers.

Now evil rules and death reigns, where not every fairy tale has a happy ending and there is always another monster. In Camelot, a usurper occupies the throne, a resurrected being, one who is tyrant and evil sorcerer, wielding black magic to control and rule. As plans proceed to right history, Emma and Thomas explore magic, develop strategy, and hunt clues that guide them closer to home, even if home may be unreachable. Friendships grow, as does the dawn of love, but love cannot bloom if it further pollutes the timeline, and only time will tell if the path they walk is the right one.",
