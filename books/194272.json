  "description": "It's 1964 and young American Kate Hughes anticipates finding knowledge--and perhaps love--at Oxford University.  She discovers possibilities in David MacKenzie, a young lecturer who carries on the legacy of his friend and mentor, C.S. Lewis.  But conflict arises when she also catches the eye of the dashing Lord Stuart Devereux. Kate's heart is torn between the two men, and her convictions are challenged as her vulnerability draws her to a rendezvous she may regret. Sprinkled with allusions to classic English literature, references to C.S. Lewis, and an appearance from Professor J.R.R. Tolkien himself, this wonderful first novel unfolds with grace into an endearing story that will delight both devotees of The Inklings and readers of romance. This new Harvest House edition of Inklings contains the original novel and an all-new sequel titled Intentions.",
