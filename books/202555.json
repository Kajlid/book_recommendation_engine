  "description": "Freya is myth. She is legend. And she’s about to make one hell of a comeback.Sara Vanadi is more than she appears to be.In her prime, she was Freya, the Norse goddess of love, beauty, war, and death. Now all that’s left of her legacy is herself. Her power comes from belief, and for an ancient goddess in the 21st century, true believers are hard to come by.She’s been lying low for a few decades, when all of a sudden a shadowy corporation extends an offer: join them and receive unlimited strength and believers—or refuse and be destroyed. Sara chooses neither; she flees with the help of a new friend named Nathan.With a modern power rising that wishes to bend the divine to its will, Sara decides to fight back—but first she needs some new clothes.",
