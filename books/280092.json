  "description": "To Leandros Nochdvor, Egil was the greatest hero the world had ever seen. It had nothing to do with the man's accomplishments, numerous though they were. It had nothing to do with the past Egil overcame or even the lives he saved. It was simply this: Egil taught Leandros how to live. And then he taught Leandros how to love.And then Leandros lost him.Years later, when Leandros' uncle the king is abducted by a strange woman with stranger powers, Leandros must confront his grief and ask: what would Egil do? So Leandros gathers allies, each with their own pasts and secrets, and sets off to save his king. On the journey, he faces old gods, forgotten magics, and bitter betrayals, but the foe waiting at the end makes the rest seem small: Egil, back from the dead. How could Leandros hope to win, facing the famous hero? How could he want to, facing the man he once loved? And if this righteous hero is barring Leandros' way, then which of them is right?",
