  "description": "\"God had not just sent his Messiah into the world. He had sent him to them. They were known. In all their guilt—intended and unintended—they were known and invited to find refuge in the grace of God, accomplished through the life, death, and resurrection of his Son. And the church continued to grow.\"Jesus sent his followers into the world. Russ Ramsey's dynamic narrative traces the journey of the early church with thirty-one daily readings through the book of Acts, as the people of God carried out Jesus' mission as his ambassadors. This unlikely band of believers faced enormous challenges yet experienced God's power and grace as they moved forward in the Spirit. Through this new community, a movement spread around the world that continues to this day.Come discover the transformation that energized the early church. And you too can play your part in the unfolding story.Also including The Advent of the Lamb of God and The Passion of the King of Glory, the Retelling the Story series explores the narrative arc of the Bible from Genesis through Revelation in compelling language that is faithful to the text of Scripture. The stories are told afresh to help readers hide God's word in their hearts by way of their imaginations.",
