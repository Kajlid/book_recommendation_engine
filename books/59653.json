  "description": "Julian is a student in a secret school that specialises in teaching gifted children the Arts of the Mind, a discipline originally developed to control the mysterious concept referred to as ‘consciousness’. The school is run by a charismatic, yet mysterious man, known only as Teacher to his students. In the school the children learn to utilise subtle behavioural tools based on evolutionary laws that enable them to control untrained people. Julian’s life is built around discipline and order, but the choices made by others long ago are about to change his life forever. He is forced to face his innermost fears as his path unexpectedly crosses with one of the most respected scientists in the world. Users of the Mind is a tale of the hidden aspects of human nature, the evolutionary ‘chains’ that bind us all and the will of Man to defeat Nature in order to avoid his own destruction. It is a study of the destructiveness of scientific ambition, the thin line between passion and obsession, and the bitter sacrifices that must be made to attain the highest goals.",
