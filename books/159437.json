Rather than celebrating with cake and balloons, she is met with a surprise gift from her parents that turns her life upside down. By accepting her parents’ challenge of moving out of her childhood home and finding a career job, Josefina learns that adult life is more difficult than she ever expected. When this grown-up assignment becomes overwhelming, Josefina finds solace in playing on her swing set in the backyard of her childhood home. Letting go of her childish tendencies proves to be the most trying growing pain as she is forced to make mature choices for the first time. How will an opportunity in New York City, a first apartment, and her first love help jumpstart Josefina’s journey through the ups and downs of young adulthood? This debut novel by Adriana Erin Rivera tells a relatable and endearing story of post-grad growing pains.",
