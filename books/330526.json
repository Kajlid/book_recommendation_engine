  "description": "Poetry that will reach right into your soul, and leave you hungry for more!\n\nDeliciously dark and extremely addictive.\n\nThe perfect mix of sensual & highly emotional poems.\nAn original collection of poetry, comprised of new works, writings, and photography. It documents the many facets of ones inner journey. It deals with our ever-changing emotions, and how the mind and heart react differently when confronted by lifes cruel ironies.We all live inside and outside ourselves. The quiet whispers we hear and the ones we ignore. The inner voice that makes us passionate, gives us hope, or creates the monster that sharpens their teeth.ENDroad details the winding aspects of that search for answers. It shows that we all sometimes feel the same. That we are not alone. The paths we take or the ones that take us to mold our humanity into who we are. Each one presents us with the ability for us to rediscover ourselves again.At times we might feel lost but the truth to finding our way will always rest in our hearts.My end does not mean I am finishedIt only reveals that I am starting again._hydrus",
