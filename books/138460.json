  "description": "She' s a monster. He' s a mortal. Killing each other should be easy... right?When Medusa and Tiresias rise from the Underworld as twenty-first-century teens and meet through Persephone and Hades' new dating app, it seems like a second chance. Dating is hard when you turn everyone to stone, but dating a blind prophet may be a loophole ... even if he does occasionally spout dire prophecies.But not everyone is pleased with an app designed to kindle romance between mortal enemies. As distrust grows between the heroes, monsters, and gods making up the app's user base, it' s easier to fall into old habits than fall in love. With pressure building on both sides, Medusa and Tiresias accept their kill their date, no matter how much they bond over their love of dogs or the way the gods have wronged them in the past.Caught amongst meddling gods, murderous heroes, and a classic Greek bet, Medusa and Tiresias may have signed up for more than a dating profile. With war brewing at the hands of the gods, working together may be the only way to save mortals and monsters alike.Told entirely through instant messages and transcripts, this is one mythically funny romantic comedy you don' t want to miss.",
