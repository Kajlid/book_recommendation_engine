  "description": "Vladimir Vysotsky (January 25, 1938 - July 25, 1980) was a poet, singer, and actor whose work had an immeasurable and lasting effect on Russian culture. His songs explored a vast variety of topics, ranging from comedy to social and political commentary. With the impressive poetical quality of his lyrics, he quickly outgrew the label of \"a bard.\" In the time when many poets and performers were under heavy scrutiny and censorship by the government, Vysotsky dared to speak his mind and due to his immense popularity with the Soviet people, he was left largely ignored by the authorities. Vysotsky died of a heart attack on July 25, 1980, though many speculate that alcohol and drug use may have also contributed to his early death. In the short span of twenty years, Vysotsky had produced nearly 2000 songs and poems. To this day, he remains an icon for the Russian people and has had a deep influence on the Russian musicians of today. This dual-language collection of his work strives to give a glimpse into the creative mind of Russia's greatest singer.",
