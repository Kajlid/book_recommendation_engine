  "title": "Compromising Kessen",
  "description": "The last thing career-driven Kessen wants is to leave her home in Colorado to spend a few months in London, far away from her job, her friends and the memories of her mother. However, her father, the Earl of Newberry, threatens to disinherit her unless she gets in touch with her English roots. She complies, but has no intention of enjoying the experience. That is until she meets Christian Vandenbrook, the arrogant and irritatingly handsome future Duke of Albany and her father's business partner. Unfortunately, Christian hates Americans. And coffee. And apparently, Kessen. A hatred this passionate can only lead to one thing... marriage. Caught in the middle of a Regency-inspired nightmare, Kessen and Christian are forced to marry in only one week's time. Resigned to their fate, the two resolve to give the relationship a chance - which would be much easier if everyone would stop interrupting them every time they found a moment alone. Can a historical inspired setting be the thing to ignite their passion? Or will the situation be the death of what could have been a timeless love?",
