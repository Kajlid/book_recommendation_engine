  "description": "Some secrets should just stay buried. On the day Tristan Morrow is born her mother goes missing, prompting an investigation that produces no solid leads. Fast forward fifteen years, and the Morrow family still doesn't know the truth behind Catherine Morrow’s disappearance. When fifteen-year-old Tristan is required to write a biography on her mother for a school assignment, she learns the truth about her mother’s fate and is hell-bent upon finding out who was responsible for her death. But when Tristan herself goes missing too, everyone is suspect, even her own father. Set in rural Fox Hollow, PA, Shadows of Morrow unravels a web of lies, deceit, madness, and corruption. Can investigators crack the case before Tristan meets the same fate as her mother? And who is responsible for the disappearances? There is much uncertainty as the investigation unfolds, but there is one thing that is certain: Tristan Morrow holds the master key to the entire riddle.",
