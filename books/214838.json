During a trip to Florida to visit his sister, Rachel, and her fiance, Andrew, they introduce Justin to their kinky friends in hopes they can help talk Justin into moving from South Dakota to sunny Sarasota. Including hunky, older, experienced Doms Wade and Glen. Wade and Glen are newly married since the marriage ban fell, but have been together for years. Sure they've played with thirds before, in the dungeon as well as in their bed. But their standing rule has always been it's just for fun, not for love. Until they meet Justin. Now the two sadistic Doms realize something's happened that they never expected--they've lost their hearts to Justin. But can they convince him they've changed their minds and want him for life before someone else comes in and scoops their perfect subby unicorn right out from under them?
