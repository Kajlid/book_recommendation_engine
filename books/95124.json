  "description": "Will Long loves the old west, especially the escapades of the famous outlaws, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. For a twelve-year-old boy who has recently lost his father and is now dealing with the new man in his mother's life, his interest in these long-ago outlaws is a much needed escape from reality. When Will and his mother leave their home in Fargo, North Dakota on an Amtrak train trip to visit his great-grandmother in Spokane, Washington, he suddenly finds himself on an even greater adventure than a family reunion. Jolted awake in the middle of the night, he finds himself on an old-fashioned train that is being robbed by none other than Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid! After being recruited by Butch to help out with the robbery, Will takes off with them believing he is on the adventure of a lifetime. But when a bank robbery goes sour, Will realizes that the outlaw life isn't as exciting and glamorous as he'd thought. The story takes Will on adventures around the United States, from the Tipton, Wyoming train robbery to the Winnemucca, Nevada bank robbery; down to Fort Worth, Texas where the gang members wintered, and all the way up to New York City where they plan to leave for South America to go straight. Will meets the soft-spoken, lovely schoolmarm, Miss Etta Place, who is also Sundance's wife, along with other members of the famed Hole-in-the-Wall gang. And after all his travels, he learns a family secret that no one knew about for decades.",
