Do you lack balance, or does love always seem to pass you by no matter how hard you try to connect? Maybe it’s time to get Selfish… Naketa Ren Thigpen, the #1 Balance and Relationship Advisor in the World, presents a book for ambitious women everywhere… In Selfish, Naketa shares her own deeply personal experiences as an ambitious woman who battled dysfunction, trauma, abandonment, and toxic relationships… All while growing a family, career, global business, and re-igniting the sparks in her marriage. Naketa guides you along her journey, and shares how you can move from breakdown to breakthrough. After reading this book, you • Change the conversation. Redefine the terms used to make so many women play small, give birth to your biggest dream, and create your joy! • End ‘over-giving’. Quit spreading yourself too thin, and focus on the relationships that really matter. • Stop believing in false narratives that hold you back, diminish intimacy, and keep you stuck in survival mode. • Break the pattern… Re-script disruptive cycles of unhealthy, toxic and energy draining ‘situationships’ that bind your brilliance. Selfish isn't a license to be insensitive, egoistic nor inhumane. It’s a movement that gives you permission to pause, live, love and laugh through your pain, and find your way to joy. A necessary remedy to over-giving and cyclical unhealthy relationships. Learning to get a little selfish is the missing ingredient to holistic self-care and improving mental wellness. You'll gain access to hope, healing, and victory, and shatter the cycles of shame and guilt that are keeping you from the life you deserve…",
