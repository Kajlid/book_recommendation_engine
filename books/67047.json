  "title": "Towards Asmara",
  "description": "Four Westerners travel under Eritrean rebel escort through a land of savage beauty and bitter drought towards the front-line and the ancient capital of Asmara. Each is irrevocably changed as they bear witness to the devastation of war as well as to the Eritreans' courage, remarkable organisation and humanity in the face of constant attack. With this powerful and moving novel, Thomas Keneally draws attention to a contemporary issue of global importance - and illustrates the tribal and ideological roots that continue to fuel the wars today.",
