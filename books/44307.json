  "description": "Coming soonDoctor Rowena Radcliffe opens a small clinic in Whitechapel. There she meets five poor, disenfranchised women destined to become famous. Famous for the mystery that surrounds their deaths at the hand of Jack the Ripper. The Ripper was never caught. The question of why those specific women were targeted has never been answered. RipHer is a historical novel offering a unique twist to the unsolved murders. It takes the reader down a speculative path-the Ripper was not who or what the public believe. The truth about the identity of the killer was hidden as it was too shocking for the public to learn truth.",
