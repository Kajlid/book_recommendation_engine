  "description": "Jim Rook, remedial English teacher and psychic, knows it’s going to be a bad day. He nearly runs over someone dressed entirely in black – but why did they walk right in the middle of the college driveway? And who just walks off into the fog after nearly being run over? But when a splash of blood appears on a questionnaire Jim realizes that his day isn’t going to be merely bad: it’s going to be the day from hell. Perhaps quite literally . . .",
