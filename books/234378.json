Can that be true? What would happen to Feely? (And Ollie too, but mainly Feely). Girls love Feely! Phoebe Dorcas Tonks - Feely to everyone but her teacher - has another hilarious adventure in this book, one of the 'Feely' series by Barbara Catchpole, author of the best-selling 'PIG' books. Coupled with fantastic black-and-white illustrations and an easy-to-read diary format, the laugh-out-loud humour and merciless honesty will appeal to all readers.",
