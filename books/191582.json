  "description": "Sometimes the heart wants what it can’t have.  That’s the motto Silas Mackenzie, the president of The Dixie Wardens MC, has lived by since he was a young man.  Now he’s well on the way to middle age, has three grown children and he’s lusting after a woman he should definitely stay away from.  Especially not one that his ex-girlfriend had given birth to, and happens to be only twenty-nine years old.  Sawyer isn’t a young girl at heart, though.  She’s seen the inside of a jail cell for eight long years, and every one of them was spent paying for a crime she didn’t commit.  Silas Mackenzie knows as soon as he sees her that the she has sacrificed enough. And maybe…just maybe…so has he.  It’s time for Silas Mackenzie to get what he deserves, and, in the process, put a little bit of happy back into Sawyer’s world, one rough, bearded kiss at a time.",
