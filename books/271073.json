  "description": "A desperate single dad and an unemployed child psychologist bump into each other in a small-town bar… I left the Navy, scored a billion in tech, got married, and had a baby. I did everything by the book. Happily ever after, right? Wrong.Fast-forward four years, and I’m alone, trying to raise my daughter in spite of screwing up at every turn (according to my mother-in-law), and launching a new business. I was clearly desperate the night I offered a gorgeous girl in a bar $500 a day to be my live-in nanny—or maybe it was another part of my anatomy talking. So what if I’ve been alone since forever? I’m focused on my job, not the sultry siren who sleeps downstairs.At least that’s what I keep reminding myself…He’s distant, brooding, and drop-dead gorgeous, and when he scoops up his adorable four-year-old daughter and blows raspberries on her tummy while she squeals with delight, I’m done.Bumping into him at our local pub slightly drunk and overly frustrated was a total accident. He needed help, and he offered me a ridiculous salary. I couldn't say no. Right?Now he’s given me the chance to pay off my debts and take control of my life. I can't screw up this job. But as bad as I want to be good, I’m not sure I can fake it…The way he watches me sends heat sizzling through my insides.Our hands touch, our eyes meet, and I’m ready for my new boss to make me his.(A steamy, small-town, single-dad/nanny romance. No cheating; No cliffhangers.)",
