  "description": "Recent Stanford graduate Bev Dahl is determined to prove herself worthy of her grandfather’s memory by making it on Wall Street When her cousin, Mathias, who is obsessed with a magic map that leads to a vast treasure trove of lost Spanish gold, realizes that Bev is the only one who can see the map lighting up and leading to the treasure, he offers her a chance at adventure that a restless Bev can’t refuse. Along with her eccentric brother, who has a penchant for dressing like a colonial conquistador, and her cousin’s stepson, a lawyer and songwriter who intrigues Bev, they follow the map into the bowels of a network of uncharted limestone caves that run beneath the Tennessee hills. But her cousin Mathias is determined to claim the treasure as his own, and it’s only by finally embracing the psychic abilities that Bev shares with her mother, that she stands a chance of coming out of this adventure alive.",
