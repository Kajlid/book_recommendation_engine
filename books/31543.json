  "description": "Tim LaHaye called The Resurrection File—Craig Parshall’s first novel—“one of the most fascinating books I have read in years.” Parshall continues with Custody of the State, another legal thriller with tightly drawn characters, tense courtroom scenes, and the struggle of a man to bring his beliefs into real life. Attorney Will Chambers reluctantly agrees to defend a young mother from Georgia and her farmer husband, suspected of committing the unthinkable against their own child. Soon he’s confronting small–town secrets, big–time corruption, and a government system that’s destroying the little family.  Chambers must ask, does God really protect us from evil?—as intimidation, backroom maneuvering, and the shadow of a national threat throw him into...the custody of the state.",
