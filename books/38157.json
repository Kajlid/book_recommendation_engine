  "description": "[Siren Classic Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, shape-shifters, vampires] Valentin Alekseev prays for death while fleeing for his life, hunted for secrets he shouldn't know exist. With his home in ruins and his master killed, he's in such bad shape he can't even tell that the man who's caught his eye is a shifter. He should know better than to bring innocent bystanders into his mess of a life, but Fate has other plans. Twenty-seven years old, Shawn Dougal never thought he'd fall for a man, much less a bloodsucker. But how else can he explain the sudden lapse in judgment that has him traveling halfway across Romania, risking his own life to save Valentin's? And will breaking and entering a centuries-old castle full of vampires be enough to get his lover back? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
