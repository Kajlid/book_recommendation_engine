  "description": "A respected Egyptologist, the author of Tutankhamen and the Tomb that Changed the World , examines the compelling mystery behind the death of King Tutankhamen.Today, Tutankhamen is the most famous of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs. After his death at the age of nineteen, “King Tut” was forgotten from history, until the discovery of his tomb in 1922 propelled him to worldwide fame. But the circumstances of his death remain shrouded in mystery....X-rays of Tutankhamen’s skull suggest a violent death. Was it accident or murder? Several members of his family died around the same time—was is coincidence? Why did Tutankhamen’s widow send desperate messages to the Hittite king, requesting marriage to one of his sons? And who murdered the Hittite price on his journey to Egypt? Who ordered the removal of Tutankhamen’s name from all monuments and temples, and thus from Egyptian history?This fascinating, painstakingly researched book is the first to explore in depth the questionable circumstances of Tutankhamen’s demise—and to present a shocking scenario of betrayal, ambition, and murder. In The Murder of Tutankhamen , renowned Egyptologist Bob Brier reveals an exciting journey into ancient history—and a 3,000 year-old mystery that still compels us today.“Brier's 3,000-year-old mystery steadily draws the reader into the curious and exotic world of Egyptology.”— The New York TimesINCLUDES 16 PAGES OF PHOTOS",
