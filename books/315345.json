  "description": "When a strange tear in the cosmos appears within Earth’s annual path, the consequences are disastrous. For one night a year, the vast majority of humans now undergo a frightening mental change, transforming into hateful, rage-fueled zombies who will stop at nothing to satiate their desire for brutality.While not much is understood about this horrific mass hysteria, the demographic it effects is very cisgender straight people.A few years after the first of these tragic events, four friends from across the queer spectrum look for safety in solitude, hunkering down in a remote desert cabin for what is now known as Saturation Day. With a vaccine available for straight people to curb their violent episodes, some predict the worst is over. Others aren’t so sure.As night falls, it becomes clear that survival isn’t guaranteed this Saturation Day.This is the first horror novella from two-time Hugo Award finalist Chuck Tingle.",
