  "description": "For eleven years I’d lived through hell, fought temptation, and faced the devil I’d been forced to marry. So when the chance came to run, I hadn’t looked back. I’d fled to the only place I’d ever felt safe. Barrett’s Bay.My plan was simple, hide out until the dust settled, keep to myself, and stay safe. I hadn’t planned on getting in an accident, or on my teenage crush still living in the town he’d always planned to leave behind.As a teenager, Jesse Fateson had been a god amongst mortals, but now even divinity would pale in his presence. Growing up, he had been my salvation, my everything, now he could be my ruin, because if anyone realised who I was, realised I was here, I wouldn’t be allowed to run again.",
