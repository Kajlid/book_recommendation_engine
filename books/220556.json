  "description": "This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN B01M6ZMGREI’m no one. A mechanic. A getaway driver. A thief.  I was born on the streets, and I like it rough — life, sex, everything. My job is dirty. My past is dirty. So is my future.  Until I get out of prison and discover I’ve inherited a billion dollars.  I’m not a good billionaire. I don’t care about penthouses, fancy dinners, or private jets. I don’t care about life and death. Hell, I don’t even care about money. I’m willing to spend every penny of it on one thing.  Find the woman who gave me one unforgettable night before I went down. The woman who is too good for me. The woman I can never have.  Find her. Get revenge on the man that hurt her. And make her mine.   **Full length standalone with no cheating and no cliffhanger**",
