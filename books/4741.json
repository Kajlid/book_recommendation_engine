  "title": "MetaMaus: A Look Inside a Modern Classic, Maus",
  "description": "Visually and emotionally rich, MetaMaus is as groundbreaking as the masterpiece whose creation it reveals.  In the pages of MetaMaus, Art Spiegelman re-enters the Pulitzer prize-winning Maus, the modern classic that has altered how we see literature, comics, and the Holocaust ever since it was first published twenty-five years ago.  Does he probe the questions that Maus most often evokes—Why the Holocaust? Why mice? Why comics?—and gives us a new and essential work about the creative process.  MetaMaus includes a bonus DVD-R that provides a digitized reference copy of The Complete Maus linked to a deep archive of audio interviews with his survivor father, historical documents, and a wealth of Spiegelman's private notebooks and sketches.  Compelling and intimate, MetaMaus is poised to become a classic in its own right.",
