  "description": "It is impossible to have an affair with a happily married woman and yet every year people are doing just that. Seeking happiness elsewhere. In the age of technology and smart phones we are more disconnected than we've ever been. \"How to seduce your wife (or anyone else's) seeks to address this. If \"50 Shades\" allowed women to talk openly about sex this book takes it further and argues that there needs to be more romance as well as great sex. That's not a box of chocolates and a bunch of flowers romance this is soul reaching, heart stopping romance. The author, Andy Gibney, uses his experience as a therapist as well as first hand accounts to give voice to women speaking to men about exactly what they want. Every man can learn from this book and every woman will want to read it.",
