  "description": "What could be better than ten scorching tales? How about ten bisexual shorts and novelettes by an award-winning queer author? In Bisexual Beauties, eroticist Giselle Renarde assembles an eclectic cast of characters to arouse and entertain you. Girlfriends share their first taste of man in “Felicity’s First” while frisky folk singers take Winter along for the ride in “Forbidden Folk.” A curvy girl joins the action when she walks in on her co-worker crush seducing a sexy stranger. A proudly bisexual building super fixes more than just leaky pipes, and a concerned BFF helps her married friends break down barriers when she jumps into bed with them. New fiction and fan favourites team up in this threesome-packed anthology. Whether you’ve always been a little bi-curious when it comes to erotica or you’re a die-hard fan of girls who love girls and guys, dive between the covers with these bisexual vixens! You won’t regret it.",
