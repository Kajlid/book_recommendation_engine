  "description": "Can she nab the headline without losing her heart?Elissa Tillman may be confined behind a secretarial desk, but her heart is out in the open world landing the big story that’ll place her father’s struggling newspaper back on top. When a millionaire inventor is murdered, she finally convinces her hesitant father to give her the break she’s been dreaming of. But there’s a catch. To get her article above the fold, she must compete for it. Her coverage of the story must outshine her opponent’s. To her dismay, the rival is none other than Cole Parker—a high-profile journalist and Elissa’s former flame.  Losing his prestigious job at the New York Dispatch is shameful enough, but the reason behind Cole’s termination almost killed him. When his former employer gives him a redemptive opportunity in Pittsburgh, all Cole can think of is procuring a second chance with Elissa. The crazy contest her father invents keeps Cole near her, but she regards him as an enemy, both to her dreams and her heart. Can Cole convince Elissa he’s no longer the man who’d abandoned her years ago? Or will their love remain old news?",
