  "description": "One year. Just one more year, and Jonathan Troy would be done with White Oak Bay and his controlling stepfather.Then one evening he blacks out and sees a woman in a bathtub. It would have been more enjoyable if the bathtub weren’t filled to the brim with blood. He also flash-freezes an entire swimming pool, which would have been a fantastic indoor skating rink. Now he’s fairly certain that he’s losing his mind.Lana Vander knows that Jude Summerfield is in love with her. He’s boyish, charming, adorable and a little goofy, and he’s also her best friend. But her sudden attraction to Jonathan Troy, who happens to be Jude’s older brother, is not some passing craze, because Lana Vander can feel what other people feel. Literally. And what she feels from Troy is beyond her ability to make sense of.Something connects Troy and Lana, and figuring out the insanity that is becoming a daily occurrence for them is as tricky as navigating high school, relationships and teenage life.",
