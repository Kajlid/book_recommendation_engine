  "description": "If a gold medal was awarded for 'Worst Day Ever' Laney Calderone would win it today, hands down. She's just discovered she's pregnant, her fianc√© abruptly dumps her when she tells him, and her new car refuses to start as a brutal snowstorm hits Toronto. Good Samaritan Tyler Hammond offers to take her home; however, with the heavy snow falling and his patience dwindling, Laney's gold medal day isn't over yet. Storms intensify both outside and in as Laney finds herself inexplicably attracted to this tall, dark and very handsome but infuriating stranger. Can Laney fight her unwanted yet increasing desire for this man long enough to get through the relentless storm? And will Tyler let her walk out of his life as easily as she came into it?",
