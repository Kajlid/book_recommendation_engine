  "title": "Camino Chronicle: Walking to Santiago",
  "description": "Camino Walking to Santiago takes the reader along the ancient pilgrimage trail, the Camino de Santiago, as the author and her husband travel 400 miles through northern Spain's hamlets, cities, arid plains, and mountains. The book combines intriguing historical background and rich cultural stories with the author's engaging narrative to provide travelers with the inspiration and knowledge to make their own journey to the city of Santiago de Compostela and the famous cathedral where the remains of the apostle St. James are found. Not everyone has the time or inclination to walk five-hundred miles across northern Spain, but whether armchair traveler or active adventurer, readers will find that Camino Chronicle provides a realistic, non-embellished account of what such a trip involves. You'll gain a picture of refugio (hostel) life, learn about the food and wine of the regions, and enjoy reading some of the mythology and customs of the people. This book was updated in 2014, primarily in the \"how to\" section, to give the reader current information.",
