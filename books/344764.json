  "description": "When Jordan starts to make new, more popular friends, Kara feels totally burned by her former best friend's icy rejection. These dark blue days are almost more than she can take, until she makes a life-changing discovery. To get there, however, Kara must make some major choices about who and what she's going to believe in, and if she'll ever trust anybody--including God--ever again. In her new TrueColors series, best-selling author Melody Carlson takes young readers into edgy, poignant topics that students deal with on a daily basis--issues such as drug abuse, sexuality, body image, and more. Includes discussion questions.",
