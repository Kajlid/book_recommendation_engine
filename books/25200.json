  "title": "E=mc^2: The Most Famous Equation in History... and its Folklore",
  "description": "This e-book corresponds to the first chapter of the printed book entitled \"Galloping with Light - Einstein, Relativity, and Folklore\", and is the first of the e-Series entitled \"Relativity free of Folklore\".Because you deserve more than just folklore, in this e-book you will find the answers to the following intriguing questions:1) Is it really possible to transform matter into energy?2) Why do renowned physicists say it is possible and that the famous equation E=mc^2 proves it, when, in fact, that is not true?3) Why do they say that the mass of a material object is simply its quantity of matter when, in reality, that is not true?4) Why do they associate the equation E=mc^2 only with nuclear energy and in particular with the atomic bomb when, actually, that equation had historically nothing to do with it?The fact that the reader may not have a scientific education does not mean that s/he does not have the intelligence to understand profound concepts -- as long as they are presented with semantic and epistemological clarity. After all, Einstein said that Science is simply the refinement of our intuition and everyday experiences.",
