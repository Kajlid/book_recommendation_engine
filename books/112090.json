  "title": "Freedom Is Your Nature: A Practical Guide to Inner Transformation",
  "description": "This is an extraordinary new and important work on the inner journey written by Christine Wushke, a woman whose life has seen a series of classical spiritual encounters and experiences. In these pages, she shares with us her amazing revelations, their intoxicating sweetness, and their life-giving fruit. But the book is more than just the fascinating story of Christine's own spiritual growth, for it unfolds for the reader a renewed understanding of life in general, accompanied by practical exercises that anyone can use to begin to change their own inner landscape - and with it - their outer world. Using parables, stories, experiences, and insights from her meditations, she takes the reader on a double-decker both hers and their own.",
