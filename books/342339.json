  "description": "The title of this richly textured book derives from two of the three mysterious letters left by Emily Dickinson--the ones addressed to \"Dear Master.\" Lucie Brock-Boido has imagined a series of letters echoing devices found in Dickinson's own work. \"We feel we are in the presence of something entirely new, \" says Bonnie Costello in The Boston Review . \"Not even Brock-Broido's wonderful first book, A Hunger , prepares us for this bold encounter.\"From the Trade Paperback edition.",
