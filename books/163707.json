  "description": "Book one of the Jordan Rose Dueology, Break Away is a character driven science-fiction story of love lost, of resolve, of digging deeper than you thought possible until you find the strength not to crumble, and ultimately, of surviving even when you think you have no hope left. It is the first novel in a two novel series chronicling the adventures of my heroine, Rose. Rose has only been a police officer in northern Maine for two years when her world is suddenly ripped apart by a deadly new disease out of New York City. All who are infected by this new disease are rapidly reduced to husks of their former selves leaving only rabid wild beasts bent on death and destruction. After her wife’s gruesome and violent death, Rose learns that she is immune and must decide whether to sacrifice herself for a cure or fight to survive. Rose’s choices set in motion a desperate trek north into the solitary deep woods of Northern Quebec where she must elude capture by an unchecked CDC, the military, and bands of impetuous survivors.",
