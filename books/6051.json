  "description": "A Dress in a Window is a collection of short stories about love, coincidences, and fate.What the readers are saying: What an enjoyable short story collection! Marie Astor has a real gift for storytelling. This collection has romance, everyday life vignettes and even a sprinkle of magic. An entertaining, fun read. While the subject of the stories varies from romance to everyday life to a bit of satire, I liked the fact that all stories share a hopeful ending, which is something that I found to be uplifting and enjoyable.A wonderful collection of short stories with real characters and substance. I just finished Lucky Charm, a contemporary romance by this author, and thought I'd give her short story collection a try. I loved the characters and the richly plotted stories.I absolutely loved this short story collection: my favorites are A Dress in a Window and A Chance Encounter. If you enjoy love stories, take a chance on A Chance Encounter and Other Stories! This is my second book by Marie Astor. I also read LUCKY CHARM and loved it as well.",
