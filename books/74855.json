Raul finds himself attracted to a wolf shifter named Sean Garcia who comes from a pack in Idaho. Even though his buddy has agreed to help him look into the shifter’s current whereabouts, Raul doesn’t have much faith that a member of the homophobic pack they’ve had problems with in the past would ever admit to being interested in him, too. Imagine Raul’s surprise when Sean shows up on his doorstep.Sean claims that Raul is his mate, which explains the attraction. Still, Sean didn’t come alone. He has an infant girl with him. Sean is the legal guardian for his niece, Lily, who is his deceased sister’s cub. Now, Raul has to decide if he’s ready for not only a relationship with a male, but a male that comes with a ready-made family. Before he can start to figure things out though, Raul is sent away on an assignment. Although the kisses are mind-blowing, will they be enough to help him overcome his fear of settling down?",
