  "description": "Javier Montez, a Captain in Santa Anna’s army, has marched across Texas, helping to quench the fires of rebellion. Javier’s wife Maria, against his wishes, has accompanied him from Mexico, to the Alamo, to, finally, a remote desolate corner of Texas called San Jacinto. In the battle of San Jacinto, Javier not only witnesses the destruction of the Mexican Army, but also his wife brutal murder at the hands of a rogue Texan Major. But the war is not over- in this historical time line Santa Anna is killed. In “Road to La Bahia”, an alternative historical novel of the Texas revolution, the story continues with a wounded Sam Houston, a ragtag army eager to fight, and thousands of Mexican soldiers still in Texas. The captured Javier Montez must now find a way to not only restore his honor, but avenge his wife’s death.",
