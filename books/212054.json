  "description": "After a breakdown at college landed Emmeline Kalberg in a mental hospital, she's struggling to get her life on track. She's back in her hometown and everyone knows she's crazy, but the twelve pills she takes every day keep her anxiety and paranoia in check. So when a voice that calls itself Escodex begins talking to Em from a box of frozen chicken nuggets, she's sure that it's real and not another hallucination. Well â€¦ pretty sure. An evil entity is taking over the employees of Savertown USA, sucking out their energy so it can break into Escodex's dimension. When her coworkers start dying, Em realizes that she may be the only one who can stop things from getting worse. Now she must convince her therapist she's not having a relapse and keep her boss from firing her. All while getting her coworker Roger to help enact the plans Escodex conveys to her though the RFID chips in the Savertown USA products. It's enough to make anyone Stay Crazy.",
