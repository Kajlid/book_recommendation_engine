I’m ready to start my new life until I discover my new neighbor is none other than Stone Walker.Super Bowl winning, NFL receiver.Stone cold fox.My high school crush.And my brother’s ex-best friend—emphasis on the ex.I know I should probably tuck tail and run, but I don’t. If Stone can handle this new living arrangement then so can I. Besides, neighbors don’t have to talk to each other. Until my best friend comes up with a plan. I should fake date Stone. After all, I have the talent, the drive, and the music. All I need is the visibility.And Stone has that in spades.I thought he would reject the plan, but he’s surprisingly on board. Now he’s showing up at my gigs with flowers and kisses me until my head spins and my knees go weak. And when he scores a touchdown and dances just for me? I want this relationship to be real. But falling in love wasn’t part of the agreement. Stone walked way from our family once and I don’t think I’m strong enough for him to do it again.
