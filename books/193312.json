  "description": "\"You're like the sun...and I'm the stupid moon. Always chasing after you.\"  I didn't know it was possible to fall so deeply into someone. To drown so strongly into their bottomless depths coming up for air was unfathomable. Until he comes along, with his sun-hot radiance, and eclipses the candle that is me. He's Lucifer before the fall, beautiful but the devil is in the way he looks at me. In the way his touch brands his name across every inch of my skin. His kisses possess my soul in the most sinful of ways.  Maddox Moore is my beginning and my end. Protector, friend, and loverâ€”he's become my sole religion. At his side I become fearless, in his arms I burn to cinders, and in worshiping him I lose myself and discover the person he sees in me. But nothing is forever. Moments are ephemeral. No matter how much you want something life inevitably reminds you that you can't have it.  I'm damaged. He's broken. We're both covered in stains. Stains that make it impossible for us to hold onto each other.
