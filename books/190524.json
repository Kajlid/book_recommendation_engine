  "description": "Billionaire shifter Aidan Carlisle rules his pack and his company with an iron fist. His wolf has never shown an interest in taking a mate, but when his estranged best friend suddenly reappears in his life, Aidan is filled with a fierce and inescapable longing... for another man.  Luke Manning has always known he and Aidan were from two different worlds. Aidan is a rich, powerful, and undeniably straight alpha, while Luke is just the blue-collar wolf who's been hopelessly in love with him for over ten years.  But Luke's feelings aren't the only thing he's kept from Aidan. Luke is an omega: A submissive male wolf with the power to drive powerful alphas mad with desire. Alphas like Aidan.  So when fate brings the two men together for an unforgettable night of passion, Luke is convinced Aidan is just reacting to the omega wolf inside of him.  And when he suddenly finds himself pregnant with Aidan's pup, he's certain it's going to spell the end of whatever might be building between them.  Now Aidan has to prove Luke is the most important thing in his life, or risk losing him--and their pup--forever.  His Secret Omega is a standalone novel with a HEA ending, a satisfying epilogue, and NO CLIFFHANGERS!  Content Warning: This book is a first time gay for you romance. It contains explicit, unprotected love scenes and male pregnancy, or Mpreg. Adults only shifter romance!",
