  "title": "Reinventing Love: How the Patriarchy Sabotages Heterosexual Relations",
  "description": "A work that seeks to redefine heterosexual relationships and give women back their voice, by the author of In Defense of WitchesAs feminist principles have taken wider hold in society, and basic ideas about equality for women can seem a given, many women still struggle in one of the most important areas of life: love. Whether itâ€™s finding a partner, seeking a commitment from one, or struggling in a relationship that is unfulfilling or even potentially abusive, women still find that deeply engrained notions of gender and behavior are obstacles to a healthy, loving relationship. Acclaimed French feminist Mona Chollet tackles some of these long-held and pervasive ideas. Drawing from popular culture, politics, and literature, Reinventing Love provides a provocative, accessible look at how heterosexual relationships can improve and evolve under a feminist lens.",
