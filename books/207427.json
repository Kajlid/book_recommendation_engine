  "description": "Once a Disciple, forever a Disciple.  After the death of her father, Ash learned an important lesson: being a Disciple is dangerous. The club her father loved, the club that had been their family, took him from her. She couldn’t stay and wait for the day it would take the man she loved from her, too. So, she left. Now, she’s the one in danger, and the Disciples are the only ones that can keep her safe. She has no choice but to return to the club and the man she left behind.  A Disciple will fight like a savage for what is his.  Sketch has what he needs: his tattooing, the club, and his bike. Anything else would require a heart, and his was ripped out of his chest a long time ago. It wasn’t coming back. At least, not until she did. His heart isn’t the only thing Ash brings with her, though. She has a daughter. A daughter old enough to be his. A daughter Ash claims might not be. But in his heart, Sketch knows the truth. That little girl is his… just like her mom.  This biker knows one thing: a Disciple’s daughter’s return is about to make his whole world shift.",
