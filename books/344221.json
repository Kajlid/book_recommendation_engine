When Teddy invites Parker to come with him on a working vacation to check out a resort his father is considering buying to add to the Fantasies chain, Parker doesn’t hesitate to go. Then an unexpected and unwelcome visitor from home arrives, and somehow Parker finds himself caught up in another one of Teddy’s wild schemes in order to get rid of her. Now Teddy’s acting strangely, Parker’s feeling things he shouldn’t be, and they’re both forced to play roles. Can their friendship survive this vacation? *This series is connected mainly by the location and can be read inany order.*",
