  "description": "The world has changed, and the United States changed with it. United in name only, the states stand in a loose confederacy of convenience, with the remains of the federal highway system the only thing that keeps them hanging together. Blacktop pirates roam the big empty, and privateers keep them at bay. If their clients can pay their rates, that is.It isn't easy making your way in this world, especially if you're a road warrior. If you've got the guts, and the stones, though, you can throw your life into the ring in Detroit. Once per year the crumbling remnants of the great automotive empire hosts Motor City Mayhem; a race to end all races. First over the line is showered with accolades, as well as offers from the richest privateers who want to boast that year's winner as part of their crew. If you cross that line after you get nothing... except the satisfaction of knowing you made it over the line at all.Ace has won a few races, and more than a few duels, in his day. There's no weight limit to Mayhem's run, but his little red death machine hasn't let him down yet. The guns are primed, and the fuel tank topped, when a woman from his past tries to tie on with him just before the big day. Does he trust Asari to have his back? Or is she trying to help someone else get over finish line first? And does she want him to lose, or does she want him scrapped along with his Gremlin that's left a trail of smashed iron and bloody bodies in its rear view mirror?",
