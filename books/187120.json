  "title": "What is Numerology?",
  "description": "It should be known that human beings by nature have a concern and a strong desire to control the future as well as to seek to prevent loss of control. Mankind by nature, seeks order in a world or in an environment where that order may be threatened. Humans look for meaning in things. They look for a well-ordered system as well as patterns. Everything has divine coding that can slowly be unravelled through Numerology. Though it is permissible in Islam, crossing the limits is unacceptable. What is meant here by transgressing pass the boundaries is when numerologists delve into impermissible acts such as Astrology, Tarot reading, psychic reading, magic, and all those sciences and occultic acts that are completely impermissible in the revealed law. Just because the human hands have divine coding in them, it does not make palm reading permissible. Just because we all have star signs, it does not render horoscopic readings permissible. There is divine wisdom in the acts that are forbidden and even the acts that are permissible within the revealed law of Islam that step beyond the comprehension of the human intellect. If we follow this religious law, we will be safe and will not be imprisoned by the ego and desires, Satan and the world. We must be free from all this. This book reveals how non-Muslims use Numerology and what Islam says about it. This book is a great starter for anyone studying comparative religion or anyone interested in seeking further knowledge in the field of numerology, which essentially spun off from mathematics.",
