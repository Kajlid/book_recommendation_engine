  "description": "In the middle of the Great Hungarian Plain, there are two graves. Each is covered by a black stone, which carry inscriptions in French. On the larger one: Jean T?n?bre, Chevalier; on the smaller: Ange T?n?bre, Priest. They are the T?n?bre brothers... On many occasions, during the last four hundred years, those graves have opened, to the terror and the horror of the surrounding country... \"The brothers T?n?bre are the Eternal Adversaries against which Eternal Champions and Thousand-Faced Heroes are pitched.\"-Brian Stableford. Paul F?val (1816-1887) was the author of numerous popular swashbuckling novels and one of the fathers of the modern crime thriller. Brian Stableford has published more than fifty novels and two hundred short stories. Knightshade was written in 1860-almost forty years before Bram Stoker's Dracula-and is one of three classic vampire stories also available from Black Coat Press.",
