  "description": "Lauren Stratford's story is one that everyone needs to read, though it deals with a subject most of us would rather not discuss, a subject that for many is too horrendous even to believe. Lauren Stratford lived a life of unending nightmares. As a small child she was offered sexually to strange men. Soon after, she was forced into a torturous routine of pornography, was controlled by mind- and body-altering drugs, and constantly received threats to her life. Though she sought help several times from adults she thought could be trusted with her secrets, no one was willing to risk becoming involved. After years of suffering what many would call the ultimate evil of sexual abuse, Lauren was held captive in the even more appalling world of Satanism and ritual abuse.Forced to participate in some of the most evil satanic rituals imaginable, Lauren was witness to shocking crimes against children and others, all performed in the name of Satan. Tormented sexually and mentally by the cult members, Lauren survived the torture because of her strong faith in God and her belief that He would deliver her from the evil of which she had become a part.It is an undisputed fact that this type of abuse occurs in the world today. Through this shocking story, anyone who is caught in the trap of sexual or ritual abuse can learn that there is a way out--that with the help of God and others, victims like Lauren can break free. Parents, counselors, law-enforcement personnel, and anyone who may know of or suspect a case of abuse will find in this book invaluable advice. Discover how the veil of such horrible abuse can be lifted for all who suffer.",
