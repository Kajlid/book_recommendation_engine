There’s Doreen who is worried about how her neighbour, Nathan Brown, is coping after his mother’s death; Eva who is suspicious about her boyfriend’s whereabouts; and Barry, who is concerned about his new employee. On top of that, Rose’s star pupil Joyce is fretting about her teenage daughter and her friends. Meanwhile, Rose’s sometime boyfriend DI Jack Pearce is investigating a series of burglaries and a spate of vicious attacks on young women in the area. As secrets get shared and the crimes become more serious, should Rose betray her friends’ confidences or will Jack just accuse her of interfering?
