  "description": "Behind her was the home she could never return to. Ahead was the shining promise of America...and love. There were times she wished she'd never come to America.Pretty, spirited Kathleen O’Connor arrives in Boston on a “coffin” ship from Ireland. She has escaped the devastating famine, but her boyfriend died at home and her parents didn’t survive the voyage to America. Still, the promise of a new life gives her hope. Patrick, a friend from the ship, finds a job for her as a maid with the wealthy Thornley family. They remind Kathleen of the landowners in Ireland who forced her from her home. She wants to despise them, but she can’t hate David Thornley, who is tender and handsome, and obviously attracted to her. Her secret love for David could force Kathleen to go back to Ireland or make her dreams for a new life in America come true.",
