  "description": "Caleb Clifford has earbuds, not real buds. And he prefers it that way.1. They always give him what he wants to hear.2. He can adjust the volume. 3. If things get tangled, it's relatively easy to straighten them out again ...Sixteen-year-old songwriter and aspiring social outcast Caleb Clifford fills his world with music, but – like most things – keeps his songs to himself. That is until his little brother leaks Caleb's most personal track online; a track that's quite obviously about his secret crush. Having his innermost feelings (accompanied by a funky bassline) go viral is not Caleb's idea of a good time. But is this the end of everything, or the start? A hilarious and touching coming-of-age debut novel from ARIA award-winning triple j host Alex Dyson about family, friends, fame, and the importance of never leaving your computer unattended.",
