  "description": "Keeping a secret this big is going to take lots of balls. Specifically, rugby balls. THE CAD Bryan Leech is a cad. Or, he *was* a cad. No one is quite certain. Once the quintessential playboy, Bryan claims he's done with wild parties and weekend benders. No more one night stands leading to mornings he can't remember; no more binges and blackouts; no more exploits plastered all over the tabloids and rag sheets. According to Bryan, he's cleaning up his act. The only problem is, no one believes him. THE CO-ED Eilish Cassidy never thought she'd be a mother at nineteen or still in college at twenty-four. Cut off from every member of her family except her favorite cousin, she's finally managed put her life back together. Stronger and wiser, Eilish enters her last semester of university determined to stand on her own. Now she just needs to find an internship. The only problem is, her best option-by far-places her directly in the path of her son's father, and he doesn't remember her at all. THE PLAN Bryan is determined to prove he's changed. Eager to settle down with the right woman, he's got his sights set on the gorgeous redhead who seems terribly familiar. Eilish is determined to hide her secret. She'll do anything to keep her child safe, even if that means ignoring her own wishes and desires. But what happens when Bryan starts to remember? And what will it take for Bryan to convince the girl he forgot that she's unforgettable?",
