But when her father dies from complications of multiple sclerosis, Paige, her mom, and two younger sisters say goodbye to that life and move to the small town of Basin Lake to live with Paige’s grandmother. Things look bleak on Paige’s first day in her new school until two boys, Evan Mattson and Garrett Hevener, promise that if she sticks with them, they’ll make Basin Lake just like home.  Eight years later, and as high school comes to a close, those two boys have become her best friends. When her life is complicated by a breakup and an unexpected change in college plans, she receives a declaration of love from one of her best friends and an offer she can’t refuse from the other. While working to put her dream of becoming a teacher back together, she’ll be faced with having to make the heartbreaking decision of which man she loves as a friend and which man she can’t live without.

When Paige Kessel enters his life in the fourth grade, he’s overcome with an interest in her that only magnifies over their years of friendship. When his best friend and high-school football star, Garrett Hevener, appears to finally be taking note as well, Evan must make a grand overture to keep Paige in his life. But Evan’s life is full of secrets, and he must decide whether or not to let her in, a decision that has the power to save or destroy their increasingly fragile relationship.
