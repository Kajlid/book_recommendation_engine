  "description": "\"Will you do me the greatest honor of all time and be my bridegroom?” she asks, hope in her eyes . . .  How did I get here? My assistant, bent on one knee, holding my hand, her expectant face waiting for an answer. Just . . . how?How did I go from being insulted by Charlee Cox to hiring her to be my assistant? How is it that she’s chaos in color - making me crazy and my life better at the same time?  I never thought I would be staring down at her bright blue eyes begging me to go along with this ridiculous scheme I suggested. Yes, I suggested. Like the idiot I am, I thought hey, why not start an HR nightmare and have my assistant ask me to marry her?  Confused? Don’t worry, so am I.  But try to follow along, because this is how I became Boss Man Bridegroom.",
