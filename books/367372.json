  "description": "\"An excellent book presenting many of the major issues of ordinary language philosophy--very readable.\"--Mark Hamilton, Ashland University\"The clarity, the wit, and the patience of the writing are liable to deceive the reader on only one point, namely the amount of hard work that lies behind these thoughts....This book is the one to put into the hands of those who have been over-impressed by Austin's critics....[Warnock's] brilliant editing puts everybody who is concerned with philosophical problems in his debt.\"--The Guardian",
