  "description": "I’m that girl. No…I’m not.  They want their title. I don’t. They’re proud to belong. I’m not. They chose this life. I didn’t…  My name is Winter Tews. I am a thief. Liar. Traitor. Con. The enemy is my lover. I am his Cutslut.  And this is my story.  Damn right she’s not that girl. They’re sugar and spice. She’s misery and sin. And I want her. Not to hold. Not to cherish. Not to love and honor and respect. I want to break her. Hurt her. Destroy her. Just like she destroyed me. She’s my brother’s sister. My enemy’s Cutslut. But soon… She’ll be mine.",
