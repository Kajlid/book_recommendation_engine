  "description": "Set on the tropical island of Mauritius, the novel tells the story of a girl and boy of French parentage. It follows their idyllic childhood together, their sexual awakening in adolescence, their separation during Virginia's education in France and the tragedy that prevents their reunion. Woven into the narrative is a sensuous evocation of an earthly paradise, together with a harmonious blend of the lyrical and the exotic that makes Paul and Virginia strikingly original.",
