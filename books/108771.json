  "description": "In MAJESTIC TWELVE MINUS ONE, acclaimed author Lance Moore (also the author of Killing JFK: 50 Years, 50 Lies) spins a riveting tale from the longstanding cover-up of UFOs. The greatest conspiracy of silence since the JFK assassination unfolds around the family of one honest scientist caught in a life-and-death ethical dilemma. Will Dr. “Blue” Bellew steal alien technology to keep his daughter alive, or will he honor his patriotic pledge of confidentiality? Will desperation and curiosity lead Jessica Bellew to dark and dangerous alliances? Palindromes, numerology and subterfuge... all underground, all awaiting the light of day.“A gripping tale, cleverly and masterfully crafted.” ~G.K. Robinson",
