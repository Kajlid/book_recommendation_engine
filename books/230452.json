  "description": "Emily Mitchell is being controlled by Joshua Smythe, AKA Abaddon, angel of the bottomless pit. Tracie Mitchell and Keisha Simmons, her niece and best friend, were banished by Abaddon and threatened with eternal torture in the Pits if they try contacting her again. Now living in the Carolinas, they meet a priest who vows to help free Emily. However, he’s really Grand Inquisitor Father Sebastien Michaelis, who’s been pursuing Abaddon’s mistresses for three centuries by performing unholy rites in direct contradiction of his church teachings. When Tracie and Keisha discover Michaelis intends killing Emily to stop her from delivering the perfect heir to Abaddon’s throne, the two are pursued by the priest as they make their way to New York to warn Emily. The two wonder if they can outrun the priest before he gets to Emily, and how they will deal with Abaddon’s wrath if they reach her in time.",
