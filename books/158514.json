In book two of the Burning Bastards MC: Jolly has been on the run for quite a while when circumstances cause her to stop and take stock in her life. She finds a job and a friend to lean on, the only drawback—the men who are constantly around. Demon and Knight know trouble when they see it. And it comes in the form of a woman who brings a lot of things out of them. Things they don't want to feel. They know she is carrying secrets and even with the club having its own troubles right now, there is no way they can leave Jolly alone. While they know they need to concentrate on a deadly threat to the Bastards, they also need to make a decision about the woman who has them considering changing their ways. Jolly feels she can't trust anyone, money talks and when a predator is as powerful as the one chasing her wants something done, money can talk louder than she can scream. How can she trust a gang of bikers whose only loyalty is to their own—even if the two that have self-appointed themselves her future demand she does. Words: 67,410",
