  "description": "Channon Beaumont has so much to be grateful for. An amazing Dom (who is also an amazing boyfriend), kinky friends, and people who care for him. What more could he possibly want?  Jack never expected to find someone like Channon, and now that he has, he's working on a plan to keep him.  In Season Four of His Boy Next Door, Channon and Jack must determine what they want from each other in the long term, and not just in the bedroom. What started out as kinky fun has grown into the kind of love you only find once in a lifetime, but if they want to make it last, they're going to have to be honest with each other and themselves.",
