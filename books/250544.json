  "description": "It's tough to be an out-of-work princess.After her royal father decides to retire and become a wood carver, Princess Paulina has no idea what to do with herself. She can't survey the kingdom from her leaky cottage roof, and no one waves back when she proceeds through the town on her father's cart.When she hears that a neighboring queen is seeking a bride for her son, Prince Drupert, Paulina sees her chance to get back to princessing.  But it will take all her wit and determination to pass the Queen's tests. . . . and in the end, maybe there are better fates than a royal marriage.Full of tongue-in-cheek references to stories like Rapunzel, Snow White, and the Princess and the Pea, this fractured fairy tale is an hilarious twist on traditional tales in which a young woman's practicality, good humor, and intelligence let her shape her own happy ending— with extra cheese and all the toppings her heart desires.",
