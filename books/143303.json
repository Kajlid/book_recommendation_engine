  "title": "Drifting into Darkness",
  "description": "I’m a firm believer that everything happens for a reason, that there was a path we were all supposed to be on and the choices we made led us to those paths.  My path led me to work on the Johnson farm in Texas, where I met Landon, the owner’s son. He worked there during the day and raced cars for fun at night. He was a bad boy with a reputation that exceeded my own. The guy all the girls wanted to change, the one that hooked up with random girls because he didn’t do relationships.  He was exactly the kind of guy I wanted to stay away from, but there was something about him. It wasn’t just his looks, although they didn’t go unnoticed. There were layers I wanted to peel back and reveal. I wanted to know the real Landon Johnson.  All the choices I made led me to him and he would change my life forever.  *17 and older due to language and sexual content*",
