  "description": "I’m rarely a man who mixes business with pleasure but when I find myself hypnotized by a beautiful woman at the nightclub, I make the time to enjoy the finer things in life. Like having a quickie in the linen closet. Fast forward two weeks when that same magnificent woman shows up to my office, ready to work for my law firm as our new attorney. Everything inside me screams I should step back and forget the girl that I haven’t been able to get out of my head, but it’s nearly impossible when she’s working in the office directly across from me. Her professional attitude and sexy attire do nothing to keep the inappropriate thoughts out of my head. But when a sexual harassment lawsuit from a former employee falls into my lap, I’m forced to walk away or risk losing everything I’ve worked so hard for. Lust isn’t anything to worry about. It’s love you have to watch out for. It’ll bite you in the ass at the least opportune time.",
