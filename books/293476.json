  "title": "Create Dangerously: The Power and Responsibility of the Artist",
  "description": "“To create today means to create dangerously. Every publication is a deliberate act, and that act makes us vulnerable to the passions of a century that forgives nothing.” In 1957, Nobel Prize-winning philosopher Albert Camus gave a speech entitled \"Create Dangerously,\" effectively a call to arms for artists, in particular those who came from an immigrant background, like he did. Camus understood the necessity of those making art as a part of civil society. A bold cry for artistic freedom and responsibility, his words today remain as timely as ever. In this new translation, Camus's message, available as a stand-alone little book for the first time, will resonate with a new generation of writers and artists.",
