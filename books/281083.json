  "description": "A deadly alien arena isn’t the place to fall in love…  For the last three years, Special Agent Aria Taylor’s nights have been filled with images of battling alien beings in a foreign land with purple skies and two suns. She thought they were just strange nightmares, but when a therapist suggests lucid dreaming, she wakes to find herself trapped in an alien arena, forced to fight in gruesome, deadly tournaments as one of their gladiators.  She needed to escape that place and make her captors pay… but if she’s going to have any chance of success, she needs help.  Hazy memories push her to find two males. She doesn’t know their names, or where they’re from, but she recognizes them the moment she sees them, and her heart tells her they are hers just as much as she is theirs.  Together Aria, Tirox, and Kix fight to free the beings enslaved with them and take down the Overlord, all while trying to understand the soul-deep bond they share.  A deadly alien arena isn’t the place to fall in love, but Aria isn’t sure she can help herself.",
