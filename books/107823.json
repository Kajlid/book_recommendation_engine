  "title": "Somebody on This Bus Is Going to Be Famous",
  "description": "Nine ordinary kids ride the same yellow school bus every day-but only one of them is about to be famous.Each of the nine students on Mrs. B's school bus holds a clue to the mystery of the empty bus stop. Spencer's the smart kid. Shellly's the diva. Matthew's just average (so far). In fact, there's nothing about any of the nine middle-schoolers on Mrs. B's bus route that screams \"fame,\" but before the end of the school year, somebody on this bus is going to be famous.Part detective story, part tale of self-discovery, this funny and touching novel told from nine very different points of view is destined to be a modern classic.",
