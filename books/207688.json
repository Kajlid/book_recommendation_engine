  "description": "Have you ever asked, \"God, where are you? How could you let this happen to me? How can something good ever come out of this horrible situation?\"These were the questions Patricia Jones asked God during the 133 days her baby spent in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) fighting for her life. The faith Patricia had stood on most of her life would be challenged when she found herself questioning God’s promise, plan, and purpose.In this moving memoir, Jones writes about her family's search for answers and the miracles they experienced in the midst of the biggest storm of their lives. She learned to walk out her faith – not just quote Biblical verses. This is a story of how faith, hope and love helped one family triumph over pain, and the hidden treasures they discovered during their journey.Jones reminds us that God can truly work miracles and that the lessons we learn from our most difficult trials can bring us the greatest joy and peace of heart.",
