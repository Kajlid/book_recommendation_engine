  "description": "ON THE WAY TO MEET HER HUSBAND Young, beautiful Italian mail-order bride Angelina D'Alessandro is married by proxy to an older man she's never met-her only chance to escape the poverty of Italy for the hope of a new life in America. But to join him in the wilderness of Idaho in 1899 she's not allowed to travel alone. Now she's torn between duty and desire as she fights her growing attraction to her handsome and enigmatic escort. SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER ESCORT Mine owner and explosives expert Tonio Domani prefers to travel alone. In his line of work he can't afford distractions. Against his better judgment he's coerced into playing chaperone to a beautiful and tempting bride. The dangers he faces daily in his mine are real and the increasingly volatile powder keg of North Idaho's mining country makes his return there even more dangerous. But what scares him most is the rising passion he feels for Angelina and the danger of losing his heart to her.",
