As an organization dedicated to the advancement of science, it ran afoul of the Church, yet still survives in the third millennium. In those three and a half centuries, the Academy has grown into a global construct and is viewed by rivals as the French Mafia, replete with assassins and slaves, while it awaits the rebirth of its avatar, Prince Raphael. Dr. Sean Shadden, an author, a fashion and furniture designer, and the world's foremost authority on the Franks, is also a Foreman for the Academy. During his tenure he has elected two hundred and ninety nine women into the Academy as sex slaves. His own Master, and director of the Academy, Phillipe Lafayette, insists he go after the last one of his career. She is Lady Dragon. Unwittingly, Sean pursues her, his own interest in her being the similarities to his beloved ex-wife. In fact, in his condition, compromised by the neglect of his Master and the demands of his job, he begins to believe that she is his ex-wife, and the long-held fantasy that she would return has materialized.",
