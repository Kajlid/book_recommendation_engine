  "description": "In this fresh, addictive novel from the author of Tiffany Sly Lives Here Now , an aspiring musician is forced to reunite with her ex–best friend―who just happens to be the world’s biggest teen star. Dylan Woods hasn’t seen her best friend, Langston, in years. After he moved to Los Angeles, he ghosted her. Then he became Legendary, the biggest teen R&B artist on the planet. For the most part, Dylan has moved on, with her sights set on Juilliard. But when her parents announce that Langston is coming for a short stay with them, the entire family is thrilled. Except for Dylan. The idea of sharing a house with music’s biggest bad boy makes her stomach churn. But maybe Langston hasn’t changed as much as Dylan thought―he’s kept the bucket list they made together years ago. As they start checking off items on the list, Dylan starts to remember old times, her previous self, and their shared love of music. And there’s something else. As Dylan considers giving Langston another chance, she starts to realize that maybe her feelings for him go beyond friendship. Maybe, just maybe, she’s falling for her ex–best friend.",
