  "description": "Raya’s burgeoning psychic and time-travel powers could freak anybody out. But they're that much weirder when you're an emotionally wounded, smart-mouthed, foster kid. After accidentally flinging herself to 1645 England amidst their deadliest witch trials, along with an equally smart-aleck talking cat, people try to help her come home. But instead she sticks her fingers in it again, and transports to 1645 Istanbul, where life is leaps and bounds beyond England. There she meets extraordinary historical figures as well as ordinary people. She starts to let love in, and begins to heal. “Raya’s bittersweet memories of her mother are absolutely heartbreaking and serve as an important touchstone for readers who may have experienced similar trauma. The author’s talent for balancing real-world issues with adrenaline-pumping exploits through time (including a perilous sojourn to 17th-century Istanbul) is impressive, as are her richly detailed descriptions of various people and places.”Kirkus Reviews – Verdict: Get it.",
