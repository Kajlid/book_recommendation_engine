One thing I didn’t anticipate, was her and the permanent wicked gleam in her eye.Anastasia Exley was so much more than I expected. One thing I knew for certain was that she was all that I wanted. I didn’t care if she felt the same way. I knew I had to have her from the moment I laid eyes on her and I would’ve done whatever it took to have her.And, it worked. She was mine. Or maybe, it was the other way around and I was hers. She had a hold over me, one that I hadn’t expected. Our bond was something that I never imagined could be real. The more time we spent together the closer we grew, the more unattainable my desire for her became.I thought the hard part was over, I thought we were ready for our happily ever after. Obviously, I was wrong. I will not back down.I will find her.I will not lose my happily ever after.",
