  "description": "In this second installment of the ‘League of Ascenders’ series we return to the town of Evergreen where yet another troublesome demon is up to no good. The now twelve Ascenders have been informed of a level-three demon that they thought had been done away with years before, and are forced to try and find him before he wreaks havoc upon them. Love is most certainly in the air, as Larimar has finally arrived at The Landing, and when she and London are not arguing, they’re teleporting to distant lands where they often find themselves in precarious situations. Brandolyn is forced to confront her past before she can move forward with Vaughn; Stevie—frightened by the prospect of love—rejects Flynn until disaster strikes; Noah struggles to understand that he cannot leave his beloved Mina behind to keep her safe; and Bailey learns to get out of his own way when it comes to winning Quinne. Grab your favorite hot drink, curl up in your cozy spot, and prepare to get swept away, because your favorite characters are all back. Join the Ascenders, Gabriel, Honor, Gash, Fish-the-Cat, and those two pesky birds, Pasha and Shiver, in another romantic supernatural adventure with a flying cruise ship, fantastic creatures, a masquerade ball, exotic places, and the battle of good against evil—and get ready for a surprise ending!",
