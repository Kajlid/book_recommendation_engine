Her life in Paris was safe, with a devoted if slightly smug boyfriend and a career that was slowly taking off. When she first meets the man calling himself Constantine she can’t see him and his voice is disguised. Even so, she feels a distinct, erotic pull that horrifies her.Con has no use for relationships, particularly with a reporter. But he can’t get Maddy Banks out of his mind, and when he runs into her later that evening he can’t resist playing with fire. Neither of them had any idea how brightly it would burn.",
