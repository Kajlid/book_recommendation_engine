  "description": "Life is never what it seems. From the time he took the job with Allen Brooke Inc., Luke’s life had gone from one incredible challenge to the next. In the blink of an eye they transitioned him from writing training manuals for a new game, to putting his very life on the line for the company. He was quickly realizing that the product was no game at all, and that it had far more uses and dangers for society than he could have ever imagined. And he was clearly not alone in that understanding. Secret societies and government intelligence agencies were now looking intently into it, and into anyone who was involved with it. His professional and personal life was suddenly thrust into a deadly battle between two political and religious ideologies that he didn't understand but he needed to grasp if he had any chance to stop the religious genocide that one of them had planned. He would need to use every resource his body could call upon, including the most important one that he had yet to learn how to use… The Eyes of his Heart .",
