  "description": "Dakota Bombay prided himself on his blond Bond image---bad-guy killer by day, lady-killer by night. Then his life gets both shaken and stirred by an irate grandmother demanding a marketing plan for the family assassination business, a precocious six-year-old son Dak never knew he had, and a mysterious redhead who's erased his decades-old preference for blondes.Suddenly the perennial playboy is knee deep in pie charts and thinking he may have found the perfect mom for his boy. She's smart, funny, and directs a funeral home no less---what could be better? Now if he can just take out a team of rival assassins without getting killed himself, they can all live trigger-happily ever after.",
