Traversing through the prisms of their lives, the characters stumble and scatter into myriad colours. They hum hopeful songs, finding solace and redemption only through a pilgrimage of sorrow! Pilgrims of Sorrow is a mosaic of tiny mirrors from broken hearts and if you find little reflections of your own longing soul, don't be surprised!",
