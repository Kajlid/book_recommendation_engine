  "description": "It’s the year 2004 A.D.JuandreAt twenty-two, my existence was crusty. It was a Friday afternoon when I was racing like the Red Queen down the interstate from New York to Lexington, Kentucky, feeling like I would never reach my destination and, simultaneously, reluctant to start my life as a straight-married man and a father-to-be. When I crossed the bridge at the Ohio River, I swung my sexy sports car over to the first R&G (rainbow and glitter) establishment for a martini or three. One olive turned into several before I returned to the highway, wired and waving off my newfound besties, whom I will probably never see again. Their enthusiastic motivational pep talks convinced me to take a chance, find the man of my dreams and ask for what I wanted. This book contains male/male sex between consenting adults, all eighteen years or older. This book is not intended for people under eighteen.
