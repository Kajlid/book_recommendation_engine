But when a rogue agent of the enigmatic organization introduces numerous threats to the social hygiene of existence, the future of the world teeters on the edge of cataclysmic change. Now as the hour of chaos approaches. The Hand's only chance of success rests on the shoulders of their greatest agent, a man who is traumatically fixed in a hypnotic state in which he believes himself to be a fat, balding, middle-aged loser with an addiction to porn.
