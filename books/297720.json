  "description": "Everyone knows Bryan Kincaid.He’s the guy you wear a hazmat suit around... while carrying a long range cattle prod to enforce a little distance.Add a Clorox bath to those precautions, toss a little salt over your shoulder, and a girl could probably walk away from his bed without contracting a nasty case of the clap.Well, that’s the word on the street according to my best friend - aka: Bryan’s former lover, and current scorned woman.Despite this being a small town, I’ve never met the guy. However, his reputation precedes him, and I know for a fact he’d love to add my name to his long list of conquests.I would be the perfect trophy for the competitive fighter.I could give in to temptation - because, let’s face it, he’s sexy, dangerous, and exudes confidence - but going there would land me in a world of trouble from those closest to me.To bag a Kincaid is the ultimate no-no in my family. But if I break girl-code, I might just find out what makes this brooding, quick-witted stranger tick.Am I ready to play with no limits?If I don’t play, I won’t win, but it would be foolish of me to think he’ll be as easy as he thinks I am.Two families. Two grudges. One winner.",
