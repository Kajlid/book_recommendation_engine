  "title": "Jeremy Owl",
  "description": "Jeremy is a 10 year old science geek who's just trying to get by. When the two bullies grab the owl pellets Jeremy's found in the woods, he loses all hope of studying them under his teacher's microscope. But when Lorelei Eversole, the school cuckoo, steps in, she wins the pellets back. When Jeremy discovers a mysterious, glittering bone inside one of the pellets - a discovery that even a braniac like him can't figure out - he must admit that Lorelei might not be as dopey as she seems. A flying pig, enchanted pies, and a wild adventure all show Jeremy that science has its limits. And that sometimes magic turns up in the most unusual places.",
