  "description": "If you haven't yet read the first book of this series: REQUISITION FOR: A THIEF - Book 1 - A Dimaond for the Taking DO NOT READ THIS SYNOPSIS!!! It would be a spoiler for Book 1.Book 2--The Second Book in the Three-Book Pilot of the REQUISITION FOR: A THIEF Series  The unlikely, no...the unbelievable has happened: Un-catchable International Jewel Thief Gregg Hadyn has been caught.  Expecting to spend the next fifteen years in a federal penitentiary, Gregg is pleasantly surprised when covert Strategic Intelligence Unit (SIU) Director Denny Garret gives him an offer too good to refuse: the opportunity to serve his sentence outside of prison--stealing for the U.S. Government.  In love with Carly Macklin, the SIU's profiler, but hopeless that she'll ever trust him, Gregg puts his genius mind to work on finding a way to escape. As he becomes immersed with helping the SIU fight the current international threat, however, Gregg is surprised by his growing feelings of fondness for the team, and even...gasp!...a beginning trust for Director Denny Garret.  As Gregg begins to embrace his place in the SIU, he encounters a new hurdle to this law-abiding destiny and is once again confronted with a life-changing decision: Should he continue to trust Denny Garret, the former fed he was raised to despise, or make a run for it back to his un-law-abiding lifestyle?  If you like books, tv shows, and movies (such as \"Leverage,\" \"White Collar,\" It Takes a Thief,\" \"To Catch a Thief,\" \"Catch Me if you Can,\" \"The Italian Job,\" and \"Oceans 11, 12, & 13\") that portray thieves/non-violent criminals as the heroes, you'll love the REQUISITION FOR: A THIEF series. Look for the final book in the pilot for the series in February, 2013.",
