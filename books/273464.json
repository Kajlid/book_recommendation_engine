  "description": "Four gorgeous college football players changed this art student’s world forever. They make me tremble, beg for more—and they inspire my artist’s soul. I belong to them now. And I’m never turning back.  The top five art school sins are:  1. Stealing someone else’s work 2. Not having an original idea 3. Drawing yourself nude 4. Being attracted to any of the muscular, gorgeous models  I'm a good girl. I've always followed the rules, but now, all bets are off. But it's not just about one guy... it's a whole team of men. First there's Diego, the perfect specimen who models for my art class and puts me under his spell. Then Trevor, a Golden Retriever of a man; cuddly and loving. Zeke, who is the perfect boyfriend: s*xy, sweet and fits me perfectly. And Spencer, the leader of them all—the one who connects with my soul. I could never choose between them. Luckily, I don't have to. They share everything from a schedule, to a dorm room to, well, me. Can this ever be more than just a fling? Can we take this team to the final touchdown?  This is a steamy standalone 60,000 word novel with a HEA, and no cheating!",
