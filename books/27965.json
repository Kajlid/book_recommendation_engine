  "description": "To Jess, it’s a Friday morning like any other. The weather is freaking cold, Katie’s nose junk is freezing to her face, and the boys are trying to kill each other. You know…typical stuff.After speeding her kids into their only vehicle she flips the key – the car won’t start. Unfortunately, this is the least of her problems. Today isn’t a normal Friday.Next, she finds out that her husband might lose his job. It’s more than just a job though. It connects to everything. The bills, the furniture, her dreams. This dream, the one she’s been saving for isn’t about a vacation, or a new dress. She wants to visit her dying father for the last time. She’s faced with a choice, one that no one should have to make. She has to choose between supporting her distraught parents, or securing that meager savings for her now unemployed family.How will she find the strength to do the right thing? Maybe it will come from the last place she expects. Maybe she just needs a little push.It didn’t snow often here. A random adventure might be just the thing to lift my spirits.I quickly stuck the two dozen on the cookie sheet in the oven. We had fifteen minutes. “Let's go.”Bundled up again, we soon stood in the driveway trying to catch a few flakes with our tongues. The snow fell lightly, dusting the ground and our hair with a thin layer of white. The cars, mailboxes, even the trash cans, sparkled, their tops adorned with a million fragile jewels.As my children smiled with delight and laughed, which always made me tingly inside, it became clear to me that I would remember this moment forever.Yep, another one of those moments. They usually hit me at random—maybe it was a birthday, or even something totally mundane. One second I’d be standing there, then wham, and my mind would take a picture.",
