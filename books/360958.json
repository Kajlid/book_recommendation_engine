  "title": "Girl Crush: Women's Erotic Fantasies",
  "description": "Every woman has a girl crush  that physical and emotional fascination with another intriguing, provocative woman who inspires the thought, \"What if?\" Girl Crush answers that question with an inspiring range of erotic short stories about women acting on their desire and sometimes getting more than they bargained for. Teresa Lamai offers an erotic take on revenge in \"Mirador,\" when a woman has hate sex in a nightclub bathroom with the person her boyfriend is cheating on her with. In \"Getting to Work,\" David Erlewine writes about a hot young lawyer who has a lot of work to do to make a demanding, sex-craved partner happy. Writer and editor Rachel Kramer Bussel shows us the unexpected in \"Great Lengths,\" when an unrequited crush finally evolves into something more  and something less. In Girl Crush, what happens next is always a surprise, to straight women, bisexual women, and lesbians alike.",
