  "description": "As she circles her mate, a stalker is watching and planning revenge.Human, shifter, or somewhere in between, women are beautiful creatures to Derek Taylor. Makes it nice to have a werewolf alpha as a best friend, which opens up a whole new realm of hookup possibilities. The only turnoff would be one of them claiming he s her mate.One look at the alpha s cousin, though, and all he can think about is her body wrapped around him, her lips wherever she feels like putting them. If the cues she s throwing off are any indication, sooner or later he ll have her. All five-foot-three of her.Paige Treyhorn has little use for men, particularly the one who keeps leaving her gifts and anonymous notes insisting she s his mate. Yet when the scent of the one man truly meant for her assaults her senses, she nearly climbs over everyone in her way at the restaurant to get to him.Now begins the convincing a playboy human he s a shifter s mate. But things get complicated and dangerous when she realizes Derek hasn t been the one leaving the notes.\" This title contains violence, graphic language, sex with a shape-shifting female, and appropriate and inappropriate use of trees, porch swings and walls.\"\"",
