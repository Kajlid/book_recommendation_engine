  "description": "Getting there is half the fun with this pair, and along the way (past an electrical tower they think is the Eiffel Tower), Minnie and Moo pick up a busload of equally adventurous animal friends from nearby Africa World, careen through a car wash they believe is China, and find themselves trading stories under a night sky in what they hope is America. The power and appeal of story itself has rarely been funnier—or sweeter—than in this slapstick extravaganza.",
