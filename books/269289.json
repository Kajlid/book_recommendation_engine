  "description": "An Introduction to Celebrity Protection and Touring offers a peek behind the scenes of the close protection industry, more commonly known as the bodyguard business. More than the stereotypical bullet blocker, the modern protection specialist is a skilled practitioner who utilizes verbal judo much more than its physical counterpart. This book, written by industry experts, Elijah Shaw and United States Secret Service Agent, Dale June (Ret.), also narrows the focus, centering in on an exciting, but misunderstood, sector that involves working with celebrities ranging from actors to musicians and entering into their world of touring, filming and promotional appearances. While many may think that celebrity protection is one size fits all, nothing could be further from the truth, as you are not only dealing with the protection of the client, but the client's reputation. All this with the added pressure of the entire world looking over your shoulder, just waiting for a misstep. With real world advice, tactics and techniques on how to identify and defeat potential attackers, as well as covering everything from dealing with overzealous fans, to hyper-aggressive paparazzi, this book offers proven solutions from two experts that have covered the gambit from the Grammy Awards to the White House.",
