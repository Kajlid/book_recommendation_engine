  "description": "‘Everyone has their price, Olivia.’ ‘There isn’t enough money in the world to persuade me to marry you.’  Beckett. Let me count the ways I loathe him.  1. He’s the bane of my existence. 2. A thorn in my side. 3. I’m pretty sure he’s the devil in disguise  Or he at least has him on speed-dial.  So why am I standing here, bouquet in hand, about to become his wife?  He calls it a business proposition. I call it blackmail. He says our fighting is foreplay. I say he should be on meds. He says he has the power to destroy my company, I say with a husband like him, who needs enemies.  But I can survive this six-month calamity.  All I have to do is keep hating him . . .   To Have and Hate includes an older hot Brit, a marriage of convenience, and is a hate-to-love fest, full of fire, fun, and smexytimes!>",
