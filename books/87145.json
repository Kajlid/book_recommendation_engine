  "description": "Uncrossable rivers, hospitable nomads, rabid dogs, marijuana fields, hailstone flashfloods, maidens on horseback, underpants wrestling, toxic mountaintop lakes, stupid westerners, and so much mountain biking your ass will hurt just reading itIn July 2010, Tom Doig and his best friend Tama Pugsley cycled 1487 kilometers (920 miles) across northern Mongolia from a small town called Moron to a smaller town, also called Moron. Why? Because there were two towns called Moron, and they were two morons. It had to be done. Armed with spandex unitards, an inadequate phrasebook, and Chinese steel-frame bikes of a brand you've never heard of, Tom and Tama's mission over the barren steppes and rugged mountains of Mongolia is an outrageously absurd odyssey, taking place in one of the world's most remote and beautiful wildernesses. This hilarious, dangerous, at-times-idiotic adventure overflows with sweat, mud, unidentifiable meat product, and torrents of Chinggis Khaan vodka. A travel book like no other, this tale has it all: pleasure, pain, heartache, heartburn, and the dried fermented milk of a horse.",
