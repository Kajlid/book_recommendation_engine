  "description": "\"Remarkably powerful, gripping, and chilling medical thriller\" - Daily Express\"Thoughful, chilling, funny, tantalizing - lays out big issues without ever losing its power to grip and appal\" - Time OutTo Edinburgh surgeon Alistair Kingsley, medicine is a science. So, when a dishevelled Indian mystic identifies him as the messiah of his ancient Hindu sect, and claims to have endowed him with the healing touch, Kingsley dismisses him as a harmless crank. When evidence suggests mysterious \"cures\" among patients he has merely examined, Kingsley retalliates with cold, hard reason; until an incurable illness strikes the person dearest to him, and his logical world starts to unravel. \"An absolutely outstanding storyteller\" - Daily Telegraph",
