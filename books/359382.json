  "description": "Valentina Richards’ sexual escapades are the stuff of legends. As a 23-year-old woman, who is confident in her sexuality and unafraid of taking risks, she believes that she’s living life to the fullest, the only way she knows how.Parents would say that Val is a bad girl, a promiscuous heathen who their children should steer clear of, but what do they know? Unlike them, Val isn't sitting around judging people like her who choose to live their lives with passion. She's too busy taking chances and forming strong connections in the real world. And if her actions lead to hilarious consequences, even better! At least her life will never be dull.When Val takes the biggest risk of all and gives in to her growing attraction to best friend Mandy, she finds out that there’s more at stake than she anticipated. Mandy is a pure-hearted breath of fresh air, sweet and innocent, and non-judgemental of Val’s promiscuity. But does Mandy see her as just a friend?To find out if the attraction is mutual, Val decides that she must corrupt her innocent best friend. She hopes that they can come out of it unscathed, closer than ever. But there’s also the small matter of Val still being entangled with resident bad boy and alpha male Mr Hall, none other than Mandy’s father. Could this drive a wedge between the two best friends?",
