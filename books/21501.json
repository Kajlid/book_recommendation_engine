  "title": "The Organic Home Garden",
  "description": "In The Organic Home Garden, Patrick and John, take readers step-by-step through the engaging process of growing the best possible food - from spring's fi rst spinach, asparagus and salad greens, through the summer abundance of tomatoes, cucumbers, melons and all, right into fall's harvest of squash, leeks, carrots and potatoes. Often, a small timely tip makes all the difference, and this dynamic team leaves nothing out. Whether you tend a small city yard, a full-size country garden or something in between, their instructive, easy to follow and often humorous advice will ensure you make the very best use of the space you have -- and you can't get any more local, seasonal and organic than food from your own yard. Combine this with John's unique and vibrant artistic paintings, and you have a book that stands out from the wall of glossy, manufactured gardening publications, making The Organic Home Garden a stand-alone, stand-out book sure to intrigue and capture gardeners, artists and customers who conduct their lives to a different rhythm.",
