  "title": "Come Again, Pelican",
  "description": "From the creator of Corduroy, a newly restored classic picture book that celebrates a child’s bond with the natural world. Every summer Ty’s family came to camp in their trailer at the same beautiful spot on the white sand dunes by the ocean. And every year, as long as Ty could remember, the same old pelican had welcomed them. This year, as soon as the trailer was parked, Ty pulled on his shiny red wading boots and ran with his fishing pole to look for his friend. “Be sure not to lose those new boots of yours,” his father said. And Ty didn’t – not really. But by the time the tide had quietly crept in and as gently flowed out again, some surprising things had happened and both he and the pelican had made unexpected catches. What could they have been to make both boy and bird so happy when each swapped his catch with the other? Pictures full of space and light and the shining colors of sky and sand and sea help to tell the delightful story of Ty's adventurous afternoon.",
