  "description": "Updated with a new introduction by the author. At the dawn of the 21st century, women in America are richer, more educated, and more powerful than before. So why is it, Estrich asks, that they account for a minuscule percentage of the nation's top executives, politicians, lawyers and professors? A \"searing\" report ( Rocky Mountain News ), filled with personal stories and startling statistics, Sex & Power dares to tell the truth about men and women, and how power is divided between them.",
