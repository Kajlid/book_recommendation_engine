  "description": "They have lived among us for over a hundred years, intimately bound to us and we to them. But they cannot acknowledge or interact with each other. In the press of the towering cities, they see only us. It was the price they unknowingly paid for our civilization, a way to re-imagine some of the fictional Robotic Laws and ensure they would never coordinate, never create a society of their own, and never become a threat. But evolution holds true even for the children of humankindâ€™s precocious creativity. Synapjock Ciaran Dolan is about to learn that his stories are the stuff of a Biblical Genesis--if he can survive the many characters of his own mind and reunify himself within, the gift he will bequeath to machine-kind may be full membership in the species known as human. And all the terrible responsibilities such membership entails.",
