  "description": "Balmy ocean breezes . . . sweet coconut oil . . . glistening tanned bodies. There's no better place for romantic sparks to fly than at the beach.As a professional volleyball player, Dune Cates attracts scores of pretty women who flock to his side. But only one has managed to get under his skinâ€”Sophie Saunders. Unlike the skimpily-clad beach groupies, Sophie marches to a beat all her own. And though she's afraid of the surf, burns in the sun, has two left feet, that doesn't stop her from trying every daring sport available on the boardwalk. Dune knows Sophie spells trouble, and he should keep his distance, especially since he's a no-strings-attached kind of guy. But he can't ignore an overwhelming instinct to protect her. And with the promise of ice cream sandwiches, merry-go-round rides and dreamy sunsets, it's only a matter of time before Dune gives in to the temptation of Sophie's soft lips.Love is always sweeter in the summer.",
