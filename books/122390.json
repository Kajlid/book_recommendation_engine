  "description": "This interview with the man who ‘sort of’ invented time travel is a touching story of love, regret, loss, and the hope for redemption. Nearing the end of his life, wealthy 'time travel' inventor Marcus Hollister—famously known for creating the technology behind Vacations in Time —wishes to tell his story to a hopeful young reporter, Jessica Matthews. Why her? Wy now? She was most interested in his motivations for creating a means of time travel, how it came to be nothing more than a recreational tool, and why he shut down the multi-trillion-dollar business it spawned. Their one-hour meeting stretched into three days, in which they discovered some secrets were best kept buried.",
