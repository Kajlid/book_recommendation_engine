  "description": "Dove Rosetta is crushing hard on the hot guy she ran into at the coffee shop. His big build, sharp suits, and dark eyes have her flustered, and as luck would have it, they meet by chance every day. She might be innocent, but her thoughts aren’t, and she’s ready for him to make a move.  Beau Heart has been watching her for weeks. It’s no accident that he sees Dove every day and he’s tired of playing it cool. He’s done with gentle and patient. He’s grumpy, and now it’s time for dirty and fast.  Warning: This Valentine’s story is filled with alpha possessiveness and rough need. Good things come to those who wait, but great things come to those who claim. Get ready!",
