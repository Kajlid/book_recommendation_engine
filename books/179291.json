  "description": "For 10-year-old Mandy, the old stone orphanage was the only home she remembered. Matron Bridie was kind to her, but there were 30 children to look after, and sometimes Mandy felt there was something missing. One day Mandy climbed over the high orphanage wall and found a tiny, deserted cottage in the woods. Here at last was her very own home. All through the spring, summer, and fall, Mandy worked to make it truly hers. Sometimes she \"borrowed\" things she needed from the orphanage. Sometimes, to guard her secret, she even lied. Then one stormy night at the cottage, Mandy got sick, and no one knew how to find her, except a special friend she didn't know she had.",
