  "description": "Sexual Possession:‘The state of being dominated or controlled by a nonphysical entity seeking to impulse the possessed into behaviors which will create sexual energy for the express purpose of absorbing and feeding off of it.’ This unique booklet peels back the layers to reveal a hidden world with often dubious motivations. Sex is one of our most primal drives. Without it we simply wouldn’t be here in physical form. The most prevalent yet least explored supernatural phenomenon is sexual possession. Erotic energy is the psychic rocket fuel all entities are after- but why?Ghost Hunters and other paranormal enthusiasts are targets for the unseen denizens of the astral realm. Sexual energy is not just about physical intercourse; it’s the cosmic juice that creates universes. Learn how ghosts manipulate flesh and blood beings into generating this energy to siphon it off for their own creative agendas. True possession is not pea soup and spinning heads. It’s actually far more subtle and ominous; something that occurs more often than you’d think and alters the trajectories of millions of lives. Are you looking for a fascinating interpretation of what is occurring beneath the surface of our physical reality? Do you want the tools to protect yourself from sexual possession? I’ve been living with this condition for over 20 years and will show you how to detect and neutralize the efforts of sexual vampires among us.",
