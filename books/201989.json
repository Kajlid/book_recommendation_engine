While Moshe and his Jewish troops risk their lives to open the Arab-held pass of Bab el Wad for a food convoy to save their people, David and Ellie search the Mediterranean for a freighter loaded with weapons for the Muslim Jihad and the bands of Arab soldiers who still vow to drive the Jews into the sea. And Rachel's mother-heart yearns over her fever-ravaged infant....BOUND BY DESTINY YET OVERWHELMED BY ODDS, IS THERE ANY \"LIGHT IN ZION\"?",
