  "description": "The purpose in publishing this edition of The Pilgrim’s Progress is to carry forward this treasured legacy for a new generation. With this as the objective, the text of this edition has only been lightly edited—to update archaic words and difficult sentence structure, while retaining the beauty and brilliance of the original story, and to let the story unfold with all the power, truth, and remarkable creativity of the original. It is our hope and prayer, then, that the following pages will fascinate and captivate the hearts and minds of this generation today, as was the case when The Pilgrim’s Progress was first published more than three centuries ago.",
