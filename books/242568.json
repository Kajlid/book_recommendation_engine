  "description": "When Lord Harrington mysteriously leaves the London season much too early, he sets tongues wagging. He would wager he will never marry. His mother, frustrated that neither of her sons can seem to settle down, insists on a house party where only carefully selected guests have been invited. She would never be so vulgar as to wager. The young lady Lord Harrington was courting is distraught that he left without proposing marriage. When she receives a coveted invitation to the house party, she views it as her chance to triumph. This paragon would wager she will be Countess of Harrington by Christmas. When an unwanted guest shows up, wagers of the mostâ€¦interesting kind are made. Especially when anonymous letters begin to be exchanged. Fans of Sarah Eden, Georgette Heyer, and yes, even Jane Austen, will love this witty Regency romance.",
