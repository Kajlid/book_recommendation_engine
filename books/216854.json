  "description": "\"How's your vision?\" he asked, trying to feel her out. \"I'm obviously not blind,\" she huffed and crossed her arms. Apparently her eyes were a sore spot. He could see how people might assume she was blind. Her eyes were translucent in a way he'd never seen before. \"I didn't think you were. I think you see better than most people.\" He saw the color in her face drain out before she bolted up looking at the exit. \"Stay. Please,\" he asked softly, leaning across the table. \"I need your help.\" Rosie has an affliction her family refuses to talk about. One that killed her grandmother, one that will likely kill her. Diagnosis: being psychic. Rather than being a cool ability, Rosie fears the random flashes of the future that leave her emotionally crippled, ostracized by her mother, and prevent her from having a normal life. It seems like an unbearable condition until Agent McGarrett shows up promising answers and a purpose for her gift. But will those answers help Rosie or just confirm her fears were justified?",
