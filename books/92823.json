Then, Dr. Jace Staton enters her life. While instantly attracted to him – with his dark hair and haunting blue eyes – she becomes a challenge to him when she refuses to succumb to his charms.Tate tells herself she doesn't deserve his love, but will his relentless pursuit of her be strong enough to pull her out of the murky depths of her life? Or will haunts of her past come back and expose the person she used to be, causing her to lose him? Tate knows in reality, she never really deserved him to begin with. Will Jace show her that love can conquer all?Author's Note:Dear Reader, Flawed Beauty was originally entitled, \"Squalid\", and after reading the story you will understand why. After much consideration, my editor and I decided to rename it to something people could more identify with. We hope you enjoy Flawed Beauty!",
