  "description": "Marigold and Rose is a magical and incandescent fiction from Nobel Prize laureate Louise Glück.\"Marigold was absorbed in her book; she had gotten as far as the V.\" So begins Marigold and Rose, Louise Glück's astonishing chronicle of the first year in the life of twin girls. Imagine a fairy tale that is also a multi-generational saga; a piece for two hands that is also a symphony; a poem that is also, in the spirit of Kafka's Metamorphosis, an incandescent act of autobiography.Here are the elements you'd expect to find in a story of infant twins--Father and Mother, Grandmother and Other Grandmother, bath time and nap time--but more than that, Marigold and Rose is an investigation of the great mystery of language and of time itself, of what is and what has been and what will be. Simultaneously sad and funny, and shot through with a sense of stoic wonder, this small miracle of a book follows thirteen books of poetry and two collections.",
