  "description": "Pennsylvania. The groundbreaking dystopian vision Hugh Howey called “a brilliant tale of extra-planetary colonization.” Now you can revisit USA Today Bestselling Author Michael Bunker’s unique world in this anthology of original short stories—authored by ten of his fellow master storytellers and including a new Pennsylvania story by the creator of the Pennsylvania World himself. In Tales from Pennsylvania, Transport’s ever-growing desire for complete control forges new heroes as imagined by today’s leading voices in speculative fiction. You’ll meet an Amish family torn between their commitment to pacifism and impossible choices to preserve their way of life. A hacker named Gordian, who’s far too good at what she does for the Authority’s taste. A former stripper and her club-owner husband, who must learn to fit into Plain society or lose their lives. A young girl, lost in the winter cold and at the mercy of the Wild Ones. A scavenger on the Great Shelf, who befriends a woman he’d only intended to rob. A young Native American girl forced to undertake a journey in time. These adventures and more await you inside this collection. If you liked Michael Bunker's Pennsylvania, you’ll come to love these new heroes. Their tales are heartbreaking. They’re exhilarating. They’re unforgettable.",
