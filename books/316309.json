  "description": "In a world where extrasensory talent is acknowledged but not trusted, it's not easy to be Razzi, a young man with an ''extra''. Especially when someone in the complex where he lives fingers him for a crime he didn't commit.  Dannen Garniner is the Protector sent to investigate him, and he's fascinated by Razzi in spite of himself. Who wouldn't be fascinated by a kid who can change his appearance at will? But it goes deeper than that, as they soon find out. Can Dannen and Razzi both face their fears about their abilities, and about letting someone else get close?",
