  "title": "A Christmas Carol",
  "description": "A Christmas Carol is a novella written by Charles Dickens. It was first published in London by Chapman & Hall in 1843. The story tells of a miser by the name Ebenezer Scrooge who was visited by the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley. Marley tells Scrooge that he has one chance to avoid the same fate and that he will be visited by three other ghosts, one on each successive evening and that he must listen to them or be cursed to carry chains of his own that are much longer than Marley's chains. As Marley departs, Scrooge witnesses other restless ghosts who now wish they could help their fellow man, but are powerless to do so. Scrooge is then visited by the three ghosts Marley spoke of, each visit detailed in a separate stave, who accompany him on visits to various Christmas scenes.",
