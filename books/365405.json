  "description": "The story of three very different women finding courage, love, and compassion in the most unlikely places, this narrative follows medical interns as they work in a rural South African hospital. Spoiled Rachel struggles to establish her independence and learns to love across the cultural divide; conservative Seema attempts to end a relationship that has become increasingly abusive; and street-savvy Nomsa finally accepts a past that she has spent a lifetime denying. Coping with rogue snakes, gang assassinations, and the public's denial of AIDS, these women demonstrate what it takes to be a doctor in South Africa.",
