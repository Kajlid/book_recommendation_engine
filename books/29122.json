  "description": "When your guitar is your only real friend and you won’t let anyone hear you play, your life is hardly what you’d like it to be. Eighteen-year-old Heather hopes escaping her bickering parents by going away to college will help her come out of her shell. She knows it won’t be easy. Fortunately, her new roommate Marissa is everything Heather is not—outgoing, stylish, brash and totally confident. Heather is glad for Marissa’s help, until Marissa shoves her into a cute older guy from her English class and then disappears, leaving a tongue-tied Heather to fend for herself. With a plot based on four hit songs of a popular artist and with many more musical references sprinkled inside, A Love Story is a book any country or pop music fan will love. But you don’t need to be a music fan to enjoy the romance, humor, heartbreak and joy of Heather’s first year at college. Buy A Love Story now and begin experiencing a journey with Heather you will not soon forget.",
