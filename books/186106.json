  "description": "Two near-death experiences have transformed Myx Amens; he hasn't slept for three years. His first near-death experience, a lightning strike, left him with a photographic memory while his second, drowning, induced synesthesia, so he smells and feels colors, sees sounds, and tastes the thoughts and feelings of others. These skill sets endow Myx to investigate local unsolved homicides and ruffle a lot of feathers. The murders are disturbing—a beautiful teen with her lower lip cut off; her boyfriend sexually mutilated—and leave Myx wondering What could the killer possibly want with these body parts? A third victim, the town's tattoo artist, could be the clue to link the other two victims, but a tattoo seems a thin motive for murder. Myx discovers a baffling puzzle box which may hold secrets dating back centuries to town founder Elbridge Sonnet, and is possibly connected to the tattoo murders. For an unblinking 42 hours, Myx's high-performance synesthetic brain probes the dirty secrets of Miracle, Massachusetts, in search of the astonishing truth. This thoroughly original, beautifully written novel introduces one of the most intriguing protagonists in recent literature.",
