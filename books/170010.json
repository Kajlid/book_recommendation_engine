  "title": "The Other Side of the Bay",
  "description": "Small towns have a way of burying things, and small-town people have a way of keeping things that way. With reminiscence and narration, a local sheriff must comb through his own humid world to unravel the truth behind the death of a local boy. But itâ€™s not as easy as it seems, because no one is talking. The Other Side of the Bay is a remarkable portrait of the unique people in the Panhandle of Florida. The story weaves itself into the tall longleaf forests, and along the crests of the uneasy bay, telling a tale of the human spirit. This is a novel of how things aren't always as black and white as they ought to be, and how right and wrong aren't always easy to tell apart. It's an evocative tale that delivers its reader to the apricot sun rises and sepulchral storm clouds of their own bittersweet memories.",
