  "description": "On a Beam of Light is Gene Brewer's brilliant sequel to K-PAX, the novel in which a man called 'prot' (rhyming with goat) claims he is a perfect being from the planet K-PAX - an idyllic world without wars, government or religion. At the Manhattan Institute his psychiatrist is determined to prove that prot's identity is nothing more than a tragic case of multiple-personality disorder. But when people begin to notice prot's peculiar characteristics, many of them start to doubt the diagnosis.On a Beam of Light is the tale of prot's return to earth and his plan to take some beings back with him, the next time he goes home. For Dr. Brewer, as well as for the patients who are desperate to win his favour in the hope that they might be chosen, it is a race against time, for this visit prot claims, will be his last. Reminiscent of One flew over the Cuckoo's nest, it is a hilarious, touching and wonderful story.",
