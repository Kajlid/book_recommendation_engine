  "description": "An alternate cover edition can be found here.\"This is no ordinary pencil,” says the cat sitting on the end of nine-year-old Daniel’s bed. \"It's magic.\" Everything Daniel draws with his pencil--flying dragons, Octobears, and pizza-loving aliens from the planet Beezo--comes to life. It’s pretty awesome until the pencil draws a line between Daniel and his best (and only) friend Annie. Come along with Daniel and his fantastic creatures on this fun-for-the-whole-family journey as he discovers that friendship is the greatest magic of all.",
