  "title": "State Formation in Egypt: Chronology and Society",
  "description": "This study, the focus of which is the transitional period from late Predynastic to early Dynastic times, seeks to establish a reliable and refined framework of local chronologies, for the purpose of investigating the complex socio-economic changes which took place. It also seeks to examine the origins of the trend towards political unification of the country. With reference to mortuary data, a full explanation is offered of the techniques of seriation and statistical analysis, and typological criteria as applied to seven cemeteries in the Nile valley. Wilkinson supplies a summary of recent advances in understanding the evidence uncovered, and the issues left to be pursued. Controls are presented to chart alongside the principal ceramic phases, and appendices give details of the pottery groups employed. An extended essay in Part 5 completes the picture by discussing Delta communities of some significance just lately brought to light.",
