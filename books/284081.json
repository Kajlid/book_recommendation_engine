  "description": "After making his escape to Russia, Declan McGrady believes he finally has the chance to start over. Mysterious deaths in the small town he’s chosen as home serve to shatter his delusions.  He can only hide for so long, and in Russia, folklores aren’t just tales of the past: they're real. Nowhere is safe in a world where the nightmares that go bump in the night are on the hunt for him and his magic. To survive, he will have to put his skills to the test—and do his best to resist the lure of the untamed outdoors.  Survival is only the first of his challenges. The winter moon is rising, and Declan’s wolf tires of being alone.  The woman they desire, however, might become the death of them both.",
