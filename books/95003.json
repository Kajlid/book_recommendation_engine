  "description": "As The Healing Crystal Trilogy comes to a close, spring has finally come to the high mountains. As winter releases its grip, the small band of Survin refugees is violently divided. When three unique worlds collide, cultures change forever, as traditions and rituals are swept aside. While faith crumbles for one, another's is renewed. The gulf between these worlds may prove insurmountable. Young Kinter, lost in the shadow of her sister, fights for her own power. As she maneuvers to seize the crystal and displace Kairma as the heir, Kinter's future hangs by a thread. Collin, Kairma's lifelong friend, discovers he may be forever barred from Kairma by the evil carried in her blood unless the power of the Crystal can be realized. Bearing the weight of the most powerful object known to mankind, Kairma has an impossible choice to return to Survin in ignorance or dare to trust these powerful strangers. When freedom fighter Rand Solis allies himself with young Kairma, they discover that in order to heal the world, both must make sacrifices-friends, religious beliefs, and political philosophies. Great knowledge comes at great cost to the pair as they learn that a political philosophy may be perfect in a given moment . . . but such moments are fleeting. The Healing Crystal Trilogy presents a science fiction epic about lost technology, the morality of power, and the creation of religious and political philosophy",
