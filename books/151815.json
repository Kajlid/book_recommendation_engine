  "description": "In this loosely-woven sci-fi, dystopian thriller, Richard Hayes--school teacher, URL-scalper, loner--stumbles upon a game deeply hidden in the virtual recesses of cyberspace and quickly becomes addicted.Awed by the game's educational possibilities, Hayes invents a teaching method that involves putting his students and computers in cardboard refrigerator containers where they do nothing but play the game. In the darkness of their cardboard cocoons, students are confronted with computer-driven scenarios that take place in Europe beginning with the rise of Nazi Germany in the 1930's. However, to succeed in the game—and thus maintain their grade-point averages—students often must make decisions of questionable moral legitimacy, bringing to light adverse psychological traits formerly hidden from their conscious minds.But the game may serve an even darker purpose.As students struggle to master a game with nebulous objectives--and possibly nefarious origins--a question must ultimately be If one is given the power to manipulate and even eliminate some of the darkest episodes of mankind's haunted past, does he have a right to do so? Does such a power, in fact, morally obligate one empowered with such an ability to attempt to make such changes in mankind's history?",
