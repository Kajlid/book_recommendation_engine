Story is told with humor and compassion, combined with a look at the underlying complex issues involved in international adoption.ExcerptIt didn't take long to realize that parenthood was not going to be anything like what I'd imagined. I knew it on that very first day when my newly adopted son stretched out his fingers in front of him, in the cold Moscow air, to show me that he had no gloves on his hands and I realized I had left his brand new gloves on the plane. We watched together as the plane taxied down the runway, leaving with his new gloves still aboard. He looked at me with disappointment, reached for the packet of adoption papers that I carried under my arm and wordlessly took it from me. He didn't know exactly what it was, but he knew it was important and that, clearly, I was too careless to be trusted with it. From then on, he insisted on carrying the packet himself. The tone of our relationship was set.Ellie Porte Parker is a licensed psychologist with a Ph.D. in cognitive/ educational psychology.
