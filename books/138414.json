  "description": "What is it like to swim with a shark every day?Don C. Reed, head diver at California's Marine World/Africa USA, tells us in this suspenseful account of his experiences with the broadhead sevengilled sharks that lived at the aquarium--in particular the massive female he called Sevengill.From the moment she arrived, the dangerous Sevengill captured Reed's imagination. She displayed a majestic calm, yet Reed knew her to be one of the most savage predators in the world. At first he kept a way distance as he went about his underwater chores.Months passed without real trouble, and Reed's initial fear of Sevengill turned to trust. Gradually he and the other divers grew comfortable with the sharks and even began to play with them--until violent events reminded them that sharks are not pets.Through Reed's fascinating tale, we come to see that sharks are a force of nature that deserve our respect--not the bloodthirsty monsters of movie fame, but fierce and efficient hunters that play a vital role in ocean ecology.Sevengill: The Shark and Me pulls us right into the water to swim alongside the author and his favorite shark--a gripping story for all fans of true-life nature adventure.",
