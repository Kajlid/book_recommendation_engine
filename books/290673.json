  "description": "The Lufna rule and the Lufshi along with the Pangean follow...Hugin had always been sickly. But being weak in Pangea, a land where three races co-exist, isn’t exactly an option. Especially not as two Lufna battle for the crown of Copper Kingdom.Hugin doesn't care much about the war, or about Lufna, or the fate of the kingdom. He only cares about making sure he lives one more day. Hugin is a Lufshi, one of the three races in Pangea. Lufshi are able to shift back and forth from their animal form and carry their traits in their humane form like a badge of honor. Knowing this, Hugin can’t do much more than accept the fact that he’s frail and only his eyes show what type of animal he is. All he wants is an easy life filled with love and laughter at Munin’s side. But when war strikes Hugin's hometown he gets unwillingly pulled into the fray. As things change around him, he decides to tempt fate as he looks for somewhere to belong and someone who can stroke his core.Note: This book is part of a series and recommended to be read in order.
