  "description": "For three thousand years, the dark servants of the Lord of Night have waged war against the monstrous armies of the Unmaker. An ancient prophecy gives them hope of eventual victory, but now the underpinnings of their salvation are threatened, for the Unmaker seeks to destroy a central player of the prophecy before he comes into his own. Cursed with the rare gift of foresight, high priest S'Rak suffers a series of visions showing the same man dying a hundred different deaths. To save the ancient prophecy, S'Rak is duty bound to travel to a sun kingdom and, if necessary, give his life to defend this unknown prince.",
