  "title": "The Silent Sea",
  "description": "The Silent Sea was first published in 1892 and until now has never been reprinted. The story centres around the Colmar Mine which is modelled on the largest gold mine existing in South Australia at the end of the nineteenth century. Victor Fitz-Gibbon, young and adventurous, leaves Adelaide for the desolate outback and finds himself caught up in a dramatic sequence of events. The Colmar Mine also affects the lives of two very different young women: Helen Paget, an heiress, and Doris Lindsay, a young girl whose life is changed forever with her motherâ€™s death.This intelligent and sophisticated novel encompasses compelling psychological obsession, passionate romance and ironic questioning set in vivid historical detail against Adelaide society and the outback in 1890. It is an important rediscovery.",
