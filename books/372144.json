  "title": "Run with the Moon",
  "description": "A precursor to the story found in Moon Awakening - illustrated with hand drawn anime by ZJS.When I went to write this story, I did not anticipate the characters remaining in wolf form for the entire story, but that is what happened. Please be aware that this is not how my other shapechanger stories are done, but it was certainly a lot of fun to write for all of that.",
