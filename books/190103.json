  "description": "It was supposed to be casual. It was supposed to be occasional, just when he was passing through town on one of their tours. He'd text and I'd let him come over. We were casual, that's all it ever was. Then those damn pictures of me at the drug store came out for all of America to see and everything went to hell. He's Ford Knight, resident front man and lead bad boy of Sunday Knight. You've heard of them, trust me. I know there's no way you've changed the station when his deep, crooning voice has come on the radio to sing to you about his struggles being such a hot, sinful man. Is it coming back to you now? You're remembering him, I bet. Remembering him and squeezing your legs shut because you know better than to let some rock star become your...hookup friend, to put it politely. Unlike you, I don't know so well and what I thought was supposed to be just a causal, occasional fling became something I was in no way prepared for. My name's Cami and I'm here to tell you the story about how I went from being a small town hairstylist to the paparazzi's favorite subject, all courtesy of...you guessed it, Ford Knight and his anatomy down below.",
