  "description": "Have you ever wondered why as Christians we sometimes do not act as though we are? The Enemy Within will illustrate how we wrestle with the decisions between good and evil; how we want to do the right thing but feel as though there is someone else—our sinful nature— forcing us to do that which is evil. The Enemy Within exposes the power struggles that we have between the flesh and the spirit man within us. The stakes are high; you should choose this day which of the two powers will win control over your life. The decision is yours, but the cost is everlasting.",
