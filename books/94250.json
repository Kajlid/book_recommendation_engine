  "description": "Award-winning author Miralee Ferrell presents a powerful novel that blends the warmth and heart of historical romance with a deep exploration of difficult family dynamics. In 1880 Oregon, Katherine Galloway, a widow, must raise her daughters and run a boardinghouse alone. But when her controlling, outspoken mother comes to live with her, and with her older daughter entering the teen years, the pressure on Katherine becomes close to overwhelming. She must find the faith, wisdom, and courage to transform her life and relationships, especially now that new-in-town widower, Micah Jacobs, begins to capture her heart. Ferrell speaks to women's heartfelt struggles--from family dysfunction to single parenthood---while offering them the faith-filled hope they need, all wrapped in an uplifting, true-to-life romance.",
