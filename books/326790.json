  "description": "**18 and up, mature language and situations** More information on Author's WebsiteDanielle “Dani” Dole was not a member of the Howlers MC, but she was member-adjacent. Her father was a retired member who had moved from Michigan to Florida for his retirement. Her brother was the enforcer for the club and had made it very clear that he didn’t want her involved with any of his MC brothers. The problem was Dani had been infatuated with one of those brothers since she was fifteen. When an opportunity presents itself, Dani threw caution to the wind and kissed the man she had fantasized about for years. Embarrassed at her brazenness, she ran from him and tried her best to avoid him. But when you are so connected to the club and your best friend is marrying that man’s biological brother, avoiding him will only last so long.Trip Weber has a series of codes he lives by. One of those codes states when a MC brother says a family member is off-limits, that family member is off-limits. You protect them. You help them when they are in need of help. You have their back, support their dreams and goals, help move them from one house to another, celebrate their special days, treat them as family. You do not kiss them. But what do you do when that off-limit family member kisses you? He attempted to put it out of his mind and honor his MC brother’s wishes, but Dani had consumed his thoughts since the night of their kiss.If they give in to their desires, will they lose the trust and bond with their family?**check author website for all tropes, tags, and content warnings**",
