Seventeen–year–old Lydia Gibb has no business setting foot in Tanzania, but a fluke opportunity provides a chance to leave her boring life, to capture beauty with her camera--to mean something. But nothing is what it seems, and Lydia becomes ensnared in the bloody, male-dominated world of showdown hunting. She uses her camera as a shield, but the horrors mount, and so do her feelings for Caleb, a rugged, earnest game officer on a mission of his own--until Lydia captures his sights. Lydia’s pictures surpass her wildest ambitions, but then fall into the wrong hands. Unless she and Caleb team up and race to take back the camera, her work will drive both her and a rare rhino into extinction. RHINOCEROS SUMMER is a New Adult / YA crossover novel.",
