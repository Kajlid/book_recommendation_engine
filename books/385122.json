People everywhere seem lost in the complications of day to day struggles - poverty - misfortune - anger and greed. A small team of scientists have uncovered a riddle concerning this \"End of Days\". As they reveal the symbolic meaning of the riddle, their serendipitous mission is discovered by the Ancient Fraternity of the Veni Victus - determined to thwart such revelations. These two powers - of good and evil - converge. Only the spirits of the ancients know the outcome. The 100th Human is a spiritual quest delving deeply into matters of physics, metaphysics, evolution and the human condition. Join Jack, Apu and Alana as they race against time searching for those who can assist in revealing the mystery of the ancient symbols - before time literally runs out.
