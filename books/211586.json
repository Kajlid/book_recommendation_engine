  "description": "Rebelling against her overprotective brothers, a headstrong American heiress travels to London in search of the adventure of a lifetime and an everlasting love, never imagining that she's walking into the middle of a deadly political plot. Caine Wakefield, the future Duke of Somerset, rescues the exquisitely beautiful Jordan Montgomery from her would-be abductors and reluctantly assumes the role of protector. Despite her immediate attraction to her newfound hero, Jordan balks at being under yet another man's control, just as she bristles at being Caine's unwanted responsibility. As Caine works to unravel the mystery of Jordan's missing British relatives and her connection to a plot against England's Prince Regent, he fights an overwhelming attraction to the feisty blonde minx that leaves him wondering how he will protect his own heart.",
