  "title": "Joker in the Pack: An irreverent view of life at IIMs",
  "description": "This is a story of dreaming the great Indian middle class dream, and of life shaped accidentally or by design, only God knows by the great Indian middle class values. The joyride begins in the lap of two favourite pastimes of the nation cricket and television and after some shattered dreams, leads to the hallowed precincts of the venerated IIMs. It is a story of the life at the IIMs, and of life beyond. It is a story of how to play the IIM game successfully and beat the super distillation system refined by the IIMs to separate the chaff from the grain, the also-rans from the super achievers. The story has bit of raw truth. It is also tongue-in-cheek. It is designed to whet the appetite of those aspiring. It will evoke nostalgia amongst the alumni; it will also anger a few. Read on... you will either love it, or hate it, but will find it difficult to put down.",
