As a hacker who rarely leaves the basement, Raymond's chances of meeting Mrs. Right are slim to none until his hermit-lifestyle is jolted. A warning to stop poking into his past comes with consequences--and intrigues this curious cat. Raymond's only recently discovered he can shift into a lynx. He has questions, but the answers will require leaving his safe zone--and his comfy slippers--so he can find the one woman who can help. A scowling and fierce woman who makes Raymond crave a happily ever after. Whereas Lainey would rather he disappear. She isn't falling for his awkward charm. They must remain alert and never forget they're playing a game with an enemy who will stop at nothing to win. The stakes are their lives. Is it game over for this budding love? Contains mature themes.",
