  "description": "With the alliance broken, the Valle and Encala again form ideas on how to gain control of Emily. Her life on Island Coven gets in the way of Equites plans and Chevalier has to intervene and figure out if Emily has overstepped in the coven. V.E.S. activity strengthens and it's up to all three factions to find a solution to their growing numbers. Problems within the Cavalry ranks turn out to be more than what it first appears to be, while the return of a former Elder imperils all Winchesters. Emily is gifted a new home and gets a small taste of what a mortal life would be like, but the same nightmare begins to wear on her and what it contains angers the heku. Dustin continues to be a problem on the Council and confrontations between he and Emily start to spiral out of control. The heku child continues to baffle all heku and his innate nature begins to worry Chevalier. After a battle, an Encala Elder falls missing and his whereabouts threaten to pit the Equites in a war against the other two factions.",
