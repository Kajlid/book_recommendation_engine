It also deals with an inappropriate relationship between an underage girl and a much older man.When Katherine Symes experiences heartbreak at the age of twenty, she picks herself up, dusts herself off, and declares no man will ever break her again. The independent, potty-mouthed Katherine makes no apologies for how she lives her life. Marriage, babies, and husbands are ideas she’s never even entertained. There is only one thing she’s never had the guts to do. Open her own cafe. The day of her best friend’s engagement, a stranger bulldozes his way into her life. Handsome, tall, and annoying as hell, he pushes all her buttons.

After ending a toxic relationship, he never considered entering a new one. But there is something about the ever-combative Katherine which makes him realize she could be much more than a business partner. She just might be the one. However, she is going to need a little convincingIn the second installment of the Beachy Bride series, we follow the story of Katherine and Holst. A tale of shaking off the past, embracing the future, and finding true love.",
