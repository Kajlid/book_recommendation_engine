  "description": "Two months after Bantheir’s betrayal, Irina is learning how to live in a world where magic is not only real, but a part of her everyday life. As a spy for Parnaby, the shadowy president of the city of Dusk, Irina has to pretend Parnaby’s manipulation magic worked on her and she doesn’t remember his horrifying proclamation about Vernen. If her friend, brought back from the dead by an ancient source of magic, begins to show even a hint of magic, Parnaby will kill him without hesitation.When a mysterious woman named Aeonia confronts Irina, she threatens to tell Parnaby everything Irina is hiding from him if Irina doesn’t steal a magical artifact from the president’s mansion. Knowing she’s the only one who can protect Vernen, Irina agrees to Aeonia’s demands, but she wonders if this ultimate betrayal will destroy her newfound happiness with Leonid—and get her killed in the process.With elements of magic, mystery, and murder, The Burning Chaos takes readers on a dangerous journey through Dusk, introducing them to new characters and reuniting them with old favorites. Can Irina stay one step ahead of everyone and save Vernen? Or is she doomed to succumb to the magic she once loved but now despises?",
