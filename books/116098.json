  "description": "From the Authors of Nate Black Mountain Man & A Southern Moon Rising Mountain men were an unforgiving bunch when it came to revenge and even a casual comment made to the wrong man at the wrong time could lead to death. Teenaged Joshua Franklin comes West with his pa to trade items from their store to trappers. When his father and workers are ambushed by Indians and killed, he is suddenly all alone in the wilderness. Pike, an old mountain man, takes the young man under his wing and introduces him to Bear Killer. While they have plans to trap in the coming winter, another small group of men have a plan to kill Bear and any men found with him. Bear killed a man years ago and the yearning for revenge lived on in the man’s brother. Ruthless and filled with hate, they come for Bear and any who would get in their way... It is the killing of one of Bear’s mountain man cohorts that leads him and young Joshua, now called ‘Deacon’ because of his strong religious views, to follow the killer. They trail the man all over the Wild West, into Canada, and even cross the ocean to England. Once in England and out of his element, Deacon knows he’s in a conflict with no quarter given and none asked for. Only one man will walk away alive from this fight.",
