She knows the exact number because she keeps a list. Like #95: Because her skin is so dark, people call her charcoal and eggplantâ€”even her own family. And #61: Because her family is always being put out of their house, belongings laid out on the sidewalk for the world to see. When Genesis reaches #100 on the list of things she hates about herself, will she continue on, or can she find the strength to begin again?",
