And if I pretend, I can almost believe that my life is normal and everyone I care about is safe.But as long as I’m with Vincent, “normal” doesn’t exist. Gorgeous, charming, and witty, he’s everything you could ask for in a boyfriend—but his destiny is so much more.Even more terrifying than his destiny are his dangerous enemies, enemies who will kill for immortality. How are Vincent and I supposed to be together forever if we’re always in danger?I know I’ll do whatever it takes—even if it means lying to the people I love—to fight against a fate that is trying to tear us apart.",
