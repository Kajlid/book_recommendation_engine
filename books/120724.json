It’s been years since she bid Liam, the love of her life, an eternal farewell, but time hasn’t healed her wounds.

Brought to you by Ella Blythe and Greer Hartley, GHOSTS OF CHRISTMAS PAST will lure you into the strange world behind the red door. Be prepared to fall in love, surrender to lust, and spend this Christmas unlike any other.",
