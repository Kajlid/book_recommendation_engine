It is the complete rework of the previously published \"Star Woman in Love\".LOOKING FOR OSCARKassandra Morgante is a star woman with a mission. She has returned to Earth from the eternal land of Arkadia to fulfil the Ancient Venusian Prophecy and help the evolution of humankind into a race of immortal beings. She must learn what it takes to be a woman, and experience the initiation known as heartbreak. Healing the imbalance in the man-woman relationship on Earth lies at the core of the Arkadian Plan. This interdimensional love-story time-travels across Kassandra's life, from her childhood in Italy, to her student days in Edinburgh and adult years in Ireland. The cross-fertilization of humans with stellar DNA becomes possible when Kassandra falls in love with Oscar O'Leary, a famous artist with a troubled past. There are many tests for the Star Seed she carries in her heart, to see if the Plan can indeed program actions even at the low frequency of matter. The Arkadian Masters are Kassandra's powerful allies who guide her from the ethereal city of Elysia. But there are obstacles on the lovers' path, and Mr Harker and the Dark Forces are sworn to stop Kassandra before her stellar powers are fully developed. Ultimately, only Oscar can help Kassandra achieve her mission. But first he must learn to heal the wound caused by the secret he has been running away from all his life. Although Kassandra's love for Oscar is guided by higher forces and principles, the lovers' journey turns out to be surprisingly human.",
