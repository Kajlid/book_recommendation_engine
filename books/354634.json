  "description": "*This edition is out of print*When Roderick abandons new vampire Daniel to the care of his sire, DeVante, Daniel flounders under DeVante's attitude of benevolent neglect, and wonders how much autonomy DeVante will actually allow. Yearning for guidance and supervision, Daniel pursues Reed, a mortal man, and finds himself ensnared in a relationship rich with elements of BDSM.Meanwhile, Roderick has fled to Las Vegas, where he saves the life of a young man named Tony by changing him to vampire. But when Tony wakes up, he doesn't act like a fledgling vampire should. And when the sun rises and Roderick sleeps his vampire sleep, Tony walks out into the daylight and goes home, where he accidentally changes his roommate Lily to vampire. Roderick wakes to find that he now has two brand new fledglings, neither of whom he can control. He panics and does the only thing can think to do; bring them to DeVante in San Francisco.Vampires, mortals, and Tony, (who's something else altogether), are all beholden to DeVante for protection, though each has a special talent. DeVante begins to suspect that an outside force has brought all these children to him for some nefarious purpose, but before he can put the pieces together, the whole group is snatched and held for ransom. Can the members of DeVante's little coven can combine their talents to save themselves, in spite of their differences? And if they can, is that the definition of family?",
