  "description": "Mary Ann's mother tells her she's cut off. She can't get student loans without a cosigner. When her roommate drags her to a party that the Black's Raiders MC throws every year, she learns that she does have one thing left to sell, and she has an opportunity to get what she needs... if she gives the bikers what they want.  Is Mary Ann more afraid of leaving college without a degree, or of two days at the mercy of a biker gang?  EXCERPT:   “Well, she has to be pretty,” he said, reaching out and poking her nose. She flinched, startled, but didn’t look away.  “She has to be smart,” he continued. “I’m tired of,” he waved his hand, “All these girls that are only pleasant to be around when they’re wrapped around you.”  “Oh, yes, of course,” Mary said, nodding seriously, trying not to laugh at how ridiculous it was for her to be talking to a strange man about something that crude.",
