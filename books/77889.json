  "description": "We'd finally made it to seventh grade, and it looked like the Unicorn Club was history.  The trouble began when Jessica Wakefield and Lila Fowler started a dare war to decide who would be the next president.  Jessica got caught for stealing the principal's hairpiece, and we all got sentenced to working thirty hours in a day-care center with ten screaming little brats.  That was when the Unicorn Club started to change in ways you'd never expect.  Life isn't all makeovers and gossip and boys, y'know.  But just when we'd finally changed our ways, Mr. Clark, the principal, handed down the final punishment--the Unicorn Club was dissolved for good.  I guess Mr. Clark didn't know that Unicorns never give up!",
