  "description": "Lovecraftian stories stand shoulder-to-tentacle with high fantasy, steampunk, horror, Weird, and more in this collection of short stories from Ahimsa Kerp. From a steampunk world where the Burmese Empire still rules most of Asia, to Japanese death dogs, from the real reason no writings of Socrates exist, to an ancient Sumerian sage corrupted by the modern world stalking the fjords of Oslo, from a town full of women eagerly desperate to avoid sacrifice to a Dragon, to a German cat who really just wants to play a DJ set at the local Techno Festival, these stories span the breadth of the speculative fiction field.Each story includes an original black & white illustration.",
