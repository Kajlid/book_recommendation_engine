  "description": "The rug was ivory white and I slowly sank into it. At the window stood a black-ivory-white striped daybed that could seat up to six people. Surrounded by her black and white pillows, Mrs. Stankowski sat there, legs raised.She was wearing a short, high-necked jacket and long trousers made of silver-colored fabric; The red hair gleamed blindingly and had to cost her a lot of money at some expensive hairdresser's every few days. Her eyes were blue, but they were not that friendly. I gave her a warm smile and saw that it didn't hurt her.\"Sit down, Mr. Carver, and make it short.\" She pointed with a long ebony stick at a small gilt chair by the fireplace. I sat down and said: \"Your insurance company has asked me to track down the gold bracelet in the form of a rolled up python that has been stolen from you ... To be honest, it is not likely that when you and the maid were there were not, someone came into this flat with the key, took the snake bracelet from your dressing table and didn't steal anything else.
