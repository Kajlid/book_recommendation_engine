  "description": "Being the daughter to the Devil has its draw backs, just ask seventeen-year-old Desdemona Starr, aka Dessi, who attends the Morning Star Institute, a private school where teenage Hellions, paranormals like Dessi, can learn and practice their Hell-given crafts. There Dessi’s life takes a dramatic turn towards chaos when she learns she’s part of a prophecy foretelling that she will one day tip the scale of Light or Dark, ultimately creating a war between Heaven and Hell.   Dessi finds herself at the top of the hit list when soul-sucking demons attack the institute in an attempt to end the prophecy. Thankfully, Dessi has two of the strongest teenage shape-shifting-Hellhound-boys on her side. Not to mention finding herself within a love triangle can only complicate matters. Until she chooses her path and the prophecy ends, her internal war between Light and Dark is not over. Danger lurks around the corner with the help of her friends, she’ll be ready!",
