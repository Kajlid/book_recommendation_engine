  "description": "Thanks for buying this satirical and farcical comedy! Unless of course you haven't yet, and you're one of those people who hops from book cover to blurb and back again, only to wander off without buying what could quite possibly be the first book in ages that really makes you laugh! In that case, take the leap of faith. Put your proverbial hand in your pocket, click the 'buy now with 1 click' button and get involved! Why? Because ‘Extremely England’ is a naughty novella full of farcical fun! And if you have a sense of humour that likes the occasional tickling, you'll love it... Bobby Saint is in line for promotion. He is widely regarded as Britain’s best policeman, as well as being good friends with Mayor Terrence Thatcher, the man to assign the job of ‘Top Copper’ to whom he believes most suitable. But Harriet Plebb, ex-Big Brother winner and strong candidate to be the next Prime Minister, along with her power-hungry husband, Edwin, a human rights lawyer, has other ideas... In order to win votes from a certain section of the voting public, the Plebbs blackmail the mayor into giving the job to an unknown candidate of their choice. Due to fear of humiliation and the probability of losing his wonderful wife, the mayor cannot bring himself to spill the beans to his old friend, Bobby. After some scandalous defamation of his character, the out of favour policeman then has to rely on his hopeless journalist wife, Maggie, and her lay-about brother, Guy, to help him bring down the criminal masterminds and stop the corruption, thus claiming his rightful place at the top of Britain’s Police Force. Contains rude and crude humour - Not for the easily offended!",
