  "description": "WARNING: This book contains romance (and sex) between one woman and six men, and she doesn't have to choose just one. Also contains: raunchy humor, too many puns, group sex, a bit of M/M, and plenty of action, violence, and intrigue.  Six hunky, supernatural tradesmen. One sarcastic, caffeine addicted bride. A match made by fate … or karma?  My name is Arizona Smoke, and I have six husbands. Yup. Count 'em—six. Four sexy plumbers, one electric electrician ... and my last husband? Total prick. Our unconventional marriage is almost complete. All I need to do is reconcile with my first love, and rescue a man I’ve never met. Easy, right?  As if marrying a bunch of supernatural plumbers isn't hard enough, I also have to deal with the fact that my biological father and his six wives (yeah, I have six moms, too) are still hunting us, stalking us through sex parties hosted by demons and setting traps for us in the middle of underground supernatural raves. And you thought your family was dysfunctional!  All I wanted was a moment to breathe, a chance to get to know my new husbands in a way that was more than sexual—although I'm not exactly complaining about our time in the bedroom. But between my maniacal mother-in-law, some kidnapped lady-elementals, and the rich asshole I'm supposed to welcome into my new harem … when's a girl got time for dates? Let alone planning a seven-way ... wedding that is.  I'm Ari Smoke, spirit elemental, supernatural bada**, and hot-as-f*ck dragon chick. Having six hot husbands is nice … but being hunted by evil sex demons, not so much.  ELEMENTS OF RUIN is a full-length comedic paranormal, reverse harem romance. This means our leading lady has six male love interests and doesn't have to choose between them. This book is full of steamy sex, ridiculous plumbing puns, and heaps of action, intrigue, and ... well, more puns. This is book 2 of 3.",
