  "description": "Thea Galleon is your typical eighteen-year-old girl...almost. Between classes, coffee dates, and looking forward to her Pisciessoan Tail Ceremony, life is good, but long buried secrets threaten Thea and her beloved mermaid community. Bellamy, a Cephalian half man-half octopus, is on a mission to discover information about the deadly White Blight, a highly contagious illness plaguing these two secretive species. An encounter with Bellamy throws Thea’s quiet world into a tempest; she discovers she was adopted, and worst of all, is suspected to be human. Accused of treason, Thea sets out with her best friends to escape the secluded island of Bailerunda in a race against the forces that would keep them all in the dark. Will she find the truth about her past, family secrets, and government schemes, or be imprisoned for a crime she didn’t commit?",
