  "title": "White Ladies",
  "description": "When young Jasper Mortimer journeys out of Shropshire to Hayseech seeking his fortune, he takes possession of the first Arabella Tinsley and her family's land. With ruthless determination he goes on to create a great industrial concern, the profits of which come to his granddaughter, Arabella III. Arabella also inherits his steely, obstinate will. We follow Bella through a variety of formative phases and encounters which culminate in her obsession with “White Ladies”, a beautiful Elizabethan manor house. Her efforts to obtain the house and, later, to maintain it for her son, Jasper, end in disaster. The story is played out against a skilfully told background of the fluctuations in fortune of the great Black Country iron industries of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The book contains some of Francis Brett Young's most powerful evocations of the region, contrasting with the deep, rural beauty of the Worcestershire countryside.",
