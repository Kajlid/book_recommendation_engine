  "title": "Catch A Falling Star",
  "description": "Missing treasure, criminals, cops, co-worker hostility, and the surprise appearance of an ex-lover - definitely not what mystery novelist Kate Rawlings expects when she accepts a summer teaching position at her alma mater in the peaceful college town of Eden, Kentucky. Michael Mabry was Kate's lover in college, but did she ever really know him? Thirty years later, he's on the run from his partners in a Chicago museum heist in which a valuable ancient Indian artifact called the Shooting Star was stolen and two people killed. Michael escaped with the Star and his life, but he needs money to get out of the country. After so long, Eden should be the last place anyone would think to look for him, but his partners and an insurance investigator with his own agenda are hot on his trail. Kate finds herself suspected of involvement in the heist, but when a murder occurs in Eden, she also finds herself suspected of murder.",
