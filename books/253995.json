  "title": "Auction of Emotions",
  "description": "This collection of short stories is an attempt at painting the closest possible picture of the daily lives of people from the author's part of the world. Various social topics and stigmas have been portrayed here through the emotions and stories of the characters in this short stories collection. The objective of this presentation does not lie towards influence but rather on the direction of acquaintance. A few of the stories are inspired from true events whereas others are pure work of fiction derived from everyday information. However, the issues addressed are as real as the day is true. The author only hopes to make sure that whichever the story may be, the readers are touched by them and relate somehow with their own lives.`In addition, the translator has been careful of keeping the real flavor of the stories intact while trying to successfully tell these tales in a foreign language. Her only hope is for the forgiving heart of the readers should they run into any transliteration mistakes.The Book has 07 (Seven) Short Stories ::‘Hello Number Please’ ,‘Five Words at the Auction’ ,‘The Crazy Lady from Nowhere’ ,‘Yet,I Write’ ,‘275 Taka & Half a Paisa’,‘Horoscope’ – (These six stories are from Author’s Bengali Short Stories Collection – Nilame Pachti Shobdo, Published, 2017)And 'Conception'",
