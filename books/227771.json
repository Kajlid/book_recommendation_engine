And it really isn't about his getting this, like, social illness-- --The one where... Come on: it's impossible to become allergic to lying-- --Exactly -- the book isn't about that at all...One of the best novels of the decade... The magic of his writing and what he accomplishes through it is...manifested in how mesmerizing, hypnotic and just plain readable Evan Dara is. --The Quarterly ConversationIt's good to know that writers like Dara exist, capable of bravely carrying the flame [with this] very intricately crafted and grandly conceived postmodern novel. --The Review of Contemporary FictionRecalls David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest: both books offer a jigsaw puzzle of different styles, and construct a remarkably clever and complex plot with many mysteries embedded for the reader to discover after multiple readings. --American Book Review, Stephen J. BurnIf there is any literary justice [The Easy Chain] will appear sometime around 2050 in a New York Review of Books Classics edition with a forward by the aging Dave Eggers. --Conversational ReadingIn a just world, this would be the literary event of the year. --The Reading ExperienceJust brilliant...a testament to [Dara's] incredible skill. This is, without a doubt, my favorite book of the year. This is a great book. --Triple R Radio (Melbourne, Australia)This masterpiece left us drooling for days on end. We couldn't put it down. --Lowdown Magazine (Germany/UK)Uncommon and outstanding. As surely as there will always be an avant-garde, Dara will be there and whatever new guard emerges, they will be sure to have read his books. --The Front Table",
