  "description": "Welcome to the vampire city of Saruta, where the sun never rises, and all the vampire children love trying to stay up late. Hipira is a precocious young vampire whose best friend is a fairy named Soul. Hipira and Soul are an odd couple to say the least, and their games, pranks and adventures are extraordinary even for dwellers of this supernatural city. Hipira is a delightfully bright twist to traditionally dark subject matter. Filled with fun, wonder and heart, the illustrations look like they have been pulled off the screen of a top-flight animated feature. Hipira is a children's book like no other, one that will appeal to readers of all ages.",
