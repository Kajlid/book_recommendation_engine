  "title": "Hope Is the Last to Die: A Coming of Age Under Nazi Terror : A Classic of Holocaust Literature",
  "description": "This book, a classic of Holocaust reminiscence, was originally published in Poland in 1967. Covering the years 1939-1945, it is the author's own account of her experience growing up in the Warsaw ghetto and her eventual deportation to, imprisonment in, and survival of the Majdanek, Auschwitz, Ravensbruck, and Neustadt-Glewe camps. The book is notable for its simplicity and clarity of style, and is told with a first-person immediacy that makes the stark terror of its content stand out. This edition is expanded with a new epilogue and postscripts that bring Mrs. Birenbaum's story up to date.",
