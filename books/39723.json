  "title": "The Orphan Creed",
  "description": "Toeing the line between reality and fantasy and life and death, \"The Orphan Creed\" is ultimately about fighting for justice and a higher level of self-awareness while inspiring readers to recognize and take action against the injustices they may observe in their own lives. Thrown into a lonely and abusive world after the death of his parents, a young boy runs away from foster care after being orphaned only to embark upon an amazing journey of self-discovery in a foreign city...and then a foreign world. \"The Orphan Creed\" is a rich and poignant account that speaks to karma and the circle of life, as well as probing intimately into the human issues of family, religion, gratitude, loneliness, guilt, deception, friendship, faith, hope, and human resilience.",
