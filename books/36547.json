  "description": "MONSTERS DO UGLY THINGS (BUT, MONSTERS DO PRETTY THINGS, TOO) (REDUX) - a fun way to look at appropriate social skills - has all of the same content as our first award-winning hand-drawn eBook; only, this time, the images are clearer and crisper to match the style of our second award-winning picture book, MONSTERS GROW UP, which is formatted with a white background on every page making all of the colorful monsters “pop” on the pages. With the redux of our first book, both books, MONSTERS DO UGLY THINGS (BUT, MONSTERS DO PRETTY THINGS, TOO) (REDUX) and MONSTERS GROW UP, now make a perfect pair. For ages 4 to 400. Whether your young, or just young at heart, this book is guaranteed to make you smile - it may even make you laugh out loud.",
