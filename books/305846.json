A puzzle-filled scavenger hunt emboldens one college freshman to be brave with the boy she’s crushing on. A series of summer nights full of card games leads a boy to fall for a boy who he knows is taken. And a spin the bottle game that could end a life-long friendship.Fifteen stories, and fifteen unforgettable experiences that may inspire readers to start up that Settlers of Catan game again.CONTRIBUTORS:Gloria ChaoSona CharaipotraKika HatzopoulouKatie CotugnoIsaac FitzsimonsKathleen GlasgowShaun David HutchinsonKim Jones & Gilly SegalAmanda JoyYamile Saied MéndezAnna MerianoNina MorenoLaura SilvermanKayla WhaleyFrancesca Zappia",
