  "description": "Prophecies tell of an ancient power yet to emerge. One that will mend or break the world. Anwynn and Axis wonder if Milana is that power. As Milana struggles through Emergence, the Dark King’s world is rocked by horrific murders. One’s uncharacteristic to his people. While making sure they remain safe from the monster his stolen enemy might become, one already lurks his realm. Milana finds power within herself, but within the strength of another. One male will stand beside her, one that will rock her foundations. As she moves through stages of her emergence, she finds there’s more to herself than even seers foretold. Facets she doesn’t know if she wants to explore. While Milana and Anwynn both fight to keep themselves alive and the realm safe, the world waits for prophecy to become reality. For the promethean will rise, and when she does, the world will quake with awareness.",
