  "description": "In a dystopian America of the not-too-distant future, the Office of Size Compliance (OSC) claims there is a national food shortage and Congress has enacted the Endomorphic Laws in its war on obesity. It is now a crime for citizens to have Body Mass Indices of 30 or more. ‘Fatizen’ felons are imprisoned in Calorie Camps or sent to Psychogenic Re-Integration – or worse – while families are torn apart, and parents sell their children with the ‘deviant condition’ of obesity. This debut novel declares that ‘Fat is not a four-letter word’ in a big way. The fast-paced plot is action-packed and driven by its unforgettable characters. By turns poignant and graphic, this is a story that is unnervingly close to home even today. Author Philip Barragan takes us full-tilt into a profound civil rights issue, and, of necessity, the subject matter, violence and language have sharp edges and may be uncomfortable for some readers. But that’s the point. Barragan’s searing, thought-provoking dialogue and Mason Arrigo’s complex and arresting illustrations together serve up a warning about tolerance and acceptance: the future is not all that far away. ‘Fatizen’ Delilah Palladino has found a secure channel to impart an important message and the time to pay attention is now.",
