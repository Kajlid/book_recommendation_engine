Dagon is supportive in the wake of his mate's doubts and insecurities, and he tries hard to convince Taylor that love knows no boundaries. Dagon had hoped Taylor's older brother, Joshua, who's mated Dagon's brother Law, would be enough to convince Taylor to accept who he is, but Taylor still refuses to fully acknowledge his love for Dagon, and Dagon soon grows weary.Meanwhile, Taylor's inner demon may be more tangible than anyone could have imagined, and the mates, risking their lives to help Taylor, take off on their most unbelievable adventure yet.  Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
