Worried that impulsive, sweet-hearted Rosie is making a mistake, Katie is determined to save her sister from herself!

Except everyone has arrived—how can she tell them she’s not sure? As the big day gets closer, and emotions run even higher, this is one White family Christmas none of them will ever forget!",
