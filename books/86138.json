  "description": "When Mia gets a summer job at a prestigious country club, it's hard work, but fun, especially as a romance develops with fellow student Dan. However, from the beginning she is drawn to the sexy, rich and bored Jamie--he's got everything he could ever want, and enjoys nothing more than messing with people's lives for his own entertainment. Mia knows getting involved with Jamie is a bad idea, but there's something so dangerously exciting about Jamie she just can't resist.",
