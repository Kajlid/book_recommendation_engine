  "description": "Want to hear something interesting about lies? Sometimes, they’re not lies at all; they’re manipulated half-truths that spiral out of control — and take the rest of your control along for the ride.John Carrington is the man most women dream of; rich, educated, charismatic, and polite. He looks like a rock star, speaks like Mr. Darcy, and could charm a queen or a bohemian, leaving both begging for more. Most would be honored to capture his eye; most have no idea what he would capture in return.I do. I caught Carrington’s eye at a small restaurant in Manhattan. Six months later, we had a one-night stand in Las Vegas. Now, I have to appear on his talk show, at his studio in London, to fulfill a contract I signed over a year ago.My name is Clara Presley, and my ultimate sacrifice will be so much more than my time.Real Talk is a deliciously spicy, elevated romance series. It is told from the heroine's perspective and contains an attractive mix of comedy and a suspenseful plot. It will keep readers on their toes and unable to stop turning pages to find out what happens between Clara and Carrington.“But what I loved most? What starts out as [a] tale with a decidedly rom-com vibe morphs at some point into psychological battle royale, forcing Clara to stay one step ahead of Carrington (or try to, anyway) and leaving readers guessing about whether this is a love story or something more sinister. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to read a well-crafted love story that will keep you guessing.” - Reader Review",
