  "description": "Anna is blindsided when her adoring boyfriend dumps her after six seemingly perfect months. Especially since they made sweet, tender love right before he dropped the breakup bombshell. It just doesn’t make sense.Mason doesn’t want to make sweet, tender love to Anna. He wants to take her hard and fast, to push past her sexual boundaries until she’s writhing with pleasure and screaming his name. The problem? He has no idea how to tell innocent and old-fashioned Anna that he likes to dominate women in the bedroom. What if she rejects him, unable or unwilling to be his submissive?When Anna demands answers, Mason shows her with one intense, toe-curling kiss exactly how much of himself he’s held back. The thought of being submissive terrifies Anna as much as it turns her on, but she’s willing to try anything if it means discovering the real Mason…and keeping him by her side for good.",
