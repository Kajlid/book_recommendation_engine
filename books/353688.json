  "description": "Won't you share a scribble-covered dream with me? Intent on being an independent young woman, high schooler Himeyuka lives on her own in an unremarkable apartment complex in a corner of the city. But one day, she discovers her ordinary building has turned into something extraordinary! Her beloved \"castle\" is covered in childish scribbles-both inside and out! And waiting for her at the end of this rainbow-colored mess...is the perpetrator of the crime-a little boy named Rozione, who seems to know quite a bit about Himeyuka, though she has no idea who he is. Is he really just someone's lost child, or is there a greater mystery behind his appearance?In this collection, Sumomo Yumeka presents four charming, melancholy vignettes that explore the trickling of time and the machinations of the heart.",
