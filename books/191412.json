  "title": "I Never Liked You: A Comic Strip Narrative",
  "description": "In one of the best graphic novels published in recent years, Chester Brown tells the story of his alienated youth in an almost detached, understated manner, giving the book an eerie, dream-like quality. For the new 2002 definitive softcover edition Brown has designed new layouts for the entire book, using \"white\" panel backgrounds instead of the black pages of the first edition.",
