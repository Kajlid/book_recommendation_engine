  "description": "For 16-year-old Skyler, fear is a way of life.  Ever since the Wall split the UK in two, her survival as an illegal Northern refugee in the South has been a relentless knife-edge balance between evading the brutal, corrupt Board and clinging to her reputation as the South's best hacker.  But Skyler's sick of living in fear - and she's got nothing left to lose. So when fellow Northerner Mackenzie unwittingly hands her a chance to exact revenge on the regime that destroyed her home and family, she seizes it.  She's about to start a fire.  Shortlisted for the 2016 Mslexia Children's Novel Competition and longlisted for the 2016 Bath Children's Novel Award, BLACKOUT is a story of resistance, friendship and survival.",
