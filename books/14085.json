  "description": "For a thousand generations, the Dragon Slayers Society has hunted the most vile monsters across China. Thirty years ago Yuen Wong sacrificed his wife Elsa to save his new born son, Chen. They escaped China to America, and Yuen continued his search for the warrior foretold to confront the master vampire, Huwan-Tun. Erich is a student at the Wong's martial arts school, who is haunted by dreams of a beautiful Chinese woman, and the master of evil who controls her. Erich assumes that these dreams are just nightmares, but when he sees the woman in the real world, the true nightmare begins. Erich chases love and destiny beyond the veil of death into the Chinese underworld. This story features knife-throwing Chinese acrobats, giant winged mastodons, dragons, vampire wraiths, Madme Yu's House of Freaks, headless giants, mountain spirits, demon-possessed swords and trees, kungfu zombie vampire warriors starved over a thousand years, and battles between the gods and goddesses of ancient China. Hunting the Moon Tribe is a bizarro martial arts epic.",
