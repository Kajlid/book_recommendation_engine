  "description": "Not all heroes are good guys.With a body count on his soul and blood on his hands, Killian Nox lived in the gray. Ruthlessly single-minded, if he wanted something, it was his. And when it came to the gorgeous lass with a fiery attitude, he didn’t just want her.He needed her.With southern-bred manners and a snark all her own, Augusta ‘Gus’ Allan was a connoisseur of cheap wine, delicious Mexican food, and good TV. Unfortunately, her taste in men wasn’t as well-developed. When her knight in shining armor turned out to be a douche in tinfoil, Gus never expected her real hero to be a sexy-accented, tattooed beast of a man.But he was exactly who she needed.Gus had no clue how comforting a monster in the dark could be...Until Nox.Warning: Recommended for readers 18+ due to awesome things like adult content and language... wink, wink, nudge, nudge.This Happily Ever Alpha Kindle World novella is a crossover of The Hyde Series and Aurora Rose Reynolds' Until Series. It features glimpses of familiar faces from Hyde and Seek, Best Kase Scenario, and Until November. However, it can be enjoyed as a standalone.",
