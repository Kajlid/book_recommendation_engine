  "description": "What happens when you combine ancient Celtic magic and artificial intelligence? Hidden for centuries and concealed by codes hidden in Celtic knots, Alan Clark, a computer programmer, and his friends are about to rediscover Merlin's magic, but they aren't the only ones who've been searching for it, and their opponents will stop at absolutely nothing to gain the power it possesses... A fast-paced m√©lange of science fiction and fantasy, magic and mystery, all rolled into one exciting adventure.Review by James Gormley - Horrorworld.org:\"'Merlin's Knot' blends storyline threads centered around a group of college kids uncovering coded messages in ancient Celtic runes while developing advanced nano-based claytronic structures. Also thrown in are yakuza sorcerers and modern descendants of an ancient order of spellcasters dating back to the Arthurian days of Mordred and Morgan Le Fay (very much still alive in this tale). Not a linear narrative as such, but story flashes that are pieced together in a mosaic, the main gist of this story is that artificial intelligence and a secret Merlin tome are being desperately sought by all of these groups of characters, with staying alive as the ultimate goal for these danger-seeking mages-in-training.\"(Originally published as a novella in the I EAT BUTTERFLIES anthology by Raven c.s.
