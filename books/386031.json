  "description": "Who better than Sam York—a super-brain blessed with the body of an Adonis—to head up the research team entrusted with developing the greatest scientific breakthrough since Viagra? His experiments with female libido enhancers need one more crucial test: on a willing human subject. And when ace reporter Cathleen Nichols, the sexy, nosy neighbor Sam's been lusting for, exposes the lab's provocative work in a revealing article, the genius stud knows he's found the perfect participant. Though Cat has kept her feelings hidden, Sam has been secretly stoking her inner fires for months. Now, with Sam's \"wonder formula\" tossed into the mix, their unleashed passion is off the charts, rocketing them together into the stratosphere of erotic ecstasy, no emotional strings attached. In the name of science and journalistic investigation, suddenly nothing is taboo. But what happens when Sam and Cat's sizzling, sensual pleasure game starts to turn into the real thing?",
