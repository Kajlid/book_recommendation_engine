  "description": "Being the flashy frontman definitely has its perks and Hunter Chesterfield is infamous for exploiting them all shamelessly. When he isn't busy commanding the stage or wooing every groupie in sight, he's living for the three Bâ€™s: Bitches, Booze, and Bacon. He has it all, or so he thought. Chase Hanlon can hold her own with any man. Independent and feisty as hell, she was the perfect tiny package of dynamite to shatter everything Hunter thought he knew. Women have always been disposable to Hunter, Frisbees to toss away once the fun was over. There has never been a repeat rear-ender, until Chase and something about his smart mouthed, fiery Tiger Lily has him rethinking everything. When he comes face to face with his past, will Hunter grab onto the things he knows he needs to be complete or will he push it all away and chase after the empty thrills of fame he hides behind to numb the loneliness?",
