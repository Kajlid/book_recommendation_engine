  "description": "On the eve of World War II, Fritz Gerhard, Nazi art forger, faked his own death and threw himself into the Seine. He resurfaces two years later, having joined the French resistance and professes his love for Everley Pembroke. He has no idea that he is not yet finished with the Nazis. Everley is at Chambord, watching over the evacuated treasures of the Louvre. She allows herself to fall in love with Fritz, only to have him disappear again. Alain Darnay, reformed art thief and Louvre curator, has never gotten over the wife and son he lost. When he learns that his best friend has been captured and believed to have been sent to a concentration camp, nothing will stop him from finding Fritz Gerhard.",
