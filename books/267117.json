  "description": "It starts with a bang.  As in me and Hadley, the maid of honor, during my brother’s wedding reception. Sure, it was amazing, but I’m a one-and-done kind of guy. After spending years of my life getting screwed over by managers and agents with the Ryder Brothers, I no longer like to commit.  I don’t even play music anymore. The secret that I haven’t told anyone- is that I can’t.  A chance to raise money for my best friend’s nonprofit to help child stars means it’s time to deal with my block. Hiring Hadley seems like the obvious solution. She wants inside my head (not happening). I want to bang her again (she says she can’t sleep with clients).  Between my baggage and her professionalism, can my problem even be fixed? Or will we both end up just wanting more?",
