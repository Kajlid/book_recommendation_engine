New holiday checklist (last one went off the rails):\t• Having good old-fashioned fun with my family while serving our many customers at the busiest time of the year.\t• Regaining my confidence in marketing and working with the public, what I do best.\t• Lots and lots of steamy no-strings holiday hijinks with the deliciously annoying man I can’t keep my hands off…and it’s not just because he has the finest tree—ahem, trees—around. Final holiday checklist (you know the drill):\t• Survive Christmas after life implosion #2 courtesy of the enigmatic man I couldn’t keep myself from falling for — or maybe, just maybe, find the way to save the holiday for both of us.Author’s note: Fiancée by Christmas is the first book in our Happy Acres contemporary romance series, which is set near Crescent Cove. This book has a happily-ever-after—assuming Rachel doesn’t kill Clay, which is always a possibility—and no cliffhanger.",
