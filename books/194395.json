  "description": "\"I need to write. I need to sit my ass on that chair and write. I haven't written in ages. Actually I haven't written for the past two years. Rather the past one year, ten months and seventeen days.\" - from My Dream ManIn her debut novel in the romance genre, Aditi Bose has portrayed romance in an altogether new light. Her prose is realistic, candid, sympathetic and romantic - all at the same time. She doesn't miss out on the humorous bits either. My Dream Man is a novel about the female protagonist's inner desires and the challenges that the reality offers. Ajopa Ganguly is a girl in her twenties who lives with her parents in Delhi. Her life is fine except for one tiny problem. All publishers have rejected the manuscript that she has very painstakingly written. She believes it's more because she is not a known celebrity rather than because the plot is not appealing enough. She is so disturbed by this that she has been baking cupcakes and embroidering handkerchiefs instead these days. This is when Aniket Verma re-enters her life. He is a professor of economics who is well known in his circle. He's twelve years older to Ajopa. They had been good friends till a misunderstanding happened five years back. What happens when they meet again is what the story is all about. An honestly written book, My Dream Man, is insightful as it examines how forces beyond our control help us make personal decisions. As Ajopa says, it is all about \"deep choosing\".",
