  "title": "When We Kissed",
  "description": "For a girl who has suffered more than her fair share of loss and a boy who has everything he’s ever wanted, seven minutes shouldn’t change anything—except, they do. They change everything. Simone Bruckner is no stranger to heartache, so it stands to reason she avoids messy entanglements like making too many friends, or worse, actually finding a boyfriend in a school where she’s been voted Girl Least Likely to do Much of Anything outside of working at a rundown diner. Boyfriends mean opening herself to the possibility of falling in love. Falling in love means the possibility of losing love. Why risk heartache with someone, especially if that someone isn’t the guy she’s already fallen for? The guy who’s already off-limits. Whitney “Whit” Devereaux is on track for a lifetime of an acceptance to Yale, following in the footsteps of his much revered grandfather, a beautiful girlfriend, who will surely one day wear his ring, by his side. Being with anyone else never even crosses his mind. At least, not before he finds himself locked in a closet with the one girl who should be off-limits. The girl whose kisses change everything he thought he knew.",
