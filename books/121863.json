  "description": "Jerry Cornelius is already an underground legend, a comic-strip hero, saint and devil in one. This is his first novel. In it he fights a grim vendetta in a French chateau, guns his way through the fleshy jungle of a devastated London to a laughable clue in the icy wastes of Sweden, tackles the sinister Miss Brunner and throws a vast party that lasts for months in Ladbroke Grove, and finally (in a high state of sexual ambivalence) leads a horde of happy followers to their death, like lemmings to the sea, until he (or she) is the only man (or woman) left on the Earth.",
