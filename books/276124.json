  "description": "Forced to compete. Destined to lose. Too drunk to care. Come join Bucky, Bobby Jo and the others as they race to save their own sunburnt necks in a race so insane It’s outlawed in twelve galaxies. Mur’kroznitck – it’s like NASCAR, but with weapons. And in space. Oh, and it’s illegal… New ships, new weapons, and a beverage that makes Natty Light seem like a proper drink. Earth now has their Mur’kroznitck champions… unfortunately, those champions are three drunken idiots from the hills of West Virginia, two hoodies from the projects of London, and one unfortunate Army private that didn’t want any part of this to begin with. Will they be able to survive the trip from the Moon to Mars?  Will they be the first humans on the red planet?  Will Elon Musk put a hit out on them for getting there before him?  Will Bobby Jo have sexy pictures taken of her? Then have those photos used in an intergalactic ad campaign to sell beer? And have legions of squid-like fans who just want to see her hoo-has and go absolutely bonkers with lust?” (That’s pretty specific… Spoiler The answer is Yes) Space 2 Drunk 2 Drive is everything the Fast and the Furious isn’t… take that how you like. Get your copy now and join in on the insanity of high stakes race that promises its winners Fabulous Prizes – and the odd tentacle up the rectum. Scroll back up, climb aboard your racer and clench those buttocks. It’s racing time! FREE to read with Kindle Unlimited.",
