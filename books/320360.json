  "description": "Trust, loyalty, respect—that was what Malice MC stood for. The club was my family, a group of hard men who believed in brotherhood above everything else. I found my best friend there. Fell in love there. And it was there I lost everything. I gave it all up to find her, stared death in the face more times than I could count, for even just the slightest chance she was still out there. Finding her consumed me, and after six long years, she was finally back within my reach. I thought getting her back meant feeling whole again, but I was wrong. The beautiful, fierce young woman I knew was gone. I wasn’t the kid she grew up with anymore. I wasn’t her first kiss. Now, I was the enemy.",
