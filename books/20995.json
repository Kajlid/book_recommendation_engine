  "description": "Erotic ContemporaryAn unfortunate fluke of timing puts Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Harte in the wrong place at the wrong time, and it costs him his career. Caught in an Iraqi ambush while on a rescue operation, he's hit by shrapnel that damages the visual cortex of his brain. With family wealth, nothing is beyond his grasp, including the women he pays to share his nights. That suits him just fine, until he hires Annie Claire Townsend to accompany him on a mission to help the two damaged soldiers he saved in the same attack that took his sight.Taking a job as an escort is nothing Annie ever considered until medical bills from her daughter's illness buried her in debt. How could she refuse the ten thousand dollar fee? She has no idea her client is blind until she meets him, and his focus is off. Way off. Nothing about Daniel Harte elicits pity. He's roguishly handsome, assertive, and the sexiest man she's ever met. She can no more resist him than she could stop breathing. But Annie has secrets she can't confide to anyone, especially the man she's falling in love with.Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations some readers may find anal play/intercourse.",
