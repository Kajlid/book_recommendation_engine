  "description": "In Living Without, Melissa and Dallas’s chemistry skyrocketed. It’s finally time to get up close and personal with this hot couple in their very own novella, Walkout. Get ready to discover what happens when Dallas chases Melissa all the way to Sydney to claim her back.  From her one visit to Melbourne and the Hawks MC compound, Melissa Stevenson knows Dallas is who she wants. There’re just a few problems with that: he’s a douche, a pain in the arse, and a stubborn, sexist pig. Still, it’s a whole heap of fun to tease her Viking man.  Relationship. Dallas Gan hates the word. As far as he’s concerned, women are nothing but a good time between the sheets. It’s only when the sassy Melissa shows up that he realises some women give as good as they get. Now she’s under his skin and he can’t seem to get her out.  Even with the warning from Dallas that once he claims her, he will come for her wherever she is, Melissa leaves. It’s now just a matter of time before he makes good on his promise.  Wading through lies and danger, Dallas has a decision to make. Is it easier to walkout on love and never look back, or will he give that dreaded “relationship” word a chance?",
