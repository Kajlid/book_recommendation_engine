  "description": "The inhabitants of Terram grew up with stories about the Cosmos Dragon, the god of the universe. Once upon a time, he sent dragons to create and protect the world. Hundreds of years ago, things went wrong, and the portal to the realm of the dead was opened. The heroes of old managed to close the portal again, but the darkness had already wreaked havoc. Now that the Earth Dragons are almost extinct, all hope rests on the survival of Nepheda, the last Earth Dragon. However, her health is quickly deteriorating, and Sanct Solix, her guardian and protector, is very concerned.When Eilika, a girl from a small village, finds an Earth Dragon egg, new hope flourishes for Terram. Unfortunately, her find does not go unnoticed, and danger that is lurking begins closing in from all sides. With the help of Ylva; an ice sorcerer from Ísríki, Cieri; a banished night nox, Everard; the arrogant prince of Stormland, and her best friend, Harmen, she travels through Terram to hatch the egg whilst protecting it. But can she trust these strangers? The only one who is definitely on her side is Sanct Solix, and Eilika is determined to get the dragon egg to him. But when a girl named Aster, crosses their path with her earth dragon magic, confusion arises about who really should actually own the dragon egg. Will they all work together for one goal, or are there traitors in their midst?",
