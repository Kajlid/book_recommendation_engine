  "description": "These are the tales of Bowdyn, itinerant 17th Century Gleeman, member of an ancient story-telling guild. Rescued from death during the Monmouth rebellion he tells tales of the Dark Ages to his rescuers their friends and neighbours, to entertain, divert and sing for his supper . In this first tale a lovelorn boy Gewis flees home, joining the Vandals of Carthage, in piracy and war. Years later, a wealthy, seasoned warrior, he returns to save his people from slavery or death. Set in the Dark Ages straddling the Vandal sack of Rome, The Axe the Shield and the Triton is a sweeping yarn of anarchy in a crumbling Empire, where internal conflicts, savage invaders and bands of reavers destroy Imperial order. It is a story of the workings of the Fates, part of a great tapestry in the weaving, changing the history of the world for all time.",
