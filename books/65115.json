Now two years later he's working with his brother at Walker Security, but he's living fast,hard and wild, until he reaches the ultimate high.... revenge. And he's close, so close he can taste it. He's one meeting, one woman away from being inside one of the money laundering shells the cartel operates.One Woman....One dangerously hot night.....This is a 6,000 word short story (28 pgs)... a lead-in to the October 15th release of BENEATH THE SECRETS which is Blake's full sized novel.It's 99 cents because that is the lowest that the retailers would allow me to set it at. Authors don't get to pick free pricing. It's a price-match thing the retailers do of their own accord.",
