  "description": "They say autumn shows us how beautiful it is to let things go… but I’m keeping Ryan’s beard. Past Chloe has a lot to answer for. She’s made a number of questionable decisions, but drunkenly turning Ryan down on a dating app? Currently top of my list.  I love fall most of all, but oh my gourd, Ryan’s beard is fast becoming a close second. Luckily, he’s ready to give me a second chance. We have everything in common, from art to weird history facts to the correct opinions about Titanic. And boy, does he know how to pumpkin spice it up in the bedroom.  We could easily be the cutest new couple in Boulder… if we ever leave his place. Episode three of six in Dating Season.",
