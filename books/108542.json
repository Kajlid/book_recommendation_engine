  "description": "Monza Luca di Medici. Italy’s number one racecar driver. Set to inherit his father’s automotive Billion Dollar Empire. Women would donate their left kidney just to spend a night of debauchery with the infamous rogue. Sounds like the perfect life doesn’t it? It could’ve been…if I hadn’t stumbled upon her some years ago. Two weeks. Fourteen days. From dusk until dawn, she was with me—in my arms, in my mind and in my heart. She wanted commitment, but I wasn’t ready to have one. She told me she understood—and I thought she did, until I heard that she was married a month later. For me to say I felt betrayed would be an understatement. I wanted revenge, to hurt and make her pay. And I was going to get it—one-way or the other. Hell hath no fury to an Italian man spurned.",
