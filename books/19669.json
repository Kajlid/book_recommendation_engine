  "description": "Being a plain Jane has never bothered Blair Wingfield, especially since it suits her job as a deputy sheriff. Ruggedly beautiful Jackson Hole, Wyoming, is a town on the edge of vast stretches of wilderness, and the present has caught up with a vengeance.Never certain of her personal beliefs, Blair is plunged into anguish and questioning when the local high school’s star forward commits suicide, leaving behind bitter accusations of anti-gay bullying. The girl’s story galvanizes young attorney Emma Jacobs into leading the charge against the school district’s failure to protect one of its own.Beset with family troubles, stunned at her own soul-searching and caught between the law and politics, Blair tries to find some semblance of calm and control. But every time she clashes with Emma there is little of either to be found. Something else entirely wants to grow out of Blair’s uncertainties...Ruth Perkinson (Sterling Road Blues) confronts the tragedy of teen suicide amidst the hope, courage and faith of a small town and newfound belief in love.",
