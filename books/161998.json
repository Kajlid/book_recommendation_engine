  "description": "Dr. Marie Bartek, a veterinarian from Sullivan's Island, SC, is learning to deal with the fact that she can see spirits. Along with some of her friends, Marie created Sullivan's Island Paranormal Society, SIPS, to investigate haunted places. While in New Orleans for a veterinarian conference, she and her friends decide to stay an additional week to do some sightseeing and investigate a few haunted places. Their vacation quickly turns into something else when Marie has a vision of a woman being tortured and murdered. She decides to contact the police to see if there are any missing women in the area, and learns that the woman she saw in her vision has actually been murdered and is at the morgue. When she has another vision similar to the first, except this time she sees a pentagram in the vision, she again contacts the police and learns that cult activity is heavy in the area, and that the woman in the second vision was murdered as well. Are the killings cult sacrifices or something else? Will Marie and her friends be able to figure out what is going on? \"Secret of the Big Easy\" has plenty going that grabs the reader's attention and keeps it until the final page. The suspense surrounding the murders that Marie is seeing in her visions is really first rate. Add to that the mystery of why the murders are taking place and you have a first rate story. - Readers' Favorite",
