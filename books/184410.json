  "description": "Paul K. Lovett's science fiction satire The Evolution of Robert Carr is an audacious, operatic romp through a dystopian near future where genetic enhancements have pushed the divide between rich and poor ever closer to its social breaking point. The subversive tale opens on Robert Carr's eighteenth birthday when he is about to join the top 2% of the population by becoming a recipient of an exorbitantly expensive neural enhancement procedure. Yet Robert is rather uniquely reticent to the prospect. He fears becoming distant, cold, inhuman, like his enhanced best friend. And that his girlfriend, one of the revolutionary Dragoons, will spurn him. Ultimately, Robert accepts the procedure, citing all the advantages in life it will give him. But he gets much more than he bargained for. Aurora, the supercomputer used to create the enhancement program has become sentient, giving Robert an unexpected 'gift.' And once he leaves the confines of uDesign, the giant bio-tech corporation that performed the enhancements, his life takes an extraordinary and unexpected turn.",
