  "description": "It’s been almost six years since she ruined what we had. Her lies shattered years of friendship and ripped apart the future we planned. After I called her a liar and revoked my trust, she left town and never looked back. In a cruel twist of fate, she’s returned. But I’m not the wounded boy she left behind. I’m a man now. A man full of anger, resentment and loss. Darkness consumed me after she left. An unforgiving black hole where my heart used to be.If she thinks she’s already seen the worst of me, she’s wrong. Dead wrong. Peyton has only experienced the very tip of the iceberg when it comes to my darkness. I’ve craved vengeance for her lies, and now is the time to make her pay.Dear Reader, The Vengeance You Crave is the fourth book in my Maddison Kings University series and the first in a duet for a new couple. It's a dark bully romance that contains mature content and demanding alphaholes that some readers may find disturbing. You have been warned.",
