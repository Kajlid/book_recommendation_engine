But nothing in her work with the Phantoms team prepares her for the most terrifying ghost of all―seeing her doppelganger. Rumored to be a foreshadowing of one's death, the spectre shakes Kerry to the core...sending her into the arms of her best friend and fellow Phantom cast member, Paul Leake, for comfort.Until a kiss changes everything.Paul has been in love with Kerry for ages, unwilling to compromise their friendship. As their investigation in a ghost town grows more intense, however, so does the chemistry between Paul and Kerry. With her life in danger and their jobs on the line, giving into their attraction couldn't be a worse idea―and yet they can't bring themselves to stop it. Even if it kills her... Sometimes the only way to find love is to face death...\"A gem of a writer.\"SHARON SALA, NY Times Bestselling Author",
