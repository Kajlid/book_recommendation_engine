But the evidence is all around us–in the fossils of long-dead creatures, and in our genes and the relationships between all living beings. Amazing Evolution shines a light on this incredible process , from the beginnings of life around 3.8 billion years ago, to the millions of different species alive today, including the moon-walking, talking apes with super-powerful brains–human beings! Filled with clear explanations , beautiful illustrations and fascinating facts about the planet’s strangest and most spectacular creatures, Amazing Evolution will keep children (and adults, too!) enthralled for hours. Delve into the pages and learn what makes a fish a fish, why giraffes have such long necks and how all living things, from cabbages to tigers, are related!  Amazing Evolution is the perfect first book about evolution for young readers.",
