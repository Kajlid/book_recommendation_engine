  "description": "She sold herself for rough play and career-making story—not murder!  Celia Brentwood, fetish reporter for San Francisco’s Inappropriate Voices, agrees to auction herself off as a BDSM slave for thirty days. She plans to write a first-person exposé, but after she’s purchased by Garrett Lawrence, the most eligible gay bachelor in town, her story becomes an insider peek at the man whose lover was brutally murdered five years before.  Garrett still mourns the loss of his beloved, but the past is hard to let go when it’s stalking him. The killer is obsessed with Garrett, and becomes incensed when his target claims a slave. When Celia’s ruse is discovered, Garrett sends her away. The killer decides she may not be as hated as Garrett claims and will be the perfect route to lure out his prey.  Thomás Stephanopoulos, one of Garrett’s closest friends and confidants, recognizes something special in Celia, a darkness that mirrors his own. After Garrett abandons her, will she accept the lure of self-discovery, he dangles before her? Or will she cling to the man who christened her Kitten?
