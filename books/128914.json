Experiences and studies have both led to finding an effective solution that promises to last a lifetime.In finding solutions, the primary consideration is getting to identify the problem. Since the main element of the present work is a health issue of the human body, the more relevant item for contention is the physical aspect.Everyone will always wish a life that is free of pain. A mosquito bite, no matter how tiny, is not desirable. Getting pricked even by a thumbtack or a sewing pin can be a cause of unwanted annoyance. How much more will one react to the soreness that the blisters of herpes give?That is the physical problem, discomfort. Sadly enough, the aches do not stay for one minute or for one day but can be there for a few days or sometimes for a week.The two general types of herpes will be discussed in the next chapter. It may be necessary though to preliminarily examine the first one.Genital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus and is usually transmitted through sexual intercourse. By known accounts or recorded cases, it is the most common among the sexually transmitted diseases or STDs. What multiplies the predicament regarding herpes is that in many instances, the people infected by the dreaded micro-organism do not know that they already have the disease. Also, they may not experience outbreaks of blisters which appear like cold sores, one of the usual signs of infection. Owing to those circumstances, the likelihood of spreading the infection is great. Hence, from the sociological viewpoint, the asymptomatic characteristic of herpes in most instances puts limitations in the efforts to prevent its transmission to others. This can be especially true to the husbands and wives of infected spouses or among sex partners.Until recently, the universal acceptation is that herpes cannot be cured or treated. The pain can only be mitigated or the carrier can be soothed for brief and temporary relief. Be that as it may, the symptoms of the disease become less painful and the recurrence becomes less frequent as the years go by and the carrier ages. Still, it comes back once in a while unless completely treated or cured which is what the discussions here are all about.In appearing or reappearing, genital herpes is manifested by sores in the genital area which are in the form of inflammations on the outside of the affected skin. In a person who is infected for the first time, the outbreak occurs between four and seven days from the time of sexual contact. The derma openings, which are actually wounds, cause the hurt to the sufferer.In the case of pregnant women, the unfortunate situation is aggravated or worsened in that the infection can possibly be fatal to the newborn baby when the brain of the latter is attacked by the virus.The manifestations of genital herpes in both males and females are in almost the same body parts or nearby. To men, the appearances may be in the outer penis shaft or in the glans penis or in other portions of the genitals. They may also appear in the anus, thighs or buttocks. To women, the outbreaks or skin lesions may occur in the vulva, in the pubis area, in the clitoris, vulva or labia, and also in the anus and buttocks. get rid of herpes, treat and cure herpes, herpes books, herpes",
