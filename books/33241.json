  "title": "Fidelis",
  "description": "With a successful novelist as its hero, a man phenomenally ugly, Cambridge plots the love story where the hero avoids declaring his love because he shrinks from the possible reaction of Fidelis to his repulsive appearance. All comes right in the end but one is never confident that this will be the conclusion. The reader is carried along with the story that moves between Melbourne, Sydney and England involving the varied fortunes of the ugly hero who remains ugly. There is no magical plastic surgery to change him into Prince Charming. In spite of this the book has a happy fairy tale ending.",
