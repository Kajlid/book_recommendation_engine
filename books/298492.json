  "description": "Fifteen years after the Collapse of our society, resources are becoming scarce, and accountability non-existent. Small pockets of survivors gather about the region known as the Black Swamp, fighting for their own survival, while others seek to control the region with an iron fist. Ideals on society clash as an old-world disappears, and a new one is ruled by the victors.",
