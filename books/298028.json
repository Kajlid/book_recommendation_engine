  "description": "There will always be times in your life when you will fall and forget to get yourself up. But, as you march ahead, you will see the light of eternal God and his universe. My Soul Rants is a poetry collection of trials and tribulations, sorrows and pain, happiness, and victory, an unending war with self, and rising from the ashes like a phoenix. Gurpreet Dhariwal is raw, rough, and honest in her poetry and some of the poems are from the time when she was 18 years old. As she grew up as a woman, her world found a different meaning in the stories she read, the poetry she writes and the people she meets and greets in life.The author, Gurpreet Dhariwal, is as dark as the nightmare you have had and as sweet as the sugar in your last chocolate shake. There is no mediocrity for her; she is either all of it or nothing. She detests the magical hustle-bustle of city life as she belongs to the old-school class. She finds her bliss in the world of prose, poetry, and stories. She gives a damn how the world perceives her as it took her a great deal to wear her scars on her sleeve and accept her flaws as strengths. Her world revolves around books, and she is an avid reader. She travels to places she reads about, makes friends with the characters, falls in love, and fights with demons she gets to face every day.",
