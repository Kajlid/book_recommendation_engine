After a series of accidental events, he learns that he was sent a thousand years through time to be hidden from an evil king. And as if he wasnâ€™t already busy enough struggling to fit in with school bullies, he discovers a lost prophecy that he must play a role in. As Edgar and his friends find the surrounding darkness closer than they think, they must stand together and destroy the one named Henry before they are all overwhelmed.",
