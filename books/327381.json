  "description": "\"Freeze!\" Duane \"Dog\" Chapman entertains and inspires millions on Dog the Bounty Hunter, his #1-rated show on A&E -- but there is more to his story. From troubled beginnings and tragedy to triumph and transformation, he reveals all for the first time in this no-holds-barred memoir. Dog spent the first twenty-three years of his life on the wrong side of the law. In You Can Run, but You Cant Hide , he offers an inside look at his days as a gang member; his dark years of addiction and abuse; and how serving eighteen months in prison for a murder he didnt commit helped him recommit to his faith. He also shares stories of some of his most dangerous bounty hunts -- including his capture of Max Factor heir and convicted rapist Andrew Luster, which made international headlines. In You Can Run, but You Cant Hide , Dog recounts his incredible story, chronicling his journey from his onetime criminal past to the guiding faith that has led him to become one of the most successful bounty hunters in American history. Against all odds, Dog turned his life around and went from ex-con to American icon in the process. This is his story.",
