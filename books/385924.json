Shakil disguises himself to slip into the Spanish stronghold of Sebta, and with a Spanish fleet hot on their heels, Thorton, Shakil, and Henrique flee for their lives-only to run smack into the arms of the British navy. Arrested for desertion and sodomy, Thorton is obliged to surrender his arms and give his parole and serve as a lieutenant aboard the Ajax under the dour and proper Captain Ebenezer Horner. His former friend, Lieutenant Roger Perry, becomes his worst enemy. He is harassed and taunted, in spite of his victories at sea.Thorton's Sallee friends do not abandon him. Captain Tangle comes to his rescue, but the redoubtable corsair meets his match in the steely Captain Horner. Determined to do his duty and turn Thorton over for trial before the notorious homophobe, Admiral Walters, Horner must keep the impetuous Turk at bay even when being menaced by the Spanish who are bent on revenge against them all.Men of Honor carries on the tradition of nautical derring-do in exotic and colorful locations, written by a tall ship sailor and internationally acclaimed poet, M. Kei.",
