  "description": "At '70s Marvel, no one mastered the startling scope and high-concept complexity of cosmic adventure like Jim Starlin! And his work on Adam Warlock set the tone for star-spanning spectacle that is considered a high-water mark to this day. Starlin evolved Warlock to the next level, imbuing the character with the inner demons of a man-god on the brink of insanity. Forced to confront an evil version of himself and the nihilisti c menace Thanos, Warlock's conflicts weren't just knuckle-grinding throw-downs; they were epic, existenti al struggles for his very soul. Featuring the fi rst-ever assembling of the Infinity Gems. COLLECTING: Strange Tales 178-181, Warlock 9-15, Avengers Annual 7, Marvel Two-In-One Annual 2",
