  "description": "Want to know more about how your brain works? Want to learn to work with your mind, instead of against it? Ever wonder about those images from dreams, from when you read a really good book, or just from daydreaming? In this book the seams between our experience of mental visualizations (dream images, daydreams, imagination, or Tibetan icons such as Medicine Buddha) and what the latest in Neuroscience has to say about images, are joined in easy to read, simple language. An excerpt from the book, \"Comprised of billions of neurons or brain cells, our brains light up with tiny electrical chages when the neurons connect. For example, neurons connect when we perform an action. As we perform the same action repetitively the circuits of those connecting neurons grows larger. As those circuits grow larger, it becomes increasingly natural and increasingly easy, to repeat the action, behaviour or thought associated. These circuits may be measured on fMRI machines, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging machines.\"",
