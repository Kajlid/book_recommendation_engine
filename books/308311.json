  "description": "A Novel of Mountains, Tall Trees, Fog, Longing, Love, Time, and a Broken PromiseSet in the majestic wilds of northwest Montana, this contemporary saga evolves through a coming-of-age tale, a love story, and a “leeward side of life’s” struggle with introspection.As a young man, Haakon ventures to America’s Inland Northwest to gain summer employment with a building contractor. In short order, this suburban Midwesterner develops a passion for the untamed, dramatic landscape and an admiration for its colorful, rural culture. And, by chance, atop a cedar shake roof deep in the woods, he meets Kari and discovers love.But despite a burgeoning romance, fate has other plans. It launches Haakon and Kari onto separate trajectories. College, marriage, career, parenthood, graduations, and retirement come to pass and a, now, graying man finds himself at a crossroad. Haakon chooses to retrace a path from his past. Borrowing the words of Joseph Campbell, he “follows his bliss.” And in doing so, he circles back to the northwest Montana of his youth.Once returned, an event unravels so perfectly that mere happenstance seems implausible. It gives Haakon a second chance to make amends for a previous, painful choice.Gary Spetz writes of a “time and place and people” he had known well. As a lifelong painter, he vividly portrays Haakon's journey with brushstrokes of words. To author/artist Spetz, the setting of Sometimes It Feels Like Far is as paramount as the novel’s sentiments. Sometimes It Feels Like Far is a tale of adventure, beauty, and true things... and love—all in a romanticized world where the land and the sky and the mist merge into one.",
