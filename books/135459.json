  "title": "A Conversation With Cain: Death follows all men - some longer than others",
  "description": "When the woman he loves dies, Troy is terrified of the void; the nothingness that follows death. The intensity of his cry of pain draws to him the lost figure of Cain, ageless and alone. Together they embark on a perilous journey, both of them haunted - one by the desire to live forever, the other by his terrible past, which has trailed him through the wonders and horrors of eternity, and seems to be catching up. Both men are in danger and each holds the key to protect the other from revenge so ancient, it is no longer even cold.",
