  "title": "The Visual Side",
  "description": "“In his poetry collection, Christopher Obert tries to give the reader visual clues of his poetry on love and rejection… Obert plays the seductive role—like a stripper slowly revealing the layers of himself through his relationships with women. But the often haunting pictures in The Visual Side do indeed add to the poetry and put a face on his passions, making the words more difficult to forget.” Coralie Hughes Jensen, author of “Passup Point”",
