  "description": "Book Blurb Description of Atlas Down An ordinary man, Dan Lepsky, an awkward extrovert with high hopes but not much to offer, winds up on a wild adventure. Dan faces advanced science, nature, and worst of all, a vendetta which he can't quite wrap his mind around. Atlas Down tells the story of the Atlas Research Institute's over reaching policies and violent cover-ups, all the while explaining the involvement of Dan Lepsky, a truly unlucky and unlikely hero. A twisting, jarring tale that is packed with great plot twists and a journey to the United Kingdom that a fool hardy American like Dan would never have imagined possible. Unlike Scott's previous works, series like the Everlasting Night and Enchanted Lands of Bisclona, Atlas Down is a stand-alone adventure.All first edition copies of Atlas Down include two bonus short stories. Jack of Aces and Diner on 7th Avenue \"Within the Husk\"",
