  "description": "Praying to be saved by a man who can fly will get you killed! From Warren Ellis, the creator of THE AUTHORITY and PLANETARY, comes the most horrifying superhero comic you’ll ever read! When scientists build messianic super-humans to save the world, no one thought about how these heroes would do it – or even if they’d want to. So begins the apocalyptic tomorrow, when supermen kill us all and end the world just because we wanted to be rescued by human-shaped things from beyond Science itself!",
