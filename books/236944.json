  "title": "Missing",
  "description": "A directionless and unreliable college freshman goes on a quest to make life into art in obsessive and creepy ways. An inmate in a confinement cell writes a letter to his ex, explaining a bizarre occurrence. Santeria, love, magic, and memory are explored from Kendall to Little Havana. A night’s hellish adventure for one suburban hoodlum comes full circle. A war story is shared at Jackson Memorial Hospital’s detox unit. A father somehow entangles his scat fetish with his child. The dissolution of a Halloween party in Wynwood ends with a crossbow. And a tale that involves two friends, a boat, the Gulf Stream, dolphins, necrophilia, and an overdose of LSD are among the thirteen stories found in Missing, a collection born and raised in Miami.",
