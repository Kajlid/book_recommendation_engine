  "description": "When a previously unknown Robert A. Heinlein manuscript turns up in the far future, it's up to Gerald Knave to divine the truth -- or lack of it -- in this humorous sci-fi spoof.\"Both Knave and I have more respect and admiration for Robert A. Heinlein than either of us can well say. Nothing said by any person in this report is to be taken as a denigration of Heinlein or his work; indeed, no sf writer mentioned, quoted from, or alluded to by Knave or by any Misfit lacks the respect and admiration we both gladly give him, or her.\"--Laurence M.
