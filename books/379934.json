  "description": "A tale of two worlds.In her most ambitious and prophetic novel to date, Ursula K. Le Guin has produced a stunning tour de force — the spellbinding story of Shevek, a brilliant physicist who single-handedly attemps to re-unite two planets cut off from each other by centuries of distrust.Anarres, Shevek's homeland, is a bleak moon settled by an anarchic utopian civilization; Urras, the mother planet, is a world very similar to Earth, with its warring nations, great poverty, and immense wealth. Shevek risks everything in a courageous visit to Urras — to learn, to teach, to share. But his gift becomes a threat... and in the profound conflict which ensues, Shevek must re-examine his philosophy of life.Cover illustration by Alex Ebel",
