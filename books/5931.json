  "description": "A successful businessman, Richard William Barker has accomplished much in life. Together with his wife, Connie, he was about to embark on a long-dreamed-of sailing adventure. Little did he know that his dream was to become his nightmare.In The Crossing, the reader is taken on this action-packed, fateful voyage and through a twist of fate is transported back to the Second World War where Richard's late father, Billy Barker, a naval rating assigned as crew on a Motor Torpedo Boat, is captured by the enemy during a daring action off the French coast. His story of survival and friendship against all odds contrasts with his own burgeoning love for a pretty English girl, and leads Richard to begin his own recovery and understand that life must go on.Based on a true incident, this powerfully emotive tale of passion and love across two generations in the parallel settings of modern day action and the horrors of war makes an utterly compelling read with a refreshing and very different approach to subjects which are normally the preserve of male authors.",
