  "description": "'Micro Musings' is an eclectic mix of micro-poetry on topics including romance, humour, miscellany, horror and erotic. ‘She came on the gossamer wings of a dream. We met. We kissed. We loved. Then morning broke to only a fragrant pillow.’ ‘It was not of this earth, but rather from beneath its surface, a slithering fetid thing, hungering for human flesh and blood.’",
