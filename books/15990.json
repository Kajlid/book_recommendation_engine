  "title": "No Land! No House! No Vote!: Voices from Symphony Way",
  "description": "Early in 2007, hundreds of families living in shacks in Cape Town were moved into houses they had been waiting for since the end of the apartheid. But soon they were told that the move had been illegal, and they were kicked out of their new homes. They built shacks next to the road opposite the housing project and hundreds organized themselves into the Symphony Way Anti-Eviction Campaign, vowing to stay on the road until the government gave them permanent housing. This anthology of stories of justice miscarried, of violence domestic and public, of bigotry and xenophobia, is both testimony and poetry. This book is a means to dignity, a way for the poor to reflect and be reflected. It is testimony that there's thinking in the shacks, that there are humans who dialogue, theorize, and fight to bring about change.",
