  "title": "Only in India: Adventures of an International Educator",
  "description": "\"We're moving to India!\"Travel along with two international educators who take the leap and move to Gurgaon, India, to become principals at an Indian/International school. Excited by the opulent marble hallways and the grandness of the school, they quickly learn it lacks even the most basic supplies, like chalkboard erasers. The couple, however, make a go of it and ultimately adjust to the dizzying day-to-day life of Indian society where sacred cows stop for red lights, women wear glittery saris while planting rice, and dreadlocked sadhus go about renouncing all their worldly pleasures.Part memoir, part travelogue, and part tragic comedy, readers will marvel at all the couple have to endure only to end up leaving the school and India abruptly, without even so much as a Namaste. Despite a catastrophe or two, their go-with-the-flow attitudes and kindred sense of humor help them endure India's overwhelming bustle while recognizing and appreciating its distinctive allure.",
