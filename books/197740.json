Anna and Elena, her loving daughters, grapple with grief. Her faithful dog, Tom, watches and waits. But Joanna has only one thing on her agenda: revenge. She streaks through contemporary Manhattan, chasing Ned down, determined to hold him accountable for leaving her alone in her darkest hour.Along the way, Joanna revisits the beautiful life she once had, the choices she made and the consequences she suffered. She is transported by memory into desire and even deeper, into her very soul, where she searches for what's been lost ... and finds what is eternal. At the end of her journey, none of them - Jo's daughters, her dog, Ned and the ghost Joanna - will ever be the same.Fierce and funny, dark and uplifting, a sexy, lyrical page-turner, The Next is at its heart, a love story about a ghost who is determined to fix her life, even after she's dead.",
