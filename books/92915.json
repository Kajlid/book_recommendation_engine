  "title": "Fooling Ewe",
  "description": "A beautifully illustrated picture book about Ewe, a precocious young sheep who's bored grazing all alone. Now Ewe wants to play and play tricks, on Chicken, Cow, and even Farmer. A sheep that doesn't follow, Ewe is mischievous but good-natured, thinks about now, not later, and wants to play, not work. No fooling, Ewe is you and the (\"ewe\" vs \"you\") wordplay in FOOLING EWE provides a sense of interaction between young readers and the characters. So follow along and see what it's like to be Ewe, to \"Be different. Be Ewe.\"",
