  "description": "Imperial Wizard Saul Karza has a problem. He has to kill an invulnerable dragon and he's left his army at home. There's only one thing that will turn his fatal failure into survivable success - The Last Dragon Slayer. ~Saul Karza, wizard of the Empire, has been given a quest by the Empress herself: To find and slay a mythical 'noble dragon'; said to be near invulnerable. Instead of leading a large band of soldiers, archers and spell-casters, he sets out with two immigrant dock-workers and a homeless dwarf. What Saul needs is the legendary 'Last Dragon Slayer' on his side, because on this deadly quest it's not only Saul's favour with the Empress that's at stake - but also his life.The Deathsworn Arc Series:-Deathsworn Arc : The Last Dragon SlayerDeathsworn Arc 2 : The Verkreath HorrorDeathsworn Arc 3 : The Blood Queen",
