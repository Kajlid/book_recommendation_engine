  "description": "Let’s face zombies are hot, and baby, they’re getting hotter. Although not the most traditional of sex symbols, zombies are truly coming into their own, even landing on the silver screen in romantic roles, not to mention ambling and shambling across the pages of novels and television screens. Gone are those one-dimensional scary characters from George Romero’s grim and gruesome flick Night of the Living Dead . Zombies now have a lot more to offer to the non-zombie world.From the best-selling novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies to the hit TV series The Walking Dead , zombies are taking over as a source of entertainment. So isn’t it about time they had their more . . . err . . . romantic and sexy sides showcased? Mitzi Szereto wrote the sex back into Pride and Prejudice and her new Love, Lust and Zombies warms the coldest among us with stories so daring they can even raise the dead!",
