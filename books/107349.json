So long as they believed in one another, the rest did not matter very much after all. And when at last, shivering with cold, he crept back to bed, it was only to find through the Gates of Sleep a more direct way to the things he had been thinking about, and to wander for the rest of the night, unwatched and free, through the wonders of an Enchanted Landâ€¦\"A spell binding story about a young boy who suffers a near fatal accident and the ensuing out of body of experience he has as he fights to continue to live. Algernon Blackwood takes us on an astral adventure as only he can.",
