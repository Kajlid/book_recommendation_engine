  "description": "NOTE: The content of 'CONTEST' is approximately 200,000 words. A simple error leaves Leah with a unique Neural Enhancement Chip and a rapidly evolving AI implanted in her brain. In ‘Nascent’, she evaded kidnapping by virtual slavers and helped shut down some operations of the virtual crime syndicate that uses mind-controlled players as slaves. In ‘Odyssey’, she not only found a way to escape, but she also uncovered deeper plots being carried out in both the virtual multi-universe and reality. In ‘Change’, Leah began learning how to use the additional connections her chip has made throughout her body. The Pod facility she opened expanded as she helped others from her neighbourhood. Leah discovered that the crime syndicate has an even greater presence in the virtual multiverse than she’d imagined. As she begins to unravel some of their secrets, they tarnish her reputation and kidnap.  In ‘Rescue’ Leah hacked the secure Vault where an AI friend of hers had been archived. She not only managed to retrieve her friend but uncovered a deeper conspiracy. Leah also managed to rescue her mother from the crime syndicate but not before her mother had an AI chip inserted in her brain. She discovers that her boyfriend’s family controls their own crime syndicate and he is being controlled. In ‘Ipseity’ Leah discovers that the syndicate inserted a dangerous explosive AI chip in her mother. Leah’s neural architecture change allowing her greater awareness of what is happening around her as well as giving her an ability to multitask. She rescues her boyfriend as she moves closer on three virtual worlds to finishing significant quests. All the while Leah works to win freedom and a future for her Personal AI who is self-aware in a system that demands she be archived or deleted.  In ‘Contest’ Leah makes headway in all three quests as well as competing in the first Merkize Contest. Each of the quests is a contest of sorts, and she faces stronger adversaries than she has previously. Through all this, Leah struggles with her injuries and the threat of arrest overshadowing everything she does.",
