  "description": "In the 1970s, legendary writer and artist Steve Ditko created a hero named Rac Shade, wearer of the fantastic M-Vest. Now he's back...after a fashion. When 23-year-old Kathy George returns to her former home, hoping to find closure on the deaths of her parents, murdered before her in her childhood, she is horrified to discover the killer still there, apparently waiting for her. But the truth is even stranger - the man who killed her parents is dead, and in his body is Shade, a refugee from another dimension! For both Kathy and Shade, everything's about to change...Peter Milligan (\"X-Statix\"), Chris Bachalo (\"Death\") and Mark Pennington (\"Hellblazer\") present an incredible re-imagination of the classic 1970s character! Warning: Adults Only.",
