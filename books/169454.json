  "description": "“Wonderfully entertaining…” Jayne Ann Krentz  Nicole Edwards has walked down the aisle as a bridesmaid thirteen times! Thirteen times! In an effort to change her luck, this master baker plans to give up waiting for Jake – who doesn’t know she’s alive – sell her business in New York City, buy a food truck in Los Angeles, and find her own happily ever after.  Chef Sean O’Malley could use Nicole’s dessert skills at his restaurant in New York City. In fact, he’s banking on a joint venture with Nicole, although he hasn’t yet approached her about it. When he learns during a pre-wedding event they’re both working that she’s moving to L.A. because she’s giving up on Jake, he decides to give her a crash course on how to be noticed. Sean has, after all, three younger sisters. He knows how a woman’s mind works. But he doesn’t factor in how his heart works or how easily it could be broken.
