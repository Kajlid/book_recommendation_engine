  "description": "About Eye Spy by Drew Zachary Private eye DB has a pretty unusual partner. Jesse's been in his office a lot longer than he has, hanging around like ghosts kinda have to. They do pretty well together, playing chess and solving cases, which Jesse figures is better than an eternity popping in and out of walls. The new case they take seems pretty average, but it turns out to be more than they bargain for. DB and Jesse end up embroiled in a murder investigation, one that might leave an innocent man in jail if they don't get it solved. They have a lot more to learn about each other, too, but can a man and a ghost find any common ground to touch on?",
