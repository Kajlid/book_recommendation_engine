  "description": "Magic is real… Too bad I suck at it.I was a freak from day one – the orphaned, weird kid with ghost-white hair tends to stick out like a sore thumb. So, when a mystery aunt invites me to start a new life, I don’t ask questions. I board a plane. Pronto.But surprise! *insert sarcasm* It’s all a lie and a bizarre lady in a dusty junk shop basically shoves me into a closet… and I tumble into a magical world.Which might be awesome, if I weren’t a freak there too. Apparently, at Borealis Academy, my powerful uncle… who I don’t know… wants to blow up the world or something.*spoiler* He’s the bad guy who wants me to join him in the destruction.Thank the stars, the academy can't kick me out unless I'm unable to master magic – which, unfortunately, is even more difficult than it sounds.One bright spot is my broody, hot spellcasting tutor required to help up my skills. Although, he seems to have his own aggravating secrets.If he’d just let me get close enough I think we could help each other solve our problems.But my magical and romance troubles are only just beginning when my dark family past catches up with me. Now, I must quickly master my powers, or it could lead to a far worse fate than expulsion…Since it might be up to me to save everyone.",
