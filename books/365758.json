  "title": "Jessan",
  "description": "The first volume of The Cronnex relates how Jessan, the first of the story's two teenage protagonists, is snatched away from his quiet life as a fisherboy by a mysterious stranger. From then on, he is thrust into one highly dangerous situation after another, pursued by an implacable enemy intent on preventing him from realizing his true powers. Ultimately, Jessan must undertake a perilous journeyâ€”to escape capture, to find his twin, Niccas, and to realize his destiny as one of the two Nithaial, magical beings who experiences life as humans, but incorporate within themselves the power to bring harmony to the world and the lives of men.Fortunately for Jessan, the herbalist Alfrund, his companion through most of the volume, is as brave and resourceful an ally during their long journey as he is a willing and considerate lover. With him (and on his own), Jessan explores the possibilities of male sex and learns to master his many powers, as the two make a long journey, first by sea, then across the entire kingdom, to a hidden valley where he will fight a climactic battle with a powerful and ingenious necromancer and an entire army of the undead.",
