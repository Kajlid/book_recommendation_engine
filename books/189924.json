  "description": "A fast-paced, beautifully written debut novel set in the contemporary art scene. Where can the art of sensation possibly go next?In an audacious stroke, celebrated British artist Esther Glass puts herself up for sale by auction at Sothebys, as a living masterpiece, to be owned by the highest bidder for a week. For each day of her possession, she will perform as one of seven iconic women, themselves the subjects of great paintings from the Christina of Denmark by Holbein; Olympia by Manet; Madonna of the Pinks by Raphael; Madame de Sengonnes by Ingres; Mrs. Leyland by Whistler; Isabella D’Este by Leonardo da Vinci; and, Judith and Holofernes by Klimt.Esther’s extraordinary art adventure takes her to major European galleries and the Frick in New York to research her seven selected masterpieces. Once sold, she goes to Manhattan for her week of ownership. There she is forced to confront financial corruption by her dealers, the instability of her relationships with her lovers and, on her return to London, her own intrinsic values as an artist, daughter and woman.Masterpiece comes at a seminal moment in the art world, when the art of sensation has possibly run its course. It is, itself, a masterpiece of insight, giving us rare access into the workings of the contemporary art scene, and examines the effects of self-obsession, celebrity and greed on the part of its key players.",
