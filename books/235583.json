  "description": "MICAH: Ten years ago I fucked up. I pushed the one thing I loved the most away. I watched her run as far as she could. I ruined the love we had. I threw myself into the Marine's thinking I could get her out of my system. That didn't work.  When I came back I got the worst news ever. Or so I thought. Now I'm forced to keep a promise I made and find the one girl that stole my heart.  AUBRIE: We had a love that was stronger than it should have been. He threw it away though. After a series of unfortunate events, I was settled and stable. Happy? Not quiet but when Micah shows up and rocks my world to the core I'm forced back into my old life. A life I ran from. Now being back in the one place I used to call home, I don't know where I belong.",
