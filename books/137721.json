  "description": "My Soul Keeper blurb:What if your entire reality changed on you one day? You wake up and your family and friends aren't who you thought they were. You look around, and the world isn't what you thought it was. You don't even recognize yourself. You and your reality are a complete mystery to you. Simone's life was about to undergo that disturbing journey. Love, lust, death, betrayal. How do you fight the devil himself when he consumes you with lust? How can you love someone who has come to take back your brotherâ€™s soul? Shamar, soul keeper and son of Death, had never met such a unique soul before Simone. Captivated by her, he broke all rules to be near her -- to love and protect her. But how do you protect someone from evil when the forces of good seem to be working against you? When Lucifer himself crawled from Hell to claim Simone, what sacrifices would Shamar make to keep her safe?",
