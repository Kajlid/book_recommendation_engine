  "title": "Dying To Dance: A Maddie Fitzpatrick Dance Mystery",
  "description": "Noted Argentine Tango choreographer Maddie Fitzpatrick returns to her hometown of Pembroke to teach at a local dance school after a televised dance fiasco upsets her career. No sooner there, but Maddie finds herself thrown into another unsettling situation when one of the school’s students dies suddenly and horrifically during a dance class––apparently from an allergic reaction. When Maddie’s first love––now a local detective––arrives on the scene to investigate, she believes that her new life can’t possibly get anymore complicated. Of course, she’s wrong, because she soon begins to realize that the victim’s demise is anything but an accident. She decides to investigate the circumstances of the woman’s life––and death––on her own, to clear the dance school and its charming director Peter of any adverse publicity. To do this, she has to figure out how eager real estate agents, eccentric dance teachers, unstable nurses, and several popular dance students fit into the mystery. Will more people succumb before Maddie puts all the clues together and discovers why they are DYING TO DANCE?",
