  "description": "Two gripping plays by one of America's most exciting playwrights Boy's Life: love, relationships, and growing up in New York City \"a substantial play. It makes Howard Korder a presence to take seriously in the theater\" (Village Voice); Search and Destroy: corporate politics, lies and relationships \"You know the worst thing a man can do, Mr Carling? He can undertake an adventure. He can misjudge his strength and he can destroy himself.\" The Daily Telegraph described it as \"one of those all-too-rare plays where you desperately want to know what is going to happen next.\" Search and Destroy received its British premiere at the Royal Court Theatre in May 1993.",
