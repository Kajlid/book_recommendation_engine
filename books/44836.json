  "title": "Detroit Daze",
  "description": "A prequel to the John Oxman Voyages Trilogy set in 1970's Detroit. A coming of age novel full of street fights, gangs and gritty dialogue, characters and awkward teenage love that I promise you will never forget. USA Today, best selling author, Rebecca Forster, calls it better than Catcher in the Rye. Always a five star review grabber.",
