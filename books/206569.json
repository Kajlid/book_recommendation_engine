  "description": "For one man, they are the five most terrifying words of all…your heart belongs to me One year after the heart transplant that saved his life, thirty-five-year-old Ryan Perry has never felt better. He’s getting back everything he nearly lost forever―his business, his life, and, with luck, his beloved girlfriend. Miracles do happen. Then the unmarked gifts begin to arrive―a box of candy hearts, a heart-shaped pendant. Most disturbing of all is a graphic heart-surgery video and its chilling Your heart belongs to me. Ryan is being stalked by someone who feels entitled to everything he has. She’s the spitting image of the twenty-six-year-old donor of the heart beating steadily in Ryan’s chest. And she’s come to take it back.",
