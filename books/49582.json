  "title": "Apostle Islands",
  "description": "Fiction. It's not easy for a messiah to grow up in the Badlands of North Dakota. And it's even harder for him to share his message when radical ideas and so-called \"miracles\" are the surest way to get the FBI breathing down your neck. The sequel to NAZARETH, NORTH DAKOTA, APOSTLE ISLANDS follows Sam Davidson and his group of roughneck followers as they save wedding receptions, cure cancer patients, and boost a flagging fishing season, all while breaking bread and laws and making peace and enemies.On a mission to change one botched up world, Sam knows he will one day be called to make the ultimate sacrifice, and indeed he sees the writing on the shores of Lake Superior when one of his inner circle betrays him. A playful and delightfully irreverent take on the New Testament, APOSTLE ISLANDS reveals what it takes to shake up the status quo while paying the price to save the ones you love.",
