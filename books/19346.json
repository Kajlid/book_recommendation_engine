  "description": "\"Lapham, an Eisner Award winner (for Stray Bullets), has expertly crafted a tale with great dialog. His well-paced panels of stark black-and-white illustration convey the story's movement through the dark recesses of his narrative.\" - Library Journal (Starred Review) \"Very nifty, so much so that this mainstream edition of a decadeold indie original is as welcome a revival as can be.\" -- Booklist After a decade out-of-print, another great El Capitan graphic novel returns! Hanging from the ceiling fan in their lavish Hollywood home. That's where Steven Russell finds his estranged wife, a tear-stained note in her pocket pouring out years of pain and regret. Is it suicide? The police think so. But his wife's rich and powerful family is convinced otherwise, and they'll do everything in their power to make him pay. As Steven's life is systematically destroyed by a lascivious private detective, a chance meeting with an old friend drives him back toward a simpler time when the world was full of hope-to a downtrodden neighborhood he had long left behind and a fateful reunion with a woman who loved him.... David Lapham's love letter to classic noir takes you down the long, dark road of obsession, sex, betrayal, and murder. Peeling back the carefully constructed facades of each character, he exposes the true nature of their humanity and propels you toward a final, horrifying revelation.",
