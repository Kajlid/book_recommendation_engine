  "description": "Eli Walsh and Wolf Grant have been good, platonic friends for the better part of a year. Though Eli's always been attracted to Grant, he's resigned himself to being just friends. But when Eli finds out Grant cruises for dates at the local gay leather club, he goes there, determined to convince Grant that the only one he should be bringing home that night is Eli. The problem is that if Eli tells Grant flat-out he wants him, it could ruin their friendship. Eli's had that happen before, and he's not about to risk it happening again. Grant's offers to mentor Eli in the BDSM lifestyle seems the perfect solution. Though Grant insists they'll remain just friends, Eli is sure that during the intimacy of their play he can show Grant exactly how he feels, make Grant crave Eli so much that he won't want their lessons to end. And when Eli learns how powerful submission to Grant can be, he's certain they're meant to be together. But heartbreak in Grant's past has made him wary of falling in love. Can Eli convince Grant to take a chance on their relationship, or will Eli's confession of loving Grant destroy their friendship once and for all? Gay / Contemporary / BDSM",
