This is the story that came before, when Britain was just a Shadowland.Shadowland is a story of historical fantasy set in Dark Ages Britain.`I have lived more years than I can remember, probably more than the sum of all your years combined.

Now, as the tribes unite to reclaim their land, one man must rise to lead them and become their true and only king.",
