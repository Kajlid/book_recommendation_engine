  "description": "Nineteen-year-old Claire MacDougal prides herself on being sexy, independent, and noncommittal. She shows off what her mother gave her in a scantily clad uniform, getting big tips at the restaurant where she works. Then, she encounters an old classmate with educational ambitions who invites her to his church, and she finds herself falling for him despite the fact that they come from two different worlds. Stuart Jacobs had always had feelings for Claire in high school, but never pursued her because his extracurricular activities would not permit him the time to have a relationshipâ€¦nor was he her ideal. Now his mother is adamant on him meeting and pursuing a relationship with the daughter of a highly esteemed mayoral candidate, but after running into Claire after graduation, he sees it as fate and will stop at nothing to be with her. However, when he finds himself competing with a friend for her attention, she becomes the talk of every concerned mother at Renewal Baptist Church. Meanwhile, Cecelia Faulks, First Lady of Renewal, is dedicating her summer to instilling faith and wisdom into a group of young adults, all while trying to keep the church and her marriage together with a smile. Cecelia sees the bond forming between Claire and Stuart and tries to talk down the bad rumors swirling about her, but when the rumors are confirmed, will it be too late to change for the girl who was all about her thighs?",
