  "description": "Gettin’ dirty? He’s down with that.At twenty-eight, Jackson Ramsey is more than ready for marriage and a couple of rug rats. Instead, his SEAL teammates have all found love, while he’s still playing the field. And to be honest? The field is full of certifiable nutcases.When his teammates offer to set him up, Jackson figures what the hell? It’s not as if he has anything to lose. Several overeager, overdone, or just plain oversexed women later, he’s almost wishing for a long deployment—maybe to Mars—to escape the parade of disasters sent his way.That’s when the denim-clad rear end of his neighbor’s smart, sassy, green-eyed gardener catches his eye. Except she wants nothing to do with him. Little does she know a SEAL knows a thing or two about playing in the dirt…Warning: This very short freebie does not include a happily ever after. Be prepared to commiserate with a sexy SEAL on his journey for love. But don’t worry—he’ll find it soon!",
