  "description": "He arrived on an iron horse. And when the train pulled away, the town had a boxcar full of trouble. He went by the name of Speedy. Some called him a tramp - and others called him worse. Speedy was a young con man who knew the fastest way to a rich man's wallet and a pretty girl's heart. To Speedy, Durfee didn't look any different from a hundred other towns he'd seen before. There were fat bankers waiting for his smooth talk, and lovely young ladies ready to swoon over his smile and his guitar playing. But this time the charming trickster was about to meet his match - in a girl out to steal his heart!",
