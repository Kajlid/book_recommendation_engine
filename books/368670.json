  "description": "One day, Dave Navarro opened the doors of this house in the Hollywood Hills to the chaos of the valley below. His only rule was, \"You come in the house, you get in the photo booth.\" The result is a shocking, rocking, not-to-be-believed diary, sociological experiment, Hollywood documentary, and exercise in exhibitionism. From strippers, drug dealers, record execs, cleaning ladies, and pizza delivery guys, to celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, Marilyn Manson, Rose McGowan, Keanu Reeves, Flea, Billy Zane, and Natalie Imbruglia, anyone who entered Navarro's house was caught on film. And it didn't matter if they were wild and crazy, inebriated, naked, hamming it up, looking gorgeous or downright ugly. Accompanying the photo-strops are hilarious stories, musings, tell-all anecdotes, and other rare glimpses into the lifestyle of one of the most decadent rock stars of our time. Visually stunning and deliciously readable, Spread is truly an irresistible guilty pleasure.",
