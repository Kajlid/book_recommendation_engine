  "description": "“Provides a sturdy literary exoskeleton to the field of human insectivory . . . it entertains as it enlightens.” ― Daniella Martin, author of An Adventure into the World of Eating Insects and the Last Great Hope to Save the Planet Will eating insects change the world for the better? Meet the there are millions and millions of them and many fewer of the rest of us ― mammals, birds, and reptiles. Since before recorded history, humans have eaten insects. While many get squeamish at the idea, entomophagy ― people eating insects ― is a possible way to ensure a sustainable and secure food supply for the eight billion of us on the planet. Once seen as the great enemy of human civilization, destroying our crops and spreading plagues, we now see insects as marvelous pollinators of our food crops and a potential source of commercial food supply. From upscale restaurants where black ants garnish raw salmon to grubs as pub snacks in Paris and Tokyo, from backyard cricket farming to high-tech businesses, Eat the Beetles! weaves these cultural, ecological, and evolutionary narratives to provide an accessible and humorous exploration of entomophagy. “Waltner-Toews punctuates this serious subject with his quirky humor . . . Eat the Beetles! is an essential part of a growing buzz.” ― Toronto Star “An excellent read for those interested in multiple perspectives on the issue of entomophagy, digging deep into science and math with flair and irreverence.” ― Scene Magazine “When it comes to the future of insects as food for humans and livestock, Waltner-Toews walks the line between skepticism and optimism in an intelligent, witty, and provocative analysis.” ― Jeffrey A. Lockwood, author of The Infested Mind “Full of humor and science, this edible insect book is definitely a must-read!” ―EntoMove Project",
