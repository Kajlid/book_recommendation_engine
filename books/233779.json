  "description": "Nothing about the legend has gone as expected…  After almost twenty years with no word from the gods, the Sisters of Danu have begun to believe their legendary fate has been forgotten. With their children almost grown, the Sisters enjoy their well-earned peace.  But war is imminent and old enemies threaten to upend their peaceful existence. When a druid arrives with a final task from the gods, the Sisters of Danu discover they must go to war and finally fulfill their destiny to save all of Ériu.  Their daughters have different plans...  Having grown up without any evidence that the legend is true, Treasa, Alyson, and Leannan have more important things on their mind than fulfilling destiny and fighting wars…such as handsome lads and love. But when they seek love in all the wrong places, nothing but danger and turmoil follow.  When love leads to war and war leads to love, can the Sisters of Danu keep their family together and still win the final battle to fulfill their fate? Or will the desire for forbidden love tear them all apart?  This is book 3 of the Sisters of Danu Series and is best read in order intended for 18+ due to adult content",
