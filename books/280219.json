  "description": "I now know the truth, so why was I ever enrolled at Hearthstone Academy?  I’ve also found out I’m likely a descendant of Orpheus, the Ancient Greek legend who was able to charm people and animals with his music, even a god.  My beautiful and brazen boyfriend Jadon, a golem, is determined to see me safe, and now that I’ve accepted sweet and sexy Rael, a bouda, as my boyfriend too, it seems I’ll have double the protection I need to undertake something I never thought possible.  Bring back the dead.  Orpheus’ story ended in tragedy when he lost his one true love. Will I have the same fate even with both Jadon and Rael by my side? And what about the seductive and strong Oaken, a descendant of the Minotaur? His attentions are becoming harder to ignore. Have his feelings for Hayden soured?  My trio of bullies have become my protectors, and insist on accompanying me to realms I never knew existed.  I refuse to lose anyone I love.  I won’t let that happen.  Struck Chord is Book Three in the Hearthstone Academy paranormal college romance series. Inside you’ll find one downtrodden but feisty heroine determined to gain a better life for herself, a pair of seriously awesome BFFs, and a trio of cunning bullies with secrets of their own, all in a school whose mysteries are yet to be discovered.  En pressant into overtures of scalding steam with a slow burn, enemies-to-lovers romance where the heroine doesn’t have to choose!",
