  "description": "A Freaky Friday for younger kids -- and with an extra twistLate one night Nicholas sees a witch enter his bedroom and hears her say some magic words. Then the witch leaves without even saying goodbye. When he wakes up the next morning, it doesn't take him long to realize something very strange is going on - especially when he pulls at his whiskers and watches himself go off to school. Whiskers? How confusing! That nasty witch cast the old switcheroo spell on him, and Nicholas has swapped bodies with his cat, Leonardo. Needless to say, quite an unusual day is in store for both Nicholas-inside-Leonardo and Leonardo-inside-Nicholas, and Satoshi Kitamura catalogues their misadventures in fantastically funny pictures.",
