  "description": "NOT FOR UNDERAGE READERS! But it is for those fascinated with the psychology of paramedics. Dark humor a must!Short story is approximately 2000 words hitting your senses and your emotions.*Downgrade - A short story of the real world. Written in first person, it gets inside the mind of a rookie paramedic dealing with the horror of humanity, and a paramedic's place in it.I would love more insight to people's reactions after they read Downgrade. I wrote this very deliberately, for a very specific reason. See the discussion below for questions to get you thinking about the story. There's a lot more here then you might think. WARNING: this story has graphic details of death, adult language, and a minor description of nudity.http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006IL1Z4K for more reviews, a larger sneak peek and to purchase in Kindle only.*NOT FOR UNDERAGE READERS*______________________________________Excerpt: \"The stench roils from the open front door, up and over me, several feet and fresh air unable to dissipate its stubborn formation. The sickly sweet perfume of death, hoarding itself for days, easily outweighs the multitude of life surrounding me on this crisp spring day.Yeah, I may be baby medic, a rookie in this fucked up shell game, but I'm not stupid. I get why we're here, and it's not for the shits and giggles from pulling a person back from the edge. We're here 'cause cops like medics to lay our oh-so-professional eyes on corpses, declare them beyond help all official-like. That way cops can document they did their jobs, even though dead is dead, and even a simpleton could've figured it out. 'Cause once the smell oozes through hardi-plank, you don't need a paramedic to give them last rites.\"",
