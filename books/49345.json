  "description": "As their friends leave for Europe and the government gets tough with the unions, a bohemian community is enjoying the euphoria of youth.It was their dreamtime. The wider world beckoned from the white ships sailing past Rangitoto Island, but the dream was also here, on the Takapuna shoreline of Auckland, where the artist Melior Farbro grew his vegetables and let Cecilia Skyways follow her own form of Zen Buddhism in his garden hut. Where Carl Skidmore, his brilliant young head full of novels waiting to be unravelled, could dream of God, Fame, Nirvana, Great Love, or maybe just great sex. Where not even the harbourfront strike of 1951 could convince them that life wasnâ€™t about poetry and painting and potential.",
