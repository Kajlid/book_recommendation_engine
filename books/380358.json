  "description": "Twelve-year-old Minuk is intrigued by the Hoffs, the American missionary family that has moved into her village. Although she has seen white men before, Minuk has never seen a white woman--or a white child. It soon becomes clear that although the Hoffs can speak the Yup'ik language, they don't understand Yup'ik ways. When Mr. Hoff begins interfering with village ceremonies, even Minuk wonders why the missionary is so sure his ways are better than Yup'ik ways.",
