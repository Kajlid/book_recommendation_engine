  "description": "Sita is a strong woman, champion of the repressed, inspiration to the weak, a living legend in Mauritian society. She has also buried a secret that threatens to overwhelm her very self.Told in lyrical tones by Iqbal the Umpire, Sita's story echoes ancient myths, folk tales and religious prophesies. Yet in the modern landscape of the 1980s, Sita must struggle to remember her own history and her own rape which comes to symbolise all rapes, all violations, all colonisations.",
