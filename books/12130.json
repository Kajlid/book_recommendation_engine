  "description": "Unpredictable, sexy, intense, and terrifying! With symbolic parallels to the classic tale of Little Red Riding Hood, \"SHADOWSHIFTER\" gives us a whole new, modern-day Little Red to embrace... And her story is more complicated and horrifying than what the Brothers Grimm could have ever imagined! With an uncontrollable temper and a flair for the dramatics, sixteen-year-old, Julie Taylor, has landed herself in summer school after a very public and humiliating outburst. In class, she meets her striking but mysterious next door neighbor, Broderick Cooper and despite her determination to distance herself from him, she can't deny the tenacious draw she feels toward him. More and more, their paths continue to cross until they become completely entwined with one another. But as Julie swiftly becomes consumed with Broderick's love and supernatural gift, an unprecedented evil punches its way into their quiet little town bringing Hell on Earth. One close brush with danger and a terrifying chain of events begin to unfold that will forever change Julie's life as it opens her eyes to a sinister world that walks within her own... evil incarnate and legendary as fairy tales.",
