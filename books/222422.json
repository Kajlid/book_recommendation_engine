Discouraged by her burden of household chores, she falls under the spell of the new girl on the block. Iris Elizabeth introduces her to a world of silk dresses, the theater, and school popularity. But Iris Elizabeth has a dark side, and she pressures Annie to give up her old friends. Confused by the things Iris knows, Annie wonders, can it be true? Are Rose and Della Bolman really Huns? And could their father be a German spy? With the Great War raging across Europe, anti-German feelings hang heavy in Annie's Memphis neighborhood, and soon those she thought were her friends turn against her, calling her \"Hun lover.\" Annie's life grows even more complicated when Spanish influenza sweeps into town, bringing tragedy to everyone. Can Annie be true to herself and discover who her true friends really are? TRUE FRIENDS is a story for everyone who meets the demands of the world and faces the future with a spirit of joy.",
