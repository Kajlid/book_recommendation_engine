  "description": "If “weird” is a way to describe a person well, let it be him. Alexander Joseph was no one, to begin with when David first met him as his co-passenger. Just like the words ‘curiosity is what sustains the media would’, David was indeed curious about the man sitting next to him looking like a second-generation prince. But the wind doesn’t blow as David expected with Alex. His story was different, weird. This story is about him, a man David met on his flight to Dubai who lives an extraordinary life in an ordinary way. His love, perseverance, regrets, happiness, and success are the story’s life. We introduce you to Mr. Alexander Joseph, the unsung Sultan of Arab. Still, why did he call his life a failure? There is a lot more to know.",
