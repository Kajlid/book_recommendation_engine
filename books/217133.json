  "description": "A “masterful” novel ( The New York Times Book Review ) from the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of American Pastoral tells the story of a bestselling writer whose life is falling apart—all because of his great good fortune.Now in his mid-thirties, Nathan Zuckerman, a would-be recluse despite his newfound fame as a bestselling author, ventures onto the streets of Manhattan in the final year of the turbulent sixties. Not only is he assumed by his fans to be his own fictional satyr, Gilbert Carnovsky (\"Hey, you do all that stuff in that book?\"), but he also finds himself the target of admonishers, advisers, and sidewalk literary critics. The recent murders of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., lead an unsettled Zuckerman to wonder if \"target\" may be more than a figure of speech.In Zuckerman Unbound —the second volume of the trilogy and epilogue Zuckerman Bound —the notorious novelist Nathan Zuckerman retreats from his oldest friends, breaks his marriage to a virtuous woman, and damages, perhaps irreparably, his affectionate connection to his younger brother.",
