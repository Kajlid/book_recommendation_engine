  "description": "\"Powr Mastrs\" Vol. 3--brainchild of C.F., who emerged from the fabled Providence, Rhode Island, art and noise scene and who also performs under the monikers Kites and Daily Life--is one of the most anticipated graphic novels of the year. This latest installment continues C.F.'s \"Dune\"-like science fiction/fantasy epic featuring a misguided scientist and the race of beings he has created, who inhabit a surreal world called New China. The narrative follows the ever-shifting power relations of these mystical warriors who transform their physical and psychological identities each time the tide of power turns. \"Powr Mastrs\" Vol. 2 hit over a dozen \"top-ten graphic novels of 2008\" lists, both volumes 1 and 2 have been described by \"Vice Magazine\" as \"dark doors into the stunningly fantastic,\" and \"The Village Voice\" has noted that \"the homemade arcane dominates in C.F.'s sexy danger world.\" This third installment is no exception: it overflows with graphic innovation, from the intricately designed costumes each character wears to the exactingly drawn architectural detail, all rendered in C.F.'s distinctive pencil line. In this volume, C.F. firmly takes the reins both as a visual and comics artist, making a book as essential to the practice of drawing as to the graphic novel.",
