  "title": "Songs for the Forgotten: a psychiatrist's record",
  "description": "Songs for the A Psychiatrist's Record combines pivotal moments from Julia Burns's Southern upbringing in the 1970s with case histories accumulated through three decades of treating psychiatric patients, particularly those drowning in the cultural epidemic of child abuse. This book is her journal of rupture and return. The reader will follow the author's hard-won reconciliation. In telling panoply of stories, including her own, Burns argues for the interconnectedness of when one child is hurt, our humanity is violated, and we are all responsible for undoing that damage. If no one steps up to save children, to show them they are worth saving, the cycle of abuse will continue. Songs for the Forgotten offers a strong practical component, providing information about trauma and healing. Burns illustrates how hope and wholeness can come from remembrance and telling.",
