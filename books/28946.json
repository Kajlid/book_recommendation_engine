  "description": "You may think you know the story of the \"Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf\" - but only one person knows the real story. And that person is A. Wolf. His tale starts with a birthday cake for his dear old granny, a bad head cold and a bad reputation. The rest (as they say) is history. This is a hilariously inventive retelling of the popular story which \"Publishers Weekly\" called the 'Funniest book of the year'.Book  PaperbackPublication 10/31/1991 32",
