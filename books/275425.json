  "description": "A celebration of ordinary awesomeness, for all of us who were told \"You can do anything!\" and then found out we actually can't\n\nCrappy homes, lame love lives, getting passed over for a great job (again)--not what we expected for our adulthoods. Americans tell their children you can become anything! But let's face it--most of us can't. Sure, some of our peers go on to become astronauts or billionaires. But most of us don't. In Average Is the New Awesome, Samantha Matt offers encouragement to us regular humans. Full of hilarious stories and insightful advice, this is a manifesto for ordinary awesomeness--for the beauty that can be found when we acknowledge that good enough really is good enough, and that greatness is ours to define.",
