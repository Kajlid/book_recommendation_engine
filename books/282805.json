  "title": "The Haunted River: A Christmas Ghost Story",
  "description": "\"On a bright summerâ€™s morning the water may be all very well, but on the dreary winter afternoons, in the gathering twilight, and through the long, long nights, it is terrible, in its mystery, its silence, and its strength....\" Margaret Vernam and her sister Georgie need somewhere to live - somewhere quiet and inexpensive where Margaret can continue her career as an artist. The country town of Maytree seems ideal, especially when they discover the Mill House on the river just outside the town. Indeed, the house seems too good to be true and Magraret discovers that the locality is said to be haunted by the ghost of a suicide. Soon, she has to contend not only with the possibility that the stories of ghostly neighbours might have more than a grain of truth, but also with the unscrupulous actions of the house's London landlord. Soon, the sisters are caught between earthly misdemeanours and supernatural forces intent on revenge... Originally published as the Routledge Christmas Annual for 1877, this is an atmospheric ghost story from one of the Victorian era's most celebrated writers of supernatural tales.",
