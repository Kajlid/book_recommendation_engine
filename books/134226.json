Will you laugh or will you pray, or will you forget the day?\" (from Keeping Christmas by Eleanor Farjeon)   \"They chopped her down in some far wood A week ago, Shook from her dark green spikes her load Of gathered snow, And brought her home at last, to be Our Christmas show.\" (from The Christmas Tree by John Walsh)   \"Winter crept through the whispering wood, hushing fir and oak; crushed each leaf and froze each web-- but never a word he spoke.\" (from Winter by Judith Nicholls)",
