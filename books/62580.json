  "description": "An anthology of bedtime stories for adults!Just what kind of happy goes into “happily ever after?” As children, it was enough that Pinocchio got to be a real boy and that Red wasn’t eaten by the wolf. As adults, we have a slightly different perspective. Being a real boy means having boy parts, and being eaten by someone big and bad doesn’t mean quite the same thing it once did.Ever wonder what mermaids do with the swimmers they seduce? Or why a dragon might prefer a castle-guarded princess to a nice, easy field of sheep? What if your fairy godmother wasn’t circumspect in what wishes could be granted, or if that dainty little fairy had a much bigger appetite than one might guess?Milk by Claryssa BergGeppetto Falls Off the Wagon by Matthew NadelhaftForever After by Kailin MorganDemon in the Well by Claryssa BergA Little Night Swimming by Mina KellyLittle Henna Hair by R.W.
