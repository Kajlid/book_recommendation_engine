We can handle this situation like professionals.There’s only one thing threatening this fragile peace we’ve negotiated: all these inconvenient feelings I apparently still have for him.Cream and Punishment is book #2 in the King Family series set in the small town of Crowder, Texas, home of the King’s Creamery ice cream company.
