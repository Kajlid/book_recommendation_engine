  "description": "A hunter who even witches are scared of, a witch who excels at city magic, and a young boy who may be more powerful than the other two if he can just learn to martial his mind, are the unlikely accomplices in a trek across time and space.All to save the Earth at a time when shifting global consciousness is destabilizing mother nature as much as itâ€™s driving people crazy.But to retrieve the one thing that can restore the balance to Earth, they have to deal with an all-powerful warlock older than time itself.And so far, no one has ever broken free of his spells of entrapment, least of all this motley crew. Even an entire planet on the cusp of conscious awakening may well be no match for him.",
