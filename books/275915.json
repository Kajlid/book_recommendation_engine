  "description": "He’s the world’s most alpha Marine and the last man I should be letting jingle my bells this holiday season.  So why does Clint O’Dell keep running through my thoughts wearing nothing but a Santa hat? And why do I stupidly agree that we should be Christmas friends with benefits? Someone must have spiked my eggnog. I don’t do Marines. Or Santas. I learned my lesson about both the hard way.  But when Clint steps in to rescue me—from a murderous goose, a rogue reindeer, and the ghost of Christmas Right Now causing trouble in my bakery—I can’t help but wonder if we’re meant to be more than friends.  If maybe Clint is the holiday miracle I’ve been praying for…or if all the magic will disappear with the season.Humbugged is a laugh out loud holiday romp featuring a Marine with a heart of gold and a baker in need of a hero. Complete with the world's most awkward Christmas caroling, a photoshoot with furry friends, and more naughty baked goods than is good or decent.",
