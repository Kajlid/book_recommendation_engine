  "description": "The Earth’s atmosphere is swiss cheese. To avoid the oncoming oxygen crisis, black-sheep heiress, Maeve Aypotu, has been chemically suspended in one of the Archive’s plush, multi-million dollar chambers, located underground. Scientists claim they can patch everything up in about 15 years, so, just to be safe, the Archive programmed the chambers to open in 17 years.And then, everything on Earth went wrong. Up on the surface, Pluto has taken control of the planet, scorching away all signs of human civilization and reconstructing the environment to suit the Plutian’s lucrative dragon trade. Humans that survived are forced to be laborers, divided into five Houses, each handling a different stage of the dragon harvest. Survival and repopulation have become a currency among the Houses. To make matters worse, Rha Diem, the rugged leader of the Fly House, has gotten word that the cost of existence just rose to a price that no human should have to pay. And now there is a whole Archive of survivors that will be expected to pay too. Learning to trust one another may need to start small—with the fusion of one powerful Rha and one bad ass black sheep—before a damaged race can even hope to regain control of their alien Earth.",
