  "description": "Thirty six hours ago, physicist Ash Russell failed to find peace in the wilderness.Now, he's face down on the backseat of a surprisingly comfortable three row wagoneer. Dried mud conceals the hundreds of small cuts that cover his arms and legs, but he's never been more relieved.He thought it was the concussion that caused the dream, the odd sense of traveling, but it would still take him time to figure it out. The inability to give up helped a little. It made realizing that having no limit wasn't normal, that there was something more waiting for him... for everyone.But, his chances were so slim. He needed money, he needed smarter people, and he needed her.Unable to give up, Ash begins to see the truth. The worlds he is creating, they seem so real. His imagination, is questionably coming true. Fighting back, refusing to stop, somehow reality is closer to a dream. This will change everything.",
