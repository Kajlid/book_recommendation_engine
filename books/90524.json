  "description": "Ho Baron has devoted 30 years to creating his collection of intuitively modeled sculptures that firmly establish him as a visionary artist. In Gods for Future Religions, the artist weaves a story of a mythical kingdom where his surreal sculptures play Jungian archetypal roles. Seventy sculptures are boldly and beautifully displayed along with his lively interpretation of his imagery. His personal anecdotes, observations and artist's story enhance his narrative as he unveils the steps of his visionary creative growth. The 119 color and black-and-white illustrations also highlight samples of his earlier pen-and-ink drawings and experimental drawing on his photographs. Written for a general audience, this title will appeal to all readers with imagination. Baron's earlier work, El Paso: A Hoverview, is in public, academic and art libraries across the country. With line drawings in the skies of cityscapes, the work is an experimental photographic exploration of his hometown. Now with Gods for Future Religions, Baron focuses on his surreal reliefs and three-dimensional sculpture, allegorically interpreting them into a worldly fable. Raised in El Paso on the Mexican border, after receiving his MA in English Baron taught in the Peace Corps in Nigeria and Ethiopia in the 1960's. He later settled in Antwerp, Belgium as the resident photographer in a cartoonists' collective. In the late 70's, Baron returned to the US and began his studies in sculpture, first at the Philadelphia College of Art and later at the University of Texas. His sculpture has been widely exhibited in museums and galleries in the US and Mexico and in public art venues. He is a retired librarian/instructor and a full-time artist.",
