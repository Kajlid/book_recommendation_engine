  "title": "The Changeling",
  "description": "In a dystopian world, after the demise of technology, Lore was brought up believing she was a boy, and an orphan. The only constant of her childhood was transience, as she was continuously fleeing, at the insistence of her guardians, and usually in the quiet of night, from one end of the Vilken realm to the other. As a child, Lore never understood the need for caution and secrecy, or the actual threat to her survival. In her adolescence she learns of the royal blood in her veins, and the horrific fate of her parents at the hand of her uncle, the false King. The Changeling is the tale of Lore's rise to power, and the journey she takes to find the love she needs to survive.",
