  "description": "From international bestselling author, K.N. Lee comes Rise of the Flame, an epic beginning to the Eura Chronicles. There are six races, four realms, and one human girl that can bring them together in peace...or war. Lilae has been hunted since the night of her birth. She is the only heir to the human god's throne. For centuries the races have been separated by an ancient barrier. Now that the barrier is crumbling and vanishing, the races are once again pitted against one another. Lilae and her surrogate family have avoided the dangerous Shadow Elf that hunts her for 18 years. All of those years of training seem lost when Lilae is captured and enslaved by the emperor of an enemy race. Or is it? Through every hardship and moment of torture, Lilae finds comfort only in the strange man from her dreams. On the other side of the world, Liam leads his army of Tryan's across the realm to protect his people from Shadow Elves that are invading his land now that the barrier is broken. With his best friend, his betrothed, a fairy, and a specialized order of soldiers, he sets out on a journey to find a grand weapon that can aid him in this inevitable realm war. The plan seems clear, until he dreams of the human girl with the red hair. And Lilae is supposed to fall for her destined match... Not the enemy that made her his slave.",
