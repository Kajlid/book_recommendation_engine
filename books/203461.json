  "description": "What would have happened if history had been different: If the major events that shaped our times had occurred in a different way - or not at all? In this thought-provoking volume 3 in the What Might Have Been anthology series, twelve outstanding science fiction writers and one legendary statesman alter the past in order to better see the present. From a Trojan War in which Helen surrenders, to a Civil War fought with robots, from a World War I in which Teddy Roosevelt tries to capture the glory of San Juan Hill, to a World War II in which the race is not for atomic weapons but for orbital rockets, these bold excursions in time depict bizarre new worlds, oddly familiar, disturbingly different, a rare glimpse of WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.Contents: * Introduction (Alternate Wars) • essay by Gregory Benford * And Wild for to Hold (1991) / Nancy Kress * Tundra Moss (1991) / F.
