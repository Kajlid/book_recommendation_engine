  "description": "Ever O’Connell prides herself on being a good Wiccan and tries to follow the path of the Goddess with love and light. But, the “dark” witches in school—the BlackMags—finally manage to push her over the edge, and Ever finds her coven in the midst of a war.Cade Bourdain was raised by his father with a thirst for power, and that often draws him into darker areas of magick. Despite his irrational dislike for the “Fluffy Bunny” Wiccans, he feels an unearthly connection to Ever.When the two strike up a secret relationship, the real magic between them is ignited, and the power generated catches the attention of a dangerous warlock, determined to take them for his own.Trapped beneath the evil of the warlock, Ever and Cade’s conflicting covens must work together to stay alive, despite seemingly irreconcilable differences—or they will be destroyed by a common enemy.The line between light and dark has never been so unclear.Coming August 1, 2012!",
