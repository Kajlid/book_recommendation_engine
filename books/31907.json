  "description": "Blood Divided is a historical vampire tale revolving around, and told in first person by the main character, Matthew Trenton. His story begins in 1674 as he is forced to leave England after committing unforgivable sin with his sister. In his journey to the Carolinas he begins to understand his true nature, his need to befriend mortals, his lust to kill those of his kind, and the realization that he will one day become something more than just a vampire. His journey is populated with engaging characters that help him learn about himself and the world around him: Vanity, the insane former mistress to King Charles. Hope, the mute slave girl who becomes his child. James, the young mortal who grew up in a coven of vampires and becomes his mentor. Elijah, the old, black vampire who becomes his partner. Ainjul, the modern child of his past family who becomes key in helping him complete his journey to its end. The tale is sprinkled with historical fact that weaves the life and struggle of Matthew with the life and struggle of the new world and Charleston. Blood Divided is the second book of The Charleston Vampire Chronicles. It is a fun read that suspends reality and allows the reader to enjoy immortality, if only for a little while.",
