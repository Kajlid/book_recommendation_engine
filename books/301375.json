  "description": "What happens when your boss catches you making scans of your butt instead of the case files he asked you for? Any normal boss would fire you right on the spot before you can even explain yourself. But mine asked to see the pictures in color. Nicholasâ€™s Brighton is one of the best attorneys of my generation. Somehow though, he's more known for being New York's hottest bachelor. Not like I have any time to drink in his features with all the work he's assigned me. The man is such a mean and demanding jerk... but somehow that only makes him more irresistible. If things keep going this way I'm not sure if he's either going to fire or f*ck me. And I definitely know which one I'd prefer. Desk Banger is a 27k insta-love novella.",
