While peeling a second orange and wondering what mischief he could get into, Javan realized he wasn’t the only one in the garden. A very quiet, yellow tail twitched under a lilac bush.“Are you spying on me?” Javan asked bluntly. When there was no answer he threw a stone over the bush. “I can see you.”“Ow!” The tail disappeared and an angry dragon stepped around the bush. “What did you do that for? Can’t a dragon take a nap without being assaulted?”Having a wizard for a mother is not as fun as it sounds.
