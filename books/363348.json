  "description": "After years of cooking and cleaning for his stepmother and stepsisters, Cynric’s only fun is to dress up like a lady in secret and talk to the two mice that live in his room. His wish that another man would find him pretty in stockings and lace is just a dream.When Earl Charmant sends out invitations to a ball at his Castle, Cynric doesn’t have anything nice to wear, and he doesn’t think he can go as a lady. His only dress isn’t even fancy enough. Besides, there will be far prettier women, and surely, the Earl would never be interested in a man who likes to wear lace and ribbons.But with the arrival of his Fairy Goddaddy, Loki, Cynric might have a chance to enjoy the ball and even find love.",
