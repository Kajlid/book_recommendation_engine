  "description": "I owe my sister big time, but seriously, isn't there any other way I can repay her? My identical twin sister is currently dominating the \"Champion of the World\" leaderboard, a year-long TV reality show that spans the globe. But now, she's broken her leg and needs me to become Brooke 'Action' Jackson for one installment of the program. But while she's all about CrossFit, I'm more of a cross stitch girl. And here I am, heading off to a tropical island for a week of mental and physical challenges. And right from the start Brooke is giving me extra problems. Seems she conveniently \"forgot\" to mention her steamy affair with the show's host, and her escapades with the sound guy. So when I’m marooned on a deserted island one day later with five (exceedingly hot) men and a nine-year old girl, I guess it's time to tell everyone my name is not Brooke Action Jackson, I don’t have a ton of survival skills and... ...I’m just Daisy. The children’s librarian. ♥Fans of Lily Gold and Emily Rath are sure to love this wild reverse harem adventure filled with titillating turns and suspenseful twists.♥",
