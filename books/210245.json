  "description": "Ryn Abbott has been living the life of her dreams: a great job in a city she loves, far from the cornfields of her youth. The only thing lacking is a partner. She hasn’t found a man who suits her as well as Boston’s busy streets.   Until she meets Sam. Considerate, charming, and a little audacious, Sam could be everything Ryn’s been missing. But perfection rarely comes without a price, and Ryn must decide which of her priorities gets the right of way.  **Please note: Needs is a 15k word short story which originally appeared in the Winter Rain anthology. This ebook also contains the first chapter of Personal Geography**",
