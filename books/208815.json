  "description": "Tales of mediaeval England, written in what adults will find captivating poetic prose, and reflecting the life and spirit and mood of the times. These are days of strolling players, self-assured merchants, men of high and low degree; the tales convey something of their thought. There are stories of saint and devil, of ugly creatures that inhabit the land of the dead, stories of suspense, stories of heartwarming quality.",
