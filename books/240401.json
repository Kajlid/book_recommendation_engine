  "description": "When you wish upon a lunch box... *Winner of a Bronze Award in the 2017 Wishing Shelf Book Awards!* \"The book is an absolute page-turner, and will leave the reader wanting to know more. I was hooked by the first page.\" Readers' Favorite 5★ review The difference between Pandora and your average 12-year-old girl is that Pandora knows exactly what she wants at all times. So when five magical genies pop out of an old rusty lunch box, Pandora knows her life is finally going to be perfect! …Or maybe not. When one of the genies blows up a mean girl’s head to the size of a basketball, Pandora has to figure out how to unwish her wish, and fast! If you like the Dork Diaries, Diary of a Wimpy Kid or The Baby-Sitters Club books, you'll love Pandora’s Lunch Box! From the writer of My Best Friend Is a Secret Agent, this middle grade chapter book is a comic romp full of magic and suspense for any reader - children, tweens, teens... and beyond! This funny wish-fulfillment story is the first in a series, so if you like it, there's more to come! (Don't forget to look for the surprise after Chapter 1!)",
