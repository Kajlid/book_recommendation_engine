  "title": "Musher!",
  "description": "It's 300 grueling miles of ice, snow and danger. For Will Rollins, his best friend Elias, and Will's savvy lead dog, Blackie, this is the race of a lifetime. But with the $1000 entry fee, can they even get in? Can the locals compete against world-class international racers? And what about Becky Silas? She's a tough competitor. But are the boys ready for trail life with a girl? And as if the race isn't risky enough, there's someone deliberately sabotaging sleds and gear, endangering all. When the temperature falls, the wind rises, and danger prowls the long trail, the friend who has your back had better be a good one!",
