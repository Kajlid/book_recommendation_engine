  "description": "This isn’t a fairy tale. No. It’s a tale of woe as old as time. But even the tragic deserve a happily ever after, and I’m here to give it to you. CharlotteSticking out like a preacher’s pregnant teenage daughter, I lift myself off the floor and fluff my unconventionally long black hair--a silent f*ck you to the sea of blond that surrounds me. I live in a world of fraud. Everything is fake, plastic, and superficial. Nothing is what it seems and your worth is measured in dollar signs and social status. Who am I?Nothing but a prized possession. A dress-up doll for one of the most powerful men in the country. He may beat me, break me, and make me bleed. But he will never win. AidenTasked with protecting that which I despise, I struggle against turning into the monster I vowed I’d never become. How can I do right by her when being near her sets my very soul on fire? She’s a saint and temptress all in one. Unable to separate one from the other, I begin to fall into her, letting her consume my every desire. Will I survive this torture or will her love be my demise?",
