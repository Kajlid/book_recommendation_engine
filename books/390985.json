  "title": "Make Miracles in Forty Days: Turning What You Have into What You Want",
  "description": "If you could ask for a miracle right now, what would it be? We’ve all had situations in our lives that seem beyond our control or that have no clear remedy. In this concise, inspirational guide, bestselling self-help guru Melody Beattie shows us that we have the ability to make a miracle for almost any circumstance we’re facing. Beattie, a trusted counselor for millions of readers, has shared her own stirring stories of overcoming obstacles and dealing with life’s tragedies for more than twenty-five years. In Make Miracles in Forty Days she now offers the ultimate distillation of what she knows about gratitude, surrender, and connecting with our essential power. She challenges us to be more present each day and details a six-week action plan, the Miracle Exercise, to jump-start transformation in our lives. After completing a series of activities, we’ll establish what miracles we’d like to create, and then she’ll walk us through practicing this innovative exercise alone, with a partner, and even with our children. Beattie instructs us to be thankful for everything in our lives and for how we’re really feeling; we need to express gratitude for what we have and who we are, not just for our obvious blessings. It is crucial that we are grateful for recognizing what is upsetting and bothering us. Through acknowledging the pain that we’re feeling, we can excise any denial or resistance that is holding us back. As we progress over the forty days, instead of feeling lost, numb, or confused, we’ll become more conscious, aware, and alive. Our miracle will begin to materialize. Along the way, Beattie reveals her own experiences of making miracles, individually and through working with a partner, and those of the participants in her Miracle Workshop. She shares moving stories of overcoming hardship and finding acceptance and forgiveness, and inspires us to move forward with a renewed vigor for life.",
