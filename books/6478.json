  "description": "Soul, satisfying sex is usually the ultimate weapon. For Diamond Robinson, it may turn out to be a serious problem. On the surface, she appears to be your average beauty, living next door. But Diamond is full of deceit, mischief, and seduction. She loves good loving so much that she's willing to do anything, including sleep with someone you'd least expect. When her sexcapades spiral out of control, one thing leads to another, and her lover ends up dead; leaving everyone she's ever loved, against her. Unknowingly, both she and her nymphonic road dogs get themselves mixed up with secrets and lies that lead to unstoppable turmoil.",
