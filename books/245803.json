  "title": "Daemon Voices: On Stories and Storytelling",
  "description": "From the international best-selling author of the His Dark Materials Trilogy, a spellbinding journey into the secrets of his art—the narratives that have shaped his vision, his experience of writing, and the keys to mastering the art of storytelling.One of the most highly acclaimed and best-selling authors of our time now gives us a book that charts the history of his own enchantment with story—from his own books to those of Blake, Milton, Dickens, and the Brothers Grimm, among others—and delves into the role of story in education, religion, and science. At once personal and wide-ranging, Daemon Voices is both a revelation of the writing mind and methods of a great contemporary master, and a fascinating exploration of storytelling itself.",
