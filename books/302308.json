  "description": "Second book in the Accidental Mates series. Shannon is abducted by the leaders of the shape-shifting dragons who have a plan to mate her with the Drelconian lords, even if they have to watch the process from start to finish. If one sexy candidate doesn-t work, then they-ll pass her to the next and the next or better yet, take her all in one night. But the leaders didn-t count on Shannon being able to connect mentally with the banished silver dragon leader, nor that he would risk life and limb to come for her. Ryuu will kill anyone who tries to harm Shannon or keep her from him, even if it-s his own brothers or the respected elders.",
