And in the magically hidden boroughs of New York City, that’s a quick way to wind up dead. Or worse. So instead of magic, Aspen relies on her skills as a thief to stay alive.She didn’t plan on getting caught stealing from Lucien Dunadine, one of the strongest members on the Council of Mages. She really didn’t plan on him blackmailing her into being his apprentice. But with the Council demanding Lucien present a candidate for a competition to become their newest Mage, neither one of them has much choice.Now something sinister is going down in the magical boroughs. Supernaturals are winding up dead and mysteriously, impossibly, drained of magic.

Let the magic begin.\n\n\n\n\nPrepare for a gripping, action-packed, immersive young adult urban fantasy read in Mage’s Apprentice, the first book in the thrilling Mage’s of New York Trilogy full of mystery, breathtaking twists, and a slow-burn romance!\n\nThis is book one of the Mages of New York TrilogyBook One: Mage’s ApprenticeBook Two: Mage’s TrialBook Three: Mage’s End",
