  "description": "LGBT studies. Short fiction. Lesbian. Queer. With July Nights and Other Stories, Jane Eaton Hamilton (J.A. Hamilton) establishes herself as a bold new presence in Canadian fiction. \"These are die-hard stories full of perilous honesty. I love Hamilton's creatures: they have flesh and blood and bones. They tell the truth even when it's as surprising as graffiti--tender-hearted and furious and right off the wall.\" --Linda Spalding\"Jane Eaton Hamilton is wonderfully talented and completely fearless.\" --Sharon Butala\"These works ride the perilous ride the perilous border between prose and poetry--a place of timeless, breathless beauty. These are stories to be read again and again.\"--Vancouver Sun\"A fine new òcollection, one that I highly recommend.\"--Monday Magazine\"Hamilton makes captivity to her word-spirits seem, at times, preferable to mere liberty. To favour one story says more about oneself than about the writer.\"--Prairie Fire\"This is a strong first collection that will leave readers eager to see Hamilton’s next.\"--Quill and Quire\"A disturbing pleasure to read.\"--Toronto Star\"Crisp and clean, tender and dangerous.\"--Paragraph",
