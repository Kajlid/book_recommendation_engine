  "description": "Dhammapada means “the path of dharma,” the path of truth, harmony, and righteousness that anyone can follow to reach the highest good. Easwaran’s translation of this classic Buddhist text is the best-selling edition in its field, praised by Huston Smith as a “sublime rendering.”The introduction gives an overview of the Buddha’s teachings that is penetrating and clear – accessible for readers new to Buddhism, but also with fresh insights and practical applications for readers familiar with this text. Chapter introductions place individual verses into the context of the broader Buddhist canon.Easwaran is a master storyteller, and his opening essay includes many stories that make moving, memorable reading, bringing young Siddhartha and his heroic spiritual quest vividly to life.But Easwaran’s main qualification for interpreting the Dhammapada, he said, was that he knew from his own experience that these verses could transform our lives. This faithful rendition brings us closer to the compassionate heart of the Buddha.",
