  "description": "She's smart. She's sassy. She has magic powers. And she's not going to bed! Magic Trixie's had enough of her parents insisting she brush her teeth, take a bath, and go to bed on time. Especially since NO ONE else in her class has to put up with that nonsense. So Magic Trixie's leaving! Instead of letting her family BOSS HER AROUND, she'll stay over at each of her friends' houses and see what other young monsters do when the sun goes down. Will Magic Trixie ever find the PERFECT nighttime haunt?",
