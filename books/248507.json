  "description": "What if your soul mate isn’t encountered once in a lifetime but once in millennia?From the unique imagination of the author of the Ring trilogy, which inspired blockbuster films on both sides of the Pacific, comes an unconventional love story that finds the Japanese master delivering a pure page-turner outside the horror genre. Comprising three distinct parts each of which is a tale of adventure, Paradise demonstrates that the sinister poet of humidity who made use of wetness to raise chills in Dark Water is just as much in his element plotting adrenaline-fueled searches across the desert.In the arid badlands of prehistoric Asia, a lovelorn youth violates a sacred tribal taboo against representing human figures by etching an image of his beloved. When the foretold punishment comes to pass, the two must embark on a journey across the world, and time itself, to try to reclaim their destiny. A mysterious spirit guides them towards a surprise destination that readers may indeed find quite close to home.Published a year before Ring , Paradise was Koji Suzuki’s groundbreaking first novel that launched his career as a fiction writer. Winner of the Japan Fantasy Award, it was immediately made into an animated TV series. Filled with exotic locales, betrayal, action, romance, and ideas, Paradise should delight fans of David Mitchell’s Cloud Atlas as well as devotees of the non-horror fare of Stephen King, to whom Suzuki is frequently compared.",
