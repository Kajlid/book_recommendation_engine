  "description": "*This is a standalone book, as with the other books in the Walker Security series you do not have to read the entire series to enjoy this book.  Kyle, one of the alpha men of Walker Security, is hot, bothered, and intense, and when Myla lands in his line of fire, she'll soon learn her secrets, and her passion, belong to him. Myla is beautiful, a dove with clipped wings, captive by the wolf, a rich and powerful man. One look into her eyes and Kyle could see the pain, the fear... the desperation. Or so it seems. He's been fooled before by a woman and it cost him everything and everyone he loved. He won't be fooled again.",
