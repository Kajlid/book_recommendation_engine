  "description": "Anne Waylock thought she was safe. Safe from the madness of demons and the auguren that hunted them. Safe from her tumultuous feelings for the troubled Owin Moran. Safe from the pain of her best friend’s betrayal. Four months ago she ran away from it all, and she never planned on looking back.But when Legion, a mutant demon terrifying and dangerous even to other demons, appears in her new refuge, Anne finds herself forced to flee right back to the people she ran away from.As if Legion weren’t enough, a normal demon hunts Anne as well, ready to devour her body and soul. Peter, normally the voice of reason and sanity in the face of the supernatural, has broken with reality. The auguren themselves are confused and frightened of Legion’s power and the changes it has wrought.Even under guard from those trained and specially empowered by God to fight demons, safety is an illusion.To her growing horror, Anne realizes the only way to set earth, heaven, and hell right is another trip to the demon realm of Saltmarch. The dual threat of insidious demons and Anne’s own weakness leaves her wondering if redemption might be the most painful, and most dangerous, option of all.",
