  "description": "What happens when a newly divorced mother, her eleven year old son, and their overprotective Rottweiler move into a house that is haunted by the victims of a long ago grisly murder? Can young Michael fight through the madness and terror to figure out what happened so long ago? If he does, maybe the tormented souls can be put to rest. If he fails, he just might become one of them. With only the help of his babysitter, a burned out house painter, and his dog Lucy Fur, Michael is about to try. The problem is, not everyone is who they seem, even the dead.",
