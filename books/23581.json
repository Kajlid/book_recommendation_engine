  "description": "Rugged rancher Pierce Delaney doesn't trust women and has vowed never to marry; beautiful Zoey Fuller is far too busy trying to save her ranch from greedy Samson Willoughby to even think about a husband. Unfortunately, Samson not only wants her ranchland, but he wants Zoey as well. When Pierce is falsely accused of a heinous crime and then shot by a Montana vigilante while escaping, he finds refuge in Zoey's root cellar. Zoey removes the bullet and saves his life, but when Willoughby's threats loom larger, she forces Pierce to marry her at gunpoint and rescue her from Willoughby's clutches. But Zoey didn't plan on falling in love with her reluctant bridegroom, and Pierce certainly didn't plan on finding a wife quite so enticing. Just when Pierce and Zoey think they've resolved their difficulties, tragedy strikes and Willoughby surfaces to threaten their lives once again. Before Pierce can claim Zoey forever, he must first save her from the evil forces that seek to claim her for their own. Readers who love Mason's historical romances will be delighted with this addition.",
