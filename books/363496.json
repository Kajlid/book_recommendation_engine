  "description": "Book 2 of the beloved Poldark novels • A major new series on Masterpiece™ on PBS® \"From the incomparable Winston Graham...who has everything that anyone else has, then a whole lot more.\" -The Guardian Demelza is a heartwarming, gripping, and utterly entertaining saga that brings to life an unforgettable cast of characters and one of the greatest love stories of our age. An impoverished miner's daughter, Demelza Carne is now married to Ross Poldark, who once rescued her from a fairground brawl. Her efforts to adapt to the ways of the gentry--and her husband--place her in hilarious and embarrassing situations, through which she becomes self assured, mannered and lovely, and the birth of her first child brings a joy she never experienced before. But tragedy strikes where least expected, and sows the seeds of an enduring rivalry for Ross Poldark and the powerful George Warleggan, and tests Ross and Demelza's marriage and their love... What Readers are \"Even better than the first book in the series.\"\"Wonderful characters, evocative sense of place and time.\"\"If you haven't read the Poldark series, and care anything for Cornwall, the l8th century, historical romance in its truest form, historical fiction, or just a darn good story that will change you life, then you should read [these books].\"\"The Poldark series is the most powerful reading experience I have ever had.\"\"These books have no equal in historical fiction. I have read them several times and am starting over again.\"",
