  "description": "I know I'm a monster, but Elle made me feel like a man. If she knew what I did, about my life with MM, she'd never love me. So I lied. Well, I starfished, and in the end, it brought my world crashing down around me. I can't go back to being a monster, because that would mean existing without Elle. So I've made a plan. A plan that could kill me. It doesn't matter though, since I'd rather be dead than live a life without Elle in it. If I survive, will Elle forgive me? If I tell her everything, will she see past the monster? Will she see the man?",
