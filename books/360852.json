  "description": "Noah Makwa It’s bad enough that as the elder bear shifter in my clan, I’ve got to guide two adult cubs through their changes and help them acclimate to their newfound abilities, but the biologist who recently transferred to my office is the icing on my stress cake. She’s not only a beautiful distraction, she’s also smart, funny, and her research project has the potential to reveal the existence of shape shifters to the world—especially when there are two bears running around who aren’t quite acting as bear-like as they should.  Gwendolyn Locke I moved to Parrish Falls—a.k.a. The Middle of Nowhere—Michigan to study black bears. But in the three months that I’ve been working as a biologist at the local branch of the DNR, I haven’t seen a single one. Because my boss has been actively cockbear-blocking me every chance he gets. I don’t know what his problem is, but I’m about to find out. Just as soon as I can look at his gorgeous, grumpy face and not mentally relive every filthy sex dream I’ve had about him. Confronting Noah doesn’t go as planned, and I discover that shape shifters exist and fairy tales aren’t just stories. Somehow, I’ve found myself snowbound and playing Goldilocks to three stupidly-hot bear shifters. As it turns out, “just right” is so much more than a figure of speech. This book has been previously published but has undergone significant edits and revisions prior to re-release.",
