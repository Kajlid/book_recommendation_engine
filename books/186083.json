  "title": "Coco Pinchard's Must-Have Toy Story",
  "description": "A sparkling feel-good comedy, which asks the question - how far would you go to get your child the must-have Christmas toy?It's December 1992, and children are going crazy for the Tracy Island toy - almost as crazy as the parents! Christmas day is fast approaching and Coco Pinchard is desperately trying to track one down for her four-year-old son Rosencrantz.Throw into the mix a horrible boss, a lazy husband, and the prospect of her in-laws arriving for the festivities, and Coco wishes she could cancel Christmas and sail off to a desert island somewhere - preferably with the gorgeous-yet-unattainable Tom from work.But retail therapy is at hand! Coco's faithful friends Chris and Marika rally round, and even her mother-in-law Ethel tries to help in her own eccentric way.From dodgy dealings in a motorway lay-by, to extreme shopping in Hamley's with a Sylvanian Families fanatic, to having a go at the Blue Peter make-your-own Tracy Island, Coco tries everything in the hope that Rosencrantz will open his must-have toy on Christmas morning.",
