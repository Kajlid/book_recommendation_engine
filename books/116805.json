  "description": "I’m not crazy, I'm haunted. I also happen to be in a whirlwind relationship with a guy that lives in another world. On top of that, I have to juggle senior year and nightmares that get more and more real each night. The demons that attack me in my sleep have grown bolder in their desperation to kill me. When a gorgeous warrior saves my life, he also claims that we have some sort of connection that links my life to his. This man is possessive and infuriating, but I can’t deny the pull I feel towards him. Our bond is so tight that if I die, so does he. How can he possibly prevent that from happening an entire universe away?",
