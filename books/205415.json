  "title": "A Story Is a Promise: Good Things to Know Before You Write That Screenplay, Novel, or Play",
  "description": "A Story is a Promise offers a fresh new model for mastering the elusive art of writing dramatic and engaging stories. In order to illustrate its major principles, the book includes reviews and analyses of over a dozen popular films, novels, and plays. Complete with prompts and questions at the end of each chapter, A Story is a Promise can be used as a workbook to help writers internalize the principle that underlies all well-told that a story should be a promise and that a promise should be kept. The inclusion of familiar examples makes this book accessible and useful to all writers of fiction, plays, and screenplays. Bill Johnson has been using the manuscript of A Story is a Promise in his workshops for years. Many editors also use the workbook to teach blossoming writers the craft of storytelling.",
