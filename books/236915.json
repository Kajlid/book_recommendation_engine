Along the way, he offers moving, heartfelt stories about the secrets contained within these incredible organisms.Passionate and absorbing, The Plant Messiah is a tribute to the diversity of life on our planet, and the importance of preserving it.An impassioned memoir of saving extraordinary plants on the brink of extinction, by a scientist who has been called a \"codebreaker\" (\nTelegraph\n) and \"an inspiration\" (Jane Goodall)",
