  "title": "Rickey & Robinson: The True, Untold Story of the Integration of Baseball",
  "description": "In Rickey & Robinson , legendary sportswriter Roger Kahn at last reveals the true, unsanitized account of the integration of baseball, a story that for decades has relied on inaccurate, second-hand reports. This story contains exclusive reporting and personal reminiscences that no other writer can produce, including revelatory material he'd buried in his notebooks in the 40s and 50s, back when sportswriters were still known to \"protect\" players and baseball executives. That starts, first and foremost, with an in-depth examination of the two men chiefly responsible for making integration Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson. Considering Robinson's exalted place in American culture (as evidenced by the remarkable success of the recent biopic), the book's eye-opening revelations are sure to generate controversy as well as conversation. No other sportswriter working today carries Kahn's authority when writing about this period in baseball history, and the publication of this book, Kahn's last, is a true literary event. In Rickey & Robinson , Kahn separates fact from myth to present a truthful portrait of baseball and its participants at a critical juncture in American history.",
