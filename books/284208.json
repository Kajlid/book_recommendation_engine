  "description": "So metaphorical: the Palme d'Or and Golden Globe Award®-winning, Oscar®-nominated film as a graphic novel drawn by Director Bong Joon Ho himself.\n\nIn hundreds of mesmerizing illustrations, PARASITE: A Graphic Novel in Storyboards is a behind-the-scenes glimpse at the making of one of the best films in years and a brand-new way to experience a global phenomenon. As part of his unique process, Director Bong Joon Ho storyboarded each shot of PARASITE prior to the filming of every scene. Accompanied by the film's dialog, the storyboards he drew capture the story in its entirety. Director Bong has also written a foreword and provided early concept drawings and photos from the set which take the reader even deeper into the vision that gave rise to this stunning cinematic achievement. Director Bong's illustrations share the same illuminating power of his writing and directing. The result is a gorgeous, riveting read and a fresh look at the vertiginous delights and surprises of Bong Joon Ho's deeply affecting, genre-defying story.",
