  "description": "The Gray Wolf once enjoyed an extensive presence throughout North America and much of Eurasia, but today most of us have never seen a wild wolf, as it has been eradicated from 95 percent of its range in the United States, and from 25 percent of its teritory in Eurasia. Why has the ancestor of the domestic dog been thus treated and why have we developed such a strong love hate relationship with the wolf?",
