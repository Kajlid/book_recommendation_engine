  "title": "Love and Sex with Robots: The Evolution of Human-Robot Relationships",
  "description": "From a leading expert in artificial intelligence, an eye-opening but superbly argued book about how increasing innovation in robotic technology is enabling legitimate romantic and sexual relationships between humans and robots. Synthesizing breaking news in the field of robotics with the cultural history, technological development, art, literature, and psychology of artificial intelligence, \"Love and Sex with Robots\" is popular science at its diverting - and eye-opening - best. From Pygmalion falling for his chiseled Galatea to Dr. Frankenstein marveling in both awe and terror at his \"modern Prometheus\" to the man-meets-machine fiction of Ray Bradbury and Michael Crichton, readers have been enthralled by the possibilities of interaction between technological creations and themselves. Shocking yet wildly informative, \"Love and Sex with Robots\" builds on that fascination to show how entities we once deemed benign and unresponsive may very well turn out to be objects of real, human desire.",
