  "description": "Japanese police inspector Toshi and his American partner John are back in this sequel to His Beautiful Samurai. Toshi and John are still reeling from their last adventure, dealing with family issues and trying to get ready for Toshi's uncle's funeral. During the funeral preparations, Toshi realizes that his uncle's dear friend Tokuma was more than a friend, and that Tokuma needs his help. Fearing his nephew Yuzo has been kidnapped by the Yakuza, Tokuma asks Toshi and John to look into the young man's disappearance. Their investigation takes them into the murky underworld of the Japanese mob, and eventually leads them undercover to the temple of the White Tiger, a place of spirituality, love and danger. Learning the ways of the White Tiger opens John up to his psychic ability in unexpected ways, and brings the lovers closer than they ever thought possible. Through a series of unbelievably erotic encounters, John and Toshi learn the power of their love, and begin to believe that they can overcome anything, from Toshi's disapproving family to the mystery of the missing nephew. Can they find Yuzo before it's too late?",
