  "description": "\"Honor Among Orcs [...] takes you by surprise and doesn't let go of your imagination...\" -- Shannon Mayer, Author of the Rylee Adamson Series  For lovers of Warcraft, Tolkien, Beauty & the Beast--or all three…  As featured on Buzzfeed’s “21 Types of Romance Novels You Have to See to Believe,” Honor Among Orcs is the fantasy you've been waiting for…  After nearly a decade as the king’s whipping-girl, Princess Arianna has no intention of going quietly into marriage to some treasonous noble, or serving obediently as the king’s spy until her death is more convenient. When she discovers a handsome orc, chained and trapped inside a magic mirror, Arianna cannot help but see a lasting freedom from her father's abuse.  Left to rot inside a mirror by the king, Bolthorn never imagined his prayers would be answered by a princess. Nor did he ever expect to meet so worthy a woman after knowing her father’s cruelty. He needs her help to escape the mirror before the king marches against the orcs, but all he can offer Arianna is ice and darkness in exchange for her aid.  If Arianna can free the monster behind the glass, perhaps she might free herself, as well. But once they cross the mountain, there will be no return, and the deadly winter is the least of what threatens them on the other side.  Fans of Kristin Cashore's FIRE and GRACELING will appreciate the collision of romance, adventure, and epic fantasy -- all with a new adult edge -- in Honor Among Orcs.",
