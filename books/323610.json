  "description": "Tattooed. Jacked. Gruff.Three things that make Officer Handsome— sorry, Hansen— irresistible.It wouldn’t be much of a problem if he wasn’t my new roommate, and completely unavailable.Every day I need to remind myself I don’t have time for a relationship. I have a clinic to run, animals to save, and a job offer to consider.But the day I walk in on him half-naked, all bets are off.He says it can’t last— his lips tell a different story. The way they feel on my skin is addicting.Beneath his grumpy exterior, he has a huge… ahem… heart, and a family that means everything.In a month, his house will be finished, and he’ll be gone. But every night we’re together makes me want to wake up in his arms every morning.We agreed this was only a temporary fling.But what if temporary is meant to last forever?",
