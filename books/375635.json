  "title": "Dark Matters",
  "description": "A collection of dark poetry by one of the industry's finest craftsman. Beautifully illustrated by Daniele Serra.Whether he's writing about an errant siren, a grimoire, a vulture, or the apocalyptic implosion of our way of life, Boston does it with stunning and unexpected complexity. There is a sense of completeness to his poems, a sense that he has turned the thing around and looked at it from every angle. He offers insights that are startling in their clarity, and-after he's shown them to us-completely logical. This is a laudable achievement in and of itself, but the fact that he can balance his eye for detail and his intuition about character with a poet's ear for the lyrical joy of language is awe-inspiring.- Joe McKinney, author of Dead City and Quarantined",
