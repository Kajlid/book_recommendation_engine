  "title": "Reapers, Inc.- Rogue Reaper",
  "description": "It's been nine months since Seamus Flannery issued his threat to Brigit Malone; but the question still looms -- what will she be sorry for? Reapers, Inc. is growing steadily and Brigit is starting to feel the stress of being the Head Reaper while John Blackwick is continuing his quest to re-open satellite offices. Her mood is accelerated by the inability to consistantly go home to Maggie, the increasing workload created by the Bailey, facing a ghost from her mortal past and the fact that she hasn't had a cup of coffee in weeks. When Seamus finally finds a means to his promised revenge, Brigit will risk her immortal soul for the one thing that matters most.",
