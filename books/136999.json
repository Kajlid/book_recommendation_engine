After the embarrassing display of Liam and Finn fighting over NOT wanting Sophie in her front yard, the gossip vine has made her to look like the town tramp which she isn’t and it has not only affected her social life but her business life as well and she only has the O’Leary boys to thank for it.

After Murphy lost Fiona, he realized he wants her back in his life because he believes they belong together. He will do whatever it takes to make sure Fiona is back in his arms and as far away from the California boy as possible.  Watch how Murphy and Sophie take it upon themselves to not only seek revenge but get what they want at any cost, no matter who they hurt. The lives, relationships and sanity of the O’Leary family are tested, questioned and pushed to the brink in the second book of the Warblers Point Series: Beers, Lies and Alibis.",
