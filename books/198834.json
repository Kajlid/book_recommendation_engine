Ethan knows very little about his lover's past, so when an old friend from Max's university days arrives in Las Vegas, Ethan thinks it's his chance to learn more about the man he loves. What he hasn't counted on is this friend coming from a devious, highly sexual period of Max's life when the two men were members of the Doms Club, which sought out and tested the limits of potential submissives. Now, Max's friend wants to test Ethan's limits. Ethan badly wants to prove that he is the perfect submissive for Max, but maybe this time he's out of his league. Numerous graphic sexual situations.
