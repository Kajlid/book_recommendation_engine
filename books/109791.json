  "description": "The Ladies and Gentlemen of Horror is a unique anthology that focuses as much on the writer as on the stories they tell. With around ten thousand words of pure horror from each amazingly talented Lady and Gentleman, as well as in depth biographies and beautiful photos, this anthology is something you do not want to miss. The anthology comes out annually on Halloween in three print editions: The Ladies of Horror, The Gentlemen of Horror, and a combined version, The Ladies and Gentlemen of Horror. Each version also has eBook versions. All proceeds from the Ladies and Gentlemen of Horror Anthology are donated to the American Cancer Society.",
