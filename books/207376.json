  "description": "Protecting her should be easy for a man like me . . .\n When assigned as a bodyguard for Adriana Bertoli, I knew I was in for a world of trouble. With her fiery-red hair, sparkling green eyes, milky white skin, and lush, curvaceous body, she's a damn knockout.  But she also happens to be the niece of one of the most powerful mob bosses in the Seattle-Tacoma area, Don Carlo — my boss. And he’s made it clear that none of his men are to lay a finger on Adriana.  The man to have that honor would have to be perfect — a warrior and a saint. Sadly, I was no saint.  It should be an easy order to follow. After all, I owed everything to the man, and I’d be nothing without him. But every moment in Adriana’s presence is pure temptation. The longer I'm with her, the more I want her, and I fear it won't be long before I betray the man who’s like the father I never had.  **Relentless is a full-length standalone novel with an HEA and no cheating!",
