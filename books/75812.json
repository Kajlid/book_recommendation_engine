  "description": "Chula Vista, California is a city infested with outlaw gangs. Not a segment of the town escapes their touch, whether nouveau riche Eastlake, working class Castle Park or socially blighted Otay. No matter where you go in Chula Vista there is either a pack of dogs or clowder of cats demanding tribute...or else. While the K9 officers of the Chula Vista Police Department try their best, they cannot be everywhere at once. Only in one small neighborhood do law-abiding pets have someone to stand up for them, to fight back against a tide of lawlessness. From Fourth Avenue west to Broadway, from G Street north to E Street, the operatives of the Three Dog Detective Agency do their dogged best to keep the evil cats of Feral Gang in their place, to promote a sense of lawfulness and goodwill, and to sometimes save the world. When the felonious felines of the Feral Gang try to sink their claws into the innocent and gentle, their heinous actions do not go unanswered. The neighborhood animals, both domestic and wild, know they can turn to Levi, Sunny and Yoda for help. This is the story of the Three Dog Detective Agency's final battle with the Feral Gang, a story of action, of mystery, of redemption...a story of Paws & Claws.",
