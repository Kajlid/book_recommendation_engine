  "description": "Shandra Covington simply assumed her grandmother's house was sold after she hastily moved in with Shandra and her mother two decades ago. Yet, here it was, deeded to Shandra in her grandmother's will. Shandra, single aggressive, and an accomplished journalist has tender memories of the time spent as a young girl in the old house on the hill, and her curiosity and sentimentality lead her to a final visit of the forgotten home. What she discovers shocks Shandra to her very core. Not only is the house still filled with her grandmother's old belongings, but there is also a body, long since dead, and covered with the same thick layer of dust as the rest of the items in the house. Returning with the sheriff and his handsome deputy, Clay, they find the body missing. In its place is another body this one dead fewer than 12 hours. And all evidence points to Shandra. Desperate to clear her name and uncover the truth behind these troubling mysteries, Shandra puts her journalistic training to use. Between the reluctant townspeople, ominous warnings, and physical threats, Shandra learns the truth, little by little all the while knowing that someone is determined to keep old secrets buried, even if it means burying Shandra as well. . . .",
