However, as time wears on, their differences cause a lot of strain between them.  Jeremy, a first grade teacher and softball coach, is deeply closeted and sees no way out of the darkness.

Jeremy is heartbroken, knowing that the love they feel is the real thing. He knows he’s the one who needs to change, but old habits are hard to break.
