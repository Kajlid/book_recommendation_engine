  "title": "Time to Rhyme",
  "description": "This book features three variations on the theme of time which together introduce young readers to the cyclical rhythms of the seven days of the week, the four seasons and the twelve months of the calendar year. Beautifully illustrated throughout, the ever-shifting scenery of the English countryside is the setting for this gentle and lyrical depiction of the passing of time as refracted through the prism of a childâ€™s imagination.",
