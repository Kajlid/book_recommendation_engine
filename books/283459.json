Ami, a former actor, is handsome, intelligent and exciting - but, like his beautiful, disintegrating country, he has a terrible flaw - he is an army interrogator. As Lily and Ami's unexpected passion grows, so too does the shadow that hangs over them - the unspeakable horrors which Ami's work forces him to face.

Yet TEN THOUSAND LOVERS is set in Israel in the a dazzling backdrop to a universal story of passion, suffering and the transcending power of love.",
