  "title": "Five Urban Stories ... and Something Better",
  "description": "\"Always remember that the world is full of weird people,\" someone warns in one story.In this collection set in modern-day Italy, teenage gangs, casual sex, cheating, and crime, overlap page after page.Not everyone will come face to face with evil, but every character will have a hard time chasing their dream.Whether it's for good or evil, for the most part, they fail. Then, they go on to the next attempt, and the next.It's just another day in the cityâ€”until it's too late.TWO WARNINGS from the Author:1- There's adult content in this book. The characters sometimes have sex or try to abuse each other, just like real people sometimes do. But this is not an Erotica book, nor I think there may be anything offensive in showing what everybody does when stumbles upon someone who turns her/him on. If this isn't the music you want to hear, I invite you to go elsewhere, and thank you for visiting.2- Please, avoid the \"English Language Purist's Review\", complaining about this or that pretended oddity of my written English. I consider it a chauvinistic attitude towards bilingual people, like me, with a family name allegedly Latin.English is my second language. I love and respect it, but I never assumed or pretended to be the 21st century's Shakespeare. My focus is on the plot and characters' psychology, not on the literary excellence of the work. That's not only beyond my reach but out of my interests and goals. If a reader notices a mistake, I will be grateful to him for pointing it out, so that I'll fix it. Full stop. Again, if this isn't the music you want to hear, I invite you to go elsewhere, and thank you for visiting.",
