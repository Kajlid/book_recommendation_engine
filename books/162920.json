  "description": "Abby Vogel lives in the world of her harp. She plays and sings like an angel for beachfront weddings and other events around beautiful Piper Beach. No one else needs to know that angels keep her company. They wouldn’t understand. Gwynne Abernathy blames herself for the deaths of her sister and mother. Her psychic gifts have brought her only grief, and she’s turned her back on anything that isn’t “normal.” But the moment her path crosses with Abby’s she’s drawn to her. Abby knows right away that there is more to Gwynne than meets the eye. When she realizes that Gwynne sees the angels too she finally accepts that they’re more than a figment of her imagination. What’s more, the angels desperately need something from her. If she answers their call it means giving up the magic she feels with Gwynne. It means giving up…everything.",
