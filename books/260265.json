  "title": "Dino: Living High in the Dirty Business of Dreams",
  "description": "From dealing blackjack in the small-time gangster  town of Steubenville, Ohio, to carousing with the  famous \"Rat Pack\" in a Hollywood he  called home, Dean Martin lived in a grandstand,  guttering life of booze, broads, and big money. He  rubbed shoulders with the mob, the Kennedys, and  Hollywood's biggest stars. He was one of America's  favorite entertainers. But no one really knew him.  Now Nick Tosches reveals the man behind the  image--the dark side of the American dream. It's a  wild, illuminating, sometimes shocking tale of sex,  ambition, heartaches--and a life lived hard, fast,  and without  apologies.",
