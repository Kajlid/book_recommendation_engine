  "description": "One year is all it takes for strangers to become lovers...19-year-old Farrah Lin is going to fall in love for the first time during her year abroad in Shanghai. She's sure of it.The only problem? Her would-be leading man is her new friend’s boyfriend.There’s nothing worse than being in love with someone you can’t have...or at least, she thinks it’s love.But if that’s true, why can’t she stop fantasizing about someone else, specifically the cocky blond athlete with the world’s biggest ego (and greatest dimples)?***Blake Ryan is—was—a college football star who shocked the sports world when he quit after his third national championship. Instead of dealing with the fallout, he escapes to Shanghai, where he vows to keep life simple.No football. No commitments. No romance.But no matter how hard he tries, he can’t keep a certain beautiful brunette off his mind...or out of his heart.What starts as a physical attraction develops into something much deeper as Blake and Farrah get swept up in the magic of Shanghai—and each other. But they only have one year, and there are forces outside their control that threaten to rip them apart.Can their relationship survive the test...or was it just not meant to be?WARNING: This is the first book in a duet. It's a full-length novel with no sudden cliffhangers, but Blake and Farrah’s story concludes in book two, If the Sun Never Sets, which takes place five years later.If We Ever Meet Again is a steamy strangers to friends to lovers romance. Recommended for 18+ due to adult language and explicit content.",
