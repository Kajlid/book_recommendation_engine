That's right-the characters of this pseudo-historical account of Vietnam War are rabbits, cats, and other animals representing various nationalities involved in the war. It's the story of the life and adventures of the Special Operations unit lead by Sergeant \"Perky\" Perkins. The reader will experience and feel the danger and life or death excitement of the battlefield alongside Perky and his rabbits as they face terrible battles in the jungles of Vietnam. A remarkable synthesis of gritty realism and fable-like characters. Apocalypse Meow is a unique masterpiece!",
