  "description": "Surpassing even loyalty to country, the desire for revenge can sear white-hot and be as addictive and as all-consuming as the strongest opiate.German agents Elsa Gable and Chris Schulte grew up together in a Germany ravaged by the Great War. They became inseparable as they matured into more than friends, more than family. They had a bond no one could destroy, at least that's what Chris believed until the night of December 2, 1938.Not the typical spy murder mystery, Southern Cross is a unique tale of double agents, espionage, revenge, and murder leading investigators from a morgue in Manhattan to the SS Southern Cross, a passenger liner sailing from New York to Cuba. Forced to use limited resources, a doctor from San Francisco and a young Paris police inspector scramble to uncover a vicious murderer before another passenger is killed, and before the ship docks in Havana and five-hundred travelers flood the pier.If you are one of those people who read the last page first . . . don't.",
