  "description": "Buried deep in the reaches of vast antiquity lie the ancient customs, the vicious \"games\", the laws of the privileged lords and his enslaved minions. Sarban's preoccupation is chiefly with the remote brooding past which, certain circumstances, refuses to die, but jealously invades the present through the life and sanity of just such a healthy young animal as the heroine of RINGSTONES.",
