  "title": "Art Objects: Essays on Ecstasy and Effrontery",
  "description": "In these ten intertwined essays, one of our most provocative young novelists proves that she is just as stylish and outrageous an art critic. For when Jeanette Winterson looks at works as diverse as the Mona Lisa and Virginia Woolf's The Waves , she frees them from layers of preconception and restores their power to exalt and unnerve, shock and transform us.\" Art Objects is a book to be admired for its effort to speak exorbitantly, urgently and sometimes beautifully about art and about our individual and collective need for serious art.\"-- Los Angeles Times",
