Her design skills will soon have her traveling to London, designing a new line that should build her reputation world wide. She's on top, which is where she likes to be - especially when it comes to men. Since giving her fiance his ring back a year ago, Laura has kept her relationships light, and short. Sexy pilot Smoke Hamilton might be hot, but she doesn't need a Mr Right, just Mr Right Now. She doesn't need a man holding her down. From the moment he first saw her, Smoke knew Laura was his kind of sexy. What he hadn't banked on was her being his kind of smart, with a sassy mouth too. He usually prefers his women 'nice and easy', but Laura is a challenge. Smoke has always been a sucker for a challenge, he just can't leave them alone til he's conquered them. Conquering Laura is a risk, she's Jack's cousin, Jack is not only his friend, but his employer too. Still she's a risk he has to take. As a pilot, his career comes first, and always gives him the option to fly away. He'll never let a woman tie him down again. The chemistry between them definitely has the sparks flying, but will the scars of the past only lead them to crash and burn? The Summer Lake series follows a group of friends from a small lakeside town in the California hills. They have kept in touch over the years and now, in their early thirties, their lives are drawing them back to Summer Lake and to each other. This book is intended for adult readers 18+",
