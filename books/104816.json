But a series of inexplicable and violent events begin to rob him of everything he loves. First the man who raised him is brutally murdered. A few days later, Michael's fiancee is gunned down during a convenience store hold-up. Finally he is fired from his job with no explanation. And now it seems strangers are trying to kill him. Fleeing to the island of Martha's Vineyard, Michael hopes for a new beginning--and possibly even a new love with the enigmatic Megan Cole. But little does he know that his entire life has been built on lies--and a vast conspiracy of corruption. And his pursuers are about to strike again. . .",
