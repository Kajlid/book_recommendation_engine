  "description": "\"My dog sends me texts. Yeah. It’s weird.\" That's the premise of this hilarious tale of man and dog that's perfect for anyone who has ever had an imaginary conversation with their pet.When October Jones figured out he could send text messages to himself on his mobile phone, he naturally decided that the best use of this discovery was to send passive-aggressive messages to himself under the guise of his bulldog. And so the exasperating, slightly delusional, and utterly endearing Dog and his alter ego BatDog were born.Texts from Dog features Dog’s attempts to keep the neighborhood safe from the likes of Mr. Postman and his arch-nemesis Cat-Cat—he has managed to smash only three TVs and a patio door in the process. And in between crime-fighting sprees and run-ins with the squirrel mafia, there are romantic interludes with pillows, fetch sessions gone terribly awry, and the abusive banter only a bromance between man and his text-savvy dog can spawn.Texts from Dog will make you laugh out loud and perhaps even make you think twice about leaving your pet home alone for the day.",
