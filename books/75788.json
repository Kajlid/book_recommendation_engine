Every relationship has left her disappointed and heartbroken, from a high school romance, to a broken engagement, and then jilted at the altar. She’s decided that she's through with love. It will be a good plan until the day her true love returns after he had disappeared twelve years earlier without even saying goodbye. She's afraid to trust him again.
