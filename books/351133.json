  "description": "alternate cover for ISBN 0586042296Come with the century's greatest fantasy writer to the October Country......where it is always turning late in the year. That country where the hills are fog and the rivers are mist; where noons go quickly, dusks and twilight linger, and midnights stay. That country composed in the main of cellars, sub-cellars, coal-bins, closets, attics, and pantries faced away from the sun. That country whose people are autumn people, thinking only autumn thoughts. Whose people passing at night on the empty paths sound like rain...The little doctor with his odd love of bones... the peeled dead eyes of the thing in the jar... the graveyard earth on a dog's muzzle... a scythe with a singing, crimson-wet blade - all this and more awaits you in this hauntingly brilliant book by the greatest fantasy writer of our time.Contents:- The Dwarf (1954)- The Watchful Poker Chip of H.
