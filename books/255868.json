  "description": "Jamie and Max have intense chemistry - even though they drive each other crazy. Max thinks Jamie is a magnet for trouble and Jamie thinks Max is the most annoyingly sexy, mysterious man she's ever met. She knows she should stay away from him, but there's something irresistible about the millionaire playboy. Jamie is a newspaper owner from a small southern town. In FULL SPEED, she's after the scoop of a lifetime. Max Holt is right in the middle of that story. What follows is the tale of a corrupt minister, a gang of mobsters on the loose, a hound dog called Fleas, a wise-cracking computer genius, and lots of love in the fast lane. Not to mention plenty of steamy action between Jamie and Max.",
