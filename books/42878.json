  "description": "Before her granny died, Marcie Hollis had been spiritually attuned to Mother Earth and the spirits around her, honing her gift. Then she meets Dan McKenzie, a man she believes to be the knight in shining armor she’s been searching for all her life. However, Dan is not who he appears to be. He lures Marcie into his dark world of lies, greed and drugs. But fate intervenes during Marcie's illicit trip for Dan to New Orleans, when she's robbed and accosted in the crowded airport. When she gets knocked down, her head slams on the concrete floor, and she loses her memory, all right in the path of DEA agent, Sam Carre.Arriving in a crowded airport in New Orleans with his reputation and loyalty in question after being set up as the leak in a six month DEA investigation, Sam has come home. Even though Sam is tired, disillusioned and haunted by a past that gives him no peace, he stops to help an attractive stranger when she falls in front of him. In an act of chivalry, he takes her to his home until the police can identify her. When questions arise about Marcie and what she’s involved in, the answers lead back to Sam’s investigation in the Pacific Northwest.When her illusive memory returns, this complex case pushes them both to explain the unexplainable, brings them face to face with a generations-old evil now incarnate again and leaves Sam with a haunting question. Was Marcie set up or is this a game she’s playing? Sam is forced to make a choice: walk away from the attraction connecting them or risk losing everything.",
