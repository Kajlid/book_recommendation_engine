  "description": "\"I don't know if my case is boring or not but if you ever decide to look into it further, then I'll be glad to give you all the details from my point of view. I promise that I'll give you the story all the way live and raw without a single detail left out. All I want is for people to know what goes on in the mind of a serial rapist, what drove me to where I am today, what women can do to avoid being raped, and what women should do if ever confronted by a rapist. Finally someone will hear what I've got to say about what I did what I did and what led up to those string of events that caused me to lose my stability and go on a rampage....\" Meet Reggie. Or maybe you'd rather not. With almost half of his thirty nine years of life spent behind bars for sexual assaults, Reggie is a self admitted convicted serial rapist.

Eleven months later and after a series of more brutal rapes in West Baltimore, he is quickly labeled as \"The Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard Rapist.\" Shocking and unbelievably honest, Reginald boldly opens up to the author revealing not only why he became a rapist, but what women can do to avoid becoming a victim of rape as well as the real on what to do if confronted by a rapist. BOLD. RAW. UNCENSORED. Until I Get Caught - The True Story of a Serial Rapist In Baltimore is Real Life Production's finest materpiece in all true \"Reality Writing.\"",
