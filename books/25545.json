  "description": "Growing up gay, beginning as a teenager, to realize what you are: that's when you start to suffer. Just when everyone else is becoming involved with the opposite sex, you're alone in having to hide your feelings. Impossible to talk to anybody. It's not something you want to blurt out to your parents, obviously. Or to your teachers, Or to the boy you fancy: He'd jeer at you or hit you.The only salvation is to find people like yourself. And that's a big step. A very big step. Ewan Macrea is a 14 year old, living in the Enlish seaside town of Bude. A surfer, Ewan is having difficulties dealing with his disinterest in girls and his growing fascination with his best mate Leslie.",
