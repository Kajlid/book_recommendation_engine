  "description": "Rae Maddox's mom, Gina, thinks nothing of packing up and moving. New apartment, new town, new job--it's all an adventure to Gina, but for Rae, each move is just one more friend lost, one more chance to feel like an outsider. When they arrive in Wisconsin, Gina promises to stay put until Rae graduates. Cautiously optimistic, she wades into the social whirl at Whitman High School, making a few friends and even earning a chance at love. But when the vice principal pairs her with a new student, Allison Daly, things go bad in a big way. It seems Allison was orphaned after her parents died in a suspicious house fire, leaving their daughter to bounce between relatives' homes. When a sleepover at Rae's house goes terribly wrong, Rae sees a troubling side of Allison--and learns a few secrets about her own mother in the process. Suddenly Rae is at risk of losing everything and everyone she cares about--unless she steps up and takes charge of her life once and for all.",
