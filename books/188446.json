What she doesn’t want is the attention of the Executioner, a supervillain who kills with his touch.But the moment she survives a caress—and a kiss—at the mercy of his lethal skin, Angel realizes her problems just got a whole lot bigger. Because the only thing worse than a supervillain who wants to kill you is one who wants to keep you.",
