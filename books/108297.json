Everyone is secretive and pretty much ignores her. Everyone that is, except “the pack”, a group of kids that always hang out together and can sometimes be downright mean. Her one and only friend, Jenna, is an even bigger outcast than she is. Jenna dabbles in witchcraft and claims to be able to open Chloe’s eyes to the hidden world around them and that includes the creatures lurking in the dark. The only thing Chloe is interested in “eyeing” is Jenna’s older cousin, Ryan, who also happens to be a werewolf.When a classmate goes missing, the girls form a search party. Everything is turned upside down by fear and hatred as the town begins a manhunt. Chloe has a secret of her own and it just may be the key to finding the missing boy. She has just begun to develop feelings for Ryan when his troubled past and recent friction with the victim comes to light. Can Chloe help prove his innocence or will she lose her first love forever?",
