  "description": "Take ordinary or inane subjects then immortalize them into a poem worthy of Dr. Seuss’ beloved rhymes. Add a dash of sarcasm and a pinch of cynicism—and that's a stupid poem. The whole point is to show how incredibly mundane most things are within the context of a rhyming nightmare. Stupid Poetry: The Ultimate Collection of Sublime and Ridiculous Poems covers everything from doing the laundry to politics to toddler tantrums to colonoscopies. Find yourself a quiet place to enjoy these silly poems and bask in the stupidity.",
