  "description": "***This is a serialized work of fiction. This means that one episode of short fiction, roughly 20 pages, will be released every week for five weeks per serial. There will be cliffhangers leading onto the next episode. The whole serial will be available as one novella once each episode has been released. If you prefer longer pieces of work, I suggest you wait until then.***  Hi, my name is Hope and I'd like to introduce you to our world. Earth is full of two races, the Avoidables and Perfects. I'm an Avoidable because I only have one arm. I was born that way apparently. Because of my defect, my mother had to move to the Lower Side. The Perfects are humans that have no physical flaws. They live in luxury, while we live in filth.  Avoidables have defects ranging from looks to unexplained gifts. Some of us are half breeds. Dragons and animals were known to have bred with the human race thousands of years ago. We all live in cities, usually divided in two. The Perfects live on the Upper Side, while the Avoidables inhabit the Lower Side. We've been consumed by hate for a race that rejects us so heartlessly. We've become dangerous.  I like to sneak over to their side sometimes. It's fun to watch how they live. To watch their perfect gorgeous faces react to the one armed freak. Until I met Jason anyway. He ignored the fact that I had one arm, even daring to touch my shoulder stub. What happened when he did, blew my mind. I was no longer an ugly Avoidable. I was much, much better than any Perfect.",
