  "description": "\"I had never been particularly good at anything except catering to my own comfort and safety,\" begins Graham Mackintosh with cheerful frankness in this engaging, suspenseful, and finally stirring travel adventure. An Englishman, Mackintosh fell in love with Baja California on a visit and, despite a glaring shortage of both experience and money, determined to walk its entire coast.
