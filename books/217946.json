  "description": "With his business in America finally finished, John Constantine returns to England, much to the shock of everyone who thought he'd perished in a prison riot. And as usual, his actions have had bad consequences after his disappearance, his niece Gemma ran away to London, leaving his sister to move into a new council building that shelters an addictive evil. Said evil provides a clue that puts Constantine on Gemmas trail, but her persistent interest in the family magic business has gotten her involved with a very bad crowd, one that now thinks it can use her as a goad to make Constantine do their bidding. But Constantine has never been known for taking orders, or for his forgiving nature.",
