  "title": "Golden Vanity",
  "description": "Earth was finally entering the galaxy... The 'Allies' had arrived, sweeping down from the stars to offer a jaded Earth the marvels of the cosmos. And Earth had gone crazy. Farmers sat back to wait for Vita Flakes to fall from the sky. New York City drank itself into a permanent starstruck stupor. Blissed-out teenagers wandered into the Great Mexican Defoliation Desert to wait for the New Gods to bear them off to the astral plane... But the 'Allies' weren't in the business of trading something for nothing. This impertinent little marketworld might fetch a nice price on the interstellar auction block... particularly if a runaway wondergirl named Golden Vanity was tossed into the bargain!",
