  "description": "It started on a dance floor after too much tequila and ended with looking into the handsome face I never thought I’d see again. In person, at least. I saw his face all the time on magazine covers. To the world, he’s Parker Callahan—famous rockstar. To me, he was the boy I loved, the stepbrother who left me behind to follow his dreams.After our tequila-fueled encounter, he wants me back but that’s not a road I’m ready to walk down again. He broke my heart once, and even five years later, I’m not sure I could handle another blow.When a once-in-a-lifetime offer comes my way, even my broken heart isn’t enough for me to be able to turn it down. I agree to join the band’s tour and help Parker write his next album--but this time I’m not falling in love. This time I’ll walk away. But if there is one thing life has taught me, it’s that love never goes according to plan—especially when Parker is involved.",
