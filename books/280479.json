  "title": "The Thief of Peace",
  "description": "Short on cash and in desperate need of patronage, Florentine artist Niccolò di Volpaia is thrilled when the head of the wealthy Albani family approaches him with an offer. He is less thrilled when he discovers that the offer has nothing to do with his artistic ability and everything to do with his reputation as a hard-drinking wastrel.  Albani’s three legitimate sons are dead. His only heir is a recently legitimised son, Teodoro, and the twenty year old Teo has already poured cold water on his father’s dynastic plans by taking holy orders. Nicci’s job is to persuade the young monk of the delights of the secular world, and to leave the monastery and take up his place as heir apparent to the Albani fortune. It’s not an easy job, and Nicci’s conscience rapidly intervenes when he sees how contented Teo seems to be in his monastic life, and how – as he begins to fall for Teo – his love will undoubtedly shatter Teo’s peace.  But Teo’s outward tranquillity masks secrets, secrets that are brought to light when a gruesome murder compels him to leave the monastery and join Nicci, as they attempt to make sense of an unfolding conspiracy that threatens to destroy them both.  True faith meets true love in this historical mystery/romance set in the Renaissance grandeur of Medici-ruled Florence.",
