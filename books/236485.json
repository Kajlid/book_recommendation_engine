  "title": "Heart of Time",
  "description": "For Eona, manipulating time is second nature. It gives her an edge in her dramatic circus performances, but it also separates her from the other artists in her troupe. She has always known that her unique kind of magic could make her a target, but she couldnâ€™t have prepared for being kidnapped, manipulated and imprisoned by a megalomaniac sorcerer.  In order to figure out what he wants from her, she needs to explore her own magic, the bond she feels with a mythical creature, and the feelings she has for a certain beautiful elf.  This book is the first in the Ruined Heart series. There is no cliffhanger, and it can be read as a stand-alone (but then you would miss the developing reverse harem romance in the next volumes). Eona falls in love with a female elf in this book, so if that's not your thing, try it anyway.",
