Members of the Complex Crimes Unit Team Three, one of the best FBI investigative teams in the nation, had to stop a stalker before he destroys one Texas family from within.Gillian Birch was a successful children’s book novelist and part-time librarian. She’d never hurt anyone, never done anything to draw the attention of an obsessive madman. But what he’d threatened to do to her terrified her and she had no one else to turn to but the police. They’d called in the PAVAD division of the FBI.But could Team Three stop the stalker, before he harmed Gillian? Team Three wasn’t so sure…_____________________________________Case File #0001 is the first in a series of mystery novellas featuring characters from the PAVAD: FBI Romantic Suspense series.
