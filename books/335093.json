So there's a new plan, a plan that involves a casual holiday fling. Merry Christmas to me.But spending the holidays with Park Bradshaw in my charming hometown turns into Mission Impossible when I find out his knife skills go way beyond carving the Christmas ham.Now I'm on the run, living out my own Christmas version of Die Hard, where making it home in time for Christmas is the least of my worries. I just want to make it home alive—and hopefully not lose my heart to the one man I'm not sure I can trust.Because as the countdown to Christmas ticks on like a bomb, I'm left wondering which side he's on.",
