  "title": "Red Ranger Came Calling",
  "description": "Using glowing, hypnotic images and a funny, provocative text, the narrator relives his father's most amazing childhood Christmas. A moody young boy living with his aunt on an island, \"Red\" Breathed sees himself as the \"Red Ranger from Mars\", his hero from the movie serials, and cannot picture life without the gift of a Red Ranger bicycle. Red is far too \"swanky a human being\" to believe in Santa Claus, but nevertheless he pays a visit to the aged island hermit, Lord Sander Clos, rumored to be the legendary man himself, now living in lonely, joyless retirement. This meeting triggers an emotional response within the self-absorbed Red and leads to the most remarkable bicycle ever delivered on Christmas morning.",
