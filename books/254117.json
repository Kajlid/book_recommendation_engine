Vanessa Wright never planned to return home to Calendar. But her relationship ends, her job disappears, and she suddenly inherits a former inn from her great aunt, so she concludes it’s finally time for her to return to the sleepy mountain town. Although it was where she grew up, she has no plans to stay there for long. All she must do to get her life back on track is fix up the inn and find a buyer.  The Blackberry Inn has lost some of its charm and good looks over the years, going from gorgeous, Victorian-era splendor to being relegated to a dilapidated fixer-upper. It’s going to be one helluva a job to restore it to its former glory. Fortunately, Vanessa isn’t afraid of a little hard work. She boldly confronts her first night alone in the big, old house with determination and courage, until she finds a dead body on the veranda. The indications are that a man might have broken in. Who could the failed burglar be? What could he possibly want from the old inn? When successive attempts are made to scare Vanessa out of the house, she has to find out what the victim’s mystery accomplice is seeking and quickly, or she could become his next victim.  With the help of her contractor and old friend, Nate Minoso, Vanessa tries to solve the dead man’s murder. She also has to find out what he intended to steal. More importantly, she must make a big decision in her life: is it finally time to put down roots? Or should she turn her back on her hometown, and Nate, forever?  Twelve cozy mysteries... one deadly town!",
