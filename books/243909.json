  "description": "Eleven-year-old Rick Rusek is determined to improve the traffic conditions in Los Angeles-- his parent's failing delivery catering service, Smotch, depends on it.\"Traffic is a puzzle with one correct solution. And I've got to solve it!\"Rick has been studying maps and traffic patterns for years, and devises solutions to improve Los Angeles' notoriously terrible traffic that he calls his Snarl Solutions. He has big ideas, but not enough resources-- until his artistic friend, Mila brings him to a Girl Scout meeting.Every week at Miss Diamond's art studio, the scouts paint recycled traffic signs with their own designs. The signs will be hung all over Los Angeles to beautify the city with art. But Rick, The Colossus of Roads, has ulterior motives . . . He will restore the signs to their original glory and find a way to install them strategically to rectify the traffic. Anything can be hung with duct tape!But of course, it's not that easy. SPLAT (Stop Poor LA Traffic), BLAM (Bike-Loving Amazing Mamas), and the TCD (Traffic Calming Division) have their own methods of curing the city's dilemma and will undermine Rick's efforts however they can.Will Rick be able to clear the notorious traffic problem on Sepulveda Pass in time for his parents to deliver Polish food to the movie studio and land the catering contract they need to keep their company afloat?Written by Christina Uss, the acclaimed author of The Adventures of a Girl Called Bicycle,  which was selected for the Texas Bluebonnet Award Master List and was a Kirkus Reviews Best Book of the year.",
