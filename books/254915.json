  "description": "He’s a little bit country . . .She’s a little bit rock and roll . . . Jo Demonix’s life changed almost instantly after a crazy altercation with her ex-boyfriend leads to a drunken stupor that the Paparazzi catch red-handed. Now Jo’s name went from something to mud overnight. Fed up with her drunken escapades, her manager and fellow band members give her an ultimatum: go to Rocker Rehab, or get kicked out of the band forever. Only, Jo never expected that her Rocker Rehab would be in the middle of nowhere, Wyoming, with six hot cowboys, a foul-mouthed but adorable five-year-old, and no cell reception. Hunter Montgomery always imagined that after his parents passed away, he could handle taking care of Montgomery Ranch and his brothers just like they had. Unfortunately, the financial stress of raising six brothers and keeping the ranch has the bank knocking on his door and the bills piling up. Struggling to make ends meet, Hunter has no hesitation when he’s approached with the opportunity to make a lot of money for the ranch overnight. But he wasn’t expecting that money to come with a feisty, purple-haired, girl, covered in tattoos and bursting with trouble. Even though the two opposites have nothing in common, they form an unlikely friendship neither can deny and when trouble knocks on Jo’s door once again; Hunter and his brothers will do everything they can to protect Jo, even if it means losing their Ranch forever.",
