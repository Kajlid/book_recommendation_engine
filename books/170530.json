  "description": "Warning, this is a dark erotica novella read with caution. Beneath Innocence is a novella for side characters, Jenson and Blue from the bestselling Deception series. (FaCade,Cadence)   JENSON We all say we'd kill for the one we love, but would we? I did. And I took great satisfaction in doing it as painfully and gruesomely as possible. He paid for what he did to Blue.... My girl, the only girl who could ever steal my heart. Did it get me anywhere? Oh yeah. I fell onto a path of self-destruction. I reserved myself a spot in hell. And Blue left.  BLUE When someone kills for you, you owe them everything, even your life. I couldn't even give him my heart. Why? Because I didn't deserve for him to protect it for me. Instead, I hid away, made some wrong choices and watched from afar as the man I loved fell in love with someone else",
