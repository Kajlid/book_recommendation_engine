  "description": "How is she expected to follow the rules when he looks at her that way? \n\n \nIt's impossible to concentrate with a boss like Brogan O'Keeley. If the man isn't driving her crazy with his brooding looks and blue eyes, he's killing her with his uptight, straitlaced personality. He sets the rules and follows them without fail.So, after the misfortunate event of stripping down to her undies in front of Brogan and his brothers (the three very hot owners of O'Keeley's Irish Pub), she's shocked that instead of applying for unemployment, her presence is requested to come into the office early.Working alone with Brogan day-after-day doesn't bode well for that one, no-dating rule he's set. Following the rules has never been her strength, and after seeing exactly what's underneath those fancy suits and ties, Selena doesn't plan on starting now.Her Irish Boss is a humorous love story between a sassy, messy waitress and her sexy, moody boss.",
