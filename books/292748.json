  "description": "I'm going to war with the bullies that have tormented me at the academy. It's time to make Jensen McCauley and his minions pay.  But when our prank war lands us both on restriction, the two of us are trapped together.  It's all his fault. It's all his plan.  Jensen wanted to be left alone so he could unravel the secrets surrounding his sister's death.  I've got enough to figure out. I have to make sense of the on-again, off-again heat between Lex and me, my hopeless crush on Rafe, the sexy instructor who think I'm a human trainwreck, and the way I've ruined my friendship with Penn.  Plus, there's the small matter of the demon stalking me...  But when Jensen McCauley needs my help...even though he doesn't deserve me... I'll help him find the truth about his sister.  It's a truth some people are desperate to cover up.  Can Jensen and I not only work together...but survive?",
