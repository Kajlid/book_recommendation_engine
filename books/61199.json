  "description": "What happens in the desert stays in the desert…Or does it? On tour in Iraq with other SEALs teams, Lieutenant John Tucker from the Skins holds a tenuous line of defense with Lieutenant Commander Alex Jackson of the Water Dogs. With four days wait until the Army shows up, and the pock-fire of insurgents ever-present, fight or flight urges are put to the extreme. So when Tucker shocks the LC by making a play for him, and he reluctantly gives in, it’s not like Ajax is going to have to face the fire when he returns home.Except the mutual devastation of the SEALs teams prompts the military to combine them. Now Tucker is serving under Ajax in a brand new way, and the desert isn’t keeping the secret.",
