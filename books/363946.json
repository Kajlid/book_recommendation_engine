Imagine a modern society parallel to our own where impoverished peasants are legally permitted to sell their children into slavery starting at age 15. The upper class households in this world demonstrate their wealth by buying the best of everything - including people.Bran returns to his old master but this time it is to retrieve yet another slave that is being sold to the \"slave breakers\". Returning to his former home, even for such a short period of time, has its effects on Bran as does Lee, his master's new acquisition.Note: This book originally appeared as posts on LiveJournal and still contains some editing notes. The text is sexually explicit (including m/m and polyamorous situations) and is intended for adult readers.",
