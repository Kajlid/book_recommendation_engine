Terror is control. With her secret parentage revealed, the newly-minted Princess of S'Kir has lost all hope of finding a new normal. Catapulted back into the horrors of war, she must face the insanity that is the reign of the Mad Queen. Restraint is control. The Queen of Vampires is in over her royal head within the turbulent dimension of S’Kir, but her determination is steady: find the Breaker.
