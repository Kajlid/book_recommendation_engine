  "description": "Looking for love in all the wrong countries…Miranda Bloom’s life has never been better. She finally has an almost-quasi-boyfriend, Dex McConnell, the star lacrosse player of Orange Cove High. But when holiday break rolls around, she jets off to visit her mother in London, and Dex suddenly seems to lose all interest in her. Then there’s Henry, the very cute and very available British guy who complicates matters by making it clear that he’s very interested in Miranda. Things don’t get easier for her when classes start back up at Geek High. Between the dreaded Math Team competitions, an annoyingly love-struck best friend, and a stepmother who seems to delight in making Miranda miserable, it doesn’t take a genius to see that the semester ahead is going to be tough.",
