  "description": "Before I was born, the world changed.When monsters stepped into the light to rule, most humans were forced into servitude.My family was one of many.But I hold a secret inside me.One I don’t dare share.Until I meet my new vampire master—who wears cold and angry like a second skin—and his shifter friends. While he can’t compel me, I long to share every part of me with them.Only fear holds me back.I need courage to move from within the darkness to the light. But maybe with the support of the three men, I can embrace my true self. And if I bring change to humanity along the way, that will be an even bigger win.",
