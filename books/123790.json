  "description": "\"The depth of research, generosity of spirit, and brilliance of biblical imagination make this remarkable book one of my favorite reads of a lifetime. I confess I need to see Jesus more alive and present. Blaine brings the presence of Jesus through the stories of the Hebrew Bible with such a vivid, lush, and compelling craft that as each chapter ended, I couldn’t stop.\"—Dan B. Allender, Ph.D. Professor of Counseling Psychology and Founding President, The Seattle School of Theology and PsychologyThe Bible is a piercing drama, a tale of prophets and wandering spirits, heroic mothers and flashing swords, cosmic mountains and dry, shadowy Sheol. It is a true story that defines the nature and purpose of reality, and its claims are astonishing.But few modern readers experience the Bible that way.In this groundbreaking book, celebrated storyteller Blaine Eldredge draws upon years of research to illuminate the story of the Bible through the lives of six kingly characters. From Adam to Jesus, Eldredge combines thrilling retellings of famous stories with cutting-edge scholarship and robust theology to explore topics such as the Bible’s picture of evil, its sophisticated supernatural worldview, and its complex picture of the human condition.The result is a stunning portrait of Jesus of Nazareth, the king and God and sacrifice who conquered death and overthrew the spiritual powers of this world and whose offer remains open to Follow me, come home to reality, and heal your humanity.",
