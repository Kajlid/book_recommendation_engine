  "description": "Tamsen Hayes has everything in life she could ever need; her family, her farmstead, and the love of her best friend and hunky fellow farmer, Jake Turner. However, when a blast from the past shows up unexpectedly, Tamsen and Jakeâ€™s relationship takes a turn, making her question whether or not she really wants to share her little slice of heaven with someone else after all. However, with a little help from her pack of goofy goats, and a gentle reminder from an old friend, Tamsen starts to make her way again, finding success, security, and true happiness in her little holler in the shadow of the Blue Ridge mountains.",
