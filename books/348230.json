  "description": "Along with Wit, Charm, Health, and Courage, Princess Amy of Phantasmorania receives a special fairy christening Ordinariness. Unlike her six beautiful sisters, she has brown hair and freckles, and would rather have adventures than play the harp, embroider tapestries . . . or become a Queen. When her royal parents try to marry her off, Amy runs away and, because she's so ordinary, easily becomes the fourteenth assistant kitchen maid at a neighboring palace. And there . . . much to everyone's surprise . . . she meets a prince just as ordinary (and special) as she is!\"This delightful fairy tale is sure to please young romantics . . . Neither Kaye's princess nor her book should be considered ordinary.\" ( School Library Journal )",
