  "title": "The Doctrine of Fascism",
  "description": "“Democracy is a kingless regime infested by many kings who are sometimes more exclusive, tyrannical and destructive than one, even if he be a tyrant.”\n'The Doctrine of Fascism' (Originally known as 'La dottrina del fascismo') is an essay written by Giovanni Gentile, with credit given to Benito Mussolini as a co-author. It was first published in the Enciclopedia Italiana of 1932, as the first section of a lengthy entry on \"Fascismo\" (Fascism). The entire entry on Fascism spans pages 847-884 of the Enciclopedia Italiana, and includes numerous photographs and graphic images.Today, it is considered the most complete articulation of Mussolini's political views. A key concept of the Mussolini essay was that fascism was a rejection of previous models: \"Granted that the 19th century was the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy, this does not mean that the 20th century must also be the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy. Political doctrines pass; nations remain. We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the 'right', a Fascist century. If the 19th century was the century of the individual, we are free to believe that this is the 'collective' century, and therefore the century of the State.\"Regardless of one's political inclinations, this essay is of great curiosity to any reader with intellectual interests, and a must-read for those who seek to buttress or demolish its unwavering premises.",
