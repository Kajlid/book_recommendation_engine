  "description": "The creator behind the cult-favorite website The Paxton Configuration (cult means no one reads it) and the former cult favorite website Secure Immaturity (cult means no one read it), brings you this crazy, bold, poorly edited, odd, possibly offensive and likely pointless collection of film reviews. Films reviewed include 1992's breathtaking masterpiece of offensive virtual reality The Lawnmower Man, the sparkled vampire spectacle Twilight: New Moon, the manly manliness of the ever-manly film Predator, the crime against humanity that is Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, the poster film for nihilism, Rambo, and many more.",
