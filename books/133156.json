But after the hell my ex-husband had put me through over the last year, over the last twenty years…well, I was ready to move on, repair what was left of my shattered heart and find someone to share my life with—someone who would put me first.I deserved it. I’d done my time being in her shadow, being a cheap understudy, always second. For. All. Those. Years. Never again.Our move to San Diego provided a fresh start, a new place away from all the hurt and memories. Life as a single mom to three teenagers had its' challenges, but we were adjusting and my kids were doing well. It was time to focus on my happiness, for once.
