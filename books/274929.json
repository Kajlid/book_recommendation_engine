  "description": "She's sweet. He’s sexy. Together they're scorching sensuality.Greta and Jacob aren't looking for love, but lust and longing strike on a stormy Michigan afternoon, leading to a few torrid hours of passion and pleasure. When the clouds parted, so did they, certain neither would fit into the other's vastly different life.Weeks later, when they unexpectedly meet again, both believe rekindling the fire will destroy their meticulous plans and dreams. Yet, neither are able to resist the heat.Jacob wants all of Greta, her heart and body, even though she could destroy the life he's struggled so hard to build for himself. He's also convinced she'll never see him as anything more than a blue-collar nobody—a temporary indulgence who doesn't belong in her world.Greta agrees. He doesn't fit, and trying for more is a mistake. He'd cause nothing but upheaval and chaos in her orderly life. Yet, for someone so wrong, he feels so right. As tempers flare and passions deepen, Greta and Jacob will have to decide if they're each other's fairy tale ending. Or nothing more than an erotic chapter.",
