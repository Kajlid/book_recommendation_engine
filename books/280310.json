  "description": "She’s the game changer he wishes he’d never met.  Nolan Clark is the last man standing. While he is happy his teammates have found love, he’s even happier to be single. But fate is a funny thing. When a one-night stand turns into a friends with benefits agreement, he starts to question why he’s holding the beautiful Reagan at arm’s length.   He knows she’s dangerous and should end their arrangement but the sex is too good and she is too… much.    He's the regret of a lifetime!  Nolan Clark should’ve been off-limits. He’s my closest friend’s teammate and a man that I’m not prepared for. I lied and told him I understood he’d never offer me a white picket fence and jumped straight into bed when he offered me the only thing he could sex.  With every smile, every touch, and every sizzling kiss I fall deeper in love. When the day comes for me to move five-hundred miles away to start a new job, he doesn’t stop me. Days pass, then weeks, and Nolan Clark does exactly what he said he was going to do – loses my number.  With Reagan gone to start her new life in Florida, Clark is left in Georgia at war with his heart. The timing couldn’t be worse. The past he thought he’d let go of, the ex-wife he’d thought he forgave crashes into his life brings with her an eleven-year-old boy he never knew existed.  When Reagan stumbles onto some information she shouldn’t, and her life is threatened, will Clark, and the 707 get there in time to save her? Or will she die alone and broken-hearted in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico?",
