For Missy, blueberry picking quickly becomes about more than just moneyâ€”it's the perfect distraction from the fact that her two best friends have gone off to summer camp without her and her dad is getting remarried. Why can't everything go back to the way it used to be? Back to normal? Soon, though, Missy discovers that the summer is full of secrets: the secrets to making her family feel whole again; the secrets to keeping her two best friends from changing and leaving her behind; the secrets of a local farm's blood feud; and most importantly, the secrets of blueberries.Author Sara Nickerson infuses warmth and humor into this tender coming-of-age story about finding something special within yourself and a place to call your own, in even the most tumultuous of times.",
