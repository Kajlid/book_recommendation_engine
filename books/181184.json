  "title": "Poop Squirrel: Essays by Finn Blakkatt",
  "description": "When your 8 year old daughter randomly blurts out the phrase “Poop Squirrel” while waiting for the school bus you know the apple does not fall far from the tree. This debut collection of essays from Finn Blakkatt showcases the humorous outcomes of anyone with bipolar or who aspires to visit both poles. Witty, irreverent and decidedly off-center; Blakkatt shares a collection of sadly funny life stories while also attempting to solve life’s many simple mysteries. From exploring the logical side of scatological outcomes at a local Home Depot to impersonating anyone to get ahead in life, Blakkatt attempts to break the mold of droll intellectualism. From his cynical foray into the restaurant business and fisticuffs with God to his inability to control any bodily function; Blakkatt brings a decidedly outré perspective to a life well lived.",
