  "description": "Agnes finds herself alone in Sweden where surprisingly she meets, Alex, someone from her past. She finds him irresistible, but he's no longer the man she knew before--he's married. But, to Agnes's surprise, he's in an open marriage. His wife allows him to go out with others. The couple's alternative arrangement makes Agnes think about her own marriage and the views she's had about it. When Benedict, her husband, flies to Sweden to be with her, Agnes confesses to him and tests whether or not Benedict would want an open marriage. Benedict takes flight and leaves her in Sweden and in to the arms of Alex. How far is Agnes willing to go with Alex? In the third installment of the Everywoman series, we find Agnes learning new things about herself and doing things she's never done before.",
