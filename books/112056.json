  "description": "Sig thought that changes to the world which strengthened magic had passed him by, until he discovered that he was chosen to be a major player in the battle against Black Magic. Unfortunately, only part of the power bequeathed to him is operational. The ability to change into a nine-foot tall, 700-pound Battle Wizard with a nearly invincible sword is great, but it doesn’t mean much in this age of rockets, tanks, and fighter jets.He can’t even light a candle with magic, like almost any other magical being can. The Wizard who is the head of the Physics of Magic department at Northwestern University takes Sig under his wing to help him discover the rest of his magic. Living at college while he finishes his last semester of high school is neat and Sig meets new magical friends including a werewolf and a tribe of Amazons. At least it was neat before the Dark Mage who defeated Sig’s Battle Wizard great-grandfather comes after Sig. He invokes the services of a Demon Marquis of Hell to kill Sig. College just isn't what Sig imagined.",
