  "title": "The 9/11 Conspiracy: The Scamming of America",
  "description": "Time is showing a growing development of skepticism about the official version of 9/11. The experts contributing to this book have conducted their own research into this seminal event that the Bush administration has used to subvert civil liberties, conduct preemptive wars, and bring the world perilously closer to chaos. In articles and appendices, The 9/11 Conspiracy shows why it’s unlikely that the Twin Towers were brought down by the crashing planes and subsequent fires; why the Pentagon was most likely not hit by a Boeing 757; and why the story of Flight 93 could not have happened as the government claims. For example, the Towers were built to withstand much more impact and heat than actually occurred, and the collapse contradicts the laws of physics. The notable contributors here — including David Ray Griffin and Morgan Reynolds — have thoroughly scrutinized 9/11 from every angle and found the government portrayal of what occurred deceptive — and dangerous.",
