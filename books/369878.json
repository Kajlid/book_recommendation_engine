  "description": "The outlaw lawman Rio encounters a young lad with incredibly good luck at cards but some mighty bad luck in life. Dark Horse Comics is proud to present a classic western tale from master storyteller Doug Wildey in this stunning collection of last year's two-issue series. Collected for the first time ever, readers can join our hero as he rides shotgun on a stagecoach to San Francisco's Barbary Coast, where he encounters a strange game of poker and even stranger poker partners! Lovingly rendered by this legendary artist, each painted color page brings the old West to life with a lush and lavish realism. This volume also includes a ten-page section of never-before-published art from Wildey's long and varied career as an illustrator in a myriad of fields. As an extra bonus, the collection's cover logo is embossed with special silver foil stamp.",
