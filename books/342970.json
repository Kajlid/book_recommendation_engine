  "description": "When Christian arrives in Egypt as the man Friday to an eccentric American, he's hoping to get his chance to make history and establish his name in archaeology. What he doesn't count on is meeting brash hired gun, Eric Lawless, and falling into an uneasy partnership. He thinks Eric is a boor. Eric thinks he's a prude. Sparks fly, leading to a night of passion that Christian has no intention of repeating. Too bad he can't resist Eric's rough charm. He's not ready for what their digging exposes either. The spirits of ancient Egypt are stirring, raised by very modern men, leading him, and Eric, into a dangerous game of cat and mouse. One where old ghosts and older gods send them on a dance of deception and terror deep in the tombs of the Valley of the Kings. Together, they must face their greatest fears, and their feelings for each other. Ancient artifacts, deadly snakes, and terrifying monsters stand in the way of what may be the greatest archaeological find any man has ever seen. Can they unearth the secrets of the tomb of the god king before they lose everything they hold dear?",
