Now please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Novak.I like to think of myself as a business man with an edge.Not just any woman has the capability to snag my attention, it takes a certain something if you will. Women like Katrina are few and far between. I have no intention of letting Katrina get away from me. Then there's also that nasty little issue of the flash drive. I will be keeping Katrina on a very short leash...To say that I am a dangerous man would be an understatement; let's just say that Katrina crossed the wrong man when she stole that flash drive. If forced marriage is the only way to keep her from testifying against me; well then, So.Be.It.Katrina:I was doing great. Riding high on the success of my bestseller. Until the Mobster I stole from found out. Giving that flash drive back would be admitting I had stolen it and used it to write my story. It meant admitting my novel which had now become a worldwide, phenomenal best seller; was nothing more than a hoax. This created a grave problem, it meant losing a lot of money and worse than that, it meant my reputation as a writer would be ruined.I had no choice, I would have to try and charm this snake, somehow, some way; into not ruining all that I had worked for. But forced marriage?!? He couldn't be serious, or could he?",
