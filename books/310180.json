  "description": "18+ THIS BOOK HAS TRIGGER WARNINGS:\nUnderage debauchery, sexual assault, drug & alcohol abuse, andheartbreaking loss.This is not for the faint of heart; it has graphic sex and a plethora of expletives.\nHayes Davenport:\nShe was the love of my young life, my best friend, then nothing but a fading memory stitched to my blackened heart.I lived a cold existence, trapped in the darkness, weighed down by all the secrets and lies; until she crashed back into my life and set my world on fire.Her alluring jade pools unleashed the beast within, and I had to have her.But I underestimated her innocence and fell for the sheltered she-devil and her poisonous kiss.Twin flame, or soul mate, I may never know.However, in all of life's uncertainties, one thing remains clear: she's the beginning and my end.\nGeorgiana Crawford:\nMy life was forever changed one fateful night.A void in my memory. A pain in my heart. A nightmare on repeat.His blue eyes haunt my dreams with the fleeting glimpse of a life not lived.Or a past, all but forgotten.For years, he'd been a tormented stare and grimace on the street.A familiar passerby in a small southern town, a ghost I'd yet to meet.The moment he fell into my life, whether by fate or chance, I knew there was no turning back.Our connection is magnetic, and his body calls to mine in ways Iâ€™ve only ever read about.He's pain and pleasure, my favorite nightmare.But is he my savior?Or did I hand him my heart, my soul, to break?",
