  "description": "Usually, things can't just disappear. You may think this has happened before when you've lost a pen, your keys, your homework, or maybe even your baby brother. But that is not actually what happens at all. Usually, you have simply put it down somewhere and, afterward, forgotten where. However, in this story, you will encounter an incident where a person does disappear, and in this story, that is not so unusual because the captain and the crew of his train, Evelyn Bamford (Earthling) and Paulo Vistar (Serothian), are on an unknown planet somewhere in deep space-where just about anything could happen. Fourteen-year-old Evie has disappeared, and it's up to her new travelling companions to discover what's happened. Along the way, the captain and Paulo encounter an angry lost mob, an angry hungry animal, and an angry greedy maniac, while Evie's problems seem to be-well, more relaxing, peaceful, restful, quiet and gloriously-sickeningly frustrating. How can Evie be stuck somewhere that doesn't seem to exist? Why doesn't anyone else around her notice that something is terribly wrong? And what is the awful secret that lies beneath the surface of the sanctuary? Next time you're thinking of taking a holiday, don't go there!",
