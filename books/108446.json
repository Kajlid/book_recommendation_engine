  "title": "Letters to a Young Victim: Hope and Healing in America's Inner Cities",
  "description": "In a series of compassionate yet provocative letters to a young African American trying to turn his life around, one of America's leading conservatives argues that individual responsibility, not government involvement, is the key to solving the problems of our most devastated communities.In this tough-minded and inspirational book, popular syndicated radio and television talk show host Armstrong Williams offers possible solutions and hopeful words to a community in crisis. In a series of letters to a young black man called Brad, a drug dealer and murderer seeking to transform his life, Williams applies the lessons he learned growing up on a farm in Marion, South Carolina, and, later, working in Washington's corridors of power to find answers to Brad's problems and the difficult questions facing Americans today, especially young black men. His conclusion is clear and only through hard work, faith, social responsibility, and individual empowerment can we create a better life for ourselves and our children.",
