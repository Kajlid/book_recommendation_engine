  "title": "London Fields",
  "description": "London Fields is more complex and affecting than its predecessor, Money, or the nuclear-haunted short stories of Einstein's Monsters. It is a state-of-England novel that also examines the state of the writer... He gives us a true story, a murder story, a love story, and a thriller bursting with humour, sex, and often dazzling language.",
