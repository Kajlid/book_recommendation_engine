  "description": "Statistics say that as many as one in three girls will be sexually abused at some point in their childhood. Mandy Smith is one of those girls. Beginning at age three, Mandy's stepfather begins to molest her. When she finally breaks the family’s code of silence at age fourteen, she is shunned—abandonment that leads her down a dark path. When she finds herself pregnant as the result of rape, the deep love she feels for her unborn baby surprises her—and gives her hope for the future. But just as she is in the midst of making plans for their new life together, her parents perform one final act of deception, a betrayal that sends her into an abyss of depression, disordered eating, and PTSD.",
