  "description": "No one in the Tower could remember what the Zero People looked like. They made up wild stories: \"The air is very bad down there. So Zero People have great big noses.\" \"There is no sun. So Zero People have gray skins. They all look dead.\" \"There is no food. They live on what we throw down.\" No one would ever go down to find out for sure. There were big animals on the steps, people said. They would eat you. Linda believed all the stories.",
