  "description": "Forty years ago, the legendary manga artist Moto Hagio reinvented the shōjo (girl's comics) genre with an ongoing series of whip-smart, psychologically complex, and tenderly poetic stories. Here now, in English for the very first time, as the debut release in Fantagraphics Books' ambitious manga line of graphic novels, are ten of the very best of these tales.The work in A Drunken Dream and Other Stories spans Hagio's entire career, from 1970's \"Bianca\" to 2007's \"The Willow Tree,\" and includes the mind-bending, full-color title story; the famously heartbreaking \"Iguana Girl\"; and the haunting \"The Child Who Comes Home\"–as well as \"Autumn Journey,\" \"Girl on Porch With Puppy,\" the eerie conjoined-twins shocker \"Hanshin: Half-God,\" \"Angel Mimic,\" and one of the saddest of all romance stories, \"Marié, Ten Years Later.\" A Drunken Dream and Other Stories is supplemented with a feature-length interview with Hagio, where discusses her art, her career, and her life with the same combination of wit, candor, and warmth that radiates from every panel of her comics.",
