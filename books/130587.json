  "description": "Witches and hunters. Blood and magic. Heartache and lust. Will history repeat itself? Lora Smith's life changes forever one day deep in the English fens. Caught up in the Witch trials of 1645, her life ends tragically early, yet her legacy lives on. Regan White is a 21st century Brighton girl who loves to shop, party, and shop some more. Forced to relocate to her aunt's crumbling old house in the fenland of West Norfolk, away from everything she's ever known, Regan's life takes a mysterious twist. A box of old diaries tell of strange happenings, striking a chord with Regan's own recent unnerving experience in the lingering fog of the fens and drawing her deeper into the mystery. Destiny is a big word but it seems that Regan's is irrevocably entwined in this bewitching landscape. How do the diaries, her band of new friends, and the captivating American Nate Hunter, all tie together? Will Regan find the link before it is too late, or will she share Lora's fate?",
