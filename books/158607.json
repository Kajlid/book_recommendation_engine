  "description": "When high school football star and ex marine, Ryan Hardman, comes back to Hidden Falls, he doesn’t care that his company wants to buy the ranch he’s always loved. He doesn’t care that he hasn’t seen his two brothers in seven years. And why would it be any of his business that Charlotte Love isn’t married anymore. It’s not.  Charlotte Love doesn’t believe in fairytale endings or happily ever after. She doesn’t want it, either. To say that she’s not the least bit concerned Ryan Hardman is back in town—would be saying she even cares that much. All she wants is to raise her son and run her bookstore.  After Charlotte discovers the ranch Ryan wants to buy—is hers…and a news story releases information surrounding the mystery of why Ryan hasn’t been back, they are left with a choice—run or fight.",
