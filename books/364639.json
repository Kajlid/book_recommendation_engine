  "title": "The Hunt",
  "description": "Book two of the Custodes Noctis. More than a thousand years ago, the Hunt was founded to ride the Between World. Long believed a punishment for Custodes Noctis who have denied their destiny, the riders and horses of the Hunt became the stuff of legend and nightmare. Ten years ago, Galen Emrys denied his destiny in a desperate attempt to save his family-and the world. With his brother Rob's return they could face that fate together, but the past does not forget. The call of the Hunt is back, sounding clearly for Galen, and even as he fights the call, he and Rob discover that joining the Hunt-and possibly losing themselves to the darkness forever-might be the only hope they have to stop something far, far worse from rising and devouring the world.",
