  "description": "\"A gripping tale of deceit and betrayal, love, loss, compassion, courage and the all consuming desire to fight for what you believe in. I fell in love with the characters.\" - Wormhole 5/5 stars, reviewer \"This is a story of hope, love, freedom, and redemption. Turen and Mia are wonderful.\" - LJ DeLeon Bestselling author of Warrior's Rise What would you do to save your people from extinction? What if your race held the key to mankind's future? One Guardian will risk hell to change the future. Descended from the race of Guardians, Turen's people have survived the last two hundred years, quarantined and isolated. Living in secrecy with no mates and no offspring, they fail to deliver on their ability to replenish and heal human souls through the birth of their Guardian children. Risking his life, Turen chooses capture at the hands of a comrade-turned-enemy to seek answers to change the future. Mia Bowman has no knowledge of the secret Guardian race. Yet, her uncontrollable, nocturnal summons to Turen's prison cell and her strong sense of justice leave her with little choice but to help him. She can heed his warning and stay clear of his people's problems or she can ferret out the lies and unravel an ancient tale of murder and deceit. It will take an ultimate sacrifice to stop the unexpected evil and reverse a fatal ending to the Guardian line. THE GUARDIANS OF A race of beings created in a Sanctum at the far edge of Eden. Co-existing with mankind, they safeguarded human souls and the promise of eternity--until a virus killed all over the age of eighteen. The surviving children fled to the Sanctum for protection, children raising children without the full legacy of their history and knowledge. Two hundred years of solitude have produced a race of semi-immortals fortified with powers and intellect but lacking the mates who will make them whole and allow them to fulfill their covenant with mankind.
