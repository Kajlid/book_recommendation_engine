  "description": "It’s been years since Siris and Julian’s boy band broke up and they all went their separate ways. Now they’ve run in to each other in a little redneck bar in the middle of nowhere, coming face to face with the ghosts of their past and the feelings they never quite grew out of. Siris is here handing out golden tickets to some new reality tv show for the network that owns his record label. Julian is here to meet up with yet another new partner. On the surface it seems like a coincidence… or is it? Neither man is happy when they realize that The Parliament means for Siris to be Julian’s new partner. Julian worries about what he could do to Siris. Siris just wants to go back to being a mega popstar and has no interest in being a monster hunter. Thrown together against their will (and better judgement) how will these former friends do on their first case?",
