  "title": "Talent for Humanity: Stories of Creativity, Compassion and Courage to Inspire You on Your Journey",
  "description": "We are all born with the power to imagine what does not yet exist. What if we used that power to create the world we all dream of living in--for ourselves and others? Meet seven inspiring people--Reza, Sherry and Bob Jason, Aliza Hava, Deeyah Khan, Yarrow Kraner, and Daniele Finzi Pasca--who used their passion and creativity in the arts to reach out and infuse others with values and understanding that are vital for their future and for the community. As you dive into their stories and allow them to take you on exceptional journeys, do realize that this book stands incomplete without your own contribution. Indeed, a few pages at the end are left blank. The final story, if you accept, can be yoursâ€¦ How would you put into words your wishes for the world and your aspirations to do something to bring change? Now imagine a million new friends just waiting to hear from you!",
