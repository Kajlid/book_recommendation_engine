  "description": "It’s not everyday that a girl of little significance is found locked in a grand birdcage in a royal court. What is it about Lily Tuteur? Is it her curly sunshine hair or her clear blue eyes that seem to speak truth? Expert in matters of manipulation, King Branken has secrets. Why does he fear the young woman enough to take an action that would insult a Prince from another land? Can Lily unlock a hidden power much greater than the King’s own? Remarkable events, and a kind prince, lead Lily to Breonia and the truth that might give the Kingdom of Arihi a chance for a miracle as the secrets of the King become unearthed.",
