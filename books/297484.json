  "description": "One loser, one karate-chopping bombshell, and one talking cockroach stand between YOU and the zombie apocalypse.It's business as usual at the 24/7 Demon Mart. Well, not exactly. The beer cave is still the portal to hell, but things haven't been quite right since a handful of vengeful beasts from beyond nearly destroyed the store in their bid to unleash hell on earth.Demon Mart has a serious pest problem. Shoddy construction has compromised the gate. Even the neighborhood is in flux, now that the Monster Burger across the street has a snooty new owner with a personal beef against the Demon Mart staff.And Lloyd Wallace, one-time world-saving hero, is too scared to leave his house. He's had a bit of trouble dealing with the fact that zombies are real (and a valued part of the Demon Mart team), blood-thirsty hell beasts are real, and that his boss is the devil. His guardian angel—who lives in a Magic 8-Ball—has had to resort to extreme measures to get Lloyd to leave the safety of his childhood bedroom, show up for work, and keep the promises he made to God.When the store's living dead staff get restless, and human customers start shuffling around, absolutely starving, ready to eat anything they can get their hands on, it's clear 24/7 Demon Mart has a big problem. It's ground zero for the zombie apocalypse.It's up to DeeDee, Lloyd, and Kevin to save the day—again. But Lloyd will have to conquer his crippling fear long enough to do his job. Can he man up and become a world-saving hero? Or, will he remain a couch-surfing zero? If they fail, Columbus, Ohio, could quickly turn into Zombie, Ohio. The fate of the world is on the line. What could go wrong?Monster Burger is the second book in the 24/7 Demon Mart series, a horror-comedy / humorous comic fantasy series. Other titles include The Graveyard Shift and Hell for the Holidays.",
