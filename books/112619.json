  "description": "From the works of Brian Daniel YoungBusinessman | Writer | Audiobook Producer | www.cerilene.comDefinition:Observation that in many (if not most) cases only a very small amount (the 'tip') of information is available or visible about a situation or phenomenon, whereas the 'real' information or bulk of data is either unavailable or hidden. The principle gets its name from the fact that only about 1/10th of an iceberg's mass is seen outside while about 9/10th of it is unseen, deep down in water.Brian Daniel Young takes this definition and applies it to the business world through real world tips, successes, and suggestions for your business.",
