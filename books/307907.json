  "title": "Cold Blooded",
  "description": "The Black Hand. Five families who run the city, a criminal syndicate even the police can’t touch. I used to be one of them, the youngest daughter to a family of hitmen, but then things changed. Just over five years ago, I lost everything. My whole family was murdered, but I managed to escape. But I’m back in town now, only this time I’m not the girl I used to be. The plan? Put on a mask, worm my way in. Destroy the Black Hand from the inside out. Make them pay for what happened to my family, for molding me into the revenge-obsessed monster I am today. Burn it all to the ground. And I’ll start with the Jameson twins, Jett and Dex. They might be cute, they might have smiles and bodies that make me wish things were different, but I’m a girl on a mission, and I won’t stop until those responsible are choking on their own blood. My heart turned cold a long time ago. The Black Hand is about to meet its match in this cold-blooded girl. ** Cold Blooded is the first book in a planned trilogy. This series is RH/Why Choose, meaning there are at least 3 love interests. Possibly more as the series goes on. There are mentions of violence, among other things some might find triggering. **",
