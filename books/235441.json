  "description": "As one of the top paid defensemen in the NHL, my life has been a revolving door of beautiful women and no-strings-attached sex.Until Brynne.It was only supposed to be a one-night-fling. Hell, it wasn't even supposed to be that. I knew the cardinal rule. Don't touch the coach's daughter. And for years, I kept my hands to myself. It wasn't difficult considering Brynne Jacobs hates my guts.She can't stand being in the same room as me - except for that one night. A night that left me hell bent on having more. Having all of her.But she took off. No text. No explanation. Not even a goodbye.Now she's back, but she's not alone. She's got a kid. A kid with all-too-familiar blue eyes and dimples.Math might not be my strong suit, but a quick calculation and I know the baby is mine.And she's delusional if she thinks I'm going to let her keep him from me.Damaged. Callous. Cold. Those are the words she uses to describe me. And I've never claimed to be anything more. But for her - for them - I want to be.I've been a fighter on the ice my entire life. Now, I'm fighting for the one thing I've spent my life running from - family.AUTHOR'S NOTE: This is a stand-alone spin-off of  Second Draft. You do not have to read  Second Draft first. No cliffhanger and a Guaranteed HEA.",
