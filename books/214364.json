  "description": "Crochet yourself a cute pet with the irresistible art of amigurumi!Amigurumi is the Japanese art of crocheting small, adorable, stuffed animals and creatures—and this collection delivers on the sweetness. Crochet more than 60 projects, including dogs (Chihuahua, Yorkshire Terrier, Toy Poodle, Pug, Bulldog, Corgi), cats (American shorthair, Maine Coon, Siamese), small pets (like rabbits and turtles), pets we wish we could own (T-Rex, unicorn, and dragon), as well as accessories (beds, bowls, leashes) to complement your pets. The dog and cat sections include recipes for individual body parts with information on how to combine the components. A helpful dog and cat breed guide will show you which parts to combine to create a specific breed or even designer breed (Goldendoodle, Puggle, Yorkipoo), or use your imagination to create your own unique and lovable mixed breed. All other projects include specific patterns for each animal. Give them as gifts . . . or keep them to snuggle yourself! Most patterns are created to scale with the dolls from AmiguruME, so make a best friend for your AmiguruME doll to enjoy.",
