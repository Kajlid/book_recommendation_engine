  "title": "The French Revolution: A History by Thomas Carlyle",
  "description": "Originally published in 1930, this book contains a series of extracts from Thomas Carlyle's influential three-volume work The French Revolution: A History (1837). The text was compiled with the intention of providing a 'representation both of Carlyle's delineation of the Revolution, and of his poetic scheme of history.' Continuity of narrative is ensured through the use of short explanatory link passages which are inserted between extracts. A detailed editorial introduction is also included, with information on the text, Carlyle's life and his conception of history. This book will be of value to anyone with an interest in Carlyle's writings and perspectives on the French Revolution.",
