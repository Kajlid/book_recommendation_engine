  "description": "*PART 2 OF A DUET*My world is on fire, and I’m obsessed with the girl who lit the match.Bloodied knuckles and a lifeless body at my feet confirm it: Penny is my demise.My gentlemanly facade is nothing but a memory.My sins are seeping through my shirt like ink.I tried to leave her. Couldn’t do it.I tried to snuff the life out of her. Couldn’t do that, either.So we’ll slow dance in the flames until I’m nothing but ash and embers.I’ll only rise like a phoenix when she’s gone.The problem is, I’d never let her go.No, she’d have to run far, far, away to escape me.And maybe she will if I just told her the truth:I own the Sinners Anonymous Hotline.And I’ve listened to every call she’s ever made.DARK MAFIA ROMANCE - ENEMIES TO LOVERS - AGE GAP - SLOW BURN***SOMME’S NOTES:Sinners Consumed is part two of a duet. Rafe & Penny’s story starts in Sinners Condemned, which will be out September 7.For a better reading experience, please read Sinners Anonymous before reading Sinners Condemned & Sinners Consumed.You should know that I write dark romance, and my stories–including this one–aren’t for the faint of heart. They contain several triggers, so aren’t suitable for everyone.",
