  "description": "\"Conscious Creativity: Ancient Europe Mindfulness Meditations\", by Nataša Pantović, is a profound exploration of the intersection between ancient mystical traditions and the power of the subconscious mind. In this book, Pantović delves into the fusion of Eastern and Western philosophies, focusing on how ancient civilizations, especially those in Ancient Europe, understood the mind, consciousness, and creative expression. It combines historical insights, meditation practices, and the development of the subconscious mind to inspire contemporary mindfulness practices.Key Themes of \"Conscious Creativity\"1. The Power of the Subconscious MindThe book draws inspiration from both Eastern and Western traditions to explore the subconscious mind—referred to in Eastern philosophy as Chitta. This concept of the mind is central in many ancient philosophies, particularly in the teachings of Plato, Pythagoras, Jung, and Patanjali. These thinkers and mystics believed in the potential of the subconscious to connect individuals to higher realms of knowledge and creativity.Pantović emphasizes the ascending spiral of consciousness, a metaphor that reflects personal and spiritual growth. This spiral is symbolic of how one moves from lower states of awareness to higher, more refined states of being, resonating with ancient gods and tapping into universal wisdom.2. The Intersection of Ancient East and WestIn Platonism, Neo-Platonism, and the mathematical teachings of Pythagoras, the subconscious mind and higher consciousness were linked to the discovery of universal truths. Ancient Greek philosophers often saw the mind as a means of connecting to the divine or achieving knowledge through logical and philosophical inquiry. This is echoed in the mystical traditions of Ancient Egypt and other civilizations, where the subconscious mind was seen as a gateway to the divine and the metaphysical realms.By integrating both Eastern meditation practices (like mindfulness) and Western philosophical teachings (like those of Jung and Plato), the book proposes a holistic view of conscious living that enables individuals to tap into their highest potential.3. Ancient European Civilization & Subconscious WisdomPantović brings attention to the ancient civilizations of Europe, particularly in Malta, which had a unique culture that flourished for over 1,500 years, from around 3500 BC to 2500 BC. The Temple Culture of Malta constructed megalithic temples dedicated to the worship of the Mother Goddess, Death, Creation, and Dreams. These sacred spaces were places for spiritual exploration, and no evidence of violence or warfare has been found in this society—indicating a peaceful, harmonious community that focused on artistic expression and spiritual growth.The absence of weapons and the emphasis on peaceful worship of the goddess offer a fascinating lens through which to understand the deep connection between art, spirituality, and the subconscious in ancient societies.4. The Role of Art, Music, and Sound in ConsciousnessPantović delves into how art and music can influence the subconscious mind. Ancient civilizations believed that by observing sacred symbols, engaging in ritual prayers, and listening to sound frequencies, individuals could align their inner vibrations with higher cosmic frequencies.She explores the concept of subconscious vibrations and how they can be perceived through ancient art and music. By engaging with these creative forms, we are encouraged to activate both hemispheres of the brain, fostering a balanced and harmonious approach to creativity and spiritual growth. The ancient use of sound frequencies for healing and consciousness ascension is tied to practices like mantras, chants, and other forms of sacred sound.5. Mindfulness and European PhilosophyIn a fascinating interview featured in the Sunday Times, Pantović discusses her concept of \"European mindfulness.\" She explains that mindfulness is not just a modern trend or a quick path to happiness, but a deep spiritual practice rooted in the Age of Enlightenment and the ancient Greek philosophers. Unlike the quick-fix mentality promoted by modern \"instant happiness\" gurus, Pantović believes that by listening to our souls and connecting with our deepest desires, we can live in alignment with our highest potential.She reflects on the rapid changes in the world, noting how the population has grown from 3 billion to 7 billion since her birth in 1968. In this context, Pantović stresses the importance of adopting new behavioral patterns that not only allow us to survive but to thrive in a rapidly changing world. For her, mindfulness is a way to live authentically, reconnect with art, creativity, and higher wisdom, and be un-hypnotized by modern distractions such as consumerism and media.6. The Role of Creativity in MindfulnessA central idea in Pantović's philosophy is that creativity—whether through art, music, dance, or writing—is an essential part of mindful living. By embracing our creative potential, we can connect to our inner wisdom and raise our consciousness. She underscores that true mindfulness involves a creative engagement with life, rather than a passive existence, and encourages us to be both active and reflective in our journey of personal and spiritual growth.",
