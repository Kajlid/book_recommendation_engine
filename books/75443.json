Not speaking French at a school full of snobby French girls is bad enough, but Maya believes there is something sinister going on in her new city. A purple-eyed man follows Maya and her younger brother, James. Statues seem to have Maya’s face. And an eerie cabinet filled with mysterious colored bottles calls to her. When James becomes the target of dark forces, Maya decides she must answer the call of the Cabinet of Earths, despite the danger.",
