  "description": "From the New York Times bestselling author of A Ship of Bones and Teeth comes a spicy, dark romance for fans of Katee Robert and Sophia Lark. Raised by con artists, Ellie Watt has a lot of crazy childhood memories, but none worse than being scarred with acid by crime boss Travis Raines. Now Ellie is a full-grown woman who lives for revenge, and Travis is a full-blown criminal who kills for pleasure. The sadistic bastard has kidnapped her good friend Gus as well as her mother, whom he's been holding as prized possessions in his heavily guarded lair. And Ellie has only one chance in hell of getting them out alive-using two dangerous men who love her to death . . . One is Camden McQueen, a talented tattoo artist who's made a permanent mark on Ellie's heart. The other is Javier Bernal, her fiery ex-lover who's busted more than a few heads in his time. From the crime-ridden streets of Mexico City to the predatory jungles of Honduras, this unlikely trio forms an uneasy alliance in the deadliest game of all-a gun-blazing battle to the finish that will pit enemy against enemy and lover against lover. And Ellie must choose the right man to trust . . . or die.",
