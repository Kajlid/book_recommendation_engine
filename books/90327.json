  "description": "Vivi Rios is a lot of things – impulsive, idealistic, half angel on her horny dad's side. Vivi plans to travel the country, killing monsters and helping people. All happy thoughts until she meets a giant demon half breed idiot and his defective monster. Helping Seth and Felix, Vivi figures she has things handled until his pack catches up to them. To keep Felix alive, Vivi must join the demon half breed males.If Hoyt Jackson thought having a pretty female join his pack was a genius way to retain control against a competing alpha, Vivi proves him wrong…fast. She never shuts up, tells goofy stories, and charms his pack into dreaming big. Hoyt just wants everything to remain the same, but a war is on the horizon. As if he doesn't have enough problems, he also must contend with the enchanting Vivi who beyond all good reason swoons over him.While Vivi finds herself in over her head with problems mounting, sometimes the easiest route is the least fun.Note: Ain't No Angel is a revised/expanded version of the book previously published as Desert Flower.",
