  "title": "The Wonderful Demise of Benjamin Arnold Guppy",
  "description": "Benjamin Arnold Guppy loved turnips. He loved eating them, but most of all he loved throwing them. He also loved money and pain... extorting a lot of the former and causing an equal amount of the latter. A foul, sour-faced old swindler with a penchant for clucking like a chicken and more than a passing interest in the local postman, he was determined to get his hands on his neighbours' money, regardless of the cost. As it turned out, the price was his life.",
