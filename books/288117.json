  "description": "When the president of the club goes missing, Beck Caulder, Glory MC’s sergeant at arms, is the one to strap on his anti-radiation gear and go in search for him. The problem is, ever since Knuckle learned that a hit was placed on him, Beck won’t be the only one on the lookout for him.  When Beck discovers that the president is hiding in Westborough, the most dangerous place located in Ward Four, he has no choice but to run headlong into Slasher territory. There he encounters Devine Blaise, the raven-haired beauty, covered in leather and tattoos. With her killer bod and equally killer instincts, Devine quickly becomes Beck’s dream woman. Too bad she’s also the hitman hired to take out his club’s president.  Equally matched in determination and skill, the chase soon becomes a battle of the most deadly as Beck and Devine try to take each other out before they can reach their target. This should be easy for the club's sergeant at arms, but defeating the killer proves impossible when she becomes the only woman he can’t resist.",
