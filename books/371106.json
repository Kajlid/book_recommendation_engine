  "description": "Tarzan of the Apes had heard only rumors of the Kavuru - a race of strange white savages. But when they stole the daugher of Muviro, chief of the Waziri, the Lord of the Jungle set on in search of their legend-shrouded village on a mission of rescue - or, if need be, of revenge. He could not know that his trail ran close to that of a strange group of survivors of a crashed plane - including his beloved mate, Jane - who struggled for survival against the terrors of Africa and an even worse danger within their own party. But the stranded Europeans and the ape-man were destined for a rendezvous of blood and fire - in the dreaded temple of the Kavuru.Cover Illustration: Boris Vallejo",
