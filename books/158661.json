  "description": "Forget love at first sight. I'm doomed to love at every sight. Much like a Greek siren with the curse of broken-hearted suitors scattered throughout her past, Emalie goes away to college hoping to leave her old habits behind and find real love. To her immense displeasure, her habitual wearing of sunglasses as a means to protect potential \"prey\" of her powers proves to be ineffective. Almost immediately, a boy named Quincy sees her blue, beautiful eyes, and as though they are Cupid's arrows, he is struck with love. But why isn't he acting crazy with infatuation? To make matters worse, another classmate named Tony kidnaps her for a game with some friends and she must use her eyes to escape the dangerous encounter. The downside to the escape: Tony falls in love with her. Struggling against her feelings of vulnerability and the belief that she is a victim of circumstance unable to influence the plot of her life, she must make a choice. She can either continue a life of captive, possessive love with Tony or take a leap, risk her secrets, and pursue her goal of finding love unsolicited by her cursed eyes.",
