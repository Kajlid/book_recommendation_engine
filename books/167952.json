  "title": "The UnPeopled Season: Journal from a North Country Wilderness",
  "description": "\"Rice is a poet, and wilderness is his muse.\" -Robert Roberg, Smithsonian Folk Artist Ten Year Anniversary Edition includes twenty-five images from the adventure, plus three new journal entries by the author. “Today I am an unemployed writer living as a recluse in the great Northwoods.”So begins this North Country journal from the author of THIS SIDE OF A WILDERNESS . In the spring of 2011, Rice resigned from his career with the U.S. Geological Survey, and moved alone into a tent deep in the forests of northern Minnesota. THE UNPEOPLED SEASON is his daily record of the four months in isolation. But it is more than a catalog of events. It is a compassionate and introspective quest into mankind’s connection to wild places. He writes with humor about his follies and foibles, shares technical know-how about setting up camp, ruminates on fishing, introduces wild animals, and discusses the often invigorating, occasionally disconcerting, task of confronting solitude.",
