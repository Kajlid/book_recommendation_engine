  "title": "Anything He Wants",
  "description": "\"Richard Weems' surging dialogue and rhapsodic narrative guide us through the humorous, albeit damning, interactions of people who are just like us. Confused, inspired, and sad, his characters are working to change their lives but are frustrated by both the every-day and the highly unusual. Detailed introspections are delivered through original prose, unlike anything I've ever read. Don't read him if you want the norm. His voice is part of an underground, cutting edge group of writers who are making wild changes to the way literature is created and enjoyed.\"-Camille Renshaw, former Editor of Pif Magazine \"A pleasure to read, a pleasure to inhabit, the stories in Anything He Wants remind us why we want to read in the first place. Extraordinary work by a writer about whom too little is known.\"-Frederick Barthelme “Richard Weems is a big, generous, weird guy whose stories too are generous and weird. Weems is going to get weirder with time, and more generous and more large, and he will be fun to read.”-Padgett Powell",
