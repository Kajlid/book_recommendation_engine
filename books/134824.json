  "title": "Master Rosalind",
  "description": "Twelve year old Rosalind Broom, raised by her clergyman grandfather in a small village near Oxford, does not relish his plans for her marriage to a suitably endowed gentleman. Instead, she dreams of an independent life, perhaps in London. Bright, high-spirited, and willful, she ignores her grandfather’s warnings and disguises herself as a boy. Kidnapped and brought to London, she falls in with thieves and cutpurses, whom she later leaves to join Burbage’s company of actors. Still accepted as a boy, she plays female roles, including that of Rosalind in As You Like It. Her deception is eventually revealed to no less a person than Queen Elizabeth.",
