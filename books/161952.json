However, on the way to obtain her parents' approval, a car runs them off the road. When Sean wakes up, he's tied up and alone, at the mercy of an anti-shifter group. Six months ago, Lauren never would've pictured herself with a cougar-shifter, but Sean was everything she hoped for and was willing to risk it all to be his mate. Yet when a staged car crash tears him from her side, Lauren must reach out to his clan--a clan she's never met--for help before it's too late. Can Lauren and Sean be together for Christmas? Or, will their differences be too much to overcome and rip them apart?",
