  "description": "Back in print again for the first time ever, The Nuclear Platypus Biscuit Bible, quite possibly THE WEIRDEST BOOK OF ALL TIME, clearly and concisely articulates all knowledge worth knowing! Now featuring 342% more Biscuitism, this long out-of-print underground cult classic returns in a thoroughly revised edition (212 pages, compared to the measly 48 pages of the 1990 edition) in hard- & softcover, with loads of new eye-popping graphics and all-new chapters that continue the brain-twisting Biscuitoid assault on reason, normality and comprehensibility. Learn such crucial info as: the precise theological difference between the Nuclear Platypus and His bumpkin cousin, the Nucular Platypus; the horrors of the Great Porridge Famine that wiped out the creatures of myth and fairy tales; what happened when God-Biscuit showed up drunk for the Apocalypse; and God-Biscuit's glorious plan for humanity. Guaranteed to be the most important publishing event in the entire history of human civilization or your money back!",
