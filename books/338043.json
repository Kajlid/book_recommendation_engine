  "description": "Once more Wren Valere's game plan has taken an unexpected direction. She'd agreed to a bargain with one supersecret magic-watching outfit to protect her and her partner on their last job. But now the Silence is trying to wedge them apart.On the one hand, ever since she and Sergei began to talk about their \"relationship,\" things have been tricky. On the other, though… Well, no one better try to stand between Wren and Sergei when danger is near!So now they are off to Italy in search of a missing artifact, without any information other than the fact that it's very old, very dangerous and everyone who gets too close disappears.
