  "title": "The Boys, Volume 2: Get Some",
  "description": "The second volume of the acclaimed series The Boys is here by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson! Dark avenger Tek-Knight and his ex-partner Swingwing are in trouble. Big trouble. One has lost control of his terrifyingly overactive sex-drive, and the other might just be a murderer. It's up to Hughie and Butcher to work out which is which, in Get Some. Then, in Glorious Five Year Plan, The Boys travel to Russia - where their corporate opponents are working with the mob, in a super-conspiracy that threatens to spiral lethally out of control. Good thing our heroes have Love Sausage on their side. The Boys, Vol. 2: Get Some collects issues 7-14 of the critically acclaimed series and is an excellent companion to Dynamite's best-selling Volume I Paperback \"The Name of the Game!",
