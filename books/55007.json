  "description": "Don't we all crave a refuge from daily life, a haven of tranquility, regardless of our creed? Altars and Icons draws together 40 eclectic personal shrines in the first photographic celebration of its kind. Here are altars -- formal and casual, secular and religious, heartfelt and whimsical -- created to evoke contemplation, inspire creativity, amuse, encourage, or honor the memory of a loved one. Amalia and Carlos Vasquez celebrate the Day of the Dead in a bright-hued altar of roses. Harrod Blank makes his car an emotional sounding board, adding a new element (bottle cap, figurine, birthday cake) each time he feels the urge to express himself. Eleanor Coppola offers a sunny spot for family memories, while in other homes a kitchen table commemorates Kwanza and a living room altar showers praise on a beloved cow. Including interviews with the people who fashion these remarkable shrines, as well as plenty of how-to tips, Altars and Icons is inspiration for creating your own sacred place.",
