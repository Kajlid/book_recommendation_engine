  "description": "Hi, I'm Max. Hardworking, book-loving person who feels special about trees. My favorite one lives in the botanical gardens, a fairly young sequoia. To me, they are the most majestic beings in the world. However, I approach them with caution now, after what happened to me.I still can't explain it very well. Imagine putting your hand on the tree, feeling the rough bark, thinking loving thoughts to it, and then suddenly plunging into darkness. That's what happened to me. I ended up in a whole forest of sequoias, and soon found out I wasn't in the good old US of A anymore. Fortunately, I made some friends, and discovered a possible way of getting home â€¦ and change the world with it.But like I said, I'm careful about sequoias, these days. And you might want to treat them with respect, too.",
