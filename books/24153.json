  "description": "This first book of White Wolf's exciting new Tribe Novel series shows the Garou - the werewolves of the World of Darkness - at their best and at the worst. In Shadow Lords, we see how the fractious Garou struggle for dominance over one another, and in Get of Fenris, at a Concolation - the largest gathering of Garou - we see them standing together in their endless war against the Wyrm. But how long can the Garou continue to fight this war? Their numbers are diminishing, and as this seven-book series will reveal, their past is being taken from them as well.",
