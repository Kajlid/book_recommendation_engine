  "description": "ASIN B008X5Z11C moved to the most recent edition herePolice Lieutenant Matt Leahy is surprised to learn that he has been assigned to work with a special branch of the National Security Agency in conducting an investigation at a top-secret base called Apache Point located in the New Mexico desert. He is met at the Albuquerque airport by a beautiful female agent who has been appointed to assist in the case. At Apache Point he learns that an extraterrestrial element known as stellarite, which powers the world's first time transporter, has been sabotaged. Computer models have determined that the only other known source of the element came to Earth in a meteor that struck Egypt in the year 1250 B.C. However, the agent who was sent back in time to recover it has taken the element and vanished into the world of Pharaoh Ramses II. To make matters worse, the suspect must be captured within 20 days, and the stellarite recovered, or hundreds of time agents will be forever stranded in the past. But Leahy soon discovers that there is much more at stake than has been revealed. A closely guarded secret threatens to reach out from man's distant past and ignite World War III. He and his team of experts transport into the era of the pharaohs, unaware of the deadly consequences that await them.",
