  "description": "A crime that isn't reported; a mother who's threatened...Classic crime from one of the greats of the Detection ClubOne of Arthur Crook's favorite maxims was \"Beware of the invisible witness, the man or woman whose presence can't be guarded against because it can't be foreseen.\" This never was more true than in this baffling case of death and kidnapping.Just such a witness was Sara Drew when with her 4-year-old son, Mike, she saw the two racing cars go flying down the hill to virtually inevitable tragedy and violent death. She is the only witness to the particularly unpleasant car accident in which an elderly lady and her dog are killed. Nervous of going to the scene of the accident with a child, she reluctantly goes home. There she meets one of the drivers, and is appalled that he has no intention of reporting the incident. And he also threatens to hurt her son if she goes to the police.This is a story of kidnapping -- of a young widowed mother driven to desperation by thugs who have killed and will kill again. In her loneliness, and fright Sara finds confidence and encouragement in the cozy and uproarious person of the lawyer/detective Arthur Crook. With her son Mike kidnapped, Detective Crook takes over the case and counters the wiles of desperate criminals . . .Anthony Gilbert tells an exciting story with wit and conviction; Arthur Crook bounds cheerfully through it, redressing wrongs. And the hardships and hazards of a bitterly cold English winter provide a realistic setting. 'No author is more skilled at making a good story seem brilliant' Sunday Express",
