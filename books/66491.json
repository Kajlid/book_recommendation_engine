  "title": "The Price of Peace",
  "description": "This novel was written as future history - something that is likely to happen in the near future. An earlier manuscript of this novel was used as a basis for a war game attended by our top generals and completed only months before Iraq invaded Kuwait. I was consulted on that war game and our response to Iraq was partially modified by my input. However, the manuscripts of this book were read by only a few government officials and a few of my close relatives. I was officially told by the Air War College in 1986 that us worrying about military in the Middle East was unrealistic, we would never have involvement of US miitary forces in the Middle East and never face a threat from them. So - I wrote this novel for a public warning that the time is near. While the characters are fiction, the military ramifications are real. I should have published it prior to 9/11, but this novel is only a bare beginning of what may soon be history.",
