  "description": "Will is different … ‘special’. He’s a genius at math and even though he’s still at school studying for his A levels, he lives on his own in a dingy, run-down bed-sit and has to work at night to support himself. But there’s something more that sets him apart – something he has to keep hidden from everyone, even his friends. Otherwise, he risks blowing his cover or, worse, losing his life…Sophie is ‘special’ too. Deep in the bowels of a secret government facility she spends her days colouring in seemingly unfathomable patterns on endless sheets of graph paper, never speaking a word. To those around her she seems like a simpleton, but little do they suspect that she, like them, is fighting a secret war – a war against the deadly organization known as the Hive.Set in a Britain of the near future, Child of the Hive is both a tense sci-fi thriller and a gripping philosophical exploration of what it means to be human in a world of ever-increasing technological sophistication. An unputdownable read.",
