Dark Horse Comics is proud to introduce Star Wars: Infinities A New Hope, the first in a series of non-continuity Star Wars stories which are sure to delight Star Wars fans of all ages. Taking off from the end of events in the movie Star Wars: A New Hope, Infinities readers will follow Luke, Han, Leia, Threepio, and Artoo on a journey every bit as action-packed and fantastic as the original Star Wars trilogy.",
