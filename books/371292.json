  "description": "Can there be such a thing as too many men in kilts? Normally Liss MacCrimmon, proprietor of Moosetookalook, Maine’s one and only Scottish Emporium, would say no. But that’s before one of them turns out to be murderous…The bagpipes are blaring at Moosetookalook’s finest hotel, reopened just in time to host an annual celebration of Scotland’s most beloved poet. But when the Scottish Heritage Appreciation Society arrives on the scene, they bring more than a hunger for haggis and a passion for plaid. The quarrelsome group harbors their share of long held grudges, and the animosity only grows as the whiskey flows. Then a fierce blizzard hits, trapping everyone—angry Scotsmen, hapless hotel staff, and Liss herself—indoors.It isn’t long before a body is discovered face down in a storage room, covered in tartan—and blood. Now Liss will have to work fast to solve this crime before another body goes as cold as the snowstorm keeping her cooped up with a killer.",
