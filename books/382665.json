  "description": "Hailed by Stephen King as \"scary and suspenseful\" and \"unputdownable,\" and by Peter Beagle, author of THE LAST UNICORN, as \"The best vampire novel I have ever read,\" THE VAMPIRE TAPESTRY examines the classic monster as a biological, rather than supernatural, predator who awakens from hibernation every few decades needing to relearn human culture. After years of secret effort, the self-styled Edward Weyland has become a respected anthropology professor and director of a sleep research lab. With reliable access to unsuspecting blood donors, he grows complacent and makes a near-fatal error. First critically wounded by a strong and canny woman, then imprisoned and humiliated by a power-mad Satanist, he is forced on a journey toward an empathy with his prey that threatens the foundations of his survival.About the AuthorSuzy McKee Charnas was born and educated in New York City, attending Barnard College as an Economic History major (1961) and, after a two-year stint in Nigeria with the Peace Corps, New York University (MAT, 1965).
