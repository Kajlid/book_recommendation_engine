  "description": "Things get quickly complicated when a teenage girl stumbles into a world of corruption and cover-up within the Hellstorm Live Supply Co. In her pursuit, she manages to endanger her life and others in a vigilante style attempt to get the injustice only her eyes have seen, released to the public through the media - her only hope for the world to know the truth. This is an epic story of grassroots motivation and advocacy, inside take-overs, unscrupulous payouts, murder, foul play, suicide, bought-and-paid-for laws and gag orders. But soon teenage Sophie Slaughter is targeted herself as a homeland terrorist and finds herself on the list. The pesky, antagonizing problem persists, however, that nobody believes her.",
