  "description": "Mysterious Earth forces eject an alien power from the planet leaving humanity exposed.Since distant prehistoric times humanity has been controlled and developed by an alien race known as the Sponsors, but over the course of one brutally destructive afternoon our alien benefactors are annihilated and their remnants expelled from Earth, never to return.For the first time in its existence the human race stands as a fully independent species. But far from this being liberation, the \"human system\" is now left in a precarious state and complete collapse seems imminent.The perpetrators of the Sponsors' destruction, the so-called Gang of Four, are giving humanity just a few days to decide its own fate. There are two options available, but both seem too dreadful to contemplate.The sole surviving human/sponsor hybrid, the British Prime Minister and an aerobics instructor from Bermondsey attempt to make sense of the forthcoming catastrophe.Can an enigmatic crop circle reveal the way ahead?**************************************************“ The Gang Of Four is an entertaining, inventive science fiction book that in places had me actually laughing out loud. ”Jane Stockwell, Unigon Plane:unigonplane.wordpress[DOT]com/2018/04/08/richard-lawther-the-gang-of-four/**************************************************You can download a FREE ebook version of The Gang Of Four from:Apple Books; Barnes&Noble; Smashwords; Obooko",
