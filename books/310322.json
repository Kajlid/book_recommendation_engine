  "description": "Otto and Wolf are son and father, respectively, and they've had a romantic and sexual relationship for a long time, even considering themselves married. Incest is legal where they live, but it's still heavily frowned upon, so they have to love in their own way behind closed doors.Otto also has a son of his own, Delfin, and his little boy is all grown up at eighteen. Unlike most teens, Delfin is different in his own way, so much so that it led his own mother to no longer want anything to do with him. That's okay, though. He has both his dad and grandpa to give him all the unconditional love he could ever be spoiled with.While Otto and Wolf love Delfin with all their hearts, it's still not enough. Delfin feels left out whenever he sees his dad and grandpa showing the kind of affection he never gets to have. Since Otto and Wolf's strong family bond has romantic and sexual facets, Delfin wants a part of it too. Could he finally get his wish? Could Otto and Wolf possibly bring the three of them closer and happier in a new way?",
