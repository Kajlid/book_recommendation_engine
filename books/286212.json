  "description": "It began with betrayal.And ended in murder.She was never supposed to cross my path. She was never supposed to know about the Currency of Secrets or the Oaths of Blood.But like a thief in the night, she stole my soul even if she wasn't mine to possess.As a member of the Elite, I live by simple tenets. A gentleman above all. Private matters stay private. Secrets whispered are never revealed. Enemies and friends are of the same coin. And power is king.My so-called brothers killed my friend. I intend to make them pay.  And before it's over, I'll bend all the rules of morality, decency and legality. I will borrow and steal to set the scales right. But begging--begging, you can forget about.My name is Ben Covington and I know my sins.",
