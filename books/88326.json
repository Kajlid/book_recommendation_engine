  "title": "Mary Baker and The Eye of the Tiger",
  "description": "Mary Baker isn’t happy. She’s bullied by a mother who hates her and her mother’s boyfriend, who is a redneck plumber with a big gut. It’s only the mysterious surprises that keep happening to her that make her life fun. Or interesting. Like the anonymous gifts that come in the mail or the flocks of black birds that follow her. Then one day, a death and a mysterious, magical stone with symbols on it, called The Eye of the Tiger, bring her great wealth and a new life attending a school of white magic. This sometimes amusing adventure includes misspells which hit the wrong people with funny results, and real spells and rituals that have powerful consequences. All is going well until a hooded figure steals the stone. Now, her riches in jeopardy, Mary and her friends soon find themselves in real danger as they come up against a young woman who can’t decide if she’s evil or good and a truly evil wizard, who just wants the stone for the wealth it will bring.",
