  "description": "Cleo St. James is everything a girl could hope to be: beautiful, rich, intelligent, and strong. But by the time she's nine years old, she's also alone--ignored by her parents and shunned by her peers. Her only friends are two grown men, and the fact that one is a gangster and the other a thief provides enough insight into the forces that shape Cleo into the weird young woman that she becomes. Hilarious accidents lead to useful skills, and as Cleo grows up (too fast), her criminal tendencies lead her closer and closer to someone from her past--perhaps the only person in the world who truly understands her. With a sailor's vocabulary, a fine set of lock picks, and a few million in the bank, Cleo always gets what she wants. But when it comes to what she needs--a real connection with someone--it pays to have someone who knows her better than she knows herself.",
