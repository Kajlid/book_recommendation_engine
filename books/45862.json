  "description": "The acclaimed author of Burned is back with more heart-stopping suspense in a gritty and thrilling sequel that pits Norwegian crime reporter Henning Juul against an international crime ring.Oslo’s top investigative crime reporter Henning Juul is still haunted by the death of his son. Every time he looks in the mirror, he sees the scars from the horrible fire that killed his six-year-old boy. So when he receives a message from convicted murderer Tore Pulli, he can’t stop himself from following up: “If you find out who set me up, I’ll tell you what happened the day your son died.” Pierced follows Henning Juul to Tore Pulli’s prison cell, where the felon sends the reporter on a quest to find the real killer behind his false conviction. Juul knows the murders pinned to Pulli don’t bear his signature, but when Pulli is found dead of an apparent suicide, Juul begins to realize there’s much more at stake. As he digs deeper, he strikes up a fragile partnership with Iver Gundersen, a journalist now living with Juul’s ex-wife. Together, the two men rush headlong into a gangland power struggle, delving into an impenetrable world. Uncovering more questions than answers, Juul soon comes to understand that he has to find not one, but several killers—money-hungry men more dangerous than any he has encountered before—if he ever wants to solve the mystery of his son’s death.",
