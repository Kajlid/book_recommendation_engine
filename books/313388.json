  "description": "Warning! Get ready for some crazy stuff that’s so not suited for faint hearts.This story ended up way darker than I expected. Let me see…I present Frankie: a badass Vampire hunter with wild, long pink hair, short skirt, multiple personalities ruling her life and a love for French fries, boots, goth fashion and gummy bears.Dean, a demon who can’t die. Well, he can but he won’t stay dead and falls for one of Frankie’s personalities. Frankie is kinda killing him a few times just to make sure… “This was something new to (censored) a guy, kill him and then (censored) him again.”Raven and Amon, the hot and evil vampire twins who rule over New Orleans.Nick, a cook/sorcerer who kinda tried to stop the vampire apocalypse and has a thing for Amon and Frankie and then there is Luis. Well, we don’t know exactly what’s his deal but damn the man is hot.When all hell breaks loose and the vampire apocalypse starts no one is really surprised. Will Frankie and her mental roommates, the memories of former slayers, be able to push the Spirit of the First Vampire back to the pits of hell and bring the light back or is she doomed to spend eternity on the run?This book has lots of steam, lots of killing, lots of darkness and vampires, lots of hot men who are or are not human. A read for my dark and gloomy why choose crowd.Ends in a bit of a cliffhanger but just think Sylvester Stallone hanging there, sweaty…",
