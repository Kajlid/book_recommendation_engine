Then a change in her dad’s job forces her to attend Cedar Cove Family Camp where she once again finds herself on the outside of a social circle.After unwittingly stumbling through a magical gateway to a new world called Alitheia, Darcy begins to realize there might be a higher purpose for her life, and she eventually convinces the other five teenagers to travel there with her. Once there, they learn the “arrival of the Six” was prophesied hundreds of years before, and that they must expel an ancient evil from the land. Will Darcy have what it takes to save Alitheia? Or will she fall prey to a deadly foe?",
