  "description": "Follow us on the path of kindness and caring in Princess and Unicorn Stories!  Learning good social behaviors is vital to a child’s development, and sharing is one of the first social skills every child must learn. That might mean sharing a toy with a playmate, a snack with a parent, or even a room with a sibling. These are early opportunities to teach your little ones the power of sharing.  Join Princess Penelope and her unicorn Aurora in Sharing: Princess and Unicorn Stories. When Penelope’s friends Owen and Bella come to visit, she has something magical to show them. But even though these best friends love and respect each other, mishaps do happen. As always, they solve their problems by remembering to be polite, kind, and caring as their day of play turns into a day of learning.  The father-daughter duo of JS and Penny B. Jen write in a whimsical fashion educating while entertaining your children.  \"Penelope shows her friends what is hidden: A MAGICAL WAND, decorated with a kitten. The wand makes animal shapes of all different types. Animals made from stone, wood, ice and even bright lights.\"  Penny B. Jen’s Personal Mantra: “Be respectful. Solves problems. Make good choices.”",
