  "description": "\"I want to be absolutely in your power, Wanda,\" I exclaimed suddenly, seized by that frenzy of passion when I can scarcely think clearly or decide freely. \"I want to put myself absolutely at your mercy for good or evil without any condition, without any limit to your power.\" While saying this I had slipped from the ottoman, and lay at her feet looking up at her with drunken eyes.  Erotic fiction by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. The term masochism is derived from his name. Originally published in 1870, this is probably the first book which blatantly addresses the issue of female sexual domination, this is today a classic of the genre.",
