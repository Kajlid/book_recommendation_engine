People whisper about him; most want to help him, as if he's a songless bird with a broken wing, make him a project, set him up on a date with a best friend . . .On one such date, Wendy sits across from Patrick and tells him she's afraid to die. She wonders what it's like. What if this is all there is? \"My mother died a year ago . . . horribly,\" she says. Patrick listens; it's all he's pretending to do.There's something wrong with the way Patrick treats the women he dates, his friends, his family . . . no one can ever get close to Patrick, and no one will ever be able to uncover his secret.Enter Justin Bog's dark world and strike up a dialogue with The Conversationalist.Included: a Foreword by Rachel Thompson, author of Broken Pieces, and a bonus short story, Mothers of Twins, from Justin Bog's first collection of psychological tales, Sandcastle and Other Stories.",
