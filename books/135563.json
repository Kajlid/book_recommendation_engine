However, remaining chaste was part of their agreement, though desire and jealousy prove a powerful aphrodisiac.Convincing Fiona of his love is the hardest thing Robert has ever had to do. But when he thinks he’s won her heart, a devastating secret from his past surfaces. Will the promise of an uncertain future with Robert be enough to keep Fiona from filing divorce papers of her own?",
