  "description": "Rule one: Don't look at the demon.  When I arrived at my uncle's house, I expected my relatives to be like meâ€”outcast sorcerers who don't practice magic. I was right about the sorcery, but wrong about everything else.  Rule two: Don't listen to the demon.  My uncle chose a far deadlier power. He calls creatures of darkness into our world, binds them into service contracts, and sells them to the highest bidder. And I'm supposed to act like I don't know how illegal and dangerous it is.  Rule three: Don't talk to the demon.  All I had to do was keep my nose out of it. Pretend I didn't find the summoning circle in the basement. Pretend I didn't notice the shadowy being trapped inside it. Pretend I didn't break the rules.  But I did, and now it's too late.  -- From the author of The Guild Codex: Spellbound comes a new series that will plunge an unprepared young woman into the darkest magic of the mythic world.  -- THE GUILD CODEX: DEMONIZED Taming Demons for Beginners (#1) Slaying Monsters for the Feeble (#2)",
