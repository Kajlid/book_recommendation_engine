  "description": "Just when you think your path is set…Audrey Greenwood’s life has always moved in a vertical line: straight through school, straight towards a PhD, straight into cohabitation with her boyfriend, straight on the road to a professorship at a university. Up, up, up. Progress and success.Noah Boone’s path hasn’t been at all vertical. He’s a professional football player who’s lived in three countries in six years, trying to make it into the big leagues, trying to get his break. Nothing in his life has been neat and easy. He needs someone like Audrey to straighten him out, straighten him up so that he can make it onto the Woodsmen football team and unpack the boxes he’s been dragging around from one temporary address to the next. That’s how she ends up working for him, as his “fixer,” to get everything organized and settled.Even though other women seem to lose their minds (and bras) when they’re around Noah, nothing about him is attractive to Audrey. Nothing at all! Not his big, muscular body, not his terrible singing voice, and not how he smiles at her. No, she may work for him, but a professional relationship is all that she wants. For sure! And certainly, Noah feels the same way.Funny how a straight line can curve! When Audrey’s life veers far off-course, Noah is there for her just like she has been for him. It turns out that nothing is so set that a shift can’t change things—but maybe that shift is the best thing that could ever happen for both of them…",
