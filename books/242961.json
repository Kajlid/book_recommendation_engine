  "description": "The first, Lonesome Cowboy, tells the love story of Savannah Weston and Laredo Smith. Savannah lives a quiet life, keeping the ranch with her brother Grady. Both of them have been scarred by the betrayal of their brother Richard, who stole their inheritance six years ago after their parents' death. Savannah steps out of Grady's shadow when she meets Laredo Smith, a wrangler she hires to help with her old rose business. Her joy at their romance is clouded by Grady's suspicious attitude and Richard's sudden reappearance. In Texas Two-Step, Ellie Frasier, who runs the feed store after her father's death, has relied on her friends for support, including rancher Glen Patterson. When does he really start to notice her? Maybe when Savannah's brother, Richard, starts paying more attention. Glen gets the prize for what may be the jerkiest marriage proposal in fiction, but give him credit for finally figuring out the right approach. Readers will cheer for these two women as they start speaking up for themselves and building their own lives. Ginger Curwen",
