  "description": "Jack Reardon's homecoming isn't quite as peaceful as he hoped it would be . . .​Ten hours ago, Jack Reardon completed the messiest case of his career. Lucky to get through it with his life and a promotion, all he wants to do is catch up on missed sleep. Which won’t happen thanks to a bothersome house-invasion from assassin extraordinaire, Ethan Blade—who is also the reason he almost lost his life and job . . .This Coda for \"Where Death Meets the Devil\" follows immediately after the ending of the novel and is best read afterwards as it does contain spoilers.",
