  "description": "Trapped in rural Steeple Bumpleigh, a man less stalwart than Bertie Wooster would probably have given way at the knees. For among those present were Florence Craye, to who Bertie had once been engaged...and her new fiance 'Stilton' Cheesewright, who regarded Bertie as a snake in the grass...also Zenobia Hopwood and her guardian Lord Worplesdon, whose violent antipathy to 'Boko' Fittleworth amounted to obsession...and that biggest blot on the landscape, Edwin the Boy Scout, doing acts of kindness out of sheer malevolence. All Bertie's forebodings were fully justified. For in his efforts to oil the wheels of commerce, promote the course of true love, and avoid the consequences of a vendetta, he became the prey of all and sundry. Complete disaster was only avoided by the genius of Jeeves, who extricated the young master with a ploy as smoothly executed as it was brilliantly conceived.
