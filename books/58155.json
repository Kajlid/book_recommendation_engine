  "title": "Eve's Seed: Biology, the Sexes, and the Course of History",
  "description": "In this provocative reinterpretation of the human experience, Robert S. McElvaine has broken ranks with his fellow historians and answered the call made by E.O. Wilson in Consilience, that humanistic scholars must begin to draw upon the natural sciences in order to fully understand the human condition. Bridging the gap between evolutionary biology and cultural history, McElvaine has created what he calls a biohistory. He begins with the assertion, by no means accepted by most historians, that history must begin with an understanding of the evolutionary heritage we carried out of the Stone Age, and that the time before writing, usually dismissed by historians as prehistory, saw the development of forces that have shaped the entire course of human history.",
