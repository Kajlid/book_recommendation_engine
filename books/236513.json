  "description": "\"Beware false prophets in sheep clothes--they can be hungry wolves.\" (Lay Pastor Eddie Red Horse reading from Matt 7:15) An old silversmith's body is dumped along the highway and Legal Services Investigator Charlie Yazzie isn't content to stand by while the FBI and Tribal look for clues--not when he sees his friends Thomas Begay and Harley Ponyboy sucked into a tightening web of evil. When a beautiful stranger knocks on Harley's door the game changes...and so does Harley's loyalties. One thing is clear in this chilling new addition to Chappell's Navajo Nation Mystery Series--a spate of murders and an outlier with a deadly agenda--should be warning enough for anyone.",
