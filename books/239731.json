  "description": "A transatlantic comic journey of a long distance relationship made closer. She's from Portugal, he's from the United States. Art brought them together and love (and humor) stitched it all. Every page unfolds the story of how they met, and how they survived their long distance relationship. This volume includes extra pages and new characters never published before in the webcomic, and tips on how to keep a long distance relationship and to travel without stress. This book is NOT a work of fiction. Any similarities to actual persons, living or dead, are purely NOT coincidental.",
