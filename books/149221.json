  "description": "Times have been tough on Indigo, Texas. But now, as artists flock to the countryside in growing numbers, Indigo is experiencing a revival. In town to teach a workshop, herbalist China Bayles, like so many others, is committed to bringing Indigo back to life. Only one person stands in their way: longtime resident Casey Ford, who has decided to sell his profitable mining rights. Once the deal is done, Indigo will be dead and buried. But when Ford winds up dead himself, China, along with her best friend Ruby, quietly begin their own investigation to discover who is behind the murder. Before long, it becomes chillingly clear that this is a town with its share of dark secrets-secrets that someone thinks are worth killing to keep.",
