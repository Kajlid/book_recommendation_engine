  "title": "Ingathering: The Complete People Stories",
  "description": "Zenna Henderson is best remembered for her stories of the People which appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction from the early '50s to the mid-'70s. The People escaped the destruction of their home planet and crashed on Earth in the Southwest just before the turn of the century. Fully human in appearance, they possessed many extraordinary powers. Henderson's People stories tell of their struggles to fit in and to live their lives as ordinary people, unmolested by fearful and ignorant neighbors. The People are \"us at our best, as we hope to be, and where (with work and with luck) we may be in some future.\"Ingathering contains all seventeen of the People stories, including one, \"Michal Without,\" which has never before been published.",
