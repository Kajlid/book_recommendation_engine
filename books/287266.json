  "description": "Sometimes people come into a person’s life and make their heart skip a beat.Those people are called cops.Well, one cop in particular.A SWAT officer for the Kilgore Police Department, to be specific.The first time Avery Flynn saw Derek Roberts, she was photographing him for the first annual Kilgore Police Department SWAT calendar. He was leaned back in his squad car, shirtless, and giving her a smile that was completely between them. A smile that hinted at what he wanted to do to her later.When she scrounges up the courage to ask him out after the photoshoot, he laughs in her face.Well, screw you, too, Mr. February.***Derek Roberts never really paid attention to the photographer.She was a mousy girl who dressed like a twelve-year-old girl. Her tight leggings, extra baggy Star Trek t-shirt denoting her a Klingon captain, and her surprisingly clean Chucks didn’t leave much of an impression.Now, the outfit that she was in weeks after he rebuffed her? Yeah, now that caught his attention.Too bad that happens when he’s trying to save her from what’s sure to be death thanks to an unhinged native Texan who’s convinced she was the reason he lost his last chance at a million dollars.When he tries to save her, she tells him she’d rather take a cattle prod to the forehead than go anywhere with him.Challenge. Accepted.",
