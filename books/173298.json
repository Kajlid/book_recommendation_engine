  "description": "Art of 4 Elements Spiritual Poetry Book.Discover Alchemy through Poetry and Love through Alchemy.Four artists, a poet Nataša Pantović, a photographer Christine Cutajar, and two painters Jason Lu and Jeni Caruana, worked together to create The Art of Four Elements book with 120 art works and 120 poems. The poetry acted as an inspiration for the work of the artists: each one of them chose 40 poems and created the art work based on the theme and the ‘vibe' of the poems.The poetry, the photography, the drawings, you will find in the Art of 4 Elements book attempt to deeper explore the infinite game of Life, through the exploration of:Earth that is fixed, rigid, static and quiet, and symbolizes the world of senses;Water that is the primordial Chaos, is fluidity and flexibility, and symbolizes the world of emotions;Air that has no shape and is incapable of any fixed form. It is a symbol of thoughts.Fire that is boundless and invisible, and is a parching heat that consumes all, or within its highest manifestation, becomes the expression of Divine Love; andSpirit that stands at the center of the four elements as an Essence, an Observer, Consciousness coming forth to experience the magic of Life.",
