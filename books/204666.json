He sets off to find her and soon realizes that he has become involved in something much larger and more sinister than he had imagined. With his traveling companions—a wizard, an aspiring bard, a fairy prince, and a feisty young woman on a quest of her own—Collun must face dangers both natural and magical in order to complete his mission. “The author spins a dramatic tale, infused with Irish myth and folklore, that fantasy fans will relish.” — Booklist",
