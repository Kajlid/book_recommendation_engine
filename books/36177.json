The trouble really starts when one of her guests ends up dead. But that's not her only problem. A cop with an attitude – can he be trusted to be more than just a pain in her ass or does he have a more sinister agenda? A new Guest Services Manager, out for her job and ready to sacrifice anyone in his way – what does he really want?The attractive maintenance guy, endangering the promise she made out of necessity to the Goddess Athena – does he know more than he's telling? A mermaid diva, whose show at the Sparkling Butterfly must go on – or else. Pallas needs to find the killer, and fast, or she'll lose her job, her home, and the ragtag family she's adopted out of her crew of \"critters\". In the course of the investigation Pallas uncovers connections to a nasty Oddities dealer deep in the heart of Zombietown, forcing her to expose a trauma from her past which could threaten her future.With everyone and everything she loves in danger, the promise made to the Goddess Athena may well damn her if she breaks it, but she is bound and determined to save her friends, her home, and everything she's built. No matter what it takes.",
