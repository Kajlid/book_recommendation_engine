  "description": "Original Cover Edition for ASIN B00VWC2BIYKayla is about to commit pseudocide. She's met a couple of experts, and they've sold her on faking her death - wiping the slate clean, emerging a new person. But, she needs a witness. When Kayla begs, Sean gets roped in. I mean, nothing too serious: just lie about when he last saw her.  Except, things fall apart in a hurry. The police don't see an accident, they see murder - and Sean is their suspect. She's vanished, and he's facing prison.  His only hope is to chase Kayla's trail and reach out to the enigmatic strangers who make a life out of pretending to be dead. They call it enlightenment, but Sean calls it crazy. But at least they have a plan, even if the first step is to kill himself. Will Sean have the strength to take the plunge? And if he does, who will come out the other side?",
