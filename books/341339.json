  "description": "Amy Jannotti's debut chapbook, composed of 26 poems on channeling the dead and yearning for life\"Amy Jannotti’s An Angel is a Kind of Ghost is a long stare into the bathroom mirror from the perspective of the mirror. The poems alternate form to explore the body as it is dissected, the fashion and photography industries as they are made reality, and the scrutinizing gaze of men, God, and hell itself. She does all of this with winged-eyeliner precision and language as delicate and phantasmagoric as gossamer. Let these poems cast their entrancing spell on you.\" — Kailey Tedesco, author of She Used to be on a Milk Carton and Speak",
