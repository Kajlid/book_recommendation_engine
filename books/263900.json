  "description": "Because of Audrey Hepburn, I have foolishly…a) bought into the whole “Paris is always a good idea” thing without any offscreen evidence,b) uprooted my son and left my bittersweet memories behind,c) allowed Thomas—the handsome, caring, way-out-of-my-league vet—to disrupt the humdrum life I had self-prescribed for my Broken Heart Syndrome.Behind his easy smile and swoon-worthy pecs, Thomas conceals an open wound. No matter how hot his kisses or how genuine his affection, he’s still reeling. He can’t move on.And I can’t risk falling for him. I have a child to raise—a preteen boy who needs his mom to be all there. But as autumn strips the trees of their leaves, falling for Thomas is exactly what I do. Throwing caution to the wind, I dare to hope for a future with him……until the past comes knocking.Can we handle it or will it break us forever?Whether you're a fan of timeless movies like “Sabrina” or prefer steamy contemporary romance novels, “An Autumn in Paris” has something for you to love.Escape to Paris, and let this sweet, fun and sensual tale give you all the feels!",
