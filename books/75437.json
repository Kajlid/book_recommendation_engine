  "description": "Lily Towell has never been one to follow the rules. She has an unfortunate habit of disregarding anything that is considered proper and expected of a young lady, despite coming from a wealthy family in the late 19th century Great Britain. In fact, her preferred pastimes include daydreaming, not paying attention in her lessons, and making a game of manipulating her younger brother, Liam. Simply put, she leads a comfortable, albeit dull, life. But her life is thrown into turmoil when she has an unorthodox meeting with Jasper, a “homeless,” self-proclaimed sorcerer from a different dimension. Soon, Lily finds herself in a world very unlike her own, one that is fully equipped with creatures she thought—or rather, hoped—didn’t exist. As if the trauma of being in a place where humans aren’t at the top of the food chain isn’t enough, Lily has a bigger problem: Jasper, the red-headed, freckle-faced vagabond, is her key to getting home … assuming they can survive long enough for him to remember the way. Risin’ Sun is a dark fairytale full of magic and mischief, beauties and beasts—and just a touch of nonsense.",
