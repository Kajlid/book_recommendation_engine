  "description": "Jacob and Noah Ingledew trudge 600 miles from their native Tennessee to found Stay More, a small town nestled in a narrow valley that winds among the Arkansas Ozarks and into the reader's imagination. The Ingledew saga - which follows six generations of 'Stay Morons' through 140 years of abundant living and prodigal loving - is the heart of Harrington's novel. Praised as one of the year's ten best novels by the American Library Association when first published, this tale continues to captivate readers with its fusion of lyricism and comedy.",
