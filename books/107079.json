  "description": "What my readers say:Dekram can't help feeling like an outcast. She's the only mixed breed fairy running around her secluded home realm of Wandermere. She loves her parents, but part of her wishes she could just be like everyone else. That sentiment only intensifies when she begins overhearing strange conversations the adults seem to be having about her and her future. Something isn't quite right in Wandermere and Dekram seems to be at the center of it.Wandermere is anything but your typical fairy forest kingdom. You won't find any dainty, innocent, classical fairies sitting on toadstools petting baby bunnies. Instead, you'll stumble upon mouthy teen fairies wearing designer knockoffs and texting on their smart phones. It wasn't always like this, and the adults claim the reasons behind the change is to help them better deal with trips to the human world, but Dekram begins having doubts about what is real and who has been lying. ~~DelSheree Gladden, The Editable BookshelfStec's fairy world mirrors ours - teens carry cell phones, wear skinny jeans, have crushes, and deal with issues like prejudice, bullying, and drug abuse. Of course there's some fun-size twists - they drive dragonflies to school, get high on honey, and swear using Disney references. As usual, her characters are a blast, and her storyline has an intriguing twist. The Other F Word is funky, freaky, and fun. ~~Audra Middlton, Audra Writes",
