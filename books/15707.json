  "title": "Nigger: An Autobiography by Dick Gregory",
  "description": "Before Richard Pryor and Dave Chappel, Steve Harvey and Chris Rock, there was Dick Gregory. He was one of the first to use comedy as a tool to wake up people about the social and political ills that plague our society. In addition to being a comic, Gregory is also a Civil Rights and social activist (he marched with Dr. King), a weight-loss and nutrition guru, and entrepreneur. Nigger is his autobiography, which sold more than a million copies. This is the first time it's been made available in ebook format.",
