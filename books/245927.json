  "title": "Lipika",
  "description": "First published in 1922, Lipika has long been cherished by the Bengali people. Now Rabindranath Tagore's delightful collection of prose poems, vignettes and short stories is available to the wider world in a direct and clear translation in English. Tagore (1861-1941) amassed a vast body of work over his lifetime, featuring novels, essays, short stories, poems, paintings and dance-dramas, and is credited with reshaping Bengal's literature and music. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. Lipika features some of his finest and most communicative work, with a poetic power and story-telling that sits at the opposite end of the scale to epic, capturing the drama of the human journey in a perfect miniature. It is a perennial that will never lose its freshness.",
