  "description": "\"My favorite books are long ones that don't seem long because the pages melt away under the pace of the story and this was definitely one of those. We're seeing a lot of social criticism through literature these days, across all genres, and I think this book definitely contributes to that trend. Movie-wise, this kind of story never goes out of style. I see it as being sort of like the Hunger Games meets the Day After Tomorrow.\" -MCS Film Review Team“How fragile everything had been. People walked through life everyday taking it all for granted, their cars, their cell phones, their lattes, their dramatic social issues and their medical problems.”She had started her day at her home in the mountains just like any other.
