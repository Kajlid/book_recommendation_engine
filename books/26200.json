  "description": "Since these poems, written at the fairly constant rate of four or five a year since 1914, are offered to a public considerably larger than they reached in hard-cover form, I have omitted the more baffling or shocking ones. The order is roughly chronological.Messrs Cassell kindly allow me to make this selection from four volumes, all still available, where the remainder of my work appear: - Poems, 1914-1947 - Poems and Satires, 1951 - Poems, 1953 - The Crowning PrivilegeRobert Graves - from the Foreword",
