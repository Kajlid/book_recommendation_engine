  "description": "A crucial work for understanding a major turning point in Heidegger's thought. \"...an important addition to the translations of Heidegger's lecture-courses.\"--International Philosophical Quarterly\"The translators of these lectures have succeeded splendidly in giving readers an intimation of the tensely insistent tone of the original German. Heidegger's concern with a linguistic preconsciousness & with our entrancement before the enigma of existence remains intensely contemporary.\"--Choice\"There is much that is new and valuable in this book, & McNeill & Walker's faithful translation makes it very accessible.\"-- Review of Metaphysics\"Whoever thought that Heidegger...has no surprises left in him had better read this volume. If its rhetoric is 'hard & heavy' its thought is even harder & essentially more daring than Heideggerians ever imagined Heidegger could be.\"--David Farrell KrellFirst published in German in 1983 as volume 29/30 of Heidegger's collected works, The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics includes an extended treatment of the history of metaphysics & an elaboration of a philosophy of life & nature. Heidegger's concepts of organism, animal behavior & environment are uniquely developed & defined with intensity.William McNeill is Associate Professor of Philosophy at DePaul University. He is co-translator (with Julia Davis) of Holderlin's Hymn \"The Ister\" by Martin Heidegger. Nicholas Walker is Research Fellow in philosophy and literature at Magdalene College, Cambridge.Studies in Continental Thought: John Sallis, general editor",
