  "description": "Winter's here, and there's a carpet of deep snow covering the Green Forest and the nearby meadow — which means Reddy Fox and Granny Fox are having trouble finding food. Reddy, of course, is full of reckless ideas, such as getting into Farmer Brown's chicken house in daylight.Using the wisdom she's acquired over the years, Granny overrules many of Reddy's foolhardy suggestions, taking the conceit out of a youngster who thinks he knows more than anyone else. Granny also teaches Reddy quite a bit about patience, common sense, and resourcefulness.A timeless fable by master storyteller Thornton W. Burgess, Old Granny Fox will delight youngsters with an entertaining story while teaching important lessons — in a painless and enjoyable way — about wildlife, the environment, and personal conduct.",
