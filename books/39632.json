  "description": "When Kevin learns of his mountain town's evil past, he must struggle to understand his father's part in it and how it affects himself.\n\"The jail was a great refuge in June, but even in the winter, I found it pleasant to play in. There was so much fun imagining the structure when it was full, back in the gold rush. I could almost hear the walls and floors resounding to the voices of the thousands of lawless men that lived back then. In the large, empty vastness of our jail, I loved pretending I needed to find escape routes.One day after tromping through the halls for an hour, I found a locked door.Why is it shut tight? What is behind that door?\"",
