  "description": "When Freedom Came is a mosaic sequence about struggles and losses under aparthied laws. It is told through the lens of nine-year-old Mandisa and spans over three generations (hers, her mother, and her grandmother). Mandisa shares the deep yearning for freedom for blacks in South Africans. Mandisa takes us to the polls as she helps her 96-year-old grandmother vote for the first time during South Africa's first free election. It was the first time that blacks were allowed to participate in South Africa's election. Mandisa is overjoyed as she watches history being made; but more importantly, she was there, the day when freedom came to her people in South Africa.",
