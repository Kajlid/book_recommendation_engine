Upset that you're never \"the one?\" Too many duds and not enough studs? You are far from alone...TAMAR TREMAINE has gone on hundreds of first dates and chatted online with thousands of men over the last ten years. On a few occasions, she has even gone on as many as three dates in one day. (Not recommended.) According to Malcolm Gladwell, author of Outliers, it takes 10,000 hours and approximately ten years to become an expert. Tamar has easily spent 10,000 hours swiping, going on dates, and staring at her phone waiting for that cute guy to text her back. This book, however, is not \"Tamar Tremaine: Expert in Online Dating.\" This book is for you. Through a series of highly relatable short stories, Tamar reveals her crazy dating history. From in-person dating to online dating, to quarantine dating, Tamar inspires readers to keep trying, download that app, and go on that date. After all, there's usually a good story in the end!",
