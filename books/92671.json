  "description": "\"LeanRx: Results May Vary\" is a horrific and darkly satirical look into the United States' consumerism, greed, and political fairness vs. incorrectness through the eyes of a physically handicapped, homebound man during an outbreak of a once get-thin-fast super drug which turned into appetite boosting super virus. In a world where people are afraid of calling things as what they are in fear of being called politically unfair, can anyone survive the infectious disease causing famine, riots, theft, murder--even cannibalism?http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C...",
