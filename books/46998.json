  "title": "Dickens at Christmas",
  "description": "A selection of the best of Dickens' Christmas stories and writings in one beautiful hardback editionIt is said that Charles Dickens invented Christmas, and these pages certainly hold all the elements of a quintessential traditional Christmas brought to vivid life: snowy rooftops, gleaming shop windows, steaming bowls of punch, plum puddings like speckled cannon balls, sage and onion stuffing, miracles, magic, charity, and goodwill. This elegant collection gathers together not only Dickens' Christmas Books but also stories that Dickens wrote for the special seasonal editions of his periodicals All the Year Round and Household Words, and the hilarious festive episodes from The Pickwick Papers. A must-have for Christmas, this book is as necessary to seasonal festivities as holly, mistletoe, and silver bells.",
