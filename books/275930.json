  "description": "The best selling and most beloved food manga of all time!As part of the celebrations for its 100th anniversary, the publishers of the Tōzai News have commissioned the creation of the \"Ultimate Menu,\" a model meal embodying the pinnacle of Japanese cuisine. This all-important task has been entrusted to journalist Yamaoka Shirō, an inveterate cynic who possesses no initiative--but also an incredibly refined palate and an encyclopedic knowledge of food.Few foods inspire as much passion and partisanship as the dish of noodles in broth known as \"ramen.\" Hot or cold, plain or miso, from fancy fusion creations to humble roadside takeout, ramen is truly a beloved food, one that can give rise to fierce loyalty or fiercer criticism (not to mention the occasional fistfight). In this volume of Oishinbo , Yamaoka and company inquire into the \"soul of ramen,\" from the flour used in the noodles to the chickens used in the broth. And where there's ramen, there's gyô little dumplings made with a variety of fillings and served as a side dish. Will Yamaoka be able to create an \"ultimate\" gyôza before Kaibara creates a \"supreme\" one?",
