  "description": "Ynyr was a third male, and while he was a fit and worthy Warrior, he had always known that no female would ever Join with him. Too many looked down on his family because of his motherâ€™s refusal to leave his manno. He knew Ull would be able to overcome this because he was a first male and would one day be a Lord. Maybe even Vali, since he was a second male, but neither Ynyr nor his younger brother Zev would ever be acceptable to a female. The most they could hope for was to serve their House with honor... that all changed with the arrival of the females from Earth.Abby's life had not been an easy one, especially after the death of her family when she had been sixteen, but she had thought things were finally looking up.

Together they had to do something no other Lord and Lady had... They had to take a House that had been destroyed by deceit and evil and turn it into the shining example demanded by the Emperor.Will the secrets left behind by Bertos and Risa tear them apart? Or will it be Abby's secret and Ynyr's reaction to it that does?",
