  "description": "Enter the world of Silverfish, where a young man attempts to discover his identity amidst a world of increasing isolation and horror. His basement room is full of wires, rats, and silverfish. He doesn't know his name or where he came from, only that he is the caretaker in a house of drugs, sex, and mindless violence. The Caretaker finds himself in the middle of a horrible, slithering conspiracy that threatens all of humanity. He finds that he is its unwitting accomplice. Without it, he would not have a home. He enters a romance with Olwyn, a young woman ravaged by drugs and the menace of LaMore, the man who runs the house and supplies her drugs. Suddenly, she makes things less clear, a choice must be made. They will soon uncover a terrible secret which threatens all of humanity. With taut language and gritty description, readers will be wrapped tight by the tentacles in the story. This novella was inspired by the work of H.P. Lovecraft, Philip K. Dick, and Edgar Allen Poe. If you are a fan of Chuck Palahniuk, this is a good choice for you. This is literary fiction with an edge, language that'll bite you back.",
