  "description": "It's not always fun playing the after all, all you are is sword-fodder. But for the desperate, the misfit, the loner and the freak, dressing up in costume for the regular Saturday fantasy role-playing game in the woods is more satisfying than any reality. It's only make-believe, isn't it? It's not about life or death...or is it?Part of the Storycuts series, this short story was previously published in the collection Jigs & Reels.",
