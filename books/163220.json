  "description": "s promised, Book Two of The Children of Necropolis Series picks up where Book One left off—in complete chaos. Things just got real in Otherworld. The usually quiet world seems ready to explode. Fletcher Bell and his “warmblood” friends are quarantined inside the Luminous Academy. Mairen’s celebrity as the Storm Queen has spread like wildfire drawing unwanted, and dangerous, attention. Tory’s deal with the dark angel, Samyaza, sends her to Necropolis to steal for him. Owain’s self-doubt threatens finding their way home. Pimm Paisley is determined to escape the city to find her missing father with, or without, help. The Fallen are readying their first attack since the Great War. Spies, demons, and gnarled creatures lurk around every corner. Meanwhile back in Scotland, Fletcher’s father’s sanity hangs by a thread as he works to figure out the Sugar Cube House before a greedy estate developer’s bulldozers destroy the gateway to the Land of the Dead. Can he unlock the secrets of the machine before it’s too late, or will Fletcher and friends stay trapped in the OW forever? Can Fletcher overcome his fears to become the leader some think him? Will the next war begin before the Living and Dead complete their quests? Or will the fate of all worlds be sealed when three armies meet in the Valley of Dry Bones?",
