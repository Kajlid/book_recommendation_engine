His Irish grandfather was a member of the IRA who was interned with his comrades by the British. His other grandfather, from the Turkish Christian minority, was jailed by the British in Palestine. An illustrative, riveting narrative of politics, murder, and espionage set during World War II, this is also a personal exploration of the ties and limits of kinship.",
