  "description": "2121, the world in which the populations of the five continents evolve has become chaotic and unlivable. Since G20 countries leaders have been condemned for genocide, New Vision established a new world order in 2080 and masters time travel since 2105. One of its most brilliant members, Kazuhiko Ken has developed a blank page project, a rewrite from scratch of the world as we know it by choosing to annihilate from the history of humanity, some events which would have, if they had not existed, avoided humanityâ€™s decline. Members of New Vision are therefore recruited across continents and eras to return to the past and annihilate Six distinct events in the history of humanity and ensure that Seven parallel worlds, six alternate realities are created.",
