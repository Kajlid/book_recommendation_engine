  "description": "The Ryans won’t be found in any history books—but their lives, conducted on the fringes of polite society, were desperate and uncompromising in the face of limited options. The Beaten Territory finds Annie Ryan running a second-rate brothel in 1890s Denver. When her young niece arrives, she is swept up in a world of booze, drugs and vice. Pearl becomes a pawn of underworld tensions between her aunt, a corrupt cop, and a successful and clever woman addicted to laudanum. The resulting tragedy attested that justice was not always served as Denver struggled to shed its rough and ready image.",
