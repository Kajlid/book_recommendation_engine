  "description": "Dr. Steven Grant, Columbia University professor of political science and special assistant to the UN Secretary-General, is recruited by the CIA to identify a terrorist cell formed inside the United Nations. Still recovering from the death of his wife a year ago, Grant hopes this new adventure will spring him from the deep depression he's suffered. When an undercover Mossad agent posing as an Arabic aide at the UN discovers the terrorists' plan, Grant knows he's got to put everything he has into this mission. The terrorists want to explode bombs at a Iranian facility storing three fully developed nuclear warheads and then blame Israel, thus forcing Iran to retaliate using their secret nuclear weapons. Grants teams with an alluring female psychologist to track down the terrorists. Unfortunately, the terrorist organization wants to eliminate them both. In his frantic search to find and stop the radicals before they launch their planned attack and start a nuclear war, Grant faces Iraqi insurgents, Hamas militants, and Egyptian Secret Police from New York to the Middle East. Just as alarming to him, though, is that he must also face the very real possibility that he's falling in love.",
