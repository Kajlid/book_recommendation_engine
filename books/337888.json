  "description": "My cocky next-door neighbor is the most infuriating person in the world--so why did I just hookup with him?Although we pretty much grew up together, we've never managed to get along.I guess he's good-looking, with his perfect hair, amazing hockey-player physique, and boyish smile... if you're into that.Which I’m totally not.Our moms are besties, and they’ve been planning our engagement since we were little kids. I'm *so* over it...He’s an arrogant athlete that goes through girls like Kleenex, and his teammates joke that he’s incapable of a relationship.My roommate comes up with the perfect plan: fake date each other to get our parents and his team off our backs.I guess we do have something in common: wanting to prove everyone else wrong.Now everyone is talking about my post-game congratulatory kiss instead of his game-winning goal.We're fooling everyone on campus plus our families, and I gotta say, I don't hate it.Turns out the hardest part isn’t faking feelings for him...It’s trying to hide my true ones.",
