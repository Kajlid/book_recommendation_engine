  "title": "A Drakenfall Christmas",
  "description": "In the spring, Mark and Maisy fell in love in the story \"Upstairs, Downstairs … and the Lift in Between.\" Months later, the magic of Drakenfall is still in the air, and spiced with cinnamon and mistletoe as Mark and Maisy welcome guests and get involved in kerfuffles with staff as they celebrate their first Drakenfall Christmas together.  In an uncharacteristic turn, unflappable house manager Glynis Ferry seems to be getting her duster ruffled every time she catches sight of Shaun Fletcher, the new head groomsman. And Pippa Taylor, a whirling dervish of a domestic, works below stairs to make the magic happen for everyone else, but will there ever be enough magic left over for her? There will if most worthy valet Kafi Cholo has anything to say about it, as he tries to spin holiday magic every which way. But his best laid plans always seem to go awry, even with Maisy helping out as his faithful sidekick.  But what about his grandest of schemes, set to take flight at the Drakenfall Christmas Ball? He's depending on guest Jamie Tovell, who's depending on guest Lea Sinclair. And even if everything goes off without a hitch, will the secret Maisy's been hiding from Mark all season pop up at the most inopportune moment to set everything asunder? It's a Drakenfall Christmas … topsy turvy, but generously sprinkled with laughter and lavishly frosted with romance.",
