  "title": "Management by Murder",
  "description": "Dan Trix, management consultant, accepts a job reviewing a research institute at a small Midwestern university. When the (closeted gay) president of the university is found dead in his office, the CEO of the Board of Trustees enlists Trix to quietly and quickly determine the death was a suicide, not murder. Trix soon discovers there are many in the university community who are not displeased that President Kieper is dead. All this occurs in a university that is financially healthy not from student tuition, but from a research institute that generates suspiciously little output. When Trix becomes smitten with Elaine Newman, the presidentas administrative assistant, his analytical skills and emotional stability are challenged, and his life is endangered as he seeks resolution to not only the universityas problem, but also his own.",
