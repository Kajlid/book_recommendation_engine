  "description": "“We were only five when the gods looked at us in fear.” Fenrir is speaking of him and his siblings. As the children of the trickster Loki, they have good reason to be feared. However, this is not the reason the gods of Asgard fear them. Fenrir, Jormungand, and Hél are some of the few shapeshifters in Norse Mythology. Fenrir has the ability to shapeshift into a great wolf and is capable of taking on even Asgard’s mighty gods. This is Fenrir’s story of his time in Asgard. His journey takes him from Valhalla, the great hall of Odin, to the depths of the Underworld, all the while facing triumph and tragedy and uncovering the mysteries of the Norse mythological world. Join Fenrir in his tale of adventure, conflict, and heartache as he is forced to live amongst the gods of Asgard. Exile of Fenrir is an original work rooted within the world of Norse Mythology. In this novel, Fenrir takes part and witnesses some of the mythological tales that were told by our real world’s Vikings.",
