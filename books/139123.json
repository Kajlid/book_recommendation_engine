  "title": "The Overending",
  "description": "For untold ages, the Granite Hulks at Tilk Duraow have been the impregnable center of the High One's slaving system. Overpowering. Impenetrable. Final. The point from which there is no return. But now, fifteen-year-old Helga's revolution--one she hardly expected to begin--is way bigger than she ever dreamed. Tilk Duraow itself is in danger. Unexpectedly finding common cause with a troupe of oddball characters, Helga and old comrades are reunited in a chain of events that portends the Overending. Now even the High One himself is no longer safe. The Overending opens a crack...  Rick Johnson's slightly skewed reality brings readers another mind-bending, genre-busting adventure. Fantastic and quirky, exhilarating and addicting, this entertaining adventure takes readers on a wild ride that they will never want to end. Ridiculous, but deadly serious. Hits you hard in the funnies, while turning your mind inside out.",
