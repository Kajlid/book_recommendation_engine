  "description": "Sometimes old flames burn the brightestFunny, sophisticated, and wise, this heartfelt book is a coming-of-middle-age story about girlfriends when you are no longer a girl, growing up when you are already grown, and the price you are willing to pay for love. Jillian Hunter treasures her independence. She has raised two sons by herself, launched a small business, and restored a tumbledown beach cottage in Connecticut. But when a trip to London reunites her with Colin-an old flame she hasn't seen in 35 years-Jill falls for him all over again. But love makes Jill reckless and Colin isn't quite the boy she remembers. She ends up risking everything she's worked for-her business, her home, and her two closest friends-to make a life with him. And when she's faced with the risk of losing Colin as well, Jill is forced to take an uncomfortably close look at the woman she?s allowed herself to become.",
