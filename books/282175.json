  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN: B082FRWFGBMy fate is in the dark, And my shadow there is real…  The darkness likes to play in this world.  It also likes to deceive.  In the Enchanted Forest, secrets thrive and one girl desperately needs to find answers before it’s too late.  That girl is Corvina Charles, a powerful Shadowborn—a human who touched dark magic and became something else.  Something dangerous.   At the age of eighteen, Corvina and her best friend are swept away to the Shadowborn Academy, the one place where magic and darkness coincide.  It’s also where pupils go missing, teachers don’t play by any rules, the therapist is hot, and boys with dark magic love to seduce your soul.  With death becoming a game at the academy that not even the Dark or Light Fae seem capable of winning, my love life should really be the last thing on my mind…especially when one of the boys just so happens to be my teacher!  Shadowborn Academy is a Dark Reverse Harem Paranormal Fae Romance for 18+. In this world, not even the shadows can be trusted…",
