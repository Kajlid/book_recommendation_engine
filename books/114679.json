  "description": "They say writing is therapeutic. How therapeutic can it be when you are picked on, beat up, and ostracized day in and day out for as far back as you can remember?Peter Rubin, an overweight tenth-grader, starts a journal to write down his thoughts. Through his very personal and lifelike entries the reader gains an understanding of his life. But something is wrong. Many of the entries are written on (\"PETER RUBIN IS A LOSER!\" \"FATASS!\" \"JELLY ROLLS!\"), some of them are ripped, there are even horrible pictures scrawled over his most private thoughts. Will the beautiful new girl at school who sits in front of him think he's a loser, too? Will Tommy Boots and John, his only two friends, stand by his side? And will the horrible teens who he calls \"The Clan,\" a group who has dedicated their time to making Peter's life a living hell, get what they deserve? Â The Journal of Peter Rubin can be viewed as an exciting and emotional work of fiction, or it can be viewed as an in-depth psychological study on how teens who are bullied react, consider suicide, and try to survive the horrible abuse they endure everyday at school. The choice is yours. Open Peter's journal. Take a look at his private thoughts. But be respectful. ***Educators and schools will receive discounts on bulk orders of paperback copies.
