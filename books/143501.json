Mortally wounded, he’s carried downriver to a witch who has the power to heal not just his body, but awaken wicked desires he’d thought long dead. First, he’ll have to forgive her for binding her to him against his will with a kiss that would not only change the course of their destiny, but that of the entire world. She needs his protection… All Druid Princess, Morgana de Moray, knows is the angry Nordic berserker she pulled from the river is the only man who can free her from Saxon captivity and get her back to the Highlands. A dark evil threatens her home, and she must gain back Bael’s broken trust if she is to make it in time. Morgana is left with no choice but to strike a deadly bargain with the dangerous warrior, and risk all to unleash the beast from within the man without losing her heart, or her life. Join the de Moray Druids as they each find a love that will be worth defying the forces of evil and risking their souls to save our world.",
