  "description": "Curvy news reporter Frankie Alexander had heard all the warnings about life in New York City, but unfortunately, her parents left out the one about avoiding sexy, infuriating vampires. It’s too late now…she’s craving blood, sizzling when sunlight touches her, and yearning for the kisses of Nicholas Hamilton, the sexiest 300-year-old she’s ever seen.  The good news: she’ll never die, as long as she can avoid sunlight, stakes, and silver. Also, Nicholas wants to claim her as his Eternal Consort, and vampire sex is multi-orgasmic and beyond hot. The bad news: her Turning was illegal, and not only that, she’s a weird super-freak of a vampire, with powers so great that the Old Ones are considering issuing a Kill On Sight order. Her only hope of survival is to solve the mystery of her Turning. To do that, she’ll have to rely on her rag-tag group of friends and on Nicholas…but it’s heartbreakingly clear that she can never trust him, because he’s got a hidden agenda all his own.",
