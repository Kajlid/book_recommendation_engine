  "description": "Okay. Fine. Amy Holt swore on air. Surely that doesn’t make her an inept radio host. Either way, she’s desperate for work; and if she doesn’t find something soon, it’s back to Australia. When the job of her dreamish nightmares presents itself, Amy jumps at the opportunity, surprised to hear that the station is built on a wormhole, opening it up to infinite realms. Interviewing Bigfoot and her doppelganger aren’t that problematic. Working for her sister’s ex-boyfriend though, is a whole other matter. He’s ridiculously charismatic. And good looking. Poor bugger is missing a six-pack, though. Suddenly, travelling through an apocalyptic wasteland and mollifying racist Bigfeet doesn’t seem so hard. Trying to avoid Ryan’s charm, though? Yeah, that wasn’t in the job description.",
