  "description": "Successful engineering executive, Jack Rothman thought he was finally free to be the Dom he was meant to become. His submissives, Rory Campbell and Spencer Hartley are soon to be married, and his place as their Dominant is unshakable. Then Jack loses the one thing a Dom requires…control over his life.  Rory can’t wait to get married but she can’t marry both of her men—not in the eyes of the law or her overbearing, critical parents. She must find the courage to tell her parents the truth about her poly relationship, despite the sudden absence of her Dominant’s strength. If she wants the happily-ever-after wedding she’s always dreamed of, she’ll have to learn to fight for it on her own.  Spencer knows that lies are a poison that destroys from within. Now that he’s come to terms with his bisexuality, he’s ready to settle down with the woman he loves and the man he can’t live without. Only the future that seemed so bright is in danger of being swept out of his hands. He’s watching his fiancée fall apart, his Dom fade away and there’s nothing he can do about it…or is there?",
