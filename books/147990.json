  "description": "Knight wanted. Must have shiny armor and own horse, preferably white.When it comes to romance, are magic, fireworks, and a dashing knight in shining Armani really too much to ask? Apparently so, since Kate Hetherington has yet to find an appropriate mate in all of London. Her lifelong friends (and confirmed pragmatists) Sally and Tom tease her endlessly about her hopeless romanticism. But Kate knows that she’s right to want her own fairy tale.After stumbling upon an old tome titled The Hopeless Romantic’s Handbook, Kate decides to give its advice a whirl. Incredibly, the book lives up to its money-back guarantee, because before Kate can say “Cinderella” she meets Joe Rogers, a drop-dead-gorgeous American actor. Frankly, he’s perfect–and Kate thinks she might have finally found The One. He certainly has the muscles required to sweep her off her feet. But Sal and Tom are less thrilled with Kate’s dreamboat. Are they just jealous, or do they know something about love that isn’t in Kate’s handbook? Kate’s pretty sure that finding true love isn’t supposed to alienate you from your friends, but what she doesn’t know is that her real knight is still waiting for her–and he’s closer than she ever imagined.",
