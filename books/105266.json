  "title": "Waking the Frog: Solutions for Our Climate Change Paralysis",
  "description": "An accessible discussion of ways to achieve a sustainable future In a highly readable account, venture capitalist, entrepreneur, engineer, and philosopher Tom Rand looks to contemporary psychology, economics, business, and finance to explain our stasis in the face of one of the most fundamental problems of our why climate disruption might just be our very own pot of hot water and we, the frog, paralyzed in our inaction. But his account doesn’t just point fingers at the bad guys, it goes deeper ― to our motivations, institutional lethargy, and deeply buried assumptions about market economics. Waking the Frog is as much about solutions as it is an account of our present paralysis. Our ingenuity, technology, capital, and policy can work together to turn down the heat and simultaneously enable the largest economic opportunity of the 21st century.",
