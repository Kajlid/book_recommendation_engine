  "title": "Escape To Fort Abercrombie",
  "description": "When fourteen-year-old Ryker Landstad discovers his father dying from an arrow wound and his mother and sister missing, he knows the Sioux are on the warpath. Danger is everywhere. Ryker promises to find and rescue Mama and Elsa. He promises to get his nine-year-old twin siblings to safety. It's risky to cut across country to Fort Abercrombie through ten miles of prairie grass taller than a grown man, but even riskier to travel the main trails in plain sight of the Indians. But Ryker has to find a way to get the twins into the fort and find Mama. Papa said to find her before the new baby is born. It takes all Ryker's gumption, and a little help from angels, to reach the fort, only to discover that Fort Abercrombie is besieged by 500 warriors. Ryker refuses to give up. He has no choice. He made a promise.",
