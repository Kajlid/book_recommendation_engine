  "description": "The books in this collection tell the stories of six American girls who lived long ago: \n   Felicity, a spunky, spritely colonial girl, full of energy and independence  \n   Josefina, an Hispanic girl whose heart and hopes are as big as the New Mexico sky  \n   Kirsten, a pioneer girl of strength and spirit who settles on the frontier  \n   Addy, a courageous girl determined to be free in the midst of the Civil War  \n   Samantha, a bright Victorian beauty, an orphan raised by her wealthy grandmother  \n   Molly, who schemes and dreams on the home front during World War Two  \n You can share their worlds - their friends and families, their struggles and successes, their sad times and celebrations, their secrets and adventures. You'll see that some things about growing up have changed, while others - like families, friendships, and feelings - haven't changed at all. These are the important things that American girls will always share. They come alive for you in the American Girls Collection.",
