  "description": "He wants to be all her firsts . . . What do a cynical former Marine and a sheltered former Olympic contender have in common? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. He has a girlfriend and she’s never been kissed. He’s sullenly sarcastic and she’s earnestly empathetic. He can’t stop thinking about her. She knows she should keep her distance. Nevertheless, when opposites attract, the results may be unexpected, but they’re also undeniably magnetic.  Ninja at First Sight is book #4.75 in the Knitting in the City series. It is a standalone, contemporary romantic comedy prequel novella (40k words) to ‘Happily Ever Ninja’ book #5 in the Knitting in the City series.",
