  "description": "Gusty Lovers and Cadavers Book 2 of the Raina Sun Mystery series. Graduate student Raina Sun thought she knew what she was getting herself into when she volunteered to take the new foreign-exchange student shopping on the last weekend before Christmas. But between a riot for the last hot toy of the season and an abandoned baby, the holiday is a season for mayhem, and sometimes it doesn’t pay to be a Good Samaritan. Raina wants to re-unite the infant with his family, but calling the mysterious phone number in the diaper bag leads to more questions than answers. A strange man claims to be the child’s father, and his alleged mother turns up dead. The local police are more interested in keeping the town’s good name out of international news than to consider if there’s foul play. And to make matters worse, she has less than a week to find his real parents before the FBI takes over the case. Raina summons her sleuthing skills to protect this baby and soon discovers everyone has a few skeletons in their closets. With her pimp-cane-toting grandma, she faces an ex-boyfriend bringing sexy back, and a murderer determined to hide the truth. For readers who like fun cozy mysteries, quirky characters, and a dash of humor.",
