  "description": "As true today as it has been for all of human history, one fundamental question plagues mankind:In the midst of ancient hostilities and recent atrocities, which choice is the most honorable, the most moral one: justice or mercy? This novel offers an answer. Regarding Tiberius is the novelization of a series of ancient scrolls recently discovered in the ruins of famed Roman commander Scipio Africanus' seaside villa (near Naples, Italy). Written in the First Century by a young woman of Persian and Ethiopian ancestry, Helena Mithridates Kleopatra, they comprise an account of how her life and destiny were forever altered by her chance meeting with Tiberius, the son of a prominent Roman senator. The pair embark on an odyssey that takes them from Asia Minor to Syria and Palestine. His goal is to rise to the upper echelon of Roman military leadership at any cost, hers to find and assassinate Cato, the commander who gave the order to slaughter the entire population of Eupatoria, her ancestral home. Their aspirations lead them to Jerusalem where both of their quests meet bloody, final resolutions.",
