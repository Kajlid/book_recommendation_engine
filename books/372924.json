  "title": "Frazz: Live at Bryson Elementary",
  "description": "One of the last places you'd expect to find fun is in an elementary-school janitor's cleaning closet. Creator Jef Mallett has given life to Renaissance janitor Edwin Frazier, better known as \"Frazz,\" who took the job at Bryson Elementary School as a struggling songwriter. He then surprised everyone by sticking around after selling his first hit song; the school will never be the same. Frazz has a diverse cast of charming characters including eight-year-old budding genius Caulfield. He's a constant thorn in the side of bitter and burned-out third-grade teacher Mrs. Olsen, who still remembers having Frazz in her class more than 20 years ago. Caulfield needs Frazz to challenge him as he remarks, \"School would be OK if it didn't interfere so much with my education.\" Hilariously naive Principal Spaetzle wants to be like Frazz. First-grade teacher (and first-rate babe!) Miss Plainwell is getting to know him better. And the kids at Bryson Elementary can't get enough of him! Live from Bryson Elementary is the first Frazz collection and will leave fans begging for more",
