  "title": "The Rise of a King",
  "description": "The second book in the Fallen Angel, Immortal Romance Series takes us from the Arcades and the kingdom of dark angels to The Cirque, a fairy realm where Farrow's brother Prince Drayden rules. Born half fairy and half-fallen angel, Drayden possesses both goodness and evil.  After being told by the Gods of Estancia that Farrow can't keep Rayelynn in the Arcades, he risks losing the only being he has ever loved to keep her safe. By leaving Rayelynn in the Cirque with Drayden, Farrow fears she will be enticed by the fairy life she deserves and the brother who has already professed his desire to claim her for himself.  Drayden is a gracious host to the sweet and powerful fairy-mortal halfling who is carrying his brother's children...but will risk his very soul to have her.  As Farrow becomes king of the Arcades, he works to prove to the gods he's worthy of Rayelynn's goodness and love, while Drayden falls deeper into a darkness that will destroy them all.  The Rise of a King is the second book in a trilogy. It has some dark themes and sexual situations that involve many polyamorous characters...who are immortal, slightly wicked, loving and oh so much fun. I recommend reading The Fall of Arcades before this book.",
