  "title": "The Average American Marriage",
  "description": "The Average American Marriage , the long-awaited sequel to Chad Kultgenâ€™s much debated, always controversial The Average American Male , is a matter-of-fact foray into the male mind and sexual fantasy. Now married with children, Kultgen's lewd and sex-obsessed narrator once again offers up his deep (and not so deep) thoughts on love, marriage, kids, and (naturally) from birthday sex to interns to parenting, The Average American Male looks upon the institution of marriage with the same deadpan smirk he has brought to the rest of his sex-addled, perennially disaffected life.",
