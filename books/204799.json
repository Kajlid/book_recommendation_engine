  "description": "a space pirate’s dream when it comes to booty, but not a good place to hide when bounty hunters come looking. Pulling up stakes means Rafe must leave his vintage trailer behind, but in the process he acquires a passenger a mouthy female who seems to think she’s calling the shots.  She’ll soon learn who’s the captain. And it isn’t Annabelle, his sassy ship.  A true red-blooded male, Rafe does his best to teach Emma her place in the universe, but her human attitude gets in the way. So why doesn’t he sell her when he gets the chance?  Damned if he knows, but despite his motto of 'The Universe Revolves Around Me', he finds himself putting his life in peril to save hers. But that doesn’t mean he’s letting her in on all his secrets. Some things a man has to carry alone, and some revelations a pirate will kill to keep.  The universe might be out to get him, but he’s not giving in without a fight.",
