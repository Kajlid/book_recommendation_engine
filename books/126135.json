  "title": "The Story of a New Name",
  "description": "The Story of a New Name is an extraordinary novel about two young women, Lila and Elena, growing up in Naples in the early 1960s.  At sixteen Lila marries the shopkeeper Stefano. She is filled with pleasure at her new wealth, and horror at the life she has chosen. Elena's own attempts at romance seem to be sabotaged by Lila's turbulent affairs. As she tries to plot her way out of poverty via academic and literary success, her constant anxiety is that she is just a shadow of the brilliant Lila.  The sequel to My Brilliant Friend, The Story of a New Name continues the enthralling chronicle of a friendship that is obsessive, loving, complicated, hurtful, enduring and constantly startling. It is an exhilarating reading experience. Elena Ferrante was born in Naples. She is the author of four other novels: The Days of Abandonment, Troubling Love, The Lost Daughter and My Brilliant Friend. She is one of Italy's most acclaimed authors. Ann Goldstein has translated Elena Ferrante's earlier novels. She is an editor at the New Yorker and a recipient of the PEN Renato Poggioli Translation Award.",
