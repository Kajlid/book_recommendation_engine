Except that every time she met Jay's deep blue eyes, she knew he wanted her. And she wanted him—the guy was seriously sexy! Perhaps it was time to let go for a change, and have the time of her life!Their intensely private and secret night together is mind-blowing, but now Jay has raised the stakes—he wants her as his mistress!",
