  "description": "Snippets of a forgotten past were returning to Nyssa Laszlo, along with the power to project her mind. Each projection thrust her into a glowing still life of color and time, and her every step led deeper into undiscovered country. Things were changing and dangerously so. She was learning who she was-- whether she wanted to or not. She was also learning dark things were on the rise. From the Unseelie faerie court to Abrial, the dauntless dreamwalker who pursued her, the curtain was going up on a stage Nyssa had never seen and a cast she couldn't imagine-- and it was the final act of a play for her heart and soul.",
