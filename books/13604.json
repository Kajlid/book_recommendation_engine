The same stranger that stared at her earlier with an intensity that rippled through her like a summer storm. Charlotte is definitely interested, until she learns more. Fact: Alex Andros is a brilliant attorney with one client — the alleged head of Boston ’s rackets. Gossip: He’s the racketeer’s lover. Curious, Charlotte accepts his offer of a drink and is captivated by his raw sex appeal. How could this seductively masculine man be gay?Alex knows the rumors and couldn’t care less. His sexual persuasion is no one’s business. He’s sworn off relationships, but Charlotte's allure is too strong; it mirrors the chemistry Alex experienced with the man who changed the way he loved. Charlotte ’s old boyfriend is determined to “out” Alex to win her back. But when Alex’s old lover shows up after seventeen years, he must confess his secret to prove he’s worthy of Charlotte ’s trust, or risk losing her forever.Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: male/male sexual content, violence.",
