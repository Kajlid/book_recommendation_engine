And modern society is pretty much gone, thanks to an EMP that destroyed the technological infrastructure of the United States. Surviving in the foothills of California is a challenge, but with the help of former Navy SEAL Chris Young, Cassidy's been able to stay alive. Until now.

Taken by soldiers and forced into a labor camp, Cassidy must turn the tables on her captors. Escape means everything. Unfortunately, staying out of Omega's crosshairs is easier said than done. You can run. But you can't hide. Cassidy's about to learn that the hard way. _ _ _ State of Chaos is the sequel to the national bestseller State of Emergency, a YA/NA Contemporary Romantic Adventure.",
