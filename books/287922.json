  "title": "IQ Means Inequality: The Population Cycle that Drives Human History",
  "description": "The exploitation of fossil fuels such as coal, oil or natural gas enabled the emergence of today's global industrial society. Cheap energy has led to an unprecedented increase in population to this day. Nevertheless, the democratic mass society of the West, which produced the welfare state, is in the process of destroying itself again. One reason for this is that the parties fighting for majorities are outdoing each other in promises and overindebted the state. The actual reasons for this self-destruction, however, lie deeper: while in the ascendant phase of Western societies entrepreneurial forces predominated, since about 1970 the striving for equality has dominated public debate. Today, not only are inherited differences in intelligence denied, but false incentives are used to discourage the high-performing and encourage the low-performing. As a result, industrial societies are often no longer able to provide a sufficient number of qualified young people, making their decline inevitable.At the same time, the cost of energy, the indispensable fuel of industrial society, is constantly rising. In many places there is a lack of creative potential to counteract the emerging chaotic conditions that threaten to arise as a result of this development. All these developments, so the central thesis of this book, must be seen in the context of their interactions: they are the expression of a lawful regulatory cycle that drives industrial society into a permanent crisis, which is accelerating intermittently and inexorably.",
