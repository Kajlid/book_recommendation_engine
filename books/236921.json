  "description": "Dire straights.  Rock bottom.  Out of options.  It's where we were. My pack and I.  A simple bargain.  A childhood crush.  Could it work? In a world of fated mates how would we possibly fake it for everyone?  Luca made it all sound so easy. My heart, body, and wolf were on board. I just needed to convince my head.  I couldn't deny the alpha he was or the chemistry between us. Only time could tell if it would be for eternity.  A not so simple bargain changed it all.",
