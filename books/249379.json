Happily Ever Alpha, a new Kindle World, will debut April 3, 2018.BrandonAnytime I heard someone speak of the boom, I laughed. Surely only crazy people believe they can fall in love as soon as they lay eyes on someone. I thought it was all in their heads until the moment she walked into my office asking for a job. The instant my gaze locked with hers, I knew she was mine, and I would do anything in my power to protect her.ArouraI never thought I would be applying for a job at a strip club, yet there I was. When the stunning owner offered me a job, I thought taking off my clothes would be the most nerve wracking thing. When I walked in the next morning, I found out I wouldn’t be stripping, I’d be working side by side with him. It doesn’t make sense for a man like him to desire a woman like me—a woman with baggage and a past. One phone call changes everything and I’m forced to realize that until Brandon, I might have had it hard, but with him I will have it all.",
