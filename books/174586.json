  "description": "Patricia Anne can’t imagine why Mary Alice is in such an uproar over her boy marrying sweet little Sunshine Dabbs. Ray found the Barbie doll lookalike on a trip to Bora Bora and Mary Alice is sure her new daughter-in-law is just after Ray’s money. The marriage is a done deal, but it’s only proper to pay a call on the family and see how bad things really are.The sisters bump down a dirt road to the family’s trailer park compound, weave their way through a landmine of junk, washing machines, and attack dogs, and follow Sunshine’s grandmother, matriarch Meemaw into her cozy trailer. But when the sisters fall over a body on the floor—with Meemaw’s best hog butchering knife in his chest—Meemaw is just shocked to pieces and things get a bit hectic. And, once again, the sisters are right in the thick of a cockeyed world of strange and bizarre events, helping out the good-old-boy sheriff who hasn’t got a clue…unless the sisters put their heads together and point his nose in the right direction.",
