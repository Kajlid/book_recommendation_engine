  "description": "Ex-members of the military tell their stories in this full-color comic from 1991, and still frighteningly relevant today. This issue was published in conjunction with Citizen Soldier, a non-profit GI and veterans' organization dedicated to the principle that the US military should respect the civil and human rights of its members. The comic focuses on brutality and abuses within the US military; hazing, reckless training, needless exposure to hazardous materials, abandonment of veterans, deceptive recruitment practices, the military's lack of accountability, and more.",
