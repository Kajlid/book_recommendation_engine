  "description": "When the radical revolutionaries of the Social Party prevent his attendance at university and make his life on New Chicago impossible, Nikolai Rovio has no choice but to accept his starship-bound uncle's offer to take refuge in space and sign on as a technical apprentice with Starways. But space, he quickly learns, is full of dangers that can kill a young man just as dead as even the most bloodthirsty revolutionary.And no place that Man can travel can ever truly serve as a safe refuge from ambitious and evil-minded men.Rod Walker is the New New Heinlein, and Mutiny in Space marks a first step in the return of science fiction to its classical form and historical heights. Written in the style and tradition of Robert Heinlein's 12 classic juvenile novels published by Scribner, Mutiny in Space is an exciting tale of space, technology, courage, independence, and the indomitable spirit of Man.",
