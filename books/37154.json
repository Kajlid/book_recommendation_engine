  "description": "Set in the bohemian artistic world of Edwardian England, Jessica Stirling's new novel reaches a thrilling and romantic climax as the Titanic sails for New York  At first, handsome, freewheeling Clive Cavendish does not appear to be an ideal catch for Julie, but when a whirlwind seduction leads to love and marriage, and Clive's ambitious schemes begin to pay off, Julie is more than happy to be the wife of an up-and-coming painter and the mother of his children. Anna's suitor, Howard Buskin, is rich, moody, and reclusive. He prefers painting Dartmoor's brooding landscape to courting the beautiful young woman his mother has chosen to be his bride, and from the first their uneasy, loveless marriage totters on the brink of crisis. Only when American art collector Teddy Norris enters their lives with a proposal that Howard cannot ignore and an easygoing charm that sweeps Anna into a tempestuous affair, do the sisters begin to question their loyalty to their husbands and to each other—a loyalty that will be tested to the limit on the first, and last, Atlantic crossing of the White Star's new superliner, the unsinkable Titanic , a voyage that not all of them will survive.",
