  "description": "19-year-old Emily desperately wants a name for what she is. For what is consuming and torturing her. For what is changing her.  But she’s not crazy like her mother. She’s not.  Emily may not be as crazy as she thinks, because her body is no longer her own. Something is stirring inside her. It is soft, seductive, and tells her what to do to survive. As Emily learns that her world has been infected by demons that consume human souls and fit seamlessly into the bodies they empty, she must also accept that she is one of them. Yet, she is different from the rest, because her darkness didn’t inhabit her, it was awakened. And Emily must choose a side.",
