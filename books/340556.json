  "description": "This volume contains the translations of works from the Soka Gakkai publication \"Nichiren Daishonin gosho zenshu\" (\"The Complete Works of Nichiren Daishonin\"). The translations were first published by the Nichiren Shoshu International Center (NSIC) over a period from 1979 to 1995 in a seven-volume series entitled \"The Major Writings of Nichiren Daishonin.\" A total of 172 works make up this series, including the Daishonin's five major works (\"On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land,\" \"The Opening of the Eyes,\" \"The Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind,\" \"The Selection of the Time,\" and \"On Repaying Debts of Gratitude\"). Columbia University Press published 85 of those 172 translations, 12 in 1990 in \"Selected Writings of Nichiren,\" and 73 in 1996 in \"Letters of Nichiren.\" Eager to have all the translations under one cover, Soka Gakkai International (SGI) members asked that they be published in one volume. Thus the Soka Gakkai decided to publish the present volume â€“ all 172 works in chronological order. This work is indeed wonderful news, not only for members of the Soka Gakkai International, but for all English-speaking people interested in Buddhism. [From the Preface]",
