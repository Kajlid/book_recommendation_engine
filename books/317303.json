I have a problem.⁣My ex-f*ck buddy is getting married. ⁣And I can’t get out of going—long story.⁣I need an arrangement I can understand from a man who only had me for a night.⁣But Jordan has other plans for me.⁣Things that will tip the scales in his favor.⁣⁣⁣𝘑𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘢𝘯⁣A tryst was what she was looking for. ⁣A date was what I wanted.⁣A chance. ⁣I understand Maria Tavares. ⁣She’s a beautiful lie. ⁣Now she needs something from me: a favor. ⁣So I’ll function in a way she can understand: an arrangement. ⁣Three months. ⁣All in. Strings attached. No interferences. Titles exchanged. ⁣The plan is simple, with only one rule—veritas.⁣Let’s see if Maria’s ex-f*ck buddy understands that, too.",
