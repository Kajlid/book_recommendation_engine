If not in that position in a hotel room with the latest groupie on the mountain bike racing tour, it’s seeing her name in first place on the leader board.

Two world-class competitors pit their skills against one another in a struggle for the world championship of downhill mountain bike racing, all the while fighting an even tougher battle—the attraction they thought they had extinguished.",
