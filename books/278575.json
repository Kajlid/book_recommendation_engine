Set in Legerdemain -- a congested, fog-filled, cobblestone-paved Victorian city built around a cemetery the size of Central Park -- Agnes' adventures include confrontations with trapped spirits, cursed souls, possessed relatives, disappearing pets, decapitated scientists, ambitious zombies and a mess of other supernatural oddities.",
