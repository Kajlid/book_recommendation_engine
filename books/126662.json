  "description": "Mia Carrington has finally done the very thing she was destined to do all along—she's broken the curse on the Dark Elves. In order to make up for her mistake, Mia has chosen to make the ultimate sacrifice: her mortal life. The Dark Elves are now wreaking havoc on the mortal world while the Light Elves are trying to gain alliances.It seems now that Dugan has come into full power, nobody is brave enough to help defeat him, and the kingdom of Álfheimr cannot do it alone. It's up to Mia to try to persuade the other kingdoms, Raumelfr and Gautelfr, to join in their fight. Only they seem more concerned with frivolous matters—like who will rule beside Mia when she becomes Queen.Now that she has taken her place as King Alberico's rightful heir, there is no shortage of suitors seeking her hand. But her heart already belongs to somebody, despite the fact that she believes her choice has separated them forever.Mia has made her decision to be immortal and there's no turning back now, but every choice has its consequence and, like the dawn must fade into dusk, every beginning has to come to an end.",
