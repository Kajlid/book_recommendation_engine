  "description": "Behind the mask lies love-a dangerous and deadly emotion. Constance Athelson, Viscountess Westbury has a gift she can't reveal. She sees things others can't, including the dead. The only thing she can't see is into the heart of Lucien Blakemore, Earl of Lyndham. After one blissful night in his arms, she knows if she's ever to win his heart, she must free him from his tortured past. Lucien Blakemore met the Egyptian goddess Isis at a masked ball, but she vanished into the night before he could learn her real name. It's just as well, since the Blakemore Curse makes love a dangerous and deadly emotion for him. But the erotic night he spent with his mysterious lover makes him want to throw caution aside-if only for one more night with his masked goddess. Warning, this title contains the following: explicit sex with a hero whose torment equals that of Jane Eyre's Mr. Rochester.",
