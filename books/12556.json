  "title": "Cindy's Prince",
  "description": "Cindy Castle’s life is a fine juggling act—raising her orphaned niece and nephew in northeast Philadelphia, embracing her job as a children's librarian, and keeping alive her dream of becoming an author of children's books. She has NO need for a prince to charge into her life with promises of easy castle life. History has shown this \"Cinderella\" that all fairy tales don't have happy endings.Princeton Edmund Highfield III isn't a knight on horseback, he's one of Philadelphia's elite. His version of \"horsepower\" comes in the form of a snazzy Aston Martin, the same model of car that James Bond drives. Is Prince out of his mind, chasing after this daring woman with a ready-made family who is absolutely not impressed with his status of society's most eligible bachelor? What must he do to prove his love is real and sincere, and that their story can have a happily ever after ending?",
