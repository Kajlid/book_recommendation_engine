  "description": "When Marco Ribisi resolves to abandon a life of crime, his decision sends shockwaves throughout the shadows and alleyways of Washington D.C. Closing his gambling houses leads to the murder of one of his workers, and the attempted murder of Jelani Jones. To Marco, Jelani isn't just another worker; he's his muscle. And, more importantly, he's like a son. So this means all out war.  The Ribisi family devises a plan that allows Marco to both achieve his goal and fulfill his vendetta. But before the plan is executed, tragedy strikes again. Lies, betrayal, and murder become the order of the day. The other crime bosses won't allow Marco to simply walk away. And Jelani may be the only one Marco can count on to save him.  In Black Ribisi, author Rasheem Rooke shows how the criminal underworld of Washington, D.C. is more ruthless than any office on K Street or Capitol Hill. Extortion, drugs, prostitution, and illegal gambling serve as its four pillars. And one of those pillars is about to crumble to the ground, dragging the whole system down with it.",
