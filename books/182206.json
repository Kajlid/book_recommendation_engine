  "title": "Stepbrother with Benefits",
  "description": "When I first arrived at my mother’s reception, I never imagined that I would meet the most attractive man I had ever seen- dark hair, piercing eyes, and a lazy, confident smile… there was no way I could resist him. I certainly never imagined that I would be having mind blowing sex with him in the art gallery upstairs. I never, ever imagined that my mother would make an announcement on that very same night that she had gotten married to his father. Of course, I was devastated. I could certainly never be sexually involved with my stepbrother… Or could I?  A fun, standalone Stepbrother Romance with no cliffhanger",
