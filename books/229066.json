A lonely girl whose mother died mysteriously long ago and whose father almost hated her. An invalid artist-archeologist obsessed with proving the Arthurian legend to have been fact. And a digger in the ruins who unearths far more than he set out to discover. For them, the eternal triangle is a design for hatred, revenge and murder.",
