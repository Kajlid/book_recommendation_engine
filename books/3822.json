  "description": "An Oprah's Book Club Selection regarded as one of Faulkner's greatest and most accessible novels, Light in August is a timeless and riveting story of determination, tragedy, and hope. In Faulkner's iconic Yoknapatawpha County, race, sex, and religion collide around three memorable characters searching desperately for human connection and their own identities. Audie Award-winning narrator Will Patton lends his voice to Light in August . Patton has narrated works by Ernest Hemingway, Don DeLillo, Pat Conroy, Denis Johnson, Larry McMurtry, and James Lee Burke, and brings to this performance a keen understanding of Faulkner, an authentic feel for the South, and a virtuoso narrator's touch. “His passion is like the current of a surging river, and his performance as authentic and timeless as Faulkner’s Mississippi dirt. A stunning achievement.” ― AudioFile",
