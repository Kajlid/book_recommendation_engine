She cares nothing for humans until, when she is sixteen, a baby is brought for her to raise, a baby who awakens emotions that she has never known before. He is Tamlorn, the only son of King Drede, and, inevitably, Sybel becomes entangled in the human world of love, war and revenge â€” only her beasts can save her from the ultimate destruction.",
