  "title": "The Miracle of Life Change: How God Transforms His Children",
  "description": "What do I do now that I'm saved? Can you imagine a life so changed, so transformed, that you are a little mirror of Christ on this planet? That transformed life can be yours, but you can't do it alone. Using the Bible and practical examples, Chip Ingram will show you how to participate in the process of true metamorphosis (or \"morphing\") that brings about a completely new youâ€”a you that's remade from the inside out. He'll show you how you can think, feel, and act differently because God's Spirit has taken up residence inside you. In this book, Chip explores how life-change really happens, even in the midst of frustrating, painful, or mundane circumstances. Don't give up! Let this book encourage and equip you to follow Christ headstrong into new life.",
