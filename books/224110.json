  "description": "From USA Today bestselling author, Shey Stahl, comes a sexy new standalone novel about marriage, love and everything in between. And if there’s one thing he’s good at, it’s getting what he wants.What’s he not so good at?Being a husband. At least that’s what his wife would say.For most of my life I’ve been focused on one goal. Making a name for myself and building a business from the ground up. I’m a hard-working man, confident in my trade and quite frankly pretty awesome if you ask me. Sure, I make mistakes, you’ll see, but I think my dedication helps me out here. It’s the devoted work ethic that has me following through with anything thrown my way.That being said, my wife of the last eight years served me with a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage.Believe me, I’m shocked too. She’s under the impression I don’t care.Ridiculous assumption.I know what you’re thinking, what the hell did I do?Let’s not judge me yet until you know the whole story. The way I see it, in the state of Arizona, I have approximately 60 days to make her fall back in love with me. Easy enough, right?You’ve clearly never met Madison.",
