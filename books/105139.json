  "description": "Life is going well for Hana Du Rose. It seems as though everything is perfect in her new life as the wife of the head of the English department of Waikato Presbyterian School for Boys and the mother of a beautiful six month old daughter, Phoenix. Hana has settled into married life and adores her handsome husband and child, relishing this fortunate second chance at love.A series of unexpected encounters conspire to rock her emotional world and cause mayhem in Hana’s life, dragging her past into her present life and causing friction with Logan. Hana’s former life in England suddenly refuses to stay there, seeking her out and forcing her to face a number of issues which she believed she had left behind, old resentments and conflicts that she would rather not face now. A spirit of death hangs over the city and the discovery of a body at the boarding house will complicate matters and implicate someone dear to her, as her relationship with her policeman son implodes dreadfully under the pressure. But its grasping fingers will not be satisfied with one death and Hana will be floored by the loss of someone close to her. As always, life in the New Zealand city of Hamilton is never dull, casting its rich tapestry of influence over the inhabitants of the prestigious private boys’ school. Yet nobody could have foreseen the dreadful outcome of a harmless day out, which will threaten the security of the little Du Rose family forever.Show more Show less",
