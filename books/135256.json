  "description": "“I bet you're worried. I was worried. I was worried about vaginas. I was worried about what we think about vaginas, and even more worried that we don't think about them.”“The heart is capable of sacrifice. So is the vagina. The heart is able to forgive and repair. It can change it's shape to let us in. It can expand to let us out. So can the vagina. It can ache for us and stretch for us, die for us and bleed and bleed us into this difficult, wondrous world. So can the vagina. I was there in the room. I remember.”― Eve Ensler, The Vagina MonologuesMy Vagina MonologuesThe word \"vagina\" comes from the Latin root meaning \"sheath for a sword,\" which also suggest the sword in question is the penis of the man which though may not be as sharp as a sword..It has also been called Lady flower in the 18th and 19th century and many other names pussy, cunt, fanny in modern time.Deflowering of the virgin is a term used in the earlier centuries for the breaking of the hymen.The hymen is a thin membrane of tissue that surrounds and narrows the vaginal opening.It usually occurs in virgins.However it may be torn or ruptured by sexual activity or by exercise.A lot of girls’ hymens are broken through using a tampon or during active sports such as horse back, riding or cycling.Masturbation too can break the hymen.It is impossible to tell whether a woman has had sexual intercourse just by looking at her hymen.The hymen disintegrates for many different reasons including tampon use, exercise and sexual activity.The vagina is an elastic, muscular canal with a soft, flexible lining that provides lubrication and sensation.The vagina connects the uterus to the outside world.The vulva and labia form the entrance and the cervix of the uterus protrudes into the vagina, forming the interior end.The vagina receives the penis during sexual intercourse and also serves as a conduit for menstrual flow from the uterus.During childbirth, the baby passes through the vagina (birth canal).Ever hear a horror story of a woman who has lost a tampon in her vagina?Well, fear not ladies.These stories are false.It is impossible to lose anything in the vagina because the opening to the uterus called the os is too small for anything to go through it (except for sperms and when the baby is due for birth).The vagina does not connect to the lung.While the vagina can expand, it is not an open conduit to the abdominal cavity.While microscopic sperm can swim through a tiny hole in the cervix, a tampon simply will not fit.So if anything is lost something in there, do not worry.Just reach in all the way and pull it out.Do not go hunting for any thing lost with a pair of pliers.Think of the vagina as being like a sock.If a banana is lost in a sock, it stays in the sock.Yes, it's true - the vagina can fall out.Not to belabor the sock metaphor but it can turn inside out just like a worn out sweat sock and hang between the legs as a woman gets older.But do not fret; this condition called pelvic prolapse can be fixed.The vagina is only as deep as the middle finger.The vagina keeps itself clean and healthy by constantly producing mucus which turns white when it’s exposed to the air.Discharge also prevents the vagina from drying out.Discharge will begin to appear some time before the first period begins.Females can ovulate before they have their period.TABLE OF CONTENTIntroductionChapter 1 VaginaChapter 2 Vaginal FunctionsChapter 3 Effect of Estrogen on VaginaChapter 4 Vagina and Diseases",
