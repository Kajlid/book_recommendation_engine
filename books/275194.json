  "description": "Mr. No Commitments.Well, that’s not entirely true. Cash Callahan has been committed to his rodeo bronc-riding career for years. But get married? No way. Cash isn’t opposed to marriage for other people. It’s just not for him—or for his long-time girl, Milly Malone—the one planning to marry another man. What on earth is she thinking?Milly waited five years for Cash to pop the question. She’s given him enough rope to knit an interstate highway—and he keeps traveling right on down it. So she’s got a new beau, a wedding on Saturday, and no footloose, commitment-shy cowboy is going to mess things up.A smart, clever woman like Milly should realize that marrying a boring number-cruncher is a mistake. But all Cash’s rational, sensible arguments don’t do a lick of good. There is only one way to prevent disaster—he’ll have to marry her himself!",
