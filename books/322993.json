  "description": "As a Christian counselor, I strive for integrity in helping guide others in God’s will for their lives. Until a young man walks into my office for premarital counseling—the stranger who ensnared my soul eight months earlier with his bewitching green eyes. Levi Townson.The one whose addictive, luscious mouth I can’t cleanse from my memory. My hunger for another taste of him should assure me of my need for a savior, not shepherd me down the rabbit hole toward depravity. Levi’s yearnings mirror mine, the kind that dominates my will. Incinerates and leaves me powerless against my sinful nature. But if we fall from grace, neither of us will escape unscathed.",
