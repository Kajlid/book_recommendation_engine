  "description": "Herpetologist Kael Hammerson is hiding in Ireland working at a research lab. While Ireland may seem a strange place for someone in his field, it was the furthest away he could get from his abusive ex-partner. Now, a year later, his heart is ready to heal. Kael's boss, Hugh Price, is very interested in Kael, but is afraid to cross the line from employer to lover. When a strange sea creature is brought into the lab, Hugh and Kael are swept into a fight for their lives and the lives of mankind. Dragons have returned and the men must decide if their own love can survive the interference of a goddess. \nPublisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable (homoerotic sex, m√©nage, some violence).",
