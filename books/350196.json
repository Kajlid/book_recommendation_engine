  "description": "Her faith takes her across the world and into the path of a most extraordinary man. Freshly arrived in East Africa, Emma Pickering is instantly drawn to Adam King. The rugged cowboy is as compelling as he is mysterious. And if he'll agree to a marriage of convenience, it would solve both their problems. Emma could secure her inheritanceâ€”and with it, her chance to find her sister. Adam could gain the funds needed to carve his ranch out of the savanna. Yet their match is anything but \"convenient\" when Emma's fears gain hold, and malicious whispers threaten to tear the couple apart. Only their love and shared faith can save their life together.",
