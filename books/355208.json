  "title": "The Art and Power of Being a Lady",
  "description": "\"Lady.\" Let's face the word brings to mind a host of associations‚ many of which call to mind costume dramas or tea-sipping debutantes. That is, until The Art and Power of Being a Lady‚ the book that brushes the cobwebs off and makes \"lady\" relevant to every girl and woman — whether her role model is Audrey Hepburn, Oprah Winfrey, Madeleine Albright, Lauryn Hill, or Mia Hamm. In an era when looking out for one another and taking the high road is too often lost in the shuffle, today's lady has not forgotten what's important. She is kind and considerate without being a doormat. She's assertive, but never a bully. She is sexy without being vulgar. She has great style but is never superficial. She gives back without asking for kudos. And from now on, the perfect word to describe her is \"lady.\"",
