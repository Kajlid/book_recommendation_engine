  "description": "Jared’s unlike any twenty-one year old guy he knows, but then that could be down to his determination to keep from associating with the human population. Not that he doesn’t count himself among humans, no. He’s completely unaware of what he is. To him the term ‘vampire’ is purely fictional, and he really would like to keep it that way. But it’s hard to hide from yourself, especially when you’re fighting a lust that has a tendency of cropping up at the most inconvenient times.Things become hard for Jared when a murder is committed right under his inhumanly-sensitive nose. He doesn’t witness the murder, but plenty of people believe that he did, because he’s the one who walks in just after the killing has taken place. And if that’s not bad enough, this happens to be the first time that he’s faced with fresh blood. He may be able to resist feasting on hidden blood, but this? This is book one of Jared's sector of the series; Collision Of Worlds. Warning: unsuitable for young readers.",
