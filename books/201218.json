  "description": "Wuthering Heights - Emily Brontë's only novel - remains one of literature’s most disturbing explorations into the dark side of romantic passion.An unpolished and devastating epic of childhood playmates who grow into soul mates, Wuthering Heights revolves around the willfully childish Catherine and the dark Heathcliff, who, in the words of Charlotte Bronte, \"exemplifies the effects which a life of continued injustice and hard usage may produce on a naturally perverse, vindictive, and inexorable disposition.\" Heathcliff and Cathy believe they're destines to love each other forever. But when cruelty and snobbery separate them, their untamed emotions literally consume them.Set amid the wild and stormy Yorkshire moors, Wuthering Heights is widely regarded as the most original tale of thwarted desire and heartbreak in the English language.As Algernon Charles Swinburne wrote, \"the intelligent reader of Wuthering Heights cannot fail to recognize that what he is readying is a tragedy simply because it is the work of a writer whose genius is essentially tragic.\"",
