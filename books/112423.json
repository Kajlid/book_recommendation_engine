  "description": "Aislinn Jane O’Rourke, AJ to her business associates, was tough. She was known to be the strongest and most brutally honest negotiator in the state with rigidly upstanding business ethics and high morals. Anyone who knew Aislinn knew she was formidable and powerful. The standard to which Aislinn led her business was the standard to which she led her life. Men were unnecessary and unable to satisfy her mentally, emotionally or sexually. As one of Seattle’s most eligible and wealthy, Aislinn preferred a low profile, free of the entanglements that men represented. Jacoby Weston was a confident man, arrogantly secure in his prowess, who liked a challenge. Many things challenged Jacoby… the daily running of his business, the negotiation of life with a broken and dysfunctional family… but women did not challenge him. Women were a pleasant diversion but never for more than one night in his basement. Until he met Aislinn O’Rourke during negotiations for a choice piece of property that he wanted. Fascinated by her intelligence, her ethics and her incredibly sexy body, Jacoby met the challenge that Aislinn presented with an uncharacteristic fervor. The more she rebuffed him, the more he wanted her. Upon the conclusion of their business deal, Aislinn and Jacoby negotiate a new deal - a deal with higher stakes than either expected… their hearts. With the paparazzi stalking them, their pasts looming over them and mysterious events that unsettle them, Aislinn and Jacoby struggle to keep their budding relationship from being destroyed while trying to control the intense, pulsing desire that drives it. Can Aislinn and Jacoby negotiate the challenges of a relationship without compromising their hearts?",
