  "description": "A lively history of the sexual biases that exist in our language and a fascinating account of past and present efforts to correct these biases by reforming usage and vocabulary.“A valuable contribution to the politics of linguistics…. Fun to read.”― Publishers Weekly“That readers’ awareness of their own opinions is sharpened constitutes one of the positive values of the book.”―Charles Sleeth, Times Literary Supplement“Based on thorough and sound scholarship, this work should have wide appeal in the academic community.”― Library Journal“What we learn from Baron’s insights into our words’ past meanings can help us make them say what we want them to for the future.”―Beryl Lieff Benderly, Psychology Today“Chock full of good research on the subject that continues to be vital to all human beings. Baron’s historical treatment gives depth and perspective to readers who are interested in a dignified approach to male/female communicative interactions.”―Mary Ritchie Key, University of California, Irvine“There are a great many books on the subject of male-female language differences but none is based on such sound historical scholarship. Grammar and Gender will become a major source for other treatments of sexist language.”―Richard W. Bailey, University of Michigan",
