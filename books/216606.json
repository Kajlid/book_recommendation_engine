  "title": "Just Nuisance, AB: His full story",
  "description": "This is the remarkable life-story of one of the most famous Great Danes of all time. Able Seaman Just Nuisance was formally inducted into the Royal Navy at Simon's Town in August 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, and his exploits during the war made him a legend in his lifetime. More than 40 years after his death and burial with naval honours at Simon's Town, the legend lives on and many thousands of people in many parts of the world still remember Nuisance with affection. He was the friend and companion of sailors who called at the Cape in the war years, and he was a much-loved citizen of Greater Cape Town. Stories about this unique Great Dane are legion, some of them factual, others apocryphal. In this absorbing and amusing book Terence Sisson records his personal experiences and those of others who were fortunate enough to become close chums of the canine AB.",
