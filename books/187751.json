  "description": "Don Heck was the co-creator of Marvel's Iron Man and the long-time Avengers artist. In the 1950s Heck did a score of artistically brilliant and extremely beyond-the-pale, extremely gruesome, Pre-Code horror comic book covers and comics. The Chilling Archives of Horror Comics now gives its loving attention to this unsung horror master! In Horror by Heck is the large format and beautiful reproduction that has made the other books in this collectable series of banned horror comics a fan's dream come true! This beautiful hardcover book sports the usual Yoe Books detailed history, rare images reproduced from original art and more mind-blowing ephemera to give a fascinating look at the dark side of Dapper Don Heck.",
