  "description": "The Empire is rising to face the enemy. They are not alone, for their allies and neighbors have come to help; some have even come to fight despite the judgment of their own rulers. No one knows the extent of what they will be facing. The Drazon is free, the Demon Hordes are on the march, and their numbers are staggering. Will the Empire survive this challenge? Or will their enemies prevail? The stakes are high, for in failing to win the upcoming battles, the lives of every Elf in the Empire are in jeopardy.As the Elves prepare for the fight, the Drazon attacks at will. He challenges the might of the Dragons. He feels invincible. Omnipotent. Immortal. He will show the world who is in charge and the meaning of fear. His hatred knows no boundary. While King Lothrariel fights to hold his Empire and, the lives of his people together, he is besieged by problems. He turns to Gabriel, to handle the greatest tasks, and to resume his place as Commander in Chief of the Combined Elven Armies of the Empire. Lothrariel answers his Life Mateâ€™s call, and soon finds there is more to her summons than their bond. As an Oracle, she holds the answers in the back of her mind, although she cannot speak them, she can only guide.",
