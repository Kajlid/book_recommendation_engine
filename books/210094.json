  "description": "One single moment changes everythingIn one breath, you can have it allA split-second later, it can all disappearVanished foreverThat was meI had it allThen in a cruel twist of fate, it was taken from meA beautiful life gone in a flashBut he was thereHe was there to pick me up when I fellTo protect meMy savior. My rock.He was just a strangerJust a selfless stranger with a face I'll never forgetCan't forgetWon't forget And like everything else, he just disappearedAs if he never existedI have to find himI need to find himHe has to know that he saved me He has to know that in that one fleeting moment, he was all I could see",
