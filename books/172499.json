  "description": "The Vatican and Kremlin are at the center of espionage and intrigue when they turn to Mark Jamison and a mysterious chess master to locate lost Byzantine treasures that could hold the key to world unity and peace. The end of the Cold War was only a resumption of the old Great Game, now more devastating than ever for the pawns on the chessboard of competing Middle East and Central Asian oil and gas pipelines. The answers go back further than the Silk Road, and the adventures to ferret them out span the old and new worlds, uncovering a forgotten past and lost knowledge at every turn. This thriller is as fast paced as it is historically accurate and prescient for what may well await us all.",
