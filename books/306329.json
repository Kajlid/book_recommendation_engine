When in his presence, she plays the demure lady, though behind the scenes, she's doing everything in her power to subvert his authority. And she thinks she has him fooled...until he beats the lass at her own game.Prepared to meet his condemnation, Rhona bravely stands before this man whom she has deemed a beast.

If not, the desire long ago burned onto their souls just might hold them both captive for eternity.",
