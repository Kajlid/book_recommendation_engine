Then her mother receives a phone call from her brother Nikos, inviting the girls to move to Georgia. And that’s when things begin to change…A fall-out with the family sends Erin into a deep depression. She and her mother find themselves in a difficult situation, and must struggle to keep themselves afloat. Just when Erin thinks it’s over, she discovers the power of music, which leads her to a little band known as Our Lady of Righteous Rage…Novocaine is the in-between story, bridging the gap between Our Lady of Righteous Rage and the upcoming Your Fame Will Destroy You.",
