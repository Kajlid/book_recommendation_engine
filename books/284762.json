  "description": "In the 16th century, Portuguese navigators circumvented the globe, conquering new lands to build one of history's largest empires, and at the same time carrying and introducing crops, food products and a variety of culinary cultures to all corners of the earth. This fascinating collection of 225 authentic recipes is the first cookbook to encompass the entire Portuguese-speaking world and explains how Portugal and its former colonies influenced each other's culinary traditions. Included are dishes containing Asian, South American, African, and European spices, along with varied ingredients like piripiri pepper, coconut milk, cilantro, manioc root, bananas, dried fish, seafood and meats. The author also explores the impact of Sephardic Jews on the cuisines of Cape Verde, Angola, and Brazil and the influence of the Moors, who brought to the Iberian peninsula rich desserts, which the Portuguese in turn took around the world. The recipes range from appetisers Pastel com o Diabo Dentro (Pastry with the Devil Inside from Cape Verde); to main courses such as Frango a Africana (Grilled Chicken African Style from Mozambique) and Cuscuz de Camarao (Shrimp Couscous from Brazil), to desserts like Pudim de Coc;co (Coconut Pudding from Timor). Menus for religious holidays and festive occasions, a glossary, a brief history of the cuisines and a bilingual index will assist the home chef in creating meals that celebrate the rich, diverse, and delicious culinary legacy of this old empire.",
