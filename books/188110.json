Emily Rose Dougherty had only fallen in love once, in high school with a boy her parents didn’t approve of. Emily saw through the tough-guy façade, his leather jacket and motorcycle. She gave her heart to him. An accident on Luke’s motorcycle brought things to a screeching halt when her parents forbade her to see him again.  Neither forgot about the other.  Fast forward ten years…  Luke Wade built a good life as the owner of a motorcycle repair shop and the road captain of Hades’ Spawn Motor Cycle Club. When he reconnects with his high school love, Emily, things seem to be falling into place.  When dirty dealings within Hades’ Spawn, problems created by Emily’s ex-boyfriend and secrets from Luke’s past threaten to blow Luke’s life and his relationship with Emily apart, it suddenly feels like everything spiralling out of control.  Can Luke and Emily find a way to conquer the obstacles to their love or will they be to each other, “the one that got away?”    This is book 2 of the Hades' Spawn Motorcycle Club Series. * Intended for mature audiences only *",
