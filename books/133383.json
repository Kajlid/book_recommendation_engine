  "title": "The Black Brothers",
  "description": "In the middle of the 19th century, many young men were sent to Milan to work as slaves. Their lives were extremely difficult and many died from the harsh conditions. But Giorgio was able to survive because of the friendship and solidarity he experienced with a secret band known as \"the black brothers.\" Some 100 years later, Lisa Tetzner and her husband Kurt Held wrote about Giorgio's experiences and adventures, and recently the accomplished artist Hannes Binder resurrected the text and added dramatic and impressive engravings, turning the final product into this exciting graphic novel.",
