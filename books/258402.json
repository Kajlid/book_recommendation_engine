  "description": "Sex, wild parties and alcohol.When you’re the lead singer of a rock group, you don’tneed to make much of an effort to attract the attention of a hot chick—the music had already done that job for you. And when you make her scream in bed, tightly gripping the sheets or digging her nails into your back—it is mission complete.Everybody calls me the devil. I think they dubbed me that because they believe I’m heartless. Perhaps they’re right...I don’t know the meaning of the word “love” and I’ve always tried to avoid emotions. I suspect the reason for that is hidden in my past. I really have no idea and don’t want to try to find the answer.The only question I’m still seeking answer to is: Why, since I met her, can’t I think of anything other than the petite French woman with thick lips and the body of a goddess, Emily Delon?",
