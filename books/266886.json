  "description": "#1 Bestseller in Young Adult Romance!\nInternational Bestselling Author Anne Mercier brings you a tale of a douche and a dame battling the everyday trials and tribulations found in the halls of high school. When I’m dragged to a party by my best friends, I don’t plan on having a good time—and I’m not, until “he” finds me alone on the beach. I expect him to be a jerk with looks like him—but he’s not. He’s funny and sweet and we spend hours talking about nothing and everything. Then he kisses me. And I give myself to him—a familiar stranger with a name as fake as mine—then we say goodbye. I never planned on seeing him again. When Shell Beach Hall moves all their classes to Shell Beach Academy, I’m more than a little annoyed. The Academy is full of the snobs I avoid like the plague. I can’t hide my surprise when I see him again. He can’t hide his derision, accusing me of knowing who he was and using him to gain popularity. I realize I was wrong about him. He’s a jerk…and I want nothing to do with him. But he won’t leave me alone. He taunts me. He’s an arrogant and a jock whose bed is never empty.I’m disgusted. This is who I gave my V-card to? Ugh. I loathe everything he represents and I want to punch him in his pretty face. So why can’t I stop feeling his hands on my body or hear his sexy whispered words? Why, oh why, did he have to kiss me?",
