  "description": "USA Today Bestselling author Adriana Locke delivers a “sweet and steamy!” romance between a wealthy mogul and the struggling single mother that captures his attention … and his heart. Alison Baker is over love. Relationships are great. But peace? That’s priceless. The only way to get and keep a calm existence is to stay away from men. This is especially true for wealthy, charming, powerful men like her ex-husband. Then she meets Barrett Landry. He looks dapper standing in front of her in a suit, taking a glass of champagne off her serving tray. He pushes but she pulls. He asks questions. She tries desperately not to answer. But Barrett isn’t one to be refused, and he won’t be easily convinced to let the beautiful, sweet woman go without a fight—especially when he falls in love with her son too. It isn’t that easy. When their worlds collide, the fallout changes everything. Because everything comes at a cost and sometimes, even for love, it’s a price too steep to pay.",
