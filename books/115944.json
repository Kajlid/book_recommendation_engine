  "description": "On Allie Bennett's thirteenth birthday, one special gift will unlock the gateway to an adventure that will span the galaxy, and throw her into a war decades in the making. Abandoned by her parents and adopted at a young age, Allie was working hard at living a normal life, until one special birthday gift from her missing mother changed everything and left her stranded, lost and alone on the wrong side of the galaxy. Fighting to survive in an alien world, Allie desperately hopes for rescue from her best friend Dav. When she learns the truth behind Dav's real purpose however, she finds that even the closest of friends can be far more, or less, than they seem. Betrayed at every turn, tangled in a web of secrets drawing ever tighter around her, hunted by a brutal tyrant, Allie holds in her hands the key to saving not only her own world, but the entire galaxy. All Allie wants is to go home. That and pass Algebra, though that might be too much to hope for. Instead, she must become something thought lost forever; a hero with an ancient legacy... a Starjumper.",
