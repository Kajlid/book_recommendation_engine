  "description": "When Roxanne Black was only fifteen years old, she was diagnosed with lupus, a chronic inflammatory disease that can attack the vital organs of the body. As a teenager with a frightening and sometimes life-threatening disease, she yearned to connect with others who knew firsthand what she was experiencing. So she started a support group from her hospital room to bring patients together. That group now has become Friends’ Health Connection, a nationwide community that matches people with similar conditions, from cancer and lupus to paralysis and chronic pain and more. Along the way, Roxanne Black has inspired millions. Roxanne’s mission each day for the last twenty years has been to turn her “bad news” diagnosis into something positive. As she says, “When I might wonder ‘Why me?,’ I know the answer: ‘To help others.’” Unexpected Blessings is an extension of that goal, bringing to life not only Black’s moving personal story but also the lessons of courage she’s learned from all the famous and not-so-famous people she’s met over the years. From a poignant encounter with Christopher Reeve to her intimate experiences with patients around the globe standing strong in the face of extraordinary challenges, these are stories of heroism and hope. They are also reminders of the healing that comes when we can connect from the heart. Warm and down-to-earth, Unexpected Blessings offers support and encouragement to anyone touched by illness or just facing a difficult time in life. It is a powerful testimony to the strength of the human spirit.",
