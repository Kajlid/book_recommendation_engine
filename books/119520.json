  "description": "In this riveting psychological thriller—perfect for fans of Jane Harper’s The Survivors and Erica Ferencik’s Into the Jungle—a ferocious storm in the Australian Outback sets the stage for betrayal and murder.With a massive downpour and flash floods predicted, Quinn Durand leaves work and races for the safety of home. The first drops start to fall as she spots something strange on the familiar bush route. With no reception and nothing but an empty road for miles in either direction, she investigates and discovers it’s a body, dumped by the side of the road. When she approaches to check for signs of life, an arm reaches out and grabs her.Back at the country pub where Quinn lives, her boss Andrea has prepared for the torrential downpour. She's bunkered down with her toddler son sleeping in the back room when she’s startled by a banging at the door. It's a biker, seeking shelter from the punishing storm. Meanwhile, out on the roads, two young couples on their way across the country struggle against the lashing rains. Tensions rise as they realize that they don’t really know each other, nor are they remotely prepared for the storm. Alone, angry, and afraid in unfamiliar surroundings, flooding isn’t the only threat bearing down on them.Chilling, tense, and twisted, this multi-POV popcorn thriller is “compelling and explosive; you won’t be able to put this book down” (Hayley Scrivenor, author of Dirt Town).",
