  "description": "Antonello I’m a ruthless killer. I’m possessive, controlling and loyal as fu*k to my famiglia. But one thing I’m not is forgiving so I’m not quite sure what comes over me when Violet is inadvertently a witness to one of my mob hits. Instead of killing her, I capture her. It could be that southern accent that’s sweet as pie or the smart mouth on her that gets me going. But if we’re being honest here, it’s the overwhelming need to fu*k her senseless. I take her as my own and give her the deal of a lifetime. Pretend to be my girlfriend to save my ass from an arranged marriage, or be killed. Easy as sweet, southern pecan pie. Violet When I moved to New Jersey from Georgia I was hoping for a new life. Getting kidnapped by a super sexy mob man wasn’t exactly what I had in mind. Besides the fact that he’s extremely intimidating and, oh yeah, a murderer, I can’t help but develop feelings for him when we start pretending to be lovers. As much as I say I hate him and I’d do anything to escape his hold, I have to admit that this life with him is way better than any life I could’ve imagined without him. My only issue is, I’m not quite so sure he feels the same.",
