So when supermodel Cassandra ends up pregnant and alone, Emma doesn't hesitate to find and confront the man responsible, the all powerful Sheikh Rafiq Al Sadini, exalted ruler of Amar'a. She demands he come back to her heartbroken twin, only to be told that it is his brother Mansour who dated Cassandra. Mansour, and not Rafiq, is the father! But by the time Emma discovers the truth, it's too late. Rafiq can't let the next-in-line to the throne of Amar'a be raised in America. And so he kidnaps the bewitching Emma, intending to use her as the bait to bring her sister - and the royal baby - to his desert Kingdom. How could he have known that his blood would run hot with desire for his hostage? And that he would go to any length to keep her by his side, where she belongs.",
