  "description": "I’m not the man I used to be. But if there’s one woman that can bring me back to my old self, it’s her.The last time I saw her was three years ago. We fell hard and I thought she was my forever, but she left without a word, hardening my heart to anything resembling love.I never expected to see her again… and then she walks back into my life looking even more beautiful than ever. Tempers flare as anger and resentment tear through us, both of us saying things we don’t mean as we work through our mangled past.I want to hate her, but the more time I spend around her, the more I want what we used to have. As the sparks around us flame higher with each moment we’re together, I realize that I can’t ignore the way she makes me feel.Can the past be mended so that we can move into our future, or will I hold it all against her and be the one to walk away this time?*Mended Mirrors is part two of the Justin and Madison duet. Shattered Mirrors must be read prior to reading Mended Mirrors.**This book does deal with issues that could be triggering for readers. These include miscarriage (happens off page but is referenced), grief from loss due to suicide, and strong sexual content. Please be mindful of these before reading.",
