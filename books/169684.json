  "description": "Rage of Angels is the one of the most compelling novels Sidney Sheldon has ever written, and Jennifer Parker, his heroine, his most extraordinary creation. Jennifer, the daughter of a small-town lawyer, joined the staff of the District Attorney of Manhattan, to fight for justice as her father had done. But less than twenty-four hours after being sworn in, Jennifers hopes, her dreams, her career, were smashed, and she found herself facing disbarment and a possible prison sentence. So begins the story of a brilliant and beautiful young woman who becomes one of Americas most successful defense attorneys. It is also the story of the two powerful men in her Adam Warner, a man of honor and integrity, born to lead his country; and Michael Moretti, compelling, strange and vengeful, a dark angel who spreads wide his wings of terror. In Rage of Angels, a master storyteller takes us behind the closed doors of the courtroom and into the hearts of characters you will never forget.",
