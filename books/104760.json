  "description": "After Kayson fell from heaven, his life got complicated. His greatest enemies, the hell hounds, thrived on Earth and hunted not only the fallen but the blood children created by their Master. After being chased and confronted by one of those very creatures, Kayson’s life becomes even more complicated. He never expected to be rescued by a vampire named Sabrina. He also never expected to become her protector after she falls prey to a hell hound’s deadly bite. Falon, head of the hell hounds, has been desperately trying to hunt down Kayson and Sabrina but with the rain steadily falling—due to interference by the lower-realm Angels, also known as the assemblies—Falon grows irritated. His only option is to threaten those that may know where the fallen can be found.With the threat of the hounds finding Kayson and the other fallen, Kayson is running out of time. Stille, once a respected Warrior in the assemblies, is pushing Kayson to leave an unconscious Sabrina behind. After all Sabrina has done for him, Kayson refuses to abandon her. But will his decision leave his friends vulnerable to attack? Sabrina is conscious enough to sense the struggles that Kayson is facing. If he knew the torture she’s been going through, she knows he would suffer even more. Sabrina silently fights the darkness that is seeping into her dreams, while struggling to stay strong for Kayson. But when the pain becomes too much, Sabrina has to make a choice that may cost not only her life, but the lives of others as well.",
