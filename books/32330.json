  "title": "Deliverance: Hooch and Matt's Story",
  "description": "Nothing in life is ever simple, especially if you're a Delta Force instructor and an ex-Marine trying to make a new life together - not when you live under the constraints of 'Don't ask, Don't tell, ' the shadow of nightmares, and a darkness that will destroy you unless kept in check. Deliverance is the story of Hooch, a US Delta Force soldier and Matt, his former-Jarhead lover. It is a spin-off from Special Forces and spans the years 1998 to 2011. Both Hooch and Matt were created by Marquesate as secondary characters in the epic Special Forces ((c) 2006-2009), but they took on a life of their own.",
