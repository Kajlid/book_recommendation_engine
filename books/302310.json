  "description": "Draco. Harmony sneaks into the dragon shape-shifter's room to either seduce him or kill him-whatever works to keep the beast from forcing her sister to marry him. The Drelconian lords were a race of the hottest men, with the stiffest equipment a girl could dream of. They descended to Earth looking for breeders in exchange for desperately needed fuel. When Draco pinned her against a wall with an offer of all night fun as payment for releasing her sister from his bond, how could Harmony possibly refuse? Ryuu. The Drelconian leaders abduct Shannon to mate her with their lords, even if they have to watch the process from start to finish. If one sexy candidate doesn't work, then they'll pass her to the next. But the leaders didn't count on Shannon being able to connect mentally with the banished silver dragon lord, nor that he would risk his life to come for her. Ryuu will kill anyone who tries to harm Shannon or keep her from him, even if it's his own brothers or the respected elders.",
