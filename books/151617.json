  "description": "This monograph meticulously examines and judiciously interprets the historical facts surrounding the conspiracy by which William Harris and his associates attempted to acquire for themselves a large portion of what we know as Rhode Island during several decades of the seventeenth century and how they were opposed by Roger Williams and others. Central to the Harris conspiracy was his forging of false documents in connection with the deed given by the Narragansett sachems to Roger Williams in 1638.",
