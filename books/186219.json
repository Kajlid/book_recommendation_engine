  "description": "Sometimes love isn’t enough… Sometimes you’re required to be beautifully loyal. If you think you know her… You’re wrong. If you think you know her family… Wrong again. If you think you know her story… You don’t. Ashlynn Adorite is no stranger to the cruel and unusual world she was born into. In fact, she accepts it, understands it, embraces it. However, in her world, falling in love isn’t simply a choice. It causes problems, changes lives, disrupts business. Sex, pleasure, carnal desires ... those things Ashlynn understands. Love ... not so much. Her world is turned upside down when she starts to feel something for not just one man, but two. The question is, can she have all that she desires, or will loyalty to her family interfere.",
