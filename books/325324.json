Does she hold the key to how the bones came to rest in her yard, or is there something more sinister afoot?When the widow makes a dramatic appearance in Ronan’s bedroom, the case takes a turn no one saw coming and Ronan is powerless to stop. Can Tennyson solve the mystery of the thirteen skeletons, or will Ronan be the next man dead and buried?",
