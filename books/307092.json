And try not to get caught hooking up with your best friend’s brother.With all my best friends off the market, it’s time that I, Tori Sussex, join them.So where better to find my future husband than the internet? It’s great. I get to get all the awkward stuff out of the way and already know if I’m going to like the guy before we meet in person.It’s a shame nothing is ever that simple.My relationship with Colton Lane is the very definition of complicated—dirty little no-strings-attached hook-ups we’ve somehow managed to keep secret from all our friends for the past six months. We’re bound to get caught, and if I’m serious about dating, I only have one choice.Call it quits. End our little covert booty calls for good. Tell him my parking space is off-limits to him.It should be easy. It should be simple.And I’m sure it would be… If only I wasn’t in love with him.",
