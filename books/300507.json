Following their first encounter (“The Wolf & The Crow”), to both of their origins (“Upon a Field of Ruin” and “The Whispering Trees”), the tales find them traveling through the mystical land of Irth to tangle with a demonic mercenary prince and his minions (“A Sordid Tale”), and across savage wastes against relentless Unhuman adversaries (“The Reckoner”). The QUINTET gives fans of Sword & Sorcery a glimpse into the larger realm of Irth, immersing them into Farys and Sibyl’s world, and their grand adventures awaiting beyond.",
