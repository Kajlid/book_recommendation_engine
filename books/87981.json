  "description": "***** This is a SHORT Novelette at 10,000 words (about 35 pages) and should be read AFTER Book #2 (Relativity) in the Sage Hannigan Time Warper series. *****Brevity is written in Aldwin's point of view and meant to give readers an inside look into Aldwin's life and past. Book Excerpt: “She’s gone … I felt … I felt her warp.” Soren’s voice was full of anguish, and in that instant, I hated him for having a bond with Sage, to have felt her leave when I was the one lying right next to her. I clenched my jaw and continued to prepare to scour the city. A slight breeze ruffled my hair as Soren left. I was glad he was gone. Glad he wouldn’t be nearby to witness my pain consume me. And consume me it did. My scream rent the air, and lightening rained down, answering my fury and grief",
