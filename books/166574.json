  "description": "Damian Wintersâ€™s life is miserable. Haunted by the death of his mother when he was seven, ignored and neglected by his abusive alcoholic father, and bullied and jeered at in school, Damian escapes from his troubles and loneliness by walking and wandering the streets at night, haunted by his inner demons. Strongly believing in his unworthiness, the teenage boy is unaware of the gift he holds, the power he was born with. But things are changing in his neighborhood beginning with the strange family moving into the haunted house next door, the series of gruesome murders involving satanic worship happening in the woods, and maybe even Damian himself.",
