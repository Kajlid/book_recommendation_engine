  "description": "Ever wonder how to “talk adoption” with your adopted or foster child? Rest assured… you’re not alone! Your heart breaks when considering the pre-adoption trauma your child endured. Should you encourage your child to talk about it? The good news is that you don’t have to figure it all out. Let Little Branch lead you and your child into the complexities of adoption through his own story. As he shares his grief, loss, and joy, your child will identify and find new freedom to do the same when talking adoption with Branch Gets Adopted perfectly combines the validation of adoptee grief with the hope and comfort of unconditional parental love. An open-hearted and generous story, it will touch you deeply. Definitely, one to add to your family’s library! - Carrie Goldman, Author/Speaker, Host of Portrait of an Adoption Sherrie beautifully captures the foster and adoptive journey in this stunning book. Her words resonate deeply with me as an adoptive mom. My 10-year-old son sat beside me as I read it and he felt that the character, Little Branch, was telling his story. Sherrie paints a picture of adoption that includes feelings of loss, love, heartbreak and healing. This book will prompt empowering connection and conversation with adoptees and deeper understanding for parents. Every foster and adoptive family should own this book! - Kristin Berry, Co-founder of confessionsofanadoptiveparent.com",
