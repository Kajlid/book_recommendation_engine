  "description": "Layla Philips is a teen mom from the wrong side of L.A.She’s pudgy.She’s vulgar.And she just left her baby Kurt in a running car on a hot day while she dashes into a drug store to shoplift.But you’d be very wrong to hate her.Layla loves Kurt dearly, if not well. And she’s willing to fight to the death the forces eager to rip Kurt from her tender embrace.Foster care wants Kurt. So does Clare, a well-meaning but childless Santa Monica matron. And most dangerously, so does Irwin Griggs, the 27-year-old old baby daddy who hasn’t had contact with Kurt—well—since his conception.Irwin’s a convicted felon and former mosh pit Lothario on a mission. After violating parole, he’s escaped to the Oregon woods, trading his punk garb and shaved, tattooed head for curly locks and Pendleton shirts. And like a twisted Promise Keeper, Irwin has vowed to atone for his fatherly wrongs. The dad of five kids out of wedlock (who he’s seldom seen) by four different moms (ditto), he plans to make amends by getting rid of the mothers, kidnapping the kids and transporting them to Kiddie Country, his unlikely mountain refuge.Only Layla stands between Irwin and his bizarre goal—with Clare caught in the middle.",
