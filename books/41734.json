  "description": "In February 2000, a new band exploded onto the pop music scene, forever changing the face of boy bands as we know them. Five unlikely boys were discovered by star-making genius Bob Buss and combined their talent to create 2gether...the phenomenon that has inspired a hit movie, a TV series, and two chart-topping albums. Now, for the first time ever, follow Jerry, Chad, Doug, Mickey, and Q.T.'s rise to the top (rise to the middle, anyway) and get a behind-the-scenes look at the group behind such classics as \"U + Me = Us (Calculus)\" and \"The Hardest Part of Breaking Up (Is Getting Back Your Stuff).\"",
