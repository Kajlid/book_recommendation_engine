  "description": "Embattled LoversAdair leads a very successful band of scavengers, bandits who prey on Pony Express riders and their motorbikes. But since the first night he spotted Lachlan in the crowd at the Chlodwigs, Adair's been far too relenting with captured Pony Express riders, and he's been concentrating his efforts on winning the Dance Wars rather than snatching their prey.Adair's crew is getting suspicious — has their leader gone soft? There's no place in their world for a sappy Werewolf. Adair rashly promises a kill for their next capture — only to have his world come crashing down on him when Lachlan's motorbike falls in their trap.Adair can't go back on his word. Seems there may be only one option left — one neither rider nor werewolf is ready to face.",
