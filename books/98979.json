But before he sees his elementary friend, Another friend of his ( 'Billy Bean'). pays him a visit, where Aaron is forced to change his plans.Does his orchard get watered? I hear you ask.Well my answer to that is why not travel with Aaron down to Kaiamaville and find out for yourself. Let him teach you the importance of rain water and introduce you to some of his elementary friends (whilst your having a fun time learning about the importance of vitamins in the body). Then you will know, if Aaron's Orchard, finally got watered.",
