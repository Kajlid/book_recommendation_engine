  "description": "Dr. Seuss has always been welcome in every reader's home, but in this Bright and Early Book classic, Marvin K. Mooney's welcome has been worn out! In merry verse and illustrations, Marvin is asked to leave by every conceivable means of transportation. He can leave by lion's tail or stamp himself and go by mail. By stilts or Crunk-Car or Zumble-Zay, it's time that Marvin was on his way. Will Marvin ever get the hint?Combining brief and funny stories, easy words, catchy rhythm, and lively illustrations, Bright and Early Books are an ideal way to introduce the joys of reading to children.",
