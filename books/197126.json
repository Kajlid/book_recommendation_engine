Warshawski agrees to fill in as coach for the girls' basketball team at her South Chicago alma mater - which in turn leads her to the headquarters of By-Smart, the global retail empire where V. I. hopes to get some desperately needed funds for the struggling squad. But conscience seems to be in short supply at By-Smart...with the exception of Billy Bysen, the earnest teenage grandson of the chain's gruff, tightfisted founder. And when Billy disappears - along with a mysterious document much desired by By-Smart's management team - V. I. is hurls onto a twisted, body-strewn path that runs through Chicago's dirtiest places and reveals some of its dirtiest secrets.",
