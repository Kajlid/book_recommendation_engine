  "description": "Somewhere in a college classroom, the ancient myth of Plato's Allegory of the Cave is being retold and someone is remembering. In the suburban shadows of New York City, Jack Tortis crawls through his adolescent struggles. He's an introvert in search of home, but he's been branded a punk on an island with little opportunity for redemption. Set in the 1980s and '90s with a soundtrack of tunes in the background, Jack and his friends try to find their way through love, hate, dysfunction, and illusion. In a battle for survival, they must overcome the violence, drugs, and apathy that infects their community. As winter approaches, Jack finds himself alone at the crossroads and must choose his fate. This is a coming of age story with perspective framed by an ancient tale of wisdom that reminds us how reality is not always what it seems.",
