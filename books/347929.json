  "description": "There was something haunting in the old man's eyes, something that mesmerized Sarah Rhinehart. Then, tragically, he died -- before she could ask why he'd been following her, before she even knew his name. Stunned and bewildered, Sarah became desperate to discover the stranger's secrets. He'd been called Marcus Stephens, and forty years ago he'd lived in Sarah's house -- and loved a woman who looked exactly like her. A terrifying possibility took hold in Sarah's mind, but she forced it away -- until the truth shattered reality. Somehow, Sarah stepped through the curtain of time into a dangerous world where nothing was familiar . . . nothing except one man, the man who was her destiny -- if only she could survive . . .",
