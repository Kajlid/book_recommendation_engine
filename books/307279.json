  "description": "Ezekiel LeClerc had been sent on a mission by his Sire to track down the origin of problems plaguing the town of Keithville, Louisiana. It seemed as if the town’s mayor was enforcing unreasonable laws and taxes on its citizenry. Zeke had been sent to find the person or demon behind the scenes who was pulling the mayor’s strings and why. His Sire had one request, stay in touch. Zeke was doing just fine until he called his Sire to give him an update and heard the one woman’s voice he could not get out of his head. Her voice called to him. Everything about her made him want to devour her body and soul. Everywhere he looked, he compared every woman he saw and they were all falling short. This had never bothered him before. What was he to do? Janis Barry had been offered a job to teach children with unusual abilities. What she learned was that there were beings called Brethren who were created by a benevolent magician over a thousand years ago to save the innocent from Detruires. These evil beings came to earth through portals that had been opened by an evil sorcerer so he could make a deal with the Devil. She learned that every male member had been promised a mate. However, she knew the male Brethren she worked for were like brothers until one day she picks up the phone and hears the most sinfully sexy voice. A voice that stirs her passion and desire for only him. His name is Zeke. How was it possible that she could fall in love with someone by just talking to them? Luckily, Janis has an the Brethren give her an education on how to recognize a mate. Is this Zeke hers? Only time would tell.",
