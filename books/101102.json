  "title": "Signing with a Heavy Hand and Heart, Love Mommy: A Journey Through Fetal Alcohol Syndrome",
  "description": "Our autobiography is based on my 22 plus years of schedule book notes along with diary like entries. There is a strong emphasis on our adopted daughter Chanel. Chanel was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome initially at birth and confirmed a few years later. Chanel has allowed me to share some very personal information about her and her struggles while wading through this 100% preventable birth defect. THERE IS \"NO\" CURE!When coping with the behavioral issues in a child with fetal alcohol syndrome, it is easy to forget that these are manifestations of the physiological brain damage caused by alcohol use during pregnancy, rather than willful misconduct on the part of the child.Chanel continues to be delightful, lovable, charming and a mischievous young woman. It's ridiculous how much we love her. Along our journey together my husband and I have set good examples for Chanel to emulate, as we strive to lovingly support Chanel in all her endeavors.Help us join Chanel to end fetal alcohol syndromeMOMS CHOICE AWARD WINNERFINALIST IN THE INTERNATIONAL READERS FAVORITE BOOK AWARD",
