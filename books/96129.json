  "description": "Nine Suns there are, nine watchers, nine masters. The worlds their children. The races their seed, the soul the shards of their intellect, the Empyrean the workshop of their divine labors. Who among us has the wisdom to hear their voices, to know their words written? Who can hear the Greater Voice beyond, the One who speaks to the Suns as they speak to us?***The NINE SUNS continues in a new epic fantasy adventure! It was supposed to be an easy job. Deliver a crate to the city of Iremnik, on Kuthir. Try not to get killed in the process. But for Gaebrel Harrn and the crew of the Sparrow, things are never that simple. For inside that crate was a sleeping princess at the heart of a plot to use dark magic and twisted technology to overthrow a kingdom and ignite a war that would leave a world in flames.Now they are on the run, chased across the Olysi system by their old enemy Ulzarad the Neverborn, who desires nothing more than to consume their souls. To restore a Princess to her rightful throne - and save their own necks - Gaebrel and his companions will do battle against a mighty warlord who has never known defeat, face certain death in the arena against creatures unknown even to legend and escape the soulless clutches of the Neverborn. They will infiltrate the homeworld of the lizard-like dzur, an secretive race known for their skill in creating magical artifacts...and their absolute hatred of outsiders. Those who enter their underground cities uninvited are never seen again.Yet Gaebrel and his companions have never let the threat of utter annihilation stand in their way. With swords and gunpowder and reckless courage they will bring a storm over the worlds of Olysi...and the Suns and Spirits help those who get in their way!",
