  "description": "Akila Peters works as an art consultant in Santa Fe. Wandering through the Georgia O’Keefe museum, he discovers a man’s body with a labyrinth tattoo. While he tries to unravel why this man was killed, he discovers a series of Southwest art thefts and a variety of interesting characters in the City Different. His neighbor, Ms. White, has an assortment of Southwestern jewelry that has gone missing. His one friend in town, Janine, works at the Garcia Books bookstore and has a knack for understanding people. She also sports a labyrinth tattoo. Although never one for believing in the supernatural, something is following him that won’t leave him alone, perhaps for his peril. Walking through the many art galleries and desert landscapes of New Mexico, Akila realizes that there is much more to art than just an aesthetic appreciation, peoples’ lives depend on it.",
