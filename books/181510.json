  "title": "Madam May: A Tale of Madams, Morphine, Moonshine, and Murder",
  "description": "This work of historical fiction is based on true events in early 20th century Atlanta, Georgia. Willie May Wheeler, a poor, young, rural Georgia woman was willing to do whatever it took to escape her upbringing. She wished to become an independent woman of means in the big city of Atlanta. She managed to seduce a prospective husband who brought her to the city. The husband was not honorable, and May soon found herself alone and embroiled in the city’s seedy underbelly of crime and corruption. Her exploits included morphine addiction, run-ins with the law, and operating a brothel. May wound up as the defendant in a sensational murder trial that brought her notoriety among the upper echelons of Atlanta society. Despite all this, she never gave up hope for a respectable and successful life as a woman on her own. Practical and pretty, conniving and intelligent, we cheer for May as she makes her way, overcoming obstacle after obstacle. The author is uniquely qualified to tell May’s story because May is her paternal grandmother! Awarded a Best Manuscript Submission at the May 2013 Atlanta Writer’s Conference, you will find yourself intrigued with this woman's story.",
