  "description": "Twin siblings Kallypso and Gabriel grow up in the lush cradle of Mythaki, an idyllic Greek island wrought of Mediterranean sun and sea. Their innocence is shattered by the outbreak of a war which flings Gabriel to distant battlefields and shackles Kallypso to a deteriorating homefront as Italian soldiers apologetically invade their island.Ravaged by the twisted specter of Hitler’s ambition, Greece’s seas run red with the blood of her children. Germany’s occupation plunges Mythaki into a dystopia of chaos and brutality. Despite the darkness, human nature retaliates with unexpected kindnesses and forbidden love. Kallypso and Gabriel discover that people must sometimes make their own miracles.War entwines the fates of a Nazi ridiculed for his conscience, an iconographer haunted by her artistry, an officer driven by his madness, and a rebel soldier fighting to return home. There are people who bring darkness. There are people who spread light.This is their story.",
