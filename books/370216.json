  "description": "Rett's known nothing but warfare since her seventeenth year. Now, with the long war at a critical turning point, she finds herself distracted by a dimwitted alien mindforce from some planet called Earth who thinks that Rett's daily brushes with death are part of a realistic dream. And just when she starts attempting to deal with the alien in her head, her platoon is assigned a technical advisor: a defected Enemy trooper who claims he is madly in love with her. Can Rett learn to cope, and keep her ego-merge a secret without losing her mind--and her life--in the process?* * *This is a planet-based sci-fi adventure. Recommended for ages 14 and up. Convergence is only the beginning of an adventure. Reading order of series: Convergence, Gravity, Stratagem, Carakenne, Kyarta Girl.",
