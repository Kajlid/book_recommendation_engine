A dark romance novella of 30k words.Excerpt:So attuned to her, he held her shoulders tightly, and for a moment time seemed frozen. Swallowing he was almost hypnotized. It was wrong to feel so, and it had been easier to ignore that when he pursued her with no hope in the face of her constant rebuttals. However, now, with her before him he froze.It didn't last though. \"You need me too,\" he said breathlessly, as if some revelation struck him. He pushed in against her, his whole hard body flat against hers, so much softer. His lips kissed along her neck, little tiny pecks at first, and he murmured, \"Don't do it, mom. You have me. You have me\" interspersed between his kisses.Angelique gasped, her hands going to his chest and pushing, but the heat of his mouth on her throat was almost too much. It broke the well of her calm, and she ducked away from him.Despite his momentary burst of strength, he was still weak from his bout of trouble, and against her shove he faltered back. The act, however, dislodged his robe. It fell from his shoulder and waist, and he stood before her, mere inches from her, nude, and so very erect.",
