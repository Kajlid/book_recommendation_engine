  "description": "Janet accepted a job at the grim, dark country house called \"The Devil's Mansion.\" She was to be companion to strange Miss Boisevain, who wore a live chameleon around her neck and lived only for the day she would die.The only other visible occupants of the mansion were the terrified, deaf and dumb maid, and a ferocious wolf-like dog who obeyed an unseen master.\"A weird thriller of the sort that R. R. Ryan and Mark Hansom are given credit for writing: this one does the job properly. Starting with the basic Gothic formula of trapping an innocent young woman in a house that is remote and threatening yet fascinating, the author adds as its apparent mistress an old woman who sports a live chameleon on a gold leash roaming over her dress; a snarling dog named Rajah; a mute servant; a male would-be rescuer who keeps misplacing his gun; a father's curse; mysterious music played by an unknown presence; and, in the climax, the revelation that the real master of the house is a deformed love-child of the old woman, kept in hiding, a malevolent creature two-and-a-half feet tall with green scales and hooves instead of feet. The pace is brisk, the style vivid, the thrills authentic.\" - Robert Eldridge. Bleiler (1948), p. 162.",
