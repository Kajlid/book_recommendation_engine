  "title": "House of Horrors: The Horrific True Story of Josef Fritzl, the Father From Hell.",
  "description": "In the quiet Austrian town of Amstetten in the balmy spring of April 2008, a truly horrifying vision of hell was discovered by police in the cellar of a normal suburban home. On 28 August 1984, seemingly respectable family man Josef Fritzl had lured Elisabeth, the youngest of his seven children, into the cellar of their family home, where he then drugged and handcuffed her in a windowless dungeon he'd spent years constructing. For the next 24 years Josef held his daughter captive in unimaginable conditions and repeatedly raped her, fathering seven children. When the eldest captive child, Kerstin, was admitted to hospital, Josef's sickening web of incest and abuse was uncovered by the authorities. This is the full and utterly disturbing true story of what happened in those underground chambers of horror.",
