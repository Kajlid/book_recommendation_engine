  "description": "A 17-year drought, earthquakes, and wildfires leave California uninhabitable and irreparable, forcing its citizens to relocate. Fewer than 1% of its population remain— by choice or necessity. But a contingency of 16 feels called of God to stay at their own risk to minister to the stragglers. Calling themselves The Holdouts, they face a clash of cultures, ethnicities, religions, and politics that pits friend against friend, with the future of the country at stake. In the midst of the chaos, while facing their most menacing opponent, the leader of The Holdouts becomes convinced he’s heard directly from God Himself. The result is a finish you’ll never forget.",
