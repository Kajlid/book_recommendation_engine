  "description": "From the award-winning, bestselling author P.S. Meraux with John Green comes a supernatural, mystery-thriller. She has no memory. No fingerprints. No parents. No cellphone. When this girl gets out of the hospital it’s going to be a helluva week.   Her hands are a wreck, fingers bruised, swollen and bandaged. Her parents are nowhere to be found. What’s a girl without an identity to do? It’s not like she’s Jason Bourne; there’s no clue implanted in her hip.  Even her supernatural gift is a mystery. How does it work? Where does the magic come from? And what’s causing sparks to shoot out of her fingers? Targeted by a mysterious group of thugs, they want something they think she has. She has no clue what it is or where she may have stashed it.  Before she can solve the mystery of her past, she must get away from them, cross the border -- all without an identity, money or friends. Oh, and magic or not, she doesn’t have any particular skills to make it easier. She’s no blonde assassin. No government in the world would put a gun in the banged-up hands of this girl.  Racing for her life, fleeing capture-- someone calls her “Merit.” Who is she? Adopting the name may kill her. Yet, Without Merit -- she has no clue to follow at all.",
