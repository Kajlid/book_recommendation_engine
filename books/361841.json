  "description": "Daisy Perika has no place in the modern world of cold, rational science. Hers is the realm of the spirit -- of ancient and sacred magic. But visions of Coyote and fire have awakened the aged Ute shaman once again to the Dark One's workings among the whites of southwestern Colorado. For Granite Creek police chief Scott Parris, the late-night murder of a brilliant female graduate student is a brutal and baffling as anything he encountered during his years as a Chicago cop. Now the investigation is leading Parris into worlds he has never known -- and toward a remarkable alliance with a beautiful journalist and an elderly Native American mystic that could prove both enlightening...and deadly.",
