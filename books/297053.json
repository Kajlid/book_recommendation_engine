  "description": "Dizzy Lizzie may be the smallest kitten in her litter, but her determination is mighty. Born under an old house, in a dark wee den, with cobwebs in the corner and dirt underfoot, every day is a struggle for the tiny kitten, until she learns a trick or two to make sure she gets her share. But just as things seem to improve, Dizzy Lizzie’s home is destroyed and she is torn from her mother. Soon, Lizzie is faced with a new set of problems, and if she wants to stick with her sister and secure a forever home, the little kitten must learn to curb her big temper. “No matter how teeny-tiny, no matter how weebly-wobbly,” Dizzie Lizzie vows, “I’ll find a way!” But as she tumbles from one calamity to the next, can Lizzie tame her tantrums and find her forever home? Based on a true story, this beautifully illustrated and uplifting rescue cat tale explores themes like loyalty, family love—whether that family is by blood or adoption—and never giving up.",
