  "description": "This time, romance isn’t the only thing undercover(s).It’s not exactly a traditional date night to get involved in a shootout. Then again, there’s nothing traditional about Lyra and Marcus. It was hard enough to hide their undercover work from each other--but discovering that their agencies are sworn enemies? Awkward.Lyra has never been known for her impulse control, but shooting her boyfriend is definitely an all-time low. Marcus isn’t the type of agent to disobey orders, but he can’t seem to keep his eyes--or hands--off the infuriating woman he’s supposed to forget. Danger is closing in from all sides, forcing them to team up to solve their mutual problem… but the enemy is already closer than either of them know.From USA Today and Wall Street Journal bestselling author Nana Malone comes the sexy, gripping conclusion to The Covert Affairs duet.",
