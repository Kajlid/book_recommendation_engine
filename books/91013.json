  "description": "New York Times & USA Today Bestselling Authors present...  Academically-minded, uptight Anna only agreed to go on Date with Destiny, a campy game show, because she wanted to win an SUV. She never dreamed that accidentally selecting the wrong prize would land her on a cruise ship full of supernaturals. At least she’s bringing someone along for the ride—her best friend Winter, a kooky free spirit with a penchant for mischief.   Andre and Christian, were-panthers and twin brothers, are polar opposites as far as personalities go. One views life as a party, the other is entirely too serious. But once they meet their intended mates, this night-and-day duo can finally agree on one thing—Anna and Winter will be theirs and theirs alone before they get back to shore.   The Powers That Be have ensured none of them will get off the ship until the two couples are mated. But as the brothers quickly realize, these human females mean to challenge them every erotically-charged step of the way.",
