  "description": "Some words to not apply to William Brown. Sweet, charming, \"dear little boy\" . . . That sounds more like Georgie Murdoch, who is so sickly sweet that William is determined to turn him into a wild, muddy, noisy outlaw like himself . . . There is only one William. This tousle-headed, snub-nosed, hearty, loveable imp of mischief has been harassing his unfortunate family and delighting his hundreds of thousands of admirers since 1922. Now with a fantastic new cover look.",
