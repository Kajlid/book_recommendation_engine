  "description": "My name is Eve Parker, and I'm as normal as can be. Well, at least I was.His name is Ash, and he's the enforcer for the Savage Legion motorcycle club. I never imagined a man like him would even look at me, let alone pursue me relentlessly. One touch of his hand leaves me melting, but I know he is bad news. I almost let things go too far the very first time we met, then he disappeared on me.He's not the sort of boy any good girl usually goes after; I should leave it alone, but I can't get him out of my head. Apparently he feels the same way because he keeps showing up wherever I go. I've done my research about his club: the Savages are an outlaw 1%er biker club, which means they're not good. In fact, they're only good at being bad. I need to stay away if I know what's good for me, but... He's magnificent. He makes me feel incredible, at least when he's not pissing me off. I don't get his choices or his lifestyle, but there's so much more to this man than the patches and the motorcycle. The more glimpses he gives me of what's beneath the shell, the more I want to find out. But when bad things start happening within the club, my fascination for Ash could very well end up getting me killed...**Originally published in the RIDING DESIRE BIKER BOXED SET.",
