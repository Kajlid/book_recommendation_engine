  "description": "Mason, the leather top known at the Cockpit Bar as the Fancy Man, loves to create BDSM scenes for people—the more unusual the better. Charles brought him one of his tougher challenges, and the two have been together since. It hasn’t always been easy, as they work out what they are to each other, both as dominant and submissive and as lovers. Now Mason and Charles work together to create BDSM experiences of intense emotion. As they help other people deal with broken hearts and long-buried desires, they also confront the possibilities in their own relationship. Partners in the scene and in the bed, the two men come to appreciate that they could be so much more together.
