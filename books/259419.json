  "description": "Sawyer Landry is sexy, rugged, charming… and did I mention sexy? Back in college, we were best of friends - which meant I secretly hid an epic unrequited crush, while he dated every other girl on campus… and then told me all about it the morning after.Now I’m back in Chicago for the first time in years, and Sawyer is determined to rekindle our friendship. I swore, I wouldn’t put my life (and heart) on hold for him again, but just one look at his handsome face and I know, he’s still the only man for me.But this time, things are going to be different. No more sitting around, waiting for him to realize his dream woman is right in front of him. No, I’m going to make him see, I’m not just one of the guys anymore.But can I really go from sidekick to soulmate? And will this playboy bachelor realize, true love is waiting - if he’d only take a chance?",
