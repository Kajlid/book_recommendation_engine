  "description": "A NEW TECHNOLOGY. AN EVIL TYRANT.AN UNEXPECTED MOVE.How much is one expected to sacrifice in the service of his or her country? That’s an elusive question for the Centauries, our intrepid but haggard band of explorers. Terrae Solaris lays ravaged by conflict, and the instability of the Outer Rim threatens the very future of humanity. An opportunity for survival emerges: a dangerous undertaking calling for the Centauries’ unique skills. But the thrown-together mission is fraught with peril—and politically motivated. Worse, the Centauries must work with the Coverts, a renegade special forces team whose leader seems to have his own agenda for the mission. Can our explorers carry out their mission? Can they even work together anymore? What secrets from both the Centauries and Coverts’ pasts threaten the mission’s success—and their lives? And what lurks in Europa’s dark history that may undo everything?RECENT REVIEWS“An incredibly thought-out, full-of-suspense, and rolling-with-emotion book.
