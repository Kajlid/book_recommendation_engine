  "description": "Patricia Bennett, Head Librarian, was quickly coming to believe that her matchmaking Great-Aunt was losing the plot. Oh, sure, the warrior that turned up in her Library fulfilled all her secret fantasy requirements; gorgeous and tall, but he was also irritating and bordering on being an Alpha-hole. Besides, she really didn’t have time to bring him up to scratch, she was too busy working on ousting the arrogant - thinks he’s always right - Cullen from the Southern Sanctuary. The gall of the man. First he steals her library books. Then he sets up his Potting Shed as a Library Annexe. Enough is enough. Descended from the Camelot Archers, Cullen has devoted his life to protecting the sovereign soil. But when he’s betrayed and forced to go into hiding, the Southern Sanctuary appears perfect for his needs. More so when he meets the riveting Patricia Bennett. But who knew the Library world would be fraught with just as many dangers as that of being a spy. With magic in the mix. Peril at every turn. Cullen must defeat a warrior-rival. Organise a high tea for a Chaos God. Hang some Christmas ornaments. Expose a traitor, and somehow convince Patricia that he belongs in the Southern Sanctuary.It’s no longer just a battle of wits when Patricia and Cullen team up to go after a traitorous spy. They must learn to trust one another if they want to survive. But before too long Patricia is in danger of becoming addicted to the excitement, the adrenalin rush and worse, the man of mystery himself.",
