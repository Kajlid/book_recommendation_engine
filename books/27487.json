With only one more year to go before Beijing reclaims control of the British colony, China's transition to power already reveals its dark and lawless side. And Claire's career as a China hand may be reaching a crossroad now that she has met the dashing Swiss UN delegate Xavier Vonallp on assignment from Geneva to set up operations based in Hong Kong.",
