  "description": "\"Robert Zubrin is a true engineering genius like the heroic engineers of the past.\"-- Frederick Turner, American Enterprise Using nuts-and-bolts engineering and a unique grasp of human history, Robert Zubrin takes us to the not-very-distant future, when our global society will branch out into the universe. From the current-day prospect of lunar bases and Mars settlements to the outer reaches of other galaxies, Zubrin delivers the most important and forward-looking work on space and the true possibilities of human exploration since Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Sagan himself said of Zubrin's humans-to-Mars plan, \" Bob Zubrin really, nearly alone, changed our thinking on this issue.\" With Entering Space , he takes us further, into the prospect of human expansion to the outer planets of our own solar system--and beyond.",
