  "description": "In 1855 New York, Ginger Fitzpatrick has absolutely no interest in taking part in the newest rage in America-the Cotillion Ball. Instead, Ginger would rather be rallying for women's rights-at least until she meets her brother's best friend from St. Louis, a dark mysterious man named Joseph Lafontaine, who ignites her passion and makes her question if love and marriage is such a ridiculous notion after all.What she and the rest of New York's high society don't realize is that Joseph is half Ojibwa Indian, and therefore, totally unsuitable for marriage to a fine, cultured young lady.In this Edith Wharton-meets-Julia Quinn tale, a young woman rebels against high society and opts for a life in which she creates her own set of rules.\"Sensuality Level: Sensual\"Ever since submitting her first screenplay to \"Bonanza\" at age twelve, Becky Lower has had a love affair with the American west. Since personal time travel is out of the question, she pursues her passion by writing about it. Becky is a graduate of Bowling Green State University and lives in Oberlin, Ohio with her dog, Mary.",
