  "description": "Nya has enjoyed her time on Arcros, mediating minor disputes and arranging marriages. She never expected that she had been offered the position based on her suitability to be a Draikyn mate, and that her soon to be lover was working his way through stone pathways to her side. Hyfor is not what she was expecting, but as she was expecting to work in obscurity, she wasnâ€™t really prepared for anything. Mating with a dragon might be a good bar joke, but the reality far eclipsed the fantasy.",
