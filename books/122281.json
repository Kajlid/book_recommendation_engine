  "description": "“I’m a disciplined man, Jane. I can stay here for as long as you need before the lesson sinks in that you don’t run from me while in my charge.\" -- Soren. He's a Mercenary with powers that allow him feel the hearts / desires / fears of others. She's his target, and must guard her identity at all costs. My village is aflame, and a deadly legend becomes my captor. I’m to appear before the most elite faction of mercenaries and warlords, commanded to answer for a crime they refuse to explain. Even if my only guess for why they want me is wrong, they cannot have me. I’ve sworn to never return to Skull’s Row, home to thieves and killers; the graveyard of my childhood. He plans to unbury every memory until my soul is stripped bare: Soren, my captor, is strangely fascinated by me. By what I hide. Of the scars I have. I’m unwillingly drawn to him. To his brutality. He harbors the same viciousness that coats my veins. He even seems persistent in taking me for himself… He’ll either be my reckoning, or my undoing. This Dark Fantasy Romance is a Duet full of foul language, sensual scenes, and improper bastards. DUAL POV – his/her Duet with a Guaranteed HEA Content Warning 18+: This series contains explicit scenes (3.5 chili peppers), depictions of war, battle violence, abduction, graphic depiction of violence, drugging, and overall a very crude world.",
