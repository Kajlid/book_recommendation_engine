  "description": "When Jamie Randall kicked the dust of Amen, Texas from her heels, she swore neither the town nor the bad boy she'd given her virginity to would never see her again. Yet here she is, returning under a cloud of disgrace, not a penny to her name or a soul to welcome her--least of all the sheriff. Jamie Randall--a decade hadn't lessened the bitter taste of her name. Zane Cameron had only been good enough for sultry summer sex. But the local hell raiser is the sheriff now and determined to run her hot little body off the worthless piece of land her father left her and right out of his sleepy little town. Just as soon as he scratches a twelve-year-old itch. Explosive passion changes Zane's mind, but before they can explore their feelings, strange events threaten Jamie and it becomes obvious someone else wants her out of the way. Dirty money, cold-blooded murder, and deadly secrets interfere with Zane's plans to convince Jamie to give him a second chance.",
