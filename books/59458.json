  "description": "Kids won't want this hilarious read-aloud ride to end. Who says getting there isn't half the fun? It's hot. Hot, hot, hot! So Junie and Jake and Poppa and the baby want to go to the lake. But can they make it in their rattletrap car? It doesn't go fast, and it doesn't go far, but with the help of some razzleberry dazzleberry snazzleberry fizz, a beach ball, a surfboard, and a three-speed, wind-up, paddle-wheel boat, they're off to the lake where it's cool, cool, cool! Aaaahhh.Phyllis Root's wonderfully inventive wordplay and Jill Barton's spirited and expressive illustrations make this a read-aloud road trip to remember.",
