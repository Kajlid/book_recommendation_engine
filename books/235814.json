When Annie's classmate, Grant, commits suicide, Annie feels compelled to find out why. What she finds out is shocking - and makes Annie realize she and Grant had more in common than she thought. At the same time, Annie's work experience placement takes her to an old people's home, where she encounters a very old soldier, still shell-shocked from theFirst World War. His story locks together with Grant's and together they help Annie put together the pieces of her own personal jigsaw.",
