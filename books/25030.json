  "description": "Book two in the ‘Scars of Defiance’ series. When tyranny becomes law, defiance becomes duty. Sean Cutler’s parents, Paul and Sara, taught him by example how to defy the ruthless dictatorial ruler of Rendier, Victor Rawlings, by helping and hiding defectors. The latest border crosser in Sean’s care is a young woman disguised as a fifteen year old boy, beaten and broken, running from Rawlings just like everyone else. However, nothing is as it appears, and once it’s reported the dictator’s own daughter is missing, Sean is thrust into a world of shocking revelations, deceit, blackmail, and corruption. His courageous young defector holds the key to Rawlings’ undoing, if only Sean can keep her alive long enough to take her father down.",
