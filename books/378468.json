  "description": "A ho-hum existence. Perpetually single. A life vicariously lived through fantasy novels. Fed-up, down-on-her-luck Lily Drew makes a desperate plea to the universe for change. Something, anything so as to catapult her out of life as she knows it. “Ask and you shall receive,” responds the Universe. Love and excitement flood into Lily’s life all right, along with a heaping dose of danger, in the form of devilishly-handsome, vampire Quinn Ambrose. A vampire who unfortunately has a insatiable taste for Lily’s blood only. Be careful what you wish for, for the universe sure does have a wicked sense of humor.",
