  "title": "Santa Claus and Little Sister",
  "description": "Santa Claus and Little Sister is autobiographical in nature, selfishly therapeutic in design, and hard proof that we cannot control our future regardless how hard we try. This is a journey of one young optimistic East Coast teacher who taught at New Beginnings, a Los Angeles placement home for at-risk, mentally and physically abused, abandoned, gang, and socially-emotionally disturbed girls. He discovers that truth often becomes lies, moral transforms into immoral, and fear builds knowledge.",
