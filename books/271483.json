  "title": "One Action - Towards women’s dreams and ambitions",
  "description": "As a teenager, Sanya Khurana had very low self-esteem and was disgusted at not being ‘fit’ enough for the world. She sought acceptance in this patriarchal world, even at the cost of her passions and ambitions. In 2014, her father gifted her a book by Sheryl Sandberg, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead. After reading it, she started a Lean In Circle. As she began leading a circle, she started leading her life, and observed a significant change in her confidence and self-esteem, and was on the path of discovering herself, spreading awareness and making a change in small ways. In this book, Sanya refers to patriarchy as a bug in human minds, which grows with age. She talks about how the Indian media, film industry, rituals and customs strengthen the bug; the effects of ‘Log Kya Kahenge’ Syndrome on gender roles; and how unsafe cities become a psychological barrier for women. The book aims to encourage women in every part of the country to come together and fight gender inequality. Lean In India is an independent organization, affiliated with Lean In. Org, which works closely with Lean In. Org to further its mission, and is licensed by LeanIn. Org to use the ‘Lean In’ name.",
