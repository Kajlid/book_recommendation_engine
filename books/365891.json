  "description": "When family tragedy strikes, Sarah Slocum steps in as guardian to her two nieces and nephew. But raising children isn't like raising sheep, and the beautiful shepherd soon finds herself in over her head. Who'd have guessed that new neighbor Craig Macklin would jump in to lend a hand? Craig's always held a grudge against Slocums--Sarah included. Now the handsome local vet is helping with her livestock, giving her young nephew a job and smiling at her every chance he gets. Sarah must decide whether she can trust Craig--and God's plan--and allow him into her family.",
