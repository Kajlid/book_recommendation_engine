  "description": "In a world at war, the Dream Archipelago is a neutral zone, and therefore an alluring prospect to the young men on both sides of the conflict. In this interlinked collection of short stories and novellas, Christopher Priest explores war, relationships, and forms of reality. Each tale is a triumph of quiet, steady craftsmanship, a model of ingenious design and subtle implication, and as a group they further enrich each other by interlocking cleverly, symmetrically, and sometimes sinisterly.The Equatorial Moment (1999)The Negation (1978)Whores (1978)The Trace of Him (2008)The Miraculous Cairn (1980)The Cremation (1978)The Watched (1978)The Miraculous Cairn (1980)Original Appearances (2009) essay",
