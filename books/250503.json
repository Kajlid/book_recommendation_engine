  "description": "The famous (infamous) blog Girl with a One Track Mind, is now in book form. Who says men think about sex more than women do? Let Abby Lee share you here world of real-life sex, pleasure, BDSM, and more.Abby Lee is a smart, determined young woman who for almost three years has been writing an online journal about her sex life. Her writing is everything that writing about sex should be—frank, hysterical, provocative, and completely honest. Her website quickly attracted thousands of hits a day, with both men and women drawn to her observations about masturbation, one-night stands, and same-sex encounters.Diary of a Sex Fiend is the book version of her Girl with a One Track Mind blog. It is a year-long diary of Abby’s desires, fantasies, and anxieties as she tries to answer the why do I always think about sex? Celebrating both her sensuality and her physical needs, Abby explores a swingers’ club and a Dominatrix dungeon, and even participates in a pre-arranged three-way (which ends without any satisfaction for her).In between her new experiences are run-ins with lifelong friends; potential romances; and long, frustrating nights when all she really wants is a “great shag.” Whether she’s offering a girl’s guide to understanding date-speak or explaining to her parents why there’s a racy picture of her on their computer, Abby writes with a ribald eye and a fearless heart.",
