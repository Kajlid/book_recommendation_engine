  "title": "The Sense of Wonder",
  "description": "An inspiring meditation on the outdoors, with color photographs, by the legendary nature writer and New York Times–bestselling author of Silent Spring.  Rachel Carson shares her prescription for developing a lifelong respect for nature in this deeply personal essay, lavishly expanded and paced by Nick Kelsh’s vibrant photography in this posthumously published edition. Using her personal adventures with her young nephew Roger as examples, Carson urges parents to let their children’s natural excitement thrive as together they discover the wonders that lie outdoors, from the scuttling of a crab across the cool night sand to a spongy carpet of lichen in a forest. Originally published as a magazine piece, this essay showcases Carson’s core belief that a childlike excitement for beauty, for the new and unknown, and for the process of discovery is a gift to be nurtured—a gift that will sustain humanity and the health of the planet on which it depends. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Rachel Carson including rare photos and never-before-seen documents from the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University.",
