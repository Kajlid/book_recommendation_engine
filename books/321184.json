  "description": "Heidi Miller is desperate. That’s the one thing that keeps drumming in her mind as she walks into the strip club looking for a job. As a cocktail waitress, she’s only supposed to serve drinks, but when a hot stranger flashes a stack of cash, how can she turn it down? Reese Davis has never been to a strip club, and it’s his cousin’s fault he’s here tonight. All he wants to do is sit in a corner until it’s over, but the hot little waitress dressed as a school girl is enough to send him over the edge.",
