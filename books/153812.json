  "description": "Deep in the High Sierras, in a picturesque town surrounded by dense forests, children go missing and no one knows why. Are they lost, kidnapped, or runaways? The law, and the townspeople, believe what they wish. Lucy Doran knows differently. Because what she saw is the stuff of legends…and nightmares. Lucy’s best friend, Candy English, has boys and a deep dislike for a certain hapless girl on her mind. Candy says Lucy has a wild imagination, choosing to taunt her friend into following her example, even if it means defying their parents. It takes a village to raise a child. It might take a miracle to save them.",
