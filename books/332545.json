  "description": "Perfectionist event planner Blakely Mayfield screws up when a food poisoning debacle puts her career on the line. Battling bad press and her business partner’s “suggestion” to take a sabbatical, Blakely doesn’t think twice when her best friend offers up her mountain retreat in idyllic Greyson Gap, NC.Armed with the task of stepping out of her comfort zone by her therapist, Blakely quickly realizes that fresh mountain air, roommate chore charts, and Tucker Greyson, the annoyingly handsome housemate she didn’t bargain for, might not fix her broken ego. Finding herself stuck in between a surreal episode of The Bachelor run by the Greyson Gap Golden Girls brigade, and her hunky housemate wanting to be friends with benefits, Blakely discovers she kind of likes the simpler life—going camping, catching fish, wearing hiking boots, and, perhaps, falling in love.Ex- baseball star, Tucker Greyson, prefers to be alone in the small mountain town where he grew up. The last thing he needs is a high-strung, clean-obsessed roommate for the summer. He hatches a plan to drive her perfectionist sensibilities into overdrive and out of his house. What he doesn’t expect is to fall for her.He tells himself to keep it simple and not let his heart get involved, but when Blakely gets called back to her old life, Tucker realizes he has more to lose than just a summer roommate.",
