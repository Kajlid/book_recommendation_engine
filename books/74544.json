  "description": "One woman, three lives . . .Which will she choose?From the critically acclaimed author of the award-winning New York Times bestseller The Confessions of Max Tivoli comes the rapturously romantic story of a woman who experiences three alternate lives-and discovers that nothing can protect her from the unpredictability of love and the consequences of even her most carefully considered choices.\"The premise of this novel isn't that a woman travels through time: it's that 'the impossible happens once to each of us'. . . . What this wonderful novel teaches us is how magic works.\"-John Irving1985. After the death of her beloved twin brother, Felix, and the break up with her long-time lover, Nathan, Greta Wells embarks on a radical psychiatric treatment to alleviate her suffocating depression. But the treatment has unexpected effects, and Greta finds herself transported to the lives she might have had if she'd been born in a different era.During the course of her treatment, Greta cycles between her own time and her alternate lives in 1918, where she is a bohemian adulteress, and 1941, which transforms her into a devoted mother and wife. Separated by time and social mores, Greta's three lives are achingly similar, fraught with familiar tensions and difficult choices. Each reality has its own losses, its own rewards, and each extracts a different price. And the modern Greta learns that her alternate selves are unpredictable, driven by their own desires and needs.As her final treatment looms, questions arise. What will happen once each Greta learns how to remain in one of the other worlds? Who will choose to stay in which life?Magically atmospheric, achingly romantic, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells beautifully imagines \"what if\" and wondrously wrestles with the impossibility of what could be.",
