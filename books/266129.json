  "description": "Annie is a star cellist at music camp. She has had a renowned teacher, supportive parents, and years of experience in the competitive music-camp environment. Michael Harvey Lewis, an inner-city kid from Chicago, is Annie’s camp buddy and is just as good a cellist and just as competitive.    Now a major competition is only months away. A big scholarship is at stake. Winning will make it possible for one of them to win the scholarship, perform internationally, and go on to a career on stage and around the world.    But now at camp Annie finds she can’t play at all. She has damaged her elbow. She isn’t allowed to participate in rehearsals, or even in the final concert. Instead she must listen to everyone else play, including her arch-rival Michael Harvey.    In listening, she learns a life lesson, experiences love, and looks forward with new insights: Will she be able to compete for the big prize? Who does she want to win?",
