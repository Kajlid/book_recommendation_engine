Spirits are amiss in the town of Hollow Creek when a portal that should’ve stayed closed is accidentally opened. A Renaissance Festival plays host to a fantastical wonderland for Alyson and her friends. But beware... not every dark corner is empty.Alyson learns that sometimes in this magical world, you have to close your eyes… to see. And to forgive, you must first open your heart. For a true friendship is one of the greatest gifts you'll ever receive.",
