  "description": "For the New York Times bestselling author of Because You Are Mine and When I'm With You, Beth Kery, breaking the boundaries of desire has never been so daring, so dangerous, so…\nExplosive\n Dr. Sophie Gable wasn’t expecting her peaceful getaway to be shattered by the arrival of a half-dazed, dead-sexy guest. Thomas Nicasio has obviously been traumatized, and Sophie thinks she knows why. There’s something about his past that he can’t—or won’t—remember. Something that could get them killed. Most women would run from a man like Thomas. Not Sophie—even when she knows she’s playing with dynamite. She can’t resist his electrifying seduction. She doesn’t want to control her willing submission to him. And she knows she never should have taken it this far. Because now it’s too late. Thomas’s past is closing in on them. And as danger and desire collide, Sophie knows that his next touch could consume her—if it doesn’t kill her first.",
