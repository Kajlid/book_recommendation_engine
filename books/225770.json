  "description": "As he flies through the cloud-swept skies above Mount Olympus in his winged sandals, Hermes looks like a carefree youth. But he's actually ageless and divine--the son and personal messenger of Almighty Zeus. Known as Mercury, Wayfinder, and Prince of Thieves, Hermes is renowned for his quicksilver speed, nimble wits, and gift of Sight.He also brings luck to the living and comfort to the dead, navigating the perilous terrain between earth and Hades with enviable ease. But when the Trojan War erupts in all its grisly violence, Hermes is paralyzed with sorrow--and guilt. He believes he's made a grave error, one that led directly to the terrible conflict. And now he wants nothing more than peace.",
