  "description": "Juliet Baldwin.Type-A Teacher. Sam Ford.Ruler of Classroom Chaos. I, Juliet Baldwin, have my hands firmly on the wheel of life at ten-and-two, steering in the opposite direction of heartache. Teaching comes first, and nothing can stand in the way of bettering my students and achieving my professional goals. Except, of course, technology. When a grade level shift moves Sam Ford—everyone’s favorite rambunctious teacher, baseball coach, and technology wizard—to my seventh grade team, we butt heads more than we grade papers. But I need someone to help put together a video for my prestigious grant application—a project that I have invested a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into over the past several years. And while I can barely work my phone’s selfie camera, Sam just so happens to be the tech guru of the building. Suddenly, as I let him take over the video project for my grant, my reins are in Sam’s hands—someone I don’t trust, and someone who could very well break my heart. But as the layers slowly peel back, revealing much more than a charming smirk beneath his sexy beard, I start to wonder if placing my heart in someone else’s hands will be good for me, or if it will just further upset the apple cart.",
