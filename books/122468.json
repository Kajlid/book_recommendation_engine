  "title": "Always Emily: A Novel",
  "description": "“Based on the Brontë family of writers, MacColl’s story is filled with life and death, mystery, and witty humor”—a Junior Library Guild Selection (School Library Journal, starred review).   Emily and Charlotte Brontë are about as opposite as two sisters can be. Charlotte is practical and cautious; Emily is headstrong and imaginative. But they do have one thing in a love of writing. This shared passion will lead them to be two of the first published female novelists and authors of several enduring works of classic literature. But they’re not there yet. First, they have to figure out if there is a connection between a string of local burglaries, rumors that a neighbor’s death may not have been accidental, and the appearance on the moors of a mysterious and handsome stranger. The girls have a lot of knots to untangle—before someone else gets killed.   Includes bonus material!
