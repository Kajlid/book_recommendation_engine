  "description": "Small Elephant likes water . . . but not when it’s in a bath. Small Elephant’s mommy tries to make the bath more fun with toys and bubbles, but he is not fooled. He is too busy to take a bath. He has said no many times. He is getting very cross. And then he disappears! (Elephants who cannot be found cannot take baths.) But Small Elephant’s daddy has a way to make the bath fun. He may look silly doing it—but it just might work! With spare text and sprightly illustrations, Tatyana Feeney, three-time author of gently funny books for the youngest readers, takes on another very important toddler topic—bathtime!",
