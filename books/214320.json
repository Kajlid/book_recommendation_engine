  "description": "“I’ve often wondered what a Collector was doing in your house that night. A few days after you arrived here, your Goddess mark appeared and-” “My what?” I’m so confused by her words that I interrupt her. She motions to my hair that’s pulled up into a bun on top of my head “your hair. The streak of white is a Goddess mark. You never knew?” I shake my head. “Every Goddess marks her children. Athene’s are marked with grey eyes that are darker than any humans could be. Your hair marks you. I’m not familiar with every Goddess mark to know with certainty who marked you. We’ve been waiting for your powers to show themselves to fully know whose daughter you are.” I feel my mouth fall open “but...I’m...I’m human right?” This time it’s Theodora who answers “No. We might not be fully sure what you are but you are most certainly not human.”",
