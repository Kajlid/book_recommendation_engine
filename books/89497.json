She’s determined to make her horse Jinx into a champion and she dreams that her childhood friend William will one day see her, rather than her condition. So when William asks her out and Jinx is shortlisted for selection in an elite training program, it seems Melissa’s dreams have come true. But when her secrets are exposed, all those dreams come crashing down around her. Can William ever forgive her? And can she learn about letting go in time to truly ride on air when it matters most?",
