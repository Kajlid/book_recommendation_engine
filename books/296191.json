  "description": "\"In I Love You Are for White People , author Lac Su offers a face--his face--as a window into the experiences of impoverished Asian refugees. Su recounts the formative events of his childhood and adolescence, all of which bear the theme of searching for love and community within the confines of racial identity and socioeconomic status. From an academic perspective, many facets of Su's memoir are pregnant with social commentary but Su maintains focus on the humanistic aspects of his family's stories . . . emboldening us with the initiative to create a more hospitable America.\"- Leung, Chung (2014) \"Book Review: I Love Yous Are for White People,\" Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences: Vol. 36, Article 2.Â Stanford University, CA, USA",
