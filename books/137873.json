When she uncovers a mysterious book linked to her grandmother and a witch's coven, her journey begins. Guided by a cursed deck of oracle cards, Tess delves into The Hall of Shadows, a realm crafted by her ancestors. With each dimension traversed, she uncovers her true lineage—a descendant of mythical beings. As Tess's humanity wanes, her destiny beckons. At journey's end, she faces a choice: preserve or destroy the hall. In a tale of magic and identity, Tess's odyssey may end, but her legacy is just beginning—a testament to the power within us all.",
