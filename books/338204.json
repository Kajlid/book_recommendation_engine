  "description": "I’m damn good at what I do, but what I do is pretty damn bad. I came to America to build my empire. Watch it flourish. Used the people beneath me as stepping stones to reach my goals. Then Brianna Declan walked into my life, and untangled every scheme I had. She was a hurricane that set the winds of change in motion, and I got swept away in her almighty power. But she’s had a bad hand delt to her. A lousy father who throws himself at the mercy of dangerous men with cruel intentions. I’m one of them. I can make it right. Give her the life she deserves. My desires for greed and lust never changed. I’m still the mean son of a gun who’ll kick your ass for speaking out of turn. But what’s the use of having all this power if you can’t get what you want? And I want Brianna’s belly full with my children.",
