  "title": "The Summer of 1983",
  "description": "It's the summer of 1983 and 16-year-old Scott has started working his first job, in the kitchen of a posh French bistro. Scott is a good Catholic school boy who lives in a suburban bubble. That is, until he starts working at the bistro, where he meets people from different cultural and racial backgrounds who take Scott under their wings and introduce him to sex, drugs and New Wave rock 'n' roll. Scott is transformed virtually overnight, and, most important, discovers that he can't find love in the usual places a 16-year-old boy would look. Coming to terms with his budding homosexuality will take guts, and a lot of help from some gay bistro pals. \"1983\" is the story of one boy's coming of age and coming out at a time when being gay was not as accepted as it is today. And it's the story of friendships that turn the life of a boy named Scott upside down.",
