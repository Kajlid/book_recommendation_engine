  "description": "THE SWEET LITTLE SONGBIRD’S IN MY CAGE NOW.  She owes the Family money. Big money. And I’m the guy they sent to put the squeeze on her. So now she’s playing at my casino. Strutting around on my stage in her tight little shorts. Killing me softly. I promised she’ll be treated with respect, so long as she does as she’s told. But I didn’t count on her barging in my office and tempting me, begging for a taste of my authority. I didn’t count on her getting under my skin. And the last thing I want is to see her debt paid. Because then I’d have to set her free…  Note: This steamy stand-alone romance is the third in USA Today bestselling author Renee Rose's Vegas Underground series. No cheating, no cliffhangers.",
