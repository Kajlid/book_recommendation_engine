  "title": "You Can Change",
  "description": "Many books are written by experts. This book isn't one of them, ' admits Tim Chester. 'It was written out of my own struggle to change. My long battle with particular issues set me searching the Bible as well as writings from the past. This book shares the amazing truths I discovered that now give me hope. 'For years I wondered if I'd ever overcome certain sins. And while I can't claim to have conquered sin - for no one ever can do - here are discoveries that have led to change in my life and in the lives of others.' You may be: A new Christian, struggling to change the habits of your former way of life. An older Christian, feeling you've plateaued: you grew quickly when you first believed but now your Christian life is much of a muchness. A Christian who's fallen into sin in a big way, wondering how you'll ever get back on track. Other books describe how we should live, but this book outlines how we can change. It's about hope: the hope we have in Jesus, hope for forgiveness, and hope for real and lasting change. God promises liberating grace and transforming power to his people.",
