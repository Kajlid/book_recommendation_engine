  "title": "Mosaic: A Collection from the Instagram Poetry Community",
  "description": "“This collection features 62 rising (and often first-time) poets and creators, sourced from Instagram’s poetry community. The poets and creators featured in this anthology were asked to submit a work following only one that their work made them feel deeply. It was in wanting to give voice to many different creators, and all of their individual artistic perspectives, that this anthology was formed. The ability to create, and the ability to have your creations shared with the world, is important to all of we do not create only for ourselves, but rather to share our experiences and have them be understood in a way that, often, usual conversation does not do justice. Expression is an essential part of all our lives, and each unique perspective deserves to find a home for its voice. These pages are a beautiful, diverse collage of passion, depth, and poetic and artistic talent that I have been proud to assemble. I hope you enjoy our creative mosaic.” —Ava Balis, Poet and Editor",
