  "description": "Christian knights and medieval chivalry meet the magical pagan realms… Feisty Catherine defies every Christian doctrine, prayer, and curtsy expected from a daughter of a duke, as her connection to the mystical world fades.Druidic prophesies… When Crown Prince Philip arrives to wed her sister as arranged, their hearts ignite, but the intense attraction is soon smothered by his knightly devotion to the church. Seeking guidance from her missing mentor—the Druidic elder who taught her the Old Ways of alchemical magic—Catherine learns of an ancient prophesy foretelling her inherent abilities, and strives to vanquish the darkest of forces that hunger for her sleeping powers.Forbidden love… Catherine’s passions hold her wild heart captive in a quandary between Philip’s love and the enchantments of her past. Will she find her truth hidden within the shadows of the Old Magic or in the arms of Prince Philip? Or both?This is not your typical Medieval Romance novel… Immerse yourself into the conflict between the old world and the new—between pagan magic and the self-righteous binding of Christianity. Set in medieval France, it is historically accurate with a good dose of epic fantasy.This book has it all… love, war, triumphs, honor, tragedy, magic and betrayal—wrapped in an enchanting story filled with plot twists and complex, layered characters. The bittersweet ending is a redeemed heroine on a new mission… leaving the reader at once breathless and yearning for more, yet fulfilled with a new sense of magic.\n\"The author takes you beyond what you ever thought possible, and when you get there, you realize you've known yourself all along. \n\nI was at the mercy of every word.”\n Beta reviewer",
