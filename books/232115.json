Then why can’t he rein in his lust for her?If there is one man Uma should not be attracted to, it’s the father of the adorable five-year-old in her charge. Once burned twice shy, Zach is the captain of a Paris water polo team and a wealthy entrepreneur who can have any woman he wants. No strings attached. Small wonder he goes all out to shun Uma!But when, with the help of a bottle of fine wine, Zach confesses all the dirty things he’d like to do to her, Uma astounds him by saying she wants that, too. What’s a man to do but oblige?Besides, it’s not like it’s the end of the world. They’re both sensible, level-headed adults.
