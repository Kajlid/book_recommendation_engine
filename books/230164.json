  "description": "Choose Wisely: 35 Women Up To No Good is a feminist anthology of dark fiction, co-edited by H. L. Nelson and Joanne Merriam. Containing 35 stories of -bad- women, and -good- women who just haven't been caught yet, it features Joyce Carol Oates, Aimee Bender, Diane Cook, Tina Connolly, Kelly Luce, Cat Rambo, Nisi Shawl, Rachel Swirsky, and 28 other fearless women writers. -Composed of 35 gleefully dark short stories by and about women, this anthology is a welcome antidote to the conventional world of women's fiction. Don't get me wrong, I adore Alice Monroe and agree that the minutely observed world of everyday life is just as viable a form of literature as the more adventurous fiction dominated by men, but, still, there's something so energizing about girls who kill, or chase ghosts, or bide their time in strange worlds of the future. If there's a mother daughter story in here, it's likely to involve a little serial kidnapping as well. If dad was a sexual predator, then his little girl is going to be one too. Super heroes, with costumes, terrifying weapons, and all too human foibles abound. . . I don't know how anyone can read this book and not feel energized.- -Vickie Fang, -Choose Wisely: 35 women up to no good, - Best New Fiction, 5 May 2015 -Inside are a number of writers I downright worship. . . a stellar collection of high caliber writing. -David S. Atkinson, -InReview: Choose Wisely, - InDigest, 30 April 2015",
