While on patrol during the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Mike makes the acquaintance of a lovely Salvation Army bell ringer, Karen O’Leary, who is struggling to support herself and her young daughter. As their paths cross during the festive holiday season in Manhattan, Karen teaches the tough World War II veteran how to support and love his family.

There Max reconnects with Sarah Peterson, his sister’s old schoolmate who now organizes relief missions for the United Nations. Sparks fly as the pair gets reacquainted over various holiday events, but when Max realizes that Sarah will leave for the Middle East the day after Christmas, he has a decision to make—convince her to stay, wait for her to return, or go with her to the one place to which he never thought he’d return.",
