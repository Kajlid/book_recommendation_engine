The hunters have become the hunted.Life on the run is no winter picnic, especially when my partner sees himself as the sheriff, not the outlaw.It's a cat-and-mouse game across the Last Frontier with agents and vampires out for blood while Fane searches desperately to find me before rogue vampires do.Surviving the Alaskan wilderness isnâ€™t nearly as treacherous as resisting the turmoil of seclusion and temptation.I fear I'll never see Fane again.The road to freedom has never felt more uncertain.",
