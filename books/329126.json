  "description": "Obsessed – to be preoccupied or fill the mind with someone continually and to a troubling extent.As soon as I realized she existed, I lost the ability to look away. She was always destined to be mine.I’m Sebastian Lockwood; a king among men. And kings get to take what they want.My little bird disagreed. She fought me, disobeyed me even though we both know she belongs to me. So I broke her, bent her to my will.I pushed too hard, loved too much and she ran from me.But letting her go was impossible. So I chased; hiding in the shadows, silently pulling the strings that would bind her to me.Two years have passed, I’ve waited long enough. It’s time to reclaim my queen; to take what’s mine.The trap is set, a gilded cage worthy of royalty and only I have the key. I’ll make her pay for leaving me. I’ll make her love me, want me as much as I do her.I couldn’t stop if I tried. She’s my obsession.***Obsession was originally published as part of the Filthy Elites: An Anthology of Enemies to Lovers Romance Standalone Novels***",
