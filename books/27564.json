  "description": "Follow the band Moondog Three as they hit the road and tour the United States. Philadelphia, Athens, New Orleans, Austin, San Francisco... Daron learns there's much more to holding a band together than good music. What's a young, gay guitarist to do when his father's a homophobic jerk who might be embezzling from the band and his lead singer can't decide which he wants more, control of the band or love? Sex, drugs, and rock and roll... if only it were that simple.",
