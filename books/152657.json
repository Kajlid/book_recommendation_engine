  "title": "Mr and Mrs Pennington",
  "description": "Susan Lorimer, pretty, intelligent and 19 years old, was not short of admirers; Mr. Feilden was flattered by her interest in his lectures; war-scarred Captain Small adored her for her sympathy; Mr. Bulgin, the scheming Halesby (Hales Owen) industrialist, thrice her age, wanted to marry her, not merely for good financial reasons. But it was on holiday at ‘Bracing, Brinton-le-Sands’ that young, naive Dick Pennington fell in love with her at first sight. A fortnight’s courtship on his unreliable motorcycle was enough time for her to accept his offers. This novel is the story of their first year of marriage. Their hideous, jerry-built bungalow at Tilton (Quinton), a growing suburb of North Bromwich (Birmingham), the nearby countryside of Worcestershire and Shropshire, so much associated with Francis Brett Young, the uncertainties of life in the Midlands after World War I, and the temptations of the 'flapper' culture of the 1920's all have a part to play in this fascinating tale",
