  "title": "A World Undivided: A Quest for Better Healthcare Beyond Geopolitics",
  "description": "Are we ready for the next global health threat? COVID-19 opened the world’s eyes to the inadequacies of our global healthcare system, and it’s on us to change what happens next.Through personal accounts gathered during his nearly forty years of experience in global health, infectious disease physician Joseph Saba provides an eye-opening analysis of healthcare’s resistance to globalization and the implications for our health. His story contrasts the world’s unified response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic with the chaotic handling of COVID-19 to explain healthcare’s dependence on geopolitics. Using anecdotes from his time at the World Health Organization and negotiating medication access with pharmaceutical companies, Joseph shares unparalleled insight into what is needed to expedite solutions for today’s most critical healthcare challenges.A World Undivided invites all readers to see healthcare delivery from a different angle and proposes a less traveled, but more human way forward.All proceeds from the book will be donated to support treatment for patients in need in low- and middle-income countries.",
