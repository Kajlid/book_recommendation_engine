  "description": "Breaking the rules never felt so good…  Forced to drop out of law school, Steven Power became a private investigator. Ten years later a client gives him a chance for revenge, but shutting down a blackmail scheme won’t be easy. In order to succeed, Steven has to break a lot of rules, including dominating his compelling client.  When wealthy submissive Jonathan House lost his long-time Dom, he rushed into another relationship, only to find himself at the hands of an abusive blackmailer. Determined to be free of him, Jonathan hires Steven, but surrendering to his masterful PI wasn’t supposed to be part of the plan.  Both men are willing to cross the line between business and pleasure, but will they feel the same about crossing the line between sex and love?",
