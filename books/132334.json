When a golden horn is discovered in the grave of an ancient anglo-saxon settlement, Lacy has a feeling that she is connected to it. Then her half-sister, Sophie, comes to stay for a week, and sinister events start to occur. It seems as if a child-ghost has developed an unhealthy interest in Sophie and is leading her into danger. Lacy has to call on all her psychic powers to protect her sister and discover the reason for the ghost's visit. Can the golden horn provide her with an answer?",
