  "description": "THE CONCLUDING STORY of Aimee and Kestrel, begun in THE TRAVELING MAN ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ How many times do you gamble on love? When love has knocked you down, should you give it another chance? When does optimism become stupidity? And what happens when the man you’re in love with is never still, always moving, always traveling? Do you say goodbye, or do you leave behind everything that you’ve worked for, everything that you’ve ever known? Can a traveling carnival be my home? Oh. You thought I had the answers. No, sorry. No answers, just a lot of questions—and a heart that wants to rule my head. Can one person be my home?",
