  "description": "She has a crush on the delivery guy. He has a billion-dollar secret.I recognize the sound of his truck turning off in front of my building.Not only do I recognize it, but my pulse picks up and I get all hot and bothered. Then I hear the low growl cutting out, followed by the clank of metal as he pulls up the back door to grab my package….Grab my package? That sounds so dirty. Which is probably appropriate given some of the fantasies I’ve had about him. My obsession with the new, mysterious delivery driver is crazy. Intense. Distracting.The last thing I need is to be crushing on a six-foot-something distraction with a dirty grin.But my friends have other plans.",
