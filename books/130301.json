  "title": "The First and Second Declarations of Havana",
  "description": "Nowhere are the questions of revolutionary strategy that today confront men and women on the front lines of struggles in the Americas addressed with greater truthfulness and clarity than in the First and Second Declarations of Havana, adopted by million-strong assemblies of the Cuban people in 1960 and 1962. These declarations which were circulated widely in the Americas at the time stand today as they did more than four decades ago as manifestos of revolutionary struggle by working people the world over. Includes new preface by Mary-Alice Waters, special 12-page photo section, glossary, chronology, index.",
