  "title": "Duke of Manhattan",
  "description": "I was born into British aristocracy, but I’ve made my fortune in Manhattan. New York is now my kingdom.  Back in Britain my family are fighting over who’s the next Duke of Fairfax. The rules say it’s me--if I’m married. It’s not a trade-off worth making. I could never limit myself to just one woman.  Or so I thought until my world is turned upside down. Now, the only way I can save the empire I built is to inherit the title I’ve never wanted-- so I need a wife.  To take my mind off business I need a night that’s all pleasure. I need to bury myself in a stranger.  The skim of Scarlett King’s hair over my body as she bends over . . .  The scrape of her nails across my chest as she screams my name . . .  The bite of her teeth on my shoulder just as we both reach the edge . . .  It all helps me forget.  I just didn’t bargain on finding my one night stand across the boardroom table the next day.  She might be my latest conquest but I have a feeling Scarlett King might just conquer me.  A sexy, standalone romance.",
