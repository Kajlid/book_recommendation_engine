Level Three is autistic -- but he's a magician, too, and there is no way to block his ability to trap people within his imaginary mental worlds. When magic doesn't work, and they have only their wits, how can the kids survive in the deadly realm of an unpredictable genius child? Thrill to a bloody and costly magical battle in Paris -- puzzle at the frightening mystery of why Mermelstein is stalking Level Three's sister -- and wonder at over a hundred pages of comedy, mystery, poems, songs, and logical puzzles as Simon and his friends struggle against all your favorites from Lewis Carroll -- and new creatures as well! Magic fans of all ages will never want to wake up -- from Level Three's Dream!Praise for The Ghost in the \"...[T]he magic is impressive.
