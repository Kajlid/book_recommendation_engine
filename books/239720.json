  "description": "I should have known my quest for vengeance would eventually be my downfall. I should have been more careful, more paranoid--but I'm glad I wasn't. Who knew that getting caught for my crimes would lead to so much happiness?  But joy can be fleeting...  It turns out, this battle is only just beginning. With ultimate power on the line, my faceless enemies will stop at nothing to capture me, dead or alive. I need to master my abilities, fast, or this could be the end for someone I care far too deeply about.  I'm Kit Davenport and this is going to be a bumpy flight.",
