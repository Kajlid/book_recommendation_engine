  "description": "It's September 2010 and Carmen Gentile - a freelance reporter embedded with American troops in Afghanistan - is pondering his perpetual poverty and why the woman he's supposed to wed thinks he's an asshole.Though he can't imagine his life getting any worse, a man wielding a rocket launcher is gracious enough to show him how, firing an explosive ordnance straight at his head.Blinded in one eye, his cheek bone reduced to shattered toothpicks, Carmen relies heavily on his dark sense of humor to make the best of a truly one-of-a-kind bad situation.\"Kissed by the Taliban\" is his look at the lighter side of getting shot in the face and coming out the other end all the better for it.",
