  "description": "Mary, a mischievous eleven-year-old, is pulled into a risky missing person’s case and finds herself dodging nefarious miscreants who are after a long-hidden journal that she has uncovered. When an old photograph surfaces that provides clues to Mary’s own family mystery, it isn’t long before it’s revealed that the two cases are intertwined and the young girl must solve the case before she becomes a missing person herself.With a backdrop of dark humor and intrigue, this book is the first in The M. Goose Chronicles, and aims to combine a classic feel with a contemporary mystery story, using artful language and is steeped in serious humor and crafty storytelling. Reminiscent of Lewis Carroll’s voice of Alice along with the drollery style of Lemony Snicket, the book will have middle-grade readers enjoying the fun and inventive twists to the characters and places of their beloved nursery tales.",
