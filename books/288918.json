  "description": "My name is Tamsin Vale. I’m the last known fairy and I haven’t gotten busted on that yet. I passed my midterms, which seemed like an impossibility a few months ago given I didn’t finish high school and I’m working on that at the same time. But with a lot of hard work and the support of people I’ve helped and new friends, I’m building a life I didn’t think I could ever have.  It’s still an adjustment. I mean, a few months ago I thought I was human with powers and now I’m hooking up with a dragon prince. Oh, and there’s my powerful warlock professor that I’m also involved with. It’s all casual and fun, but I wonder if it would be more if I was able to connect with them emotionally.  Is it even really smart to try given what else I’m facing? I mean, I am trying to save all of Faerie and find out what happened to fairies. It’s killing me not to know and to move at a turtle’s pace, but one false move and I’m dead… Along with all hope of them returning to this world with me.  Hey, who doesn’t love to work under that kind of pressure?  Artemis University is an ongoing hot burning reverse harem, university-age paranormal academy series with darker elements, strong language, violence, and a heroine who follows her own moral compass of what is right… And who she ends up giving her heart to.",
