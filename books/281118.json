  "description": "The Great Library isn't what it used to be.Last time Harold Adams was there, he rode a white stallion ahead a thousand soldiers in the service of the Sand King. Hundreds of monks lined the walls guarding the books, and mighty towers rose to the clear blue sky. They dined on soup, all of them, three times a day, fine broth like they had never tasted before.It's ruins now, with just the two monks and the ragged orphans they care for.Mercenaries, Will Adams and his grandfather, Harold, honor a contract drawn up some three hundred years previous, to protect whoever wears the symbol they carry. What if they can't find it, and what happens now his grandfather is dead on the cold stone floor?If the red faced monkeys don't get Will, it'll be that massive orc with no neck, or the reptilian girl or the green eyed woman with wild eyes or the long dead monks trapped in the catacombs.Either way, Will Adam isn't about to give in till he finds out why he's there.",
