  "description": "Being probed by aliens was only the beginning...I was abducted by incompetent aliens. They didn't know what they were doing and they still don't have a clue. Now that we're done with all the probing, they're taking lessons in 'Caring for Vulnerable Females' and 'Nest Building for Beginners' and want to turn me into their mate. And no, they don't listen when I tell them I don't need a nest. In theory, I could fall for these three hunky aliens who can bring me more pleasure than I ever dreamed of, but we're being watched and analysed every minute of the day. A creepy professor from the Intergalactic University uses us as examples for her lessons, sometimes with dangerous consequences, and there's nothing we can do about it.I don't want to be a science experiment, but can I resist falling for the aliens who stole me from Earth? The first part of this hilarious sci-fi romance trilogy is published in the Stolen and Seduced anthology, but all three books can be read as standalones. If you want sexy aliens who will protect their mate at all cost, a sassy female who doesn't need protecting, plus every single alien abduction trope imaginable, scroll up and read this book today. Beware, you may be abducted at any moment, so don't waste time.",
