  "title": "Hands of My Father: A Hearing Boy, His Deaf Parents, and the Language of Love",
  "description": "With candor and humor, Uhlberg recounts a childhood spent largely as a bridge between his parents and the hearing world. Translating from sign language to spoken language and back again, he enables his father to communicate with local shopkeepers, awakens his parents when his baby brother cries, and even interprets at a less-than-glowing parent-teacher conference. At times, he's embarrassed by his parents, and hurt that his father is called \"dummy.\" But in the end, his overwhelming love and compassion leaves a lasting effect.",
