  "description": "\"A cheeky tale for recession-era romantics,\" (\"More\") from a bestselling author  The year is 2006 and Holly Talbott is married to the founder of Comer Capital at the apex of excess on Wall street. Sure, Holly loves being a stay-at-home mom and keeping house accounts at all the best places, but there are some downsides to being Mrs. Hedgefund. Even botox can't beautify her mother-in-law's withering stares, and her husband, Tim, is away so often it feels like she's single again. So when it turns out that not all of Tim's trips have been for business, the newly minted divorcee ventures beyond the Upper East Side and finds that sometimes exes have all the fun.  Impeccably rendered with wit and style, \"The Ex-Mrs. Hedgefund\" is an old-fashioned love story and a celebration of New York-in any economy.",
