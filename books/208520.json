  "description": "Listening Length: 7 hours and 21 minutes Dragon Shifter Novel Dragon shifters are a dying breed. There are so few females left that, if drastic measures are not taken, and soon, it’ll be over for the species. The threat of extinction looms.King Blaze finally accepts that there is no other option but to evoke an age old tradition. The Hunt. The eligible dragon shifter males must hunt a handful of females. It’s first catch, first serve. The biggest problem is that the females are human. Weak and breakable. In Blaze's opinion, not capable of surviving the hunt, let alone the mating that will follow. He doesn’t believe that a lowly human is capable of birthing him a royal heir, so he sends his brother in his place.The last thing Coal wants is a human mate. A human. Never. He can’t believe Blaze is using him in this way. Especially when most of the males in their tribe are willing to accept one of these puny females. Not him. He’s never rutted with one and doesn’t have any desire, whatsoever, to rut with one in the future, let alone mate and impregnate one. Yet now, he is being forced to take part in the hunt, to win a female and to mate her. Not an easy feat considering there are three other dragon tribes vying for the opportunity. How the hell is he supposed to do all of this when he doesn’t want to come within a mile of one of these unsavory creatures? Humans are not for him.  This book can be read as a standalone but would be best enjoyed as a part of the series (Start with Chosen by the Vampire Kings). No cliffhanger!  The story contains strong sexual themes/language and is not intended for readers under the age of 18.",
