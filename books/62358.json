  "title": "The Ploy of Cooking",
  "description": "(Ordering info appears at the end of description.) The Ploy of Cooking is the second compilation of works by The Mystic Order of East Alabama Fiction Writers. Each author has contributed a collection of anecdotes, short stories, and/or poems with tangentially connected recipes. It won't take long for the discerning reader to see that each author has her own unique relationship to food and cooking, and the reader is advised to cook the recipes at his or her own discretion. The book is whimsically illustrated by Mystic member Margee Bright-Ragland. Part recipe book, part anthology of fiction/memoir, and part coffee-table book, The Ploy of Cooking is as adaptable as the recipes it contains. Order through email: mysticfictionwriters@gmail.com",
