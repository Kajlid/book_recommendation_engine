  "description": "What would it be like to live on Mars? Find out in The Callahan Kids: Tales of Life on Mars, an anthology for middle-school readers created by science fiction writers and a team of engineers at 4Frontiers Corporation. The stories take place at Bradbury Base, a realistic Mars settlement that is full of surprises for the first kids growing up there. The nine original tales in the book are beautifully illustrated by Michael Carroll whose artwork has flown in space. Contributors include Hugo-winning author Ben Bova, young adult authors Jim Denney and Rebecca Rowe, artist Phil Smith, former NASA flight controller Marianne Dyson, space scientist Brian Enke, and aerospace engineer Tom Hill. Proceeds will support educational projects to promote the human settlement of the space frontier (by the kids who read this book!).",
