  "description": "Amelia Earhart: This Broad Ocean, a graphic novel written by Sarah Stewart Taylor and illustrated by Ben Towle, tells the story of Amelia Earhart's historic crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in 1928.Earhart developed a love of flying at a very young age...and she wasn't about to let any man get in the way of her dreams. What began as a simple joy became something much deeper — a commitment to open doors for all women. As Earhart built a name for herself in the field of aviation — breaking numerous records along the way — she paved the road for future trailblazers, women like Danica Patrick, the first woman to win an Indy car race, and Eileen Collins, the first female space shuttle pilot.Taylor and Towle's book offers a glimpse at her relentless ambition and her tireless will to promote women's rights. But above all, author and illustrator leave us with a sense of her deep-rooted desire to touch the sky.",
