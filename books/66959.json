  "description": "When Ai becomes lost in a deep forest where snow gathers and darkness creeps, she encounters a group of strange children who are telling stories around a camp fire. The stories frighten her, but more than that, the children are scary too. Who are they and why are they out in the woods in the middle of the night? Only the girl with glass eyes has the answer, but Ai must listen to each story carefully before everything becomes clear...'He stood in the field going slowly insane,  While the lightning crashed and the wind tossed the rain, He tore off his head, threw it into the stream,  Then screwed on the pumpkin and let out a scream!'",
