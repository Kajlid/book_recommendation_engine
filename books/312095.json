  "description": "A beast. A beauty. A twisted tale as old as time itself. My father stole from the devil, and now the devil wants payment: his life. But my father makes a deal and tells the devil he can have my life instead. Maximus is dark, cold, vicious and violent. His desire is wild and his heart is as black as they come. Pain, pleasure; it’s all the same to the devil himself. I can’t escape, and the weird thing is, I don’t want to. I might fight, but deep down, I know it right away: the fire is explosive and addictive… and it hurts. Love, hate; it all hurts. I guess it’s true, what they say. These violent delights have violent ends.",
