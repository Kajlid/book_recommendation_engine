And soon I’ll get to hang out with the coolest, cutest boy in the Southwest. Life is so good.Except I should tell you that I’m not actually in San Diego for fun.

And I have to do it because my supercop mom is counting on me. Did I mention she’s a ghost? A ghost who can makecontact with only one person. Me, Sherry Holmes Baldwin. My mom is flunking out of the Academy of Spirits, and if I don’t help her, she’ll be banished to an afterlife for ghost failures.But . . . I so don’t do mysteries.",
