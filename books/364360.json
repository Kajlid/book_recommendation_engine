  "description": "A creationist response to the National Academy of Scienceâ€™s Teaching About Evolution and the Nature of Science. The latter, distributed nationwide to thousands of public school teachers, is an effort to saturate students with evolutionary concepts. Refuting Evolution is a cogent rebuttal, carefully examining the points raised in the NAS science and religion; natural selection; bird evolution; astronomy; the age of the earth, etc.",
