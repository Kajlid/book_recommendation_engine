  "description": "Proceed with caution...Mr. Brennan is a sometime poet, and he brings to the weird tale the poet's incisive sensibliity, the magic that provokes chills down the spine, the web of words that weaves the reader into a quivering trap of fear. From the oozing terror of SLIME to the nightmare of CANAVAN'S BACK YARD, these are the tales that offer the best of Joseph Payne Brennan's early work in the macabre to readers who however jaded, will find it difficult to forget the crawling horror that surrounds these stories like an aura. You have been warned.",
