  "description": "Identical twin sisters Goldie and Godiva take a wild and funny romp through the glitzy world of TV chefs - in search of a killer. When Godiva Olivia DuBois, a.k.a. G.O.D. – an advice columnist from Beverly Hills – takes her niece Chili to a taping of the TV cooking show Flirting with Food she’s selected from the audience as a food taster – and winds up in the hospital with food poisoning. Chili’s mother, Goldie Silver, an ‘aging hippie’ living in Alaska, already sensed trouble through a psychic bond with her twin and immediately hopped on a plane to California. Together these two wisecracking amateur sleuths try to solve the ‘who’s sabotaging the cooking show’ mystery – with the help of their 80 year old mother Flossie and their Uncle Sterling – both former Vaudeville magicians. Godiva develops a personal interest in handsome Chef Caesar Romano, the star of the show, who just happens to need a new assistant. Chili – already an experienced sous chef – is offered the position but her chance at stardom may be short-lived, because someone wants to eliminate Caesar, the reigning Gourmet Gladiator champion, from the upcoming competition. When this year’s glitzy tournament begins, rivalry quickly turns to murder. Romano is arrested for the crime, and the sisters set out to prove he’s innocent. Can they stir up the cooking pot to flush out the real killer without getting into too much hot water?",
