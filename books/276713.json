  "description": "Wyatt Davies is faced with a hard choice: give up being a veterinarian or give up the family horse racing farm he inherited. He has one chance to save the farm and that chance lies with horse trainer Camila Callahan.  Camila was raised by the United Kingdom's greatest horse trainer, and he taught her everything he knew. But everyone always saw her as the cute girl in pigtails riding on her dad's shoulders instead of the great trainer she could be if given the chance. And then she saw an ad about an opportunity in the United States.  Camila leaves everything behind to go all in with Wyatt Davies only to discover Wyatt has a horse with huge potential. And with that potential comes a lot of danger. Wyatt and Camila are in a race to uncover the threat as both of their careers and lives are at stake.  After all . . . nothing ventured, nothing gained.",
