  "description": "Death wears pumps. And that isn’t even the worst part of her day. Being a reaper isn’t nearly as easy as flipping hamburgers, but Jazz has never been one to shrug off responsibility. Still, she isn’t happy about visiting the state penitentiary to reap the soul of a serial killer. Years ago, Theodore Salazar killed two people near the Eastwood River, but that’s all over and done with. With the infamous serial killer dead, the city can breathe a sigh of relief. That relief doesn’t last long. The morning after Salazar’s death, the killings start up again. The police think they are copycat killings, but Jazz knows better. There’s a killer on the loose in Eastwood and it isn’t a copycat or Salazar’s ghost. Eastwood is about to discover that the legend of the Chain Man is real, and deadly. Brock Logan, president of the Death Dogs MC, is still chasing Jazz, and she’s very tempted to let him catch her, but then the leader of the Shadow Riders reveals something that makes her doubt Brock and the Death Dogs. If that isn’t enough chaos, Sir Edward suddenly develops an addiction to TV game shows. It’s all part of life when you are Jazz the Reaper.",
