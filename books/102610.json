  "description": "His mother died giving birth to him, and fair and handsome Daniel de Spinney, only son and heir to a Scottish duke, is about to succeed his father to the duchy of Heathershire. An alcoholic with a short temper, and maybe more important, a man with a secret, Daniel waits until his father croaks to tell his half-sister Lady Lydia that he’s been thirsting for her, and that she’s the only woman whom he will have bear his children. When Lydia proves disinclined, and the law and his extended family get in his way, Daniel takes matters into his own hands.",
