  "description": "At last, the perfect lover. Now what? Stake him, shoot him - or screw him?A Biting Love story.Elena O'Rourke lusts for two things - her detective's shield and a good lay. Sass-C gal's - Bad Girl Sex Tips - will win her the man. But keeping the shield hinges on solving a murder. Warrior-gorgeous Bo Strongwell stands in her way. Powerful as a Viking warship, Bo would be Elena's one-stop solution to celibacy - except for his apartment building full of mysteries. Plus, his kisses - and nibbles - and full body tongue-swipes - keep distracting her from the case. As if a caped clown named Dracula, a hooker with a heart of gold (and boobs of steel), and Elena's own clueless partner aren't distraction enough.Bo Strongwell is a master vampire who needs a cop snooping around like he needs a garlic enema. Fighting rogues keeps him busy enough without Elena trying to pin the murder on one of his kind - even if she does taste like heaven.Two fighters for justice. One incredible attraction. A terrible secret. Drunken women dancing on the bar: It all rides on Elena solving the Case of the Punctured Prick.Warning: Jammed with hot explicit sex, graphic fanged violence, and acid cop humor. May contain donuts.",
