  "title": "Great Russian Short Stories",
  "description": "From romanticism to realism, nineteenth-century Russian fiction gave the world masterworks of the imagination from such authors as Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Gorky, and Turgenev. This outstanding collection now allows readers to experience their themes, styles, and characters in thirteen carefully selected short stories - tales that fully reveal the quintessential nature of the Russian writer creating under the tsars. From Pushkin at the beginning of the period, whose work contains the essence of what Russian realism would become, to Gorky, who bridged the days of the 1917 Revolution in his brilliant writings, they were artists moved by the spirit of their land, new political ideas and ideals, and the ancient, dark soul of the Slavic people. Passionate or violent, tormented, humorous, cynical, or shining with unparalleled lyricism, these are magnificent stories created by some of the greatest authors of all time.
