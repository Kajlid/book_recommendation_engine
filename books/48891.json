  "description": "Update: A Third Edition of this book is now available.The Second Edition of Nutrition For Children: Practical and To-The-Point builds on the previous edition while retaining a concise reference format. There are more foods included in the listings for each age group (ages 1 to 13 are covered), and there is a new section that summarizes all of the essential nutrients.One goal of this book is to be an efficient \"go to\" reference that is more convenient and less complex than other sources of information. The introductory material can be understood in minutes, while the food listings can be used for years as your family grows. This information also demonstrates how different types of food contribute to a well-balanced diet.Nutrients that may be difficult to obtain even with a balanced diet are highlighted in the food listings, and nutritional supplements are suggested where appropriate. With some planning, it is possible to build confidence that a child is receiving adequate amounts of every essential nutrient, which is an important milestone in establishing their long-term health.",
