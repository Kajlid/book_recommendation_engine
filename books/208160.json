Ignored by her father, bullied by her mother, overshadowed by her brother, sixteen-year-old Cassie Wyndham yearns to do her part for the war effort. But after years of feeling forgotten and neglected, Cassie doubts she has anything of value to offer, especially when her pastor requests volunteers for a new ministry program at the local POW camp. Risking the ire of her mother, Cassie signs up, despite her fear of the infamous Germans. There, she meets Friedrich Naumann. Funny and kind, she is drawn to him right away. As their friendship blossoms into something more, Cassie and Friedrich struggle to keep their feelings from the rest of the world. But time is running out, and it won't be long before the war ends and they have to say goodbye... If their secret relationship isn't discovered first. An inspiring, emotionally-charged historical romance, Love Song (Liebeslied) is a novel about love that has the power to change and overcome, and the sacrifices it sometimes requires.",
