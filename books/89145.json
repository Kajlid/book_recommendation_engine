  "description": "a seven-year-old girl puts a nail gun to her grandmother's neck and fires. An isolated incident, say the experts. The experts are wrong.When anthropologist Hesketh Lock travels to Taiwan to investigate sabotage in the timber industry, he has no reason to connect the events there with the incidents back home. Or with the increasingly odd behaviour of his beloved step-son. That is, until shocking events in Taiwan and a global epidemic of child violence force him to reasses his life, his career and his role as a father. Part psychological thriller, part dystopian nightmare, The Uninvited is a powerful and unsettling portrait of apocalypse in embryo.",
