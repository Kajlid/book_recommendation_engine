  "description": "From the New York Times Bestselling author of Stepbrother Dearest...  Nina Kennedy was alive…but not living…until she met him.  Planes, trains, heights…you name it, Nina was afraid of it and led a sheltered life ruled by irrational fears and phobias. When she moves to Brooklyn for nursing school, that life is turned upside down, as she develops an intense but unwanted attraction to her gorgeous roommate, who’s pierced, tattooed and just happens to be the smartest person she’s ever met.  Behind Jake Green’s rough exterior and devilish smile, lies a heart of gold. He makes it his mission to change Nina’s outlook on life. When he agrees to tutor her, they forge a bet and the stakes are high as Jake forces Nina to face her demons. He just wasn’t expecting to fall hard for her in the process.  What Nina doesn’t realize, is that Jake has been living his own private hell. Once he drops a bombshell, will their love survive it?  Told in two parts from both Nina and Jake’s points of view, Jake Undone is a STANDALONE story and a companion to the novel, Gemini.  ***Author's note: Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.",
