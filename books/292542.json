  "description": "EVEN THE STRONGEST HEART CAN BREAK.GabeI can’t be with you anymore. She tore out my heart with those words six years ago, as I lay recovering in a hospital bed. But her leaving cut deeper than any wound I bore on my flesh.  Now she’s back, desperate to make amends. I swore I’d never forgive her, but one look and I’m back to a place where she loved me.  One kiss—her hands on my body, my name on her lips—makes me wonder . . . is there hope among the ruins of us?MiaI didn’t want to leave him.But I had to. Back then, staying seemed impossible. I was held captive by my own fear. It wouldn’t allow me to see that loving him was all I needed. I’m not the same scared girl I was then. I’m ready to surrender to everything I feel. But there’s something he doesn’t know—the real reason why I left.  And once he finds out, the second chance I've dreamed of might be nothing but a fantasy.",
