  "title": "Smart Girl, stupid world: Choosing right in a world gone wrong",
  "description": "The choices women make during the critical years of adolescence and early adulthood often have life-long consequences. Image, immorality, and recklessness reign in Western culture, and scarcely can a woman escape the drift of stupidity unless she is prepared to fight. Her weapon? Wisdom—a subject emphasized throughout the Bible but rarely discussed in homes, churches, or schools. Not a list of do’s and don’ts… but clear, guiding principles that can be applied in the most desperate situations to preserve a young woman’s destiny.Through tragic and inspiring real-life stories, Sarah Siegand paints a vivid picture of wisdom and stupidity, while boldly offering truth and perspective to bring readers to a place of decision. With vulnerability and humor, Siegand beckons young women, and those who lead them, to discover purpose and redemption as they form personal action plans for the future. Written in a format perfect for small groups and mentoring relationships, Smart Girl, Stupid World is a daring call to wisdom for an emerging generation.",
