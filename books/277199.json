  "description": "Poul Anderson has long been known for his love affair with the legends and myths of the great Norse heroes. Coordinating, translating, re-telling the scattered heroic literature could only be the work of a scholar and a lover of the genre. That Mr. Anderson also happens to be a talented writer is our great good luck. Ballantine Books Adult Fantasy Series is proud to present HROLF KRAKI'S SAGA, a keening, blood-rimed tale of men who walked like gods.",
