  "description": "Keep your eyes on the sky…As the melancholic winter fades and fragile seeds of hope begin to bloom, these 12 stories pay tithe to the changing season.Vengeful women, forlorn sirens, and strange beasts mirror the coming of spring and the reclamation of the landscape – for better or for worse. Yet, even as worlds are made anew, one thing remains constant… the moon.All proceeds from this anthology are donated to Women’s Aid.",
