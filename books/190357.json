  "description": "[Siren LoveXtreme Forever Erotic Alternative Paranormal Menage Romance, M/M/M/M/M/M, HEA] Spencer Dawson is an artist. He's flighty, absentminded, and often lost in the clouds. He's also an incubus and in his world, that means he gets five mates to start his coven. Having found his first four consorts, Spencer's life gets turned upside down when he feels a bond to the one man who has the potential to destroy him. Marcus Foster is the alpha of one of the largest wolf packs in the state. He's used to making the rules, having people jump to do his bidding, and having every order followed. He does not share. He especially doesn't plan on sharing Spencer once he discovers that the gorgeous little artist is his mate. Convincing Spencer that he was fed a pack of lies by four humans bent on keeping him as a sex slave seems a lot less important when Spencer's life is in danger. Convincing Marcus that everything he thought he knew was a pack of lies becomes a whole lot easier when Spencer transforms into a creature straight out of myth and legend. Convincing those around them to accept their unconventional mating might cost them their lives. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
