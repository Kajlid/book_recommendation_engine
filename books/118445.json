  "description": "Originally published in 1929, Passing tells the troublesome relationship between two African-American woman who are light enough to pass for white. Irene Redfield marries an African-American doctor and moves to Harlem. Clare Kendy, on the other hand, marries a bigoted white man -- never telling him of her true heritage. When the two women meet, after decades of separation, they impact each other lives in ways that neither would have imagined.",
