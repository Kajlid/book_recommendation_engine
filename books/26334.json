As her path brings her closer and closer to Jack—on a mad dash from Paris to San Francisco to Los Angeles to Havana, Cuba—Mercedes discovers the hope of survival and salvation in the lessons learned years ago in the freshness of youth, lessons learned by an eager boy, a maverick, an earnest novice…a Tyro.Tyro is the second book in the Jack Be Nimble thriller series, taking up moments after the harrowing events described in Jack Be Gargoyle.",
