  "description": "“Every man, woman, chicken, and child! Come on over now ’cause we’re going HOG WILD!”    Great singers, great actors, terrific music, and SUCH a cool illustrated songbook—wild times all around! The irrepressible Sandra Boynton brings you eleven all-out musical tracks, in a dizzying array of dance styles. And the songs are performed by a veritable dream The smoldering Patrick Wilson channels Elvis in the rockabilly “Hog Wild” title track. The ever-wonderful Kristen Bell convinces everyone to just “Dance It Out.” Samuel L. Jackson stomps his captivating way through “Tyrannosaurus Funk.” Stanley Tucci is the impossibly frenetic caller of the “Rat Race.” Five for Fighting goes full-on big band era with a stunning slow-build/big-finish “Swing Thing.” And when’s the last time you heard Laura Linney and “Weird Al” Yankovic perform a song together? Here they give you the electronic sci-fi “Robot Dance,” which Mr. Yankovic suddenly turns into (naturally enough) a Broadway tap dance number. All this and so much more!    Hog Wild! is the sixth Boynton songbook-and-CD set—the recording created with her long-time music producing partner, Michael Ford. The full-color hardcover book includes glorious Boynton illustrations, all the lyrics, and a section of music notation for all eleven songs.    Three books from this celebrated book/CD series have been New York Times bestsellers. They also have garnered a Grammy nomination, and one Platinum and two Gold record albums, led by the million-copy Philadelphia Chickens.    So don’t just sit there! Take a child by the hand, put on your sneakers or tap shoes (oh heck, bare feet will do), cue up the CD, and get out there and dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance!!!",
