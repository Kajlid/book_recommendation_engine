  "description": "In her latest romance, Jane Goodger weaves an unforgettable tale of a woman who thinks she's lost everything—until a little Christmas magic reunites her with the one man she could never forget...Dashing, debonair, and completely irresistible, Edward Hollings has all of Newport buzzing—and to Maggie Pierce's surprise, she alone has caught his eye. But when the handsome earl returns to England without proposing, a devastated Maggie knows she must forget him. Life only gets worse for Maggie, as all her dreams of happiness and love come crashing down around her. When Maggie receives an invitation to go to England for the Christmas birth of her dear friend's baby, she accepts—vowing to keep her devastating lies and shameful secrets from the one man she has ever loved. Edward vowed he'd never marry, but he came dangerously close with Maggie. She's beautiful, witty, indescribably desirable—and Edward can't forget her. When Maggie visits mutual friends for Christmas, Edward can't stay away. In fact, he finds himself more attracted to her than ever—a desire fueled even more by Maggie's repeated snubs. With the love he never thought he'd find slipping away, Edward is determined to make Maggie his own, no matter what the cost.",
