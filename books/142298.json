  "description": "The dystopian Melbourne of 'Tobacco-Stained Mountain Goat', pitched some short distance into the future, has the unique distinction of being the only city left in the world.And both Floyd and Laurel are on their last legs.Things are not going terribly well in terms of civil liberties, the political climate or the environment. In fact, things are comprehensively messed up on all fronts. This is an overcrowded, polluted metropolis groaning under the control of a government vested in corporate interests and busy herding non-conformists, misfits and the unhealthy into extramural death camps styled as “Hospitals”.Hardboiled noir soaks into sci-fi, humour and a touch of tragedy in this visual rejig of the critically lauded 2011 novel — with images constructed by author Bergen and daughter Cocoa — alongside the inclusion of new plot twists.",
