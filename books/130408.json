  "description": "Life as a private investigator isn’t all big cases, excitement and arch enemies. Filling the Afterlife from the Underworld volume two is the second book that follows the day to day musings and activities of Nicolette Mace: the Raven Siren, taken from her online blog.“My place may not be much to look at, but it is home. It has been set on fire more times than I can count, had explosives planted beneath the floorboards, had burst pipes, hosted any gunfights and even been redecorated by an RPG. And yet it is still standing...sort of.”-\tHome Sweet Home, Nicolette Mace",
