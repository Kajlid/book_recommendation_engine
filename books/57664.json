You are under arrest for the crime of interdimensional travel.\"Shit.I swear I never meant to open a magical portal in the bathroom of our apartment.Everything went awry the night I finally struck up the courage to declare my love for my best friend, Connor. I had prepared myself for the awkwardness, the rejection, and, if by some miracle, reciprocation.But we all know birthday wishes are bullshit.The last thing I’d ever expect is to be transported into another world where Connor accidentally becomes the new king of a country and I’m mistaken for a slave.But that’s where our adventure begins.Together, with the help of an interdimensional policeman who seems to hate my very existence, we must find a way back home and escape the dangers that lurk in this unknown land.Until then, my love confession will have to wait.",
