  "title": "Pitfalls of Desire: Winston",
  "description": "Winston Denning is a rich CEO of his own corporation who has four women wrapped around his finger—or so he believes. His wife Victoria lives in virtual submission to him and is about to be condemned to a life as a stripper. His maid, Gina, has become his sex toy, as has his corporate assistant, Cassidy. Worst of all—Tanya, who is already serving as his chastised whore, her body being sold by Winston to strangers for money. Pitfalls of Desire is the story of what happens when Victoria Denning and the other three women discover their strength and stand to Winston. Employing a top shelf Dominatrix to do the dirty work, the four turn the tables on Winston in a most bizarre and sexually humiliating way.",
