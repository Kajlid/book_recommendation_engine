That was, until the day he accidentally looked an executive in the eye and the executive looked back. Barrie Talon was a prince of the world, born and bred to run Talon Industries. Yet, for all his wealth and power, he felt alone; people saw only his executive suit, not the man in it. That is, until the day a drone dared to look at him with desire. Two men are at opposite ends of the world in almost every way, but can't stop wanting each other. (M/M - For content labels and excerpt, see details on publisher's site.)",
