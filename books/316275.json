  "description": "We've all been there: a new school year starts and there's 8 months till your exams - that's plenty of time, right? Then there's 6 months, 3 months, 1 month and oh, now there's 2 weeks left and you haven't started studying...What happens next is a panic-induced mayhem of highlighting everything in the textbook (without even questioning if it's actually helpful). But I'm here to help you change this!In The Only Study Guide You'll Ever Need, I'll cover a range of different topics including:路 How to get started and pick up that pen路 Learning techniques that actually work (hello, science of memory!)路 The dos and don'ts of timetabling路 And combatting fear of failure, perfectionism, exam stress and so much more!As a fellow student now at university, I definitely don't have a PhD in Exam Etiquette but this is the book younger me needed. All I wanted was one place that had a variety of tried-and-tested methods with reassurance from someone who had recently been through the education system. The Only Study Guide You'll Ever Need is just that, and I have collected the best techniques and tools I wish I'd known earlier to help you get through your studies and smash your exams!Jade x",
