  "description": "Fiction. Presenting Q, a hero for our times, who travels from riches to rags and back faster than the most intrepid entrepeneur. Born into upper-middle-class comfort but suddenly finding himself homeless and destitute, he learns to live on the street and to eat out of dumpsters. At first cowing and regularly beaten, he quickly toughens and becomes a legend of the street and the rails. His many careers include stints as a Christian (glossolalic) rapper, a yacht-hopping jet-setter, and mercenary. His improbable adventures are a parable of our age.\"Bill Lavender's Q is a charming, provocative, philosophical picaresque with attitude. In fact, on top of being a parable and an adventure, it's a very literary exploration of every kind of attitude you would or could want--towards fate, towards materialism, towards our precarious and thoroughly absurd and hellbent times--Q is a joy to read, and a joy to ponder.\"--Moira Crone\"A Voltaire for our consumer society, Bill Lavender has created apicaresque novel that travels not so much from country to country as from book to book. At times poetic, at other times philosophical, it concludes with advice that is no less wise than when Candide first offered it to his friends centuries ago: 'Tend your garden.'\"--John Biguenet",
