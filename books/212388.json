  "description": "A high school senior's life falls apart. He has problems with his girlfriend, school, and even his mother. But the worst part of it all is that he understands that the consumerist society he lives in is slowly but steadily becoming dystopian, and there's nothing he can do. There are cameras all over the place, data is collected from each and every device, and the people are reluctant to think about anything else than what should they eat and how \"sick\" is their new electronic device. He tries to talk some sense into his friends and family, but no one listens. No one cares. His mother says he's childish, his girlfriend deems him paranoid.Luckily, there is a break in the clouds. Ahroon, his alien friend he's found on the Galactic Wide Web, makes him an offer he can't refuse.But ... is Ahroon even real?",
