  "description": "Her ex…the VIP!Hiding out in the gents’ toilet backstage is not the way Sasha imagined bumping into her significant ex. Especially when that ex is notoriously damaged, famously wild rock god Nate Noble! She has a massive favour to ask him, but one glimpse of his sinfully dark eyes and all she can think about is that he’s seen her naked!Nate’s used to women doing anything to get his attention, but he never pictured bubbly schoolteacher Sasha as the groupie type—she’s far too sweet!
