  "description": "My world is nothing like it was a few months ago. Demons roam the earth, slaughtering all in their path. They are aligned with men in robes, a cult. As life, as I knew it, came to an end, an entire race was found. Witches, and powerful beings, came out of the dark. Not to save us, but to take our world for their own. I've killed, and I've suffered. But, after a childhood of captivity and pain, I've found my family. Now I must save them. Save them, from the underground world, we've been imprisoned in. Save them, from the race of magical men, and horrific monsters, that want everything for their own. I would do anything to save them, but a dangerous man, and his band of powerful Warriors, stand in my way. He causes feelings I don't understand, or want, to rise inside me. Feelings I'm not ready to admit to.  This is my story of captivity. My story of struggle, and failures. My story of family, and friendship. My story of love.  Book 1 of Before The End Saga",
