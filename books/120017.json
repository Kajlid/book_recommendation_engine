  "description": "Jim Dallas knew that runaway-daughter cases seldom end happily, but the Hamptons were frantic. Their daughter Judy had vanished in Aruba while celebrating her eighteenth birthday...and when Dallas searched for her, the quest led him into unimaginable evil, unforgivable crimes, and unthinkable betrayal. A missing girl, a deadly professional assassin, and exotic locations spice Cuban Dagger, the new Jim Dallas adventure from Ken McKea. Reviewer Gary Kim Hayes wrote of the first book, Atlanta Bones, \"The writing style is right on the money – think John D. MacDonald, Carl Hiassen and especially the easy wry style of Nelson DeMille in Plum Island.But the best thing, at least for me, is I feel like I’ve just made a new friend. And I can’t wait to read about his next adventure.\"",
