  "description": "The Collected Poems of Poet & Writer R.M. Engelhardt. R.M. Engelhardt wears black sunglasses in the shade. He chain-smokes Djarums until his head is wreathed in a clove-scented cloud. And, in the middle of the day, he sucks down coffee like a trucker on a midnight run.Engelhardt, in case you haven't already figured it out, is a poet. But he doesn't just walk the role, he talks it, too. In fact, he's been speaking his poetic mind in public for more than a decade, at least on occasion as the host the long-running Vox and School of Night readings series, both of which he founded, fostered and produced at local nightclubs. Engelhardt, 42, is one of the leading lights of the Albany poetry scene, and he is finally, rightfully, celebrating himself with the publication of \"The Last Cigarette: The New & Collected Poems of R.M. Engelhardt\"",
