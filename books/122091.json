  "description": "Slowly, the world begins to darken. A wickedness that has preyed on the souls of the weak and the damned for thousands of years now threatens to penetrate and defile all of humankind completely and irrevocably. Amidst such tremors of horror, a great tragedy befalls the Fearchar family. Three young orphans are forced to fend for themselves and Slone, the eldest, strives to raise his brothers in the image of their father. Ultimately, he leads them willinigly into the great war of good against evil, the Brightness against the Shadows.Love, too, and the illusion of love manage to wend a path, for better or for worse, through too many hearts. A great romance burgeons in soils previously thought of as unfurtile. And the advent of such a thing all too easily obscures the otherwise clear paths to duty and family.Love, unfounded jealousy, magic, power, and the rise of the end of all humanity ­­— thus begins The Fearchar Legacy.",
