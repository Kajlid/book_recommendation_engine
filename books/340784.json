  "description": "At the height of Britain’s General Strike in 1926 a red double-decker bus driven by a volunteer crashes into a low bridge in West London.Almost eighty years later Jennifer Denzel reveals on daytime television that as a teenager she'd found her sister Charlotte hanging by a school tie in their bedroom. But Charlotte can’t believe her ears - it was, she protests, Jennifer who tried to suicide all those years ago.Their grandmother Bertha, in the meantime, dreams of a distant time: of a young man she met at a Socialist rally and of a sister, long dead. While their mother, Deirdre, remembers a time forty years earlier when her sister told tales, a night during the War when a V2 rocket destroyed an entire street and much more besides.Brimming with vivid detail of London past and present, The Past and Other Lies is full of warmth, atmosphere, subtle wit and exquisite surprises",
