Repeat daily…Except on Wednesdays.On Wednesdays, Johnny, comes into the library and shamelessly flirts with me. It’s seriously the highlight of my week. Not that I’d ever admitted that to him. Yes, I’m crazy about him, but I just know we’d never work out in the real world. He’s an insanely hot fireman, his life is exciting and dangerous. I’m just a dull librarian.I know he’ll get bored of me eventually, but for now, I’ll take what I can get.Johnny –Do you know those girls who are smart, pretty, and totally perfect but have no idea? That’s April. The first time I saw her, I knew I was going to marry her. Crazy, I know. But I’m impulsive like that. Unfortunately, she’s not.Every Wednesday we go to her work. She doesn’t even realize it, but we’ve been dating once a week for months. She thinks I’m going to give up soon but I think I’m finally wearing her down.",
