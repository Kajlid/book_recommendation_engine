Reeling from the loss of those around him, Sid sets off, not only to avenge the deaths of those he loves, but also to find a way to save his own life. But the closer he gets to answers, the more people he puts in danger. Only Sid has the power to end the killer's reign. But it might cost him the one thing he holds most precious.
