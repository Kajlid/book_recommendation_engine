  "description": "â€˜Wet and Wild' is a pet shop on the Holloway Road in Islington, North London. Outwardly, the shop seems normal, if a bit rundown, but on the inside it becomes a glorious and other-worldly emporium, and its animal inhabitants have a habit of attracting press attention due to their talents and the mishaps they get into. There is Cyril, the obese mind-manipulating cat, Tibetan terrier Bruno whose gecko pads allow him to climb walls and ceilings, and Freakin' Frank, a groovy, music-loving, dancing chameleon, who seems all set to take Ibiza by storm. Shape-shifting pet shop owner Roderick has his own issues to deal with as he has two twins inside him, battling to exert their own personality over the other one. One twin is gay while the other one is straight, which can make relationships difficult! Roderick's shop assistant Brian has astonishing Dr Doolittle like tendencies, but can he maintain the shop while Roderick chases his true passion of acting? Probably not, if Ebenezer the goldfish has his way!",
