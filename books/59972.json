  "description": "It's been five years since Brigit Malone joined Reapers, Incorporated with the intent of keeping a promise to her partner, Maggie, to always be with her. Since Brigit's death, though, Maggie has started to move on with her life, leaving Brigit with little choice but to focus on the business of being the Assistant to the Grim Reaper. Everyone is suffering from burnout and John Blackwick, the Grim Reaper, wants to go on holiday. This means a temporary promotion for Brigit and she decides to ask Katuri-Buttercup, the Reaper in charge of Dangerous Cases, to sit her chair while she fills in for John. Brigit thinks it is an easy solution. It is, until Katuri-Buttercup goes missing. In the effort to find the missing Reaper, Brigit discovers a ghost town that was once the site of a Reapers, Inc. satellite office and a hunter seeking revenge on the soul responsible for killing his brother and terrorizing the town. When Brigit discovers the hunter's part in Katuri-Buttercup's disappearance, she must recruit the hunter or cross him to his eternal fate.",
