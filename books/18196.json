  "title": "The Spirit Cabinet",
  "description": "After a long, slow climb out of the strip clubs of Europe, Jurgen and Rudolfo have hit the big time in Las Vegas, headlining a magic act as slick as their own buffed and usually half-naked bodies. Rudolfo is content orchestrating the spectacle and attempting to twin his soul with Jurgen's. But Jurgen hungers for more--and finds it in a mysterious collection of magician's paraphernalia that once belonged to Harry Houdini. With the knowledge he finds there, and his own faith in the unknown, Jurgen becomes the miracle worker of the Las Vegas strip. \"Darkly comic, deeply sad, and always ironic\" (Library Journal), The Spirit Cabinet takes dead aim at the place within us that yearns for miracles. \"It is not a book about magicians and their pursuit of magic,\" wrote Alan Beaton in The National Post; \"it is a book about human beings, and their pursuit of faith.\"",
