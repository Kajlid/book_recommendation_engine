  "description": "His past is a mystery, even to him-a werewolf with memories so lost in a fog that even the Hunter's healers cannot help him. More than a century ago, Toronto awakened on an unfamiliar street, naked and alone- and dogged by the unanswered questions of his enigmatic existence. The vampire Sylvia is no Hunter. She's a mercenary who just barely skates this side of what the Hunters consider acceptable. All she wants is to hunt her quarry, and make a lot of money. Her newest prey is a devious killer. But her newest complication is of a more intimate a blonde, blue-eyed werewolf who interferes with her plans in so many exquisite ways.",
