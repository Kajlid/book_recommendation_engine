  "title": "The Mercury Waltz",
  "description": "\"We’re pursued by no one, now.\" Having fled their comfortably dangerous brothel-and-theater known as the Poppy, Rupert and Istvan have traveled far to land in a city of sepia and silver, where they make new allies and settle old grudges. Ancient families clash with municipal thugs outside and inside the doors of the Mercury Theatre: the home Rupert has always longed for, with a stage created for Istvan’s wildest tales. Kathe Koja’s compelling sequel to Under the Poppy continues the timeless love and passionate play of its heroes, who can never truly escape their past. As their lives intertwine with a young blue-eyed fortuneteller, a foxy street sharpster, and a poet from the provinces come to this city on the brink of combustion, the promise of the Poppy is played out to the tune of The Mercury Waltz.",
