  "description": "The world is a far different place in 2259. Thirty years of world war, rampant bombing, and the melting of the polar ice sheets have changed the very face of the planet.  The former countries of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America have banded together as the North American Alliance, led by distinguished military hero President Walker. His daughter Poppy has served as the First Lady of the North American Alliance since she was only twelve years old, helping her father restore order to the chaotic new world they live in.  Now nineteen, Poppy finds herself caught in the middle of a government takeover and dodging assassins. After fleeing to the war-torn ruins of Denver, she must face unknown dangers and new experiences. She will have to use every skill learned from her military upbringing to survive the terrifying beasts, deadly plant life, and fierce rebels who live in the shadows of the abandoned city.",
