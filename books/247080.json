  "description": "Kaya James doesn't think like every other culmin. In her cold world, she is not looking to get married. Her overbearing mother has other plans...and so does an unexpected secret admirer. Men are not romantic, at least that's what Kaya always thought. But the gifts keep coming, and for the first time, she is wrapped up in the idea of romance. With each note received more enthralling than the next, and a little help from the Paragons watching from afar, Kaya's heart may not be as safe from love as she once believed.This is first in a series, but the story is standalone",
