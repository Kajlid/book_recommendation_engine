  "description": "Mac Flecknoe and Other Poems is a collection of satirical poems written by John Dryden, a prominent English poet and playwright of the 17th century. The title poem, Mac Flecknoe, is a mock-heroic satire that lampoons a rival poet, Thomas Shadwell, by depicting him as the inept successor to a fictional king of dullness. The other poems in the collection include Absalom and Achitophel, a political allegory that satirizes the English court and the political crisis of the time; The Medal, which attacks the Whig politician Shaftesbury and his supporters; and Religio Laici, a defense of the Anglican Church against the claims of Catholicism and Protestant dissent. The collection showcases Dryden's mastery of various poetic forms and his skill in using satire to comment on contemporary politics, religion, and culture.Gratuitous recounting of how Shadwell responded to Dryden's Johnnie D. got beat up by some toughs.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations. Because we believe this work is culturally important, we have made it available as part of our commitment for protecting, preserving, and promoting the world's literature in affordable, high quality, modern editions, that are true to their original work.",
