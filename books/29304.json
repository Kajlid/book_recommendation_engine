  "description": "\"Stories, Essays, and Memoir\" presents Welty's collected short stories, an astonishing body of work that has made her one of the most respected writers of short fiction. \"A Curtain of Green and Other Stories\" (1941), her first book, includes many of her most popular stories, such as \"A Worn Path, \" \"Powerhouse, \" and the farcical \"Why I Live at the P.O.\" \"The Wide Net and Other Stories\" (1943), in which historical figures such as Aaron Burr (\"First Love\") and John James Audubon (\"A Still Moment\") appear as characters, shows her evolving mastery as a regional chronicler. \"The Golden Apples\" (1949) is a series of interrelated stories about the inhabitants of the fictional town of Morgana, Mississippi. It was Welty's favorite among her books. The stories of \"The Bride of the Innisfallen and Other Stories\" (1955) are set both in the South and in Europe. Also included are two stories from the 1960s, \"Where Is the Voice Coming From?,\" based on the shooting of Medgar Evers, and \"The Demonstrators.\" A selection of nine literary and personal essays includes evocations of the Jackson of her youth that is essential to her work and cogent discussions of literary form.",
