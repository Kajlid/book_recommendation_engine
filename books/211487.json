  "description": "Her husband is perfect. Until he dies. Will her family survive his shocking secret? Surviving stage four cancer is a piece of cake compared surviving her beloved husband’s death. Grieving, introverted Lang is befuddled by the grammar-butchering fashion plate who befriends her, and she is finally forced to deal with her narcissistic, jet-setting mother who breezes in just in time for the funeral. Everyone has ideas on how she should manage her disastrous life, especially Teddy, her unemployed son. Insisting that he handle her family estate, and adamant that she not cavort about with a goofy yet kindly veterinarian, Teddy gives his mother an ultimatum, one that involves her beloved granddaughter, Katie D. Her once perfectly organized world in shambles, Lang is faced with a life-changing decision. A decision that could destroy her family. “”Making Arrangements is a debut novel that features “rich sassy writing with characters you’ll want to slap” and a surprising plot twist. If you like Robyn Carr and Liane Moriarty, you should read Ferris Robinson’s “beautifully written family drama sprinkled with scenes of hilarity” that will keep you turning pages way past your bedtime.
