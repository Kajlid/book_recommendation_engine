  "description": "Margo--It was a name the townspeople whispered softly, as if the sinister old woman could hear them from her crumbling gray mansion on the hill. She was an ancient crone who should have long since turned to dust. But somehow -- in the right light -- she looked no more than thirty years old. She was rumored to have congress with demons, a deal with the devil, and an irrational hatred of her beautiful twin niece and nephew.",
