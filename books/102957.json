  "description": "In the future, technology advances to the point where anything is possible. Most spouses are tailored-made to their partner’s tastes and desires. Some spouses even have attachments. Fashion is delivered to subscribers on a daily basis, and clothes are disposable. Even products like hallucinogenic toilet paper and barbituated deodorant make the most mundane tasks fun and exciting. Vyla doesn’t see the possibilities around her. She is in a dead end job. She is in a dead end marriage. And she is in… nothing else. That is her life. One day, she is singled out at work to attend a seminar on how to handle salesmen. She learns many things at that seminar, and very few of them relate to dealing with salesmen. Vyla begins to learn how much control she really has. In a future where anything is possible, control can be a very exciting thing.This edition also includes a bonus short story, The Sixth-Level Executive. Codly Purppen never intended to go to work. He was too happy enjoying his easy carefree days of getting paid simply to be available. Then something happens to the five levels of executives above him, and he is called in to do the one thing he didn't want to do. He doesn’t even know what his company does.",
