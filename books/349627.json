It is said that when the Butterworth Tree blooms, a bumper crop of Butterworth relatives from past, present and future will fall. Of course, Glister longs to have a big family and dreams of cosseting aunts and devoted uncles, hoping upon hope that the tree may even bear fruit of the famed Butterworth Giant...Then, one day, her dream finally comes true. Indeed, a bumper crop of relatives does fall, but they are not so keen on playing Happy Families and soon Glister needs a swift and effective plan to stop the Butterworths from pulling themselves and Chilblain Hall apart, with quite astonishing results!
