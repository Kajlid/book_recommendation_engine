  "description": "Someone needed to put a stop payment on Jennifer Check.The sign says Welcome to Devil's Kettle, Pop. 7,036. Come See What's Cookin'! No, seriously . . . that's what it says.Some people find it hard to believe that a babe like Jennifer Check would associate with a dork like me, Needy Lesnicki. But we had history. We'd been the Wonder Twins since we were preverbal, and sandbox love never dies. Or at least that's what I thought.But after that night in the woods, Jennifer was different. She looked different. And then the killings began. . . .A lot of people ask me if I'm sorry I did it. I'm only sorry I didn't do it sooner.",
