  "description": "Killian Kendall is used to being overlooked, even in his own family. That's about to change. With the arrival of a new kid at school, Killian's whole world is about to be turned upside down. The new guy is openly gay and, for reasons he can't really understand, Killian finds himself drawn to him. When the boy is killed in a brutal attack, and Killian is injured in the process, Killian begins to questions everything around him. The police seem eager to write the attack off as a random mugging, but Killian was there and he knows better. With the help of the murdered boy's father and his friends, Killian starts his own investigation. His search turns up hatred in small town America, and before it's over, more people will be dead, and Killian's life will be on the line again.",
