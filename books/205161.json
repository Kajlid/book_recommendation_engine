  "title": "Hurry Up and Meditate: Your Starter Kit for Inner Peace and Better Health",
  "description": "If meditation were available in capsule form, it would be the biggest selling drug of all time. It has been scientifically proven to deliver highly effective stress relief, boost our immune systems, and dramatically slow the aging process. It has also been shown to make us much happier and more effective thinkers. Given all the physical and psychological benefits, why aren't more of us doing it? In this thought-provoking and entertaining book, David Michie explains the nuts and bolts of meditation. As a busy professional and a long-term meditator, he also gives a first-hand account of how to integrate this transformational practice into everyday life. Combining leading-edge science with timeless wisdom, Hurry Up and Meditate provides all the motivation and tools you need to achieve greater balance, better health, and develop a more panoramic perspective on life. The idea of infusing our daily schedule with newfound tranquility may sound appealing, but not everyone is temperamentally suited to sitting around in the lotus position chanting \"Om.\" Not to mention the fact that some of us just have very active minds. We'd like to meditate, but we're just not capable of switching off.Â  The the amazing thing is that it's exactly the people who use the \"too busy,\" \"'too hard,\" and \"too hyper\" justifications who stand to gain the most from meditation.",
