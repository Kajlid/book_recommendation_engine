  "description": "Beauty is not just skin deep. Kellyn, a lynx shifter, has survived a terrible battle. Horribly disfigured, he arrives on a property in outback South Australia, his memory shattered, along with his beauty. All he knows is that the world on which he is trapped is not safe. He must hide from all humans—except one.Alexander, an artist recluse, has no time for most people, which is probably just as well, because the guy he rescues isn’t exactly human. Both men deny their immediate, mutual attraction. Alex doesn’t want his heart broken again and Kel believes he has nothing to offer—he’s just a cat with a scarred mind and body.But a cat has no chance when a human gets under his fur and when Alex tangles with a cat, it’s love at first lick.",
