  "title": "Heidegger's Ghost: Applications of Existential Philosophy as a Therapeutic Model",
  "description": "Existential Psychology is characterized by a stark explanation of psychopathology and a nearly hands-off approach to therapy. Because the theoretical framework is based in a habit of mind rather than a particular treatment form, the existential approach can integrate fairly well with most forms of psychotherapy. It allows for sensitivity to culture and religious beliefs that other schools of thought do not address, but it can be harsh. As of 2006, no work has been published to statistically validate existential psychotherapy and so the ideas presented by the theorists that created this field continue to remain just that: ideas that, while valuable, remain unproven.",
