  "description": "Lucy Burchett is the heiress to a notoriously disastrous family, and she's left home for good. But when she runs a big, black pickup off the road, totaling it, she finds herself stuck in the middle of nowhere with the driver. He's got a body to die for and a hair-trigger temper. Vince Russo looks like a felon, but he's also pretty funny. He's on the lam from the cops... and a psychopathic, Russian mob boss who wants to put his balls on a barbeque. Literally.After a night of ill-advised cocktails and bathroom-wrecking sex, Vince just can't get Lucy off his mind. But he's got plans to rob her. And Lucy's life is about to get a little bit criminal too.But can a bad boy and a good girl really escape from their troubles together? Can they trust each other at all?In the steady march of disasters that follow them west, they fight and they laugh. They tease and they're tender. They're either oil and water, or chocolate and peanut butter.Except, they can't run from the real world forever. And there's a hell of a surprise in store for both of them...NOTE: Explicit sex, language",
