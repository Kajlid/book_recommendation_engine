  "description": "Through profound spiritual insights and his unique approach to the inner life, i nternationally acclaimed author Anthony de Mello points the way toward new levels of contemplation, happiness, love, wisdom, and enlightenment.In more than two hundred parables and lessons about living life fully yet simply, de Mello gives examples filled with wisdom that cannot be conveyed in regular direct discourse. Rooted in the spirit of the Gospel and spanning the mystical traditions of East and West, this invigorating volume -- like all the author's previous books -- is intended to enliven our faith and free us from whatever imprisons our mind, body, and soul.One Minute Wisdom will lead from sense to sensitivity, from mood to meaning, from thought to feeling. And as de Mello writes, \"Wisdom can come without the slightest effort—in the time it takes to open your eyes.\"Wherever your spiritual belief may lie—or even if you have no beliefs at all—you will find in these pages needed and helpful direction on continuing the process of self-discovering and on finding the satisfying riches that lie deep within you.",
