  "description": "Seer, mystic, prophet, artist, genius—he was visionary poet William Blake. And Kate, a grocer's illiterate daughter, adored him. She loved Blake enough to become his wife. She loved Blake enough to follow him into poverty, into madness, into hell... And then into Time. Because all of William Blake's angels and monsters—from dread Urizen to the immortal Zoas—were real. Beings of unimaginable power, power that they offered to Britain's finest minds... and, as a joke, to poor dowdy Kate. But when the power grows evil, the vision turns foul, when horror engulfs the world and deadly terrors clasp the man she loves, then \"poor, dowdy\" Mrs. Blake challenges the gods to rage through Time—a tyger, burning bright, in the forests of the night... Eternal night.",
