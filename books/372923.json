  "description": "Here's a strip to savor, doubly immersed in squeaky cleanliness and a knowing grasp of second graders' cool universe.\" â€”Mike Durrett, Humor Today Frazz is fun. Frazz is cool. Frazz is . . . a hit! Take one successful and secure songwriter, put him on the steering end of a janitor's broom, and drop him into the world of elementary education. And with that, if Jef Mallett's calling the creative shots, you have the makings of one of the most flourishing new comic strips to come along in years. Frazz follows the life and loves of one Edwin Frazier, aka \"Frazz,\" as he writes more best-selling lyrics, ponders the world's greatest literature and deepest mysteries with an 8-year-old genius, and interacts with the menagerie of other faculty and staff members. What results is a wild mix of witty observations and outright slapstick that amuses while causing you to see the world in a new light. 99 Percent Perspiration is the second collection of this very popular strip that appears in more than 150 newspapers worldwide, including the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, and Chicago Tribune. Frazz was nominated in 2004 as one of the best comic strips of the year by the National Cartoonists Society. It has also received two Wilbur awards for ethics and values.",
