  "description": "Re-published june 2013Would you turn down a handsome movie star if he came on to you? Well, you might if he was married. Sara wasn’t looking for love. She had escaped to London from an abusive boyfriend, a father who keeps her existence a secret, and a past filled with anorexia and anxiety. She had her baggage. So she didn’t need to fall in love with a married man. She didn’t need the threat of media exposure. And she didn’t need the risk of having her heart broken. But how long can you resist what your heart wants?",
