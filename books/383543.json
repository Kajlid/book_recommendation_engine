  "description": "In the year 4,000, the human race is threatened by robots bent to enslave mankind, and only one man has the power to fight back — Magnus, Robot Fighter!These beloved tales of science-adventure first ran in 1963 and 1964 and have influenced countless writers and artists throughout the decades. Created by fan-favorite Russ Manning — famous for his spectacular work on the Tarzan newspaper strips of the sixties — Magnus, Robot Fighter was something of his \"Tarzan of the Future,\" and Manning's run on the series came to be known as a classic in science-fiction comics. This volume reprints the first seven issues in the original 1960s Magnus, Robot Fighter series, with unparalleled art by the legendary Russ Manning, a foreword by Mike Royer, and retouched interiors scanned from the original comic books. Join Magnus on his quest, as he proclaims, \"My task will not be completed until I have smashed every evil robot that is hurting mankind in body and soul!\"",
