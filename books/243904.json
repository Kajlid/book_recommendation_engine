  "description": "In a poor, remote section of southern Mexico, the paramilitary group, the Red Shirts have taken control. God has been outlawed, and the priests have been systematically hunted down and killed. Now, the last priest is on the run. Too human for heroism, too humble for martyrdom, the nameless little worldly \"whiskey priest\" is nevertheless impelled toward his squalid Calvary as much by his own compassion for humanity as by the efforts of his pursuers. In his introduction, John Updike calls The Power and the Glory, \"Graham Greene's masterpieceâ€¦. The energy and grandeur of his finest novel derive from the will toward compassion, an ideal communism even more Christian than Communist.\"",
