  "description": "From the founder of the Zombie Research Society comes a long-awaited, helpful children's book that teaches kids just what to do if mommy suddenly becomes a member of the undead.\"If she doesn’t seem like she did before, maybe that’s not your mommy anymore. And when this happens, you must go! Here is how you’re sure to know. . .\"In the ongoing effort to warn an unprepared world of the rising danger from zombie attacks, one vulnerable group has been left out — small children. That's Not Your Mommy Anymore offers social workers, counselors, and educators a helpful new tool to communicate with hard-to-reach at-risk youth. This inviting and entertaining story helps early readers understand for themselves that a mom who has fresh brain casserole in the oven instead of her usual meatloaf is probably not their mommy anymore.This utterly twisted and incredibly funny take on the classic children’s book genre tells an entertaining story in rhyming text even as it teaches other telltale signs that mom has been bitten by a zombie! Rabid zombie fans will be highly entertained by this hilarious parody that adult readers are sure to love as much as the real children books they enjoyed as kids.",
