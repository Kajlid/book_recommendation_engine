  "description": "Hale, who turned double-agent against the corrupt spy organization he was raised in, knows his super-spy parents can't come home until the Sub Rosa Society is neutralized--and that he and his friends are all that's standing between SRS and their worldwide crimes. So Hale wants to hit the bad guys where it hurts: their bank account.Hale and his allies all travel to Switzerland and discover that this won't be a smash-and-grab job like they expected. SRS doesn't have any actual money that can be taken--it's all hidden in secret digital accounts. Oh, and some super heavy gold bars. To take them down, Hale's crew will have to undo SRS's crimes and get to the inside man at the bank, all while artfully evading SRS's notice.There's plenty of action, a big fluffy show dog, a nefarious clown, and, as readers expect from this series, all kinds of comedic, high-stakes adventure.",
