  "title": "Loving the Rain",
  "description": "Clay Thomas had encountered Jack Harding twenty years before, when Jack was a brash teenager, hungry for success. Born with the uncanny ability to manipulate minds, young Clay occasionally used that skill to his advantage-but he recognized the moral consequences and vowed to keep his secrets to himself. Though he never knew of Clay's ability, Harding is convinced his former adversary is to blame for his past humiliation, and sets out to exact revenge. He first strikes at Clay through his talented son, Tanner, a star athlete who is beginning to recognize his own emerging powers. Stopping Harding's criminal activities could force Clay to expose his secrets-but could also finally offer him some peace. Loving the Rain is a dramatic novel about the power of unconditional love, unreserved forgiveness, and the importance of allowing others to make their own choices.",
