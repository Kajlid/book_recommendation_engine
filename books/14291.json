  "description": "For a love that will last through the ages, they must fight an evil older than time. \n\nTrue Destiny, Book 3\nJeffrey Grimm’s grandfather, Odin, tortured and nearly killed his twin sister. He’s on a mission to return the favor. To get the job done, he needs the world's oldest living laser-hair-removal Fenrisùlfr, the werewolf prophecy has decreed will kill Odin at Ragnarrok. When he gets to Norway, though, he discovers the wolf can change into a man…a man so sexy that Jeff is blindsided with lust. And, despite his blood ties to Odin, Fen wants him with equal ferocity. An attraction to the blood kin of his oldest enemy? Fenris figures he must have been caged far too long. Yet as soon as the magical phrase that frees him leaves Jeff’s lips, Fenris has no choice. He is bound to protect Jeff at all costs, even if it means giving up his hatred of the man who betrayed him—and learning to live with the horrors of toothpaste and the Internet. Odin isn’t through with him, though. And when he gets his hands on Jeff, Fen calls upon everything within him to fulfill the prophecy... even if it means his own death.  This book contains explicit male/male sex, graphic language, a redhead with a temper and the ultimate werewolf. Caution, drooling may be an unfortunate side effect.",
