  "description": "Physically scarred and emotionally broken, Kelon Warrior, Vallarr, is sent to Earth as a guard to a group of Kelon scientists and healers. When he meets the little human English teacher, she stirs his body and mind in more ways than one.  Emily Morland, left partially paralyzed in her youth, is assigned the task of teaching English to the Kelons. Unafraid of Vallar’s prickly personality, she sees a deeper hurt behind his gruff behavior and wants to help.  While her tender touch sooths and calms Vallarr, she pushes to explore the powerful attraction between them, not caring about consequences. As their passion grows and their bond strengthens, forces move in to rip them apart, sending Vallarr’s mind spiraling into a deep, dark despair.  As the fates bring them together again, can Emily’s embrace bring Vallarr back from the darkness? Or will he be lost to her forever?",
