Inside the walls of this mysterious revolving tower is his beloved wife, Dejah Thoris, the beautiful princess of Barsoom. Worse yet, his wife is trapped there with the lovely but wicked Phaidor, who has sworn to make John Carter her own—even if it means murder. How can Carter gain access to the Temple, whose doors swing open only once a year? And when he does find his way inside, will he find Dejah Thoris's welcoming embrace—or her corpse?",
