  "description": "“Who says you can’t wear boots with pearls?”I’ve always loved my life and career. That was until my boss, best friend, and partner in crime, fell in love during a trip to her hometown and made me become a bougie cowgirl. It only took a few visits to the sleepy town of Poplar Falls for me to understand the draw.So here I am, fighting the two girls that live inside of me. One who loves the glitz and glamour of NYC and thrives in the fast-paced world of the Upper East Side. Then the other who longs to be wild and free in the laid back mountains of Colorado with the people who have become like family. One in particular.Payne Henderson was only supposed to be a fun fling, a hot man to scratch my cowboy itch. I didn’t realize I was falling so hard for him until it was too late to stop the ride and get off unscathed.Now I have a decision to make. Do I confess my love and reveal the stripped-down version of me, scars and all? Or do I let him go and head back to the comfort of my big city life?",
