  "description": "Best Rock Album, Best Rock Song, and Best Solo Rock Performance. I, Lucy Gold, owned the freaking world.But being the daughter of rock god Johnny Gold isn't as easy as it sounds.The music was my life. And it was just easy to fall into bed, or against a wall with no strings–pardon the rock 'n' roll pun–attached. I had no time for love or for feelings.That was until I met him. Hayden Harris. Lead guitarist of Reluctant Angel. Lean muscle, tattooed and sexy as hell. He had hot skills with the guitar and I wanted to find out what other hand skills laid beyond the music. But growing up with a rock star father gave me the strength to resist a rock star's charm. That meant he was gonna have to work for it. And, I was gonna have my fun while he tried.But damn, he has a fire in him and I think I'm losing my number one rule: Never fall in love. Will Hayden be able to tame a wild rock star? Will our love set the stage on fire? Or will it smash like a rock star’s guitar?-----Rock star's Angel is a 40,000 word NEW ADULT, ROCK STAR NOVELLA. Suitable for ages 17+ for strong language and sexual content.",
