  "description": "I've seen a lot of crazy stuff in my life, but an auction for women?That's got to be on top of the list.And they want to use my ranch for their next one.It's secluded in the Montana mountains where no one will interrupt their twisted little game for billionaires.I sign the contract and let them use the space.I'm mostly in my bear form these days anyway, wandering through the forest and I could use the easy cash.On the night of the auction, I go check it out.Not to bid on a girl, just to make sure everything is on the up and up.I won't allow any girls to be sold against their will. Not on my property.That's when I see her on stage.I know immediately she's my mate.My inner grizzly does too.Although, we seem to be the only ones who know this girl is off limits because the other men are bidding on her.In a few seconds, they'll know she belongs to me no matter who has the winning bid.I'm taking her.And I don't care if I have to burn the whole place down to do it.",
