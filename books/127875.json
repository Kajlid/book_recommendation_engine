  "description": "The outrageously inventive follow-up to By the Blood of Heroes-Inglorious Basterds meets Dawn of the Dead in this steampunk alternate history World War I zombie novelAt the close of 1917, the Germans introduced a new type of gas, T-Leiche-\"corpse gas\"-a revolutionary weapon that changed the war. Instead of killing the living, T-Leiche resurrected the bodies of the dead. Though they survived the killing fields of France, the danger has only just begun for veteran Captain Michael \"Madman\" Burke and company. They've just been assigned a new mission: rescue Princess Veronica, the sole surviving member of the British royal family. But Kaiser Manfred Von Richthofen, the undead Red Baron and new leader of Germany, is determined to find Veronica as well. In the devastated, zombie-infested city of London, Burke and his men will face off in an unholy battle with their most formidable opponent yet: a team led by none other than his infected former right-hand man, Sargeant Moore. If they don't succeed, all of Britain will fall into undead Central hands.",
