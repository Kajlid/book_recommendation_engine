  "description": "In today’s world, everyone wants to be a Star! Having a normal, comfortable and content life simply isn’t enough anymore. With Facebook on a roll, the Stars get a superb platform to feel like Stars. What with all the fans going crazy for them at the social networking website! Vatsala Rathore, a nineteen-year-old, falls in love with Ronit Oberoi - who is a VJ and an upcoming actor - at Facebook. The crush, innocent at first, soon develops into love and promptly gets converted into obsession. How can it not, when the drop-dead-gorgeous Star reciprocates with equal interest? Ankit Rai, who masters the art of selflessness, has been besotted by Vatsala for four years now. But will Vatsala finally notice? Girls wait for their Prince Charmings all their life. Vatsala has two. Will she ever be able to decide who the one for her is?",
