  "description": "Hilarity ensues when a doctor is plucked from her office and trapped in a house with her husband, two teens, a small menagerie, and no escape. As a doctor, Kathleen Wooton strongly believes that laughter is the best medicine; she also believes that the best way for her to administer that ''medicine'' is by being a humorist, which allows her to give the kind of ''shot in the arm'' that so many of us need--a good belly laugh on a daily basis. As a mother, Kathy believes that ever y day she manages to survive motherhood without personal injury or criminal charges is a blessing. That Girl's Not Right is a delightful romp through the mind and musings of Kathleen Wooton. Her hilarious commentary provides a unique and often quirky look at what other wise might be mundane life situations--from the entirely relatable ''Why Does Water Need a Child-Proof Cap?'' to the all-too-true ''Sleep Deprivation and the Exhausted Mom'.' That Girl's Not Right speaks to all of us through the universal language of laughter. Whether poetry or prose--and Wooton offers a healthy dose of each--the homespun humor in this collection is just what the doctor ordered.",
