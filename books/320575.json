  "description": "I'm lost in him, consumed by him. Knowing that he could snap me in half in a second, grind my bones to make his bread, thrills me more than it should. He could gobble me up in an instant.Lucky me that he just wants to eat me out instead.***Lost on the Appalachian Trail, Jaquelyn falls head-over-heels (literally) into an ogre's lair. She should be terrified of the enormous horned monster, but he turns out to be a surprisingly gentle green giant, and soon the fact that he and Jaquelyn don't understand each other no longer matters. Sure, he may be a monster, but he's also the best lover she's ever had, and there are definitely fates worse than spending the rest of your life in a thick-monster-king's love cave.Abandoned by his clan, Crug forms an instant bond with the strange surface creature who falls through his roof. But as much as he adores her, and as good as she makes him feel, he knows cannot keep her. Before long, Crug will have to choose between his home and clan, and the love of his life.***No Getting Ogre You is a short, steamy romance between a human woman and a male monster with a Happily Ever After and lots of happy endings. Content guidance for blood, bones, a spider, the dark, explicit monster love and swearing.",
