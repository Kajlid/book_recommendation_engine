  "title": "Someday",
  "description": "Chubby and I stood staring at the stove door, watching the flare of the burning letter. Someday had suddenly become starkly, terribly real. This town we loved, everything we knew, the very roads we walked on, would soon rest beneath the waters of a giant reservoir, like some scene in a dime-store waterglobe. What would become of us, of me and Chubby, and Mama and Gran? And what about all our friends and neighbors? Who would we be without Enfield to bind us together? \"Koller excels in making Celie fully human and three dimensional. The town of Enfield becomes a character like any other in the story, triggering emotion and tears.\" VOYA",
