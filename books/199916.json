  "description": "Anna Orlova Constabile was born to dance. She lived a good life and was a respected ballerina but puberty dealt her a cruel hand, developing a body that was simply curvier than a prima ballerina’s. Never one to back away from adversity, she enjoyed a wonderful career of principle roles with a large City Ballet Troupe. When she grew tired of supporting roles she decided to strike out on her own with something a bit untraditional.Meeting Landon Kampf Gullickson was a fluke of sorts, but a lucky one. He taught her about the parts of life that had nothing to do with dancing. Laughter, friendship and love grew quickly between the two, but it wasn’t always easy.Having both grown up with a great deal of independence it was hard for both of them to give themselves over to the other completely. In a scary turn of events each was challenged. Could Landon allow Anna to nurture him after life brought him to the darkest time of his life? And when the chips were down, would Anna finally be able to allow Landon to lead, just this once, in the most critical dance of her life?",
