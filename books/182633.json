Dr. Martin Edovich is the triumphant scientist behind the project-he claims that \"his\" discovery of I-particles will win him the Nobel Prize and change the face of physics.  But Peter Slater predicted the existence of I-particles long ago and suspects that they are unstable-explosive and potentially cataclysmic.
