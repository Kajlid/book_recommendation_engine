His doctors don't know whether he'll get his vision back, and he's deeply depressed. Carley can relate. She's been scarred by a facial deformity, but she's keeping that a secret from Kyle. She's worried that if his bandages are removed and he sees her, it will be the end of their relationship. Carley wants what's best for Kyle. But what will that mean for Carley?  Don't Die, My Love Julie Ellis and Luke Muldenhower describe themselves as \"meant for each other.\" Now in high school, they are deeply in love. Luke is a talented football player and is sure to receive an athletic scholarship to a top college, and Julie intends to follow. When Luke gets a virus, Julie persuades him to see a doctor. The test results are devastating. But Julie believes their love is stronger than anything. Or is it?  A Rose for Melinda Jesse and Melinda have been friends since the first grade.
