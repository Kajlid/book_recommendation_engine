How far would you go to ensure the object of your infatuation is forever in your possession?  Former Deputy Sam Ridley is a man plagued by past sins. In his eyes, being sentenced to ten years in prison isn’t punishment enough for his crimes. An unwanted early parole forces him to re-join a society that looks down on him with scorn. Exiling himself to a new town is the only hope he has to escape the ghosts haunting him.  Emma Danvers is a woman looking for change. Living a life of privilege has offered her opportunities without challenges. Breaking free of the constraints of family obligation, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Never did she expect to be catapulted into the arms of a man searching for his own new beginning.  Two people thrown together in a twist of fate. One running from his past; the other chasing a brighter future. Can they be each other’s salvation? Or will any happiness they find be ripped to shreds by the deadly obsession of another?
