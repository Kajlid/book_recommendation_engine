  "title": "Good Times in the Hospital: A Medical Memoir",
  "description": "As the chapters accumulate, the reader begins to realize that doctors are not much different from the rest of us. As for the patients in these stories, although hospitals are engaged in the most serious business imaginable, you cannot find more laugh-out-loud behavior anywhere. This is because when people seek medical care they are vulnerable and reveal their true, inner selves. And, it turns out that the true, inner selves of most people are often some combination of fascinating, inexplicable, and ridiculous. Good Times in the Hospital asserts that it is unhealthy to take life too seriously, and a lighthearted temperament is just as important as a sound diet. This point of view makes it possible for one book to combine a rare glimpse into what goes on inside a hospital, an informative look at health care, and an entertaining collection of unlikely stories, poignant vignettes, and humorous anecdotes. The author says, \"If you think it is insensitive to laugh at doctors attending their patients and entertain ourselves with yarns of patients lying in their sickbed, you are reading the wrong book\"",
