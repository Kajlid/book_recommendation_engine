  "description": "Joan Aiken's last Nineteenth century romance is dedicated: \"To all Female Writers, past and present\" and tells the story of two identical but unrelated schoolfriends finishing the education at the Abbey school, Reading, which Jane Austen attended with her sister, Cassandra. This is not an Austen sequel, but tells the story of Alvey, one of the two girls, who agrees to impersonate the other in order to find herself a refuge where she can complete the novel she has always wanted to write. The Deception proves all too easy, as the family she meets are in desperate need of her help. With the conspiratorial assistance of Louisa's elder sisters, Alvey becomes a member of the troubled Winship family in a rambling Northumberland household. After many complexities and entanglements, she wins their affections to such an extent that as the deception gradually unravels, Alvey is begged by the family to stay on, to the shock of the returning Louisa. Aiken vividly evokes the ambiance of the great country house of the Regency period in a part of the English countryside she knew well from childhood visits.",
