  "description": "Elizabeth Hobbsâ€™ only concern is taking care of her dying father. She keeps to herself and is seen as an outsider to the villagers. She is plain, plump and a little shy. What she was not expecting was to be accused of being a witch and drug from her home in the dead of night to face the justice of The Minister. Isaac Patter cannot fathom why Elizabeth would be accused of witchcraft, but he refuses to stand by while the mob assaults her. Especially since he has never revealed the depths of his feelings for her. A short, Colonial romance with sexual themes.",
