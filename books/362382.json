  "description": "Twenty-eight years ago, Erich von Daniken first presented his theory of alien contact with the ancient world - a theory so incredible, yet so logical and convincing, that it has become part of a wide-ranging debate that continues to this day. His claims that an alien race helped create the pyramids of Egypt were based upon the ruins themselves. And it is these ruins that now provide researchers with a never-ending source of clues - new discoveries, new revelations, new evidence that Earth was indeed colonized by an alien race... New research showing that the location and design of the pyramids were uniquely fit for preservation - something the Egyptians couldn't possibly have known; remains of the ships built by the Pharaohs and buried with them for travel in the afterlife - imitations of the ships they saw used by men from the sky; the most recent discoveries - hidden chambers and passageways, one of which ends at an ancient door. And behind the door is... the unknown; prehistoric bones that prove the existence of a worldwide cult that deformed children's skulls in imitations of the \"gods\" they had seen; and new interpretations of ancient writings - and new speculations on ancient mysteries.",
