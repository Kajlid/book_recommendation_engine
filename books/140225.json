  "description": "My Yuletide Stop Living a LieWith Christmas coming, I, Carly Winston, know it's time to make changes in my life. I've spent way too much time hiding my family's past—and letting opportunities pass me by. Not even my boyfriend, Randy, or my friends in The Sisterhood of the Dropped Stitches know about my secret shame. I'm hoping my new role as Mary in the local nativity play will build my confidence and help me to open up to those I care about. My evolving relationship with Randy—and my future—are riding on my ability to share my heart.",
