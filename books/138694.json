  "title": "Endless Love",
  "description": "One of the most celebrated novels of its time, Endless Love tells the story of David Axelrod and his overwhelming love for Jade Butterfield. The two teenagers are consumed with each other; their rapport, their desire, and their sexuality take them further than they understand. But when Jade's father suddenly banishes David from the house, he fantasizes the forgiveness his rescue of the family will bring and sets a \"perfectly safe\" fire to their house. What unfolds is a nightmare, a dark world in which David's love is a crime and a disease, a world of anonymous phone calls, crazy letters, and new fears — and the inevitable and punishing pursuit of the one thing that remains most real to him: his endless love for Jade and her family.",
