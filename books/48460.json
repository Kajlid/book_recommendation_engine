  "description": "ISHues” is the follow up book to the author’s smash conversation igniter, “Ish.” Inspired by pithy, memorable phrases she saw stenciled on the wall of a department store and her own life happenings, Griffin began writing the collection of provoking sayings. Both books are filled with a pinch of dry wit, a dash of sarcasm and bundles of humor that will prove to be an enjoyable reading experience for all ages. The book’s title begs the question, “what is ‘Ish?” The author defines ‘Ish as a random, eclectic statement intended to provoke action or emotion - whether amusement, frustration, happiness or angst. ‘Ish can also be any wanton expression or point of view that creates a gust of thought. From arguably, usable advice to satirical comments, humorous one-liners and simple nuggets of wisdom, “ISHues – A Second Helping of Del’Ishcious ‘Ish” has plenty of banter to dish. The book picks up at ‘Ish #161, sharing 145 more juicy statements like, ‘Ish #176, “Parting your lips softly during a job interview is not enough to camouflage your sterling silver tongue ring.” ‘Ish #263 cautions, “Liking (not loving) your spouse is the key to great love making.” Another that is sure to influence decision making is ‘Ish #285, “If your therapist is a chain smoker and has involuntary face twitches, switch seats.” Readers will ROTFLAO, STH (shake their heads) and scream OMG as they gobble up this heaping, second helping of “ISHues.”",
