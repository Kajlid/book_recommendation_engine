  "title": "The Memory of Mankind: The Story of Libraries Since the Dawn of History",
  "description": "This revised edition of Alfred Hessel's 1950 A history of libraries takes bibliography into the information age. The b&w-illustrated history also goes back in time some 5,000 years before the original to reflect the discovery of clay tablet libraries in the ancient Middle East. Tolzmann (U. of Cincinnati) borrows the new title from Goethe, weaving the theme of memory through the course of examining how libraries came to be what they are today and where they may be headed next.
