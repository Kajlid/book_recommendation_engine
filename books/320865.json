  "description": "In a remote corner of West Africa, in a place that only the locals know about, the world of a young chimpanzee is changed forever by forces beyond his control. Lion Shaped Mountain is the story of chimpanzees struggling to survive against a world that becomes less survivable for them each day, and the resilience it takes to stay alive. It is a tale, told through the eyes of our closest living relatives, of how every facet of one's environment dictates one's world -- the flora and fauna, the actions and reactions, the histories and the present, the beliefs and realities. These are the forces that affect us all....and implicate us all.",
