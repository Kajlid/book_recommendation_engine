Forced into a mundane lifestyle, her dreams of glory on the battlefield urge her to practice in secret. When an ancient evil emerges and threatens the village, Ingrid seizes the opportunity to prove herself. Stowing aboard her fatherâ€™s dragon ship, she hurtles toward danger and comes face to face with abilities hidden deep within. As she struggles to understand her powers, strange beings, both beautiful and terrifying put her newfound strengths to the test. To make matters worse, she is pulled into Asgard and warned that all the realms are in turmoil. Only Ingrid holds the power to restore peace and order. Plunged into a destiny beyond her wildest dreams, she must decide what to do. How can a simple farm girl change the fate of nine realms? Will she take the risk to find out?",
