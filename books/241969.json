  "description": "Peacekeeper Incorporated's breakthrough nanotechnology could bring repeat offense crime to an end, freeing society from the need for criminal incarcerations. But first, they have to finish testing it. With funding on the line, and time to prove out the project getting short, the lead scientist must find a way speed things up. That's unfortunate for his guinea pig, and anyone who would stand in his way.  Can the goal of ending most crime justify committing one... even a few? And what happens when you conflate altruism with egotism?  Find out in eConscience Beta, where two lab techs and an uncouth petty criminal must outwit a brilliant but sociopathic scientist who'll stop at nothing to establish his legacy as the man who ended crime.",
