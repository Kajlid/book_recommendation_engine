  "title": "Fearless: Imagine Your Life Without Fear",
  "description": "They're talking layoffs at work, slow downs in the economy, flare-ups in the Middle East, turnovers at headquarters, downturns in the housing market, upswings in global warming. The plague of our day, terrorism, begins with the wordterror. News programs disgorge enoughhand-wringing information to warrant an advisory. Fear, it seems, has taken up a hundred-year lease on the building next door and setup shop. Oversized and rude, fear herds us into a prison of unlocked doors. Wouldn't it be great to walk out? Imagine your life, wholly untouched by angst. What if faith, not fear, was your default reaction to threats? If you could hover a fear magnet over your heart and extract every last shaving of dread, insecurity, or doubt, what would remain? Envision a day, just one day, where you could trust more and fear less. Can you imagine your life without fear?",
