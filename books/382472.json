  "description": "A 21st-century reworking of Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice,\" set in San Francisco with a gay twist. Twenty-two-year-old Greg DeAngelis moves west to escape his overbearing father, who's pressuring him to enter law school, and his poetry-loving ex-boyfriend, who dumps him for an older, richer man. Many guys vie for Greg's attention in his new home, but only one can give him \"the love thing.\" Can he figure out which one, before it's too late? This comic novel is about the importance of love and friendship, and of knowing who your real friends are.",
