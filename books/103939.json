  "title": "A King's Burden",
  "description": "Glenn Elambil has a secret and itâ€™s tearing him apart. His new wife is hunted by unfathomable evil, his father is dying, and the weight of the lives of the elven race hangs heavy on his shoulders. All he wants is to hide in the forest, warm and snuggled in the arms of his love, and raise a family of little Elambils. That tiny dream of warmth and innocence is slipping further away by the minute. If he has any chance of a long life with his wife, he has to face the overwhelming obstacles head-on. The fate of his world is a distant priority compared to that of his woman. If he could only find a way to keep her safe, the burden wouldn't be so heavy. With dragging steps he walks the path set before him, seeking always to rid himself of the secret he keeps locked in his heart. He would give anything to grow old with her, to see her scarred face wrinkle, but threats and attacks are growing disturbingly commonplace. If they can survive today, perhaps there can be a tomorrow.",
