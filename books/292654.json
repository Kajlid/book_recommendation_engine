  "description": "The dream to travel the stars was once thought to bring an age of peace and prosperity. In reality, it brought nothing more than hardship and war. After a century of conflict, an uneasy ceasefire has begun between the Federation and the Independent Alliance. All Joe Prevost and his crew of mercenaries had to do was to perform a simple job. Instead, they get redirected to the Vega system only to find themselves in a fight for their lives. Against an enemy, that was a creation of man's design.From within the void there is a darkness rising, a darkness that may cause the end of both the Federation and the Alliance.",
