  "description": "Holden Davis has enough problems: mounting debt, a lifelong feud with his brother and his father's legacy to live up to. If he's honest with himself, he'll admit that hiring an assistant in the dead of night probably wasn't the smartest thing to do either. But life gets more complex when Holden's funeral home has to process the bodies left behind by a serial killer. The bodies start to mount up, but the clues don't. Meanwhile, Holden finds himself falling in love with his beautiful but mysterious assistant, Eileen. Will forbidden love and a secret identity stop them from finding the killer?",
