My territory.I own everything and control everyone, Aurora included.She shouldn’t have barged into my world with no armour.She shouldn’t have caught my attention with no warning.Alas, she did.Then she thought she could disappear.If a battle is what it’ll take to protect and own her, I’ll shed blood.Wars aren’t fair, and neither am I.Rise of a Queen is the second part of a duet and is not standalone.",
