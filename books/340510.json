  "title": "Bad Girls",
  "description": "Sassy, brilliant, vicious, cunning, unstable, tough-as-nails—readers will relish these stories of 22 women in history who defied the mainstream boundaries and social mores of their times.  Each gripping story speaks for itself: from Queen Mary I who did ‘what it took’ to protect Catholicism in England, to Madame Mao who became one of communist China’s most powerful and feared leaders, to Georgia Tann who, as a director of the Tennessee Children’s Home, made millions selling babies on the black market.  Some of these women were cruel, others visionary, yet others blinded by ambition or love. All were driven by a powerful combination of primal forces.",
