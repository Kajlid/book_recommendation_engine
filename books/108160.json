Garvin’s worst fear is realized when he runs home from the fields to find his lover’s forge empty, his tools scattered, and the ground trampled by a band of soldiers. Nyle has been kidnapped and conscripted into the King’s army—a death sentence even for a big smith like Nyle.Garvin is untrained, unarmed, and nowhere near strong enough to take on one soldier, let alone a whole band. All he has to work with are his household skills and a way with horses, but he can't let that stop him. For the first time in his life, he prays to the Goddess for the help he desperately needs.He’s not expecting an answer. Particularly the one he gets. Content warning - contains a brief on-page episode of dubious to non-consensual sex.",
