  "title": "Pieces of Sky: The origin of a dissident",
  "description": "Here is a collection of short tales and anecdotes featuring my mother and brother. The primary influences that shaped me into the lovable weirdo that I have grown to become. My origin story can be gleaned from this loose documentation of my side of the story. Enough people have asked me to explain myself over the years, that in order to save time, I just wrote a book to explain it all.Why I am this way, how my family shaped me, what kind of farm my 80-year-old mom is trying to build, why I don't speak with my father, and why my brother is such a freaking jag.This will all paint the picture of why I'm single, why I quit drinking, and why my life is a constant tornado of emotions. Welcome to it; it's a rollercoaster. And a hilarious one at that.",
