  "description": "Both newcomers to Beatrice Bailey’s exploits and girls and boys who loved her previous escapade, The Everyday Witch , will delight in Sandra Forrester’s brand new adventure novel. Beatrice is a twelve-year-old witch whose talent for magic-making sometimes falters. In this story, the Witches’ Executive Committee is continuing its test to see if Beatrice can become a “Classical Witch,” capable of working important magic. She and her friends must now spend time in the village of Friar’s Lantern, a town surrounded by eerie swamps and located uncomfortably close to a menacing neighboring village called Werewolf Close. On a nighttime excursion they encounter strange blue lights in the marshes. Further bizarre adventures introduce Beatrice and friends to a maddened old man witch named Yorick . . . a weird group of magical cats . . . spooky ghosts who haunt the swamps . . . and the toad-like water leaper, whose generous spirit belies his ugly appearance. Here is exciting escape entertainment—a delightful mixture of humor, magic, and spooky adventure.",
