  "description": "Six months after freeing his slave Roman and his thrall Aron, Wulfgar finds himself bored with the choices of bed partners in his lands. Thus while on a twice-yearly trip to Londinium to replenish supplies, Wulfgar visits the local slave auction in hopes of finding something to pique his interest. His eye is caught by Kintaro, a beautiful, feminine slave boy from the Far East.Enthralled, Wulfgar doesn't care how much Kintaro costs; he's got to have him. But Kintaro is a very different sort of slave from Roman. He loves his duties, is proud of his skills, and as the former prized slave of an official of his homeland, is used to being spoiled and pampered in return for his efforts.Though oblivious to matters of the heart, Wulfgar is enamored of Kintaro, but his son Gaeric is furious that this new slave feeds his father's unnatural desires. Wulfgar's passion, Kintaro's pride, and Gaeric's temper will clash as a ritual from the past and a dream of the future come to fruition and Wulfgar's heart is finally fulfilled.",
