  "title": "The Rise of Ferryn",
  "description": "She left a broken girl. Damaged in a way no one should ever be. But determined to make a difference in the world. She stayed away. Training. Learning. Hardening. Bending and breaking herself into what she needed to become to fulfill her mission in life. Something righteous, but wicked in its own way. She returned a warrior. There were promises left unfulfilled. Questions left unanswered. Hearts to be unbroken. Maybe most especially her own. ** This book can be read as a standalone but is the first in the Legacy series to the Henchmen MC **",
