  "description": "Gen's family is more comfortable spending time apart than together. Then Gen's mom signs them up for Camp Frontier―a vacation that promises the \"thrill\" of living like 1890s pioneers. Forced to give up all of her modern possessions, Gen nevertheless manages to email her friends back home about life at \"Little Hell on the Prairie,\" as she's renamed the camp. It turns out frontier life isn't without its good points―like the cute boy who lives in the next clearing. And when her friends turn her emails into a blog, Gen is happily surprised by the fanbase that springs up. But just when it seems Gen and family might pull through the summer, disaster strikes as a TV crew descends on the camp, intent on discovering the girl behind the nationwide blogging sensation―and perhaps ruining the best vacation Gen has ever had.",
