She travels there in search of the romance and excitement of the Wild West. She finds her excitementâ€”in the form of angry Indians, smelly dogs, and drunk cowboys who won't take no for an answer. Romance comes in the form of a ruggedly handsome rancher named Paul McGregor who could devastate her chastity with just a glance of his faded blue eyes. Too bad he calls her a whore within the first minute of their acquaintance.Paul has spent three years trying to hold his family and his ranch together after the death of his parents. When he saves a stunning blonde, wearing a scandalous dress that only a soiled dove would own, from a group of drunken ranch hands, he tries to do the right thing and get her work at a good saloon. He soon finds out the woman whose favors he would love to buy is the heiress who owns the land that is the key to his family's financial future, not the prostitute he thought she was. Paul decides to use his best weapon to win Lilly over and get her seduction.A wicked cattle baron wants her land as well and will kill anyone who stands between him and what he wants. Paul will have to decide what he wants more, the woman or her land.",
