  "description": "After running away from an emotionally abusive relationship, Olivia Edwards returns to her hometown of Moonrise Beach for refuge. But no matter how much time has passed, her rebellious past still continues to haunt her. Everyone remembers her as a troublemaking wild child and wishes for her to leave, but Olivia is set on walking the straight and narrow while making Moonrise Beach her forever home.  Deacon Thorpe of the Moonrise Beach Police Department won’t make it easy for her though. After his reputation has been tarnished, he has made a new rule for himself—no more women. Restricting himself means there won’t be any more trouble under his watch.  But when Olivia is caught committing a foolish crime, Deacon has no choice but to punish her. In doing so, he realizes that the stories about her may not all be true. Now, Deacon is the one fighting to protect his heart from Olivia’s wild ways. Because when it comes to love, rules are always made to be broken.",
