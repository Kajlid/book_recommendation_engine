  "description": "Hooking up with your best friend’s brother is a big no-no, but when Nora gets invited to spend the holidays in Venice, she comes face to face with the star of many of her fantasies, Grayson Pierce. She’s harbored feelings for him since she was a teenager, but he is absolutely off limits. All she has to do is survive her Christmas vacation and then she can put him out of her mind, but things are never that simple. Nora can’t stop old feelings from resurfacing and the more she tries to stay away from Gray, the more she wants him. Can Nora and Gray build a relationship when the two live on separate continents? And what happens when her bestie finds out that she’s sleeping with her brother?",
