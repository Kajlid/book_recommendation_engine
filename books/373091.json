  "description": "Chasing Hell can be harmless. Unless you catch it. Summer, 1983. As fall approaches and the summer stock theaters on Cape Cod close for the season, three promising young actors and a stagehand pile into an old Ford Fairlane and head for a vacation resort in Maine. Hoping for a relaxing getaway before pursuing their dreams, they instead encounter a bizarre storm while on a lonely stretch of highway and soon find themselves stranded in the strange rural community of Boxer Hills. At first glance it seems a harmless little backwoods town, but Boxer Hills has a horrible secret and a deadly history. It's a place of horrific age-old rituals and a legendary evil that will let no one escape without paying a terrible price. Before the sun rises on a new day, they will have to fight their way through the night and out of town, or risk falling prey to a demonic creature so profane few will even speak its name. They were young, reckless and chasing Hell. What they hadn't counted on was actually catching it.",
