  "title": "The pain of unemployment: suffering and transformation",
  "description": "Unemployment is responsible for several causes of suffering which I present and explain here. My objective in writing this book is to help those who, like myself, are living this situation, by addressing the ways of dealing with the diverse forms of suffering that unemployment entails, and to help restore, or find, happiness. I would like, also, to be able to inspire those who, although they are not living this situation personally, may use these same lessons at other times or situations in their lives, or who can help those, close to them, who are living this problem. this book holds no secret, no magical solution and no way out. Only a way in. This is a book to help you when things go wrong, not when things go well â€“ for that you would need no book.",
