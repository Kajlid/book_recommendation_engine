  "description": "The Sins of the Mother.  The Decimation of the Daughter.  The Depravity of the Father.  The Determination of the Child.  In this place of darkness, there is no hope, no love, no light—only the will to survive.   My name is Luke Greene, but feel free to address me as Pater.  Our little family love fest started with my mother, and you can call that crazy bitch Taylee. Don't worry about running into her, though—Mommy Dearest paid her way with me a long time ago.  But my kids?  I've taught them to love me the way a child should love their father. I've shown them that things are earned under my roof and not easily handed out.  Before you judge me too harshly for how my family works, ask yourself this? Are you perfect or do you have sins too?  If you've answered the latter, put down your stones, take a seat, and allow me to show you how a family should be fucking run.  Welcome to my home.",
