  "description": "Raggedy Ann has been entertaining and charming young readers ever since the first book created by Johnny Gruelle in 1918 chronicled the adventures of the mischievous rag doll and her delightful toy friends. Gruelle's inspiration was a real dollâ€”a doll made for his mother by his grandmother and then much loved by his daughter Marcella. Raggedy Ann Stories , Gruelle's first collection of tales, was soon followed by books that introduced Raggedy Andy and the fairyland called the Deep, Deep Woods.In this edition of The Raggedy Ann Stories, which contains the best original tales and artwork, you'll meet the rag doll's toy friends, as well as Fido the dog and Marcella, the little girl in whose house there is a special room where Raggedy Ann and all the other dolls live. Often, by the end of a story, after an exciting adventure or, perhaps, a wonderful journey, Raggedy Ann and her friends have learned a small but valuable lesson of life.From the days of her discovery by the real Marcella, the little rag doll with the red-yarn hair has inspired timeless tales and colorful pictures and has stirred the imaginations of millions of young readers all over the world.",
