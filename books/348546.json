  "description": "This is the classic fairy tale turned on its head. In Cinderalla, Dad and the stepsisters are zombies, the family runs a yakitori restaurant, and the prince is so sick he’s on a permanent IV support system. Junko Mizuno’s work possesses a postfeminist consciousness, and the book’s psychedelic tone is enhanced by the artist’s playful, “grotesque-cute” color illustrations.",
