  "title": "Drum, Chavi, Drum!/¡Toca, Chavi, toca!",
  "description": "Even though nobody in her Cuban-American neighborhood thinks girls should play the drums, Chavi knows she was born to play. She drums on paint cans, sofa arms, even on her mother’s cheeks. Her favorites are the tumbadoras, conga drums. So, when she’s not picked to play on the school float for Calle Ocho—Miami’s Eighth Street carnaval—she decides to do something about it! Mayra L. Dole’s plucky little musician will drum her way into the hearts of all young readers, who will add her to their list of favorite heroines. Tonel’s illustrations capture the flavor of Calle Ocho’s inhabitants and celebrations.",
