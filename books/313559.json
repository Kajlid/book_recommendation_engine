  "description": "1 hour, 47 minutes From the New York Times best-selling author of A Gentleman in Moscow and Rules of Civility comes a stylish and alluring new story about art, money, and a precious family heirloom - brought magically to life by the beloved voice of six-time Emmy-winner John Lithgow. Like many well-to-do Upper East Siders over the age of 65, esteemed art appraiser Percival Skinner had planned to spend his retirement living off his savings. But a market correction has left him living below his prior means. One day he’s visited by a dapper fixer in search of a famous work by the Renaissance master Giuseppe Didomenico. Skinner knows the work well: The original was owned by his ancestor, and was passed down through his family over the generations. If, as an intermediary, he can coordinate a sale, a small fortune awaits. Problem is, he might not be the only one on the make. Told with the quixotic energy of a classic Henry James tale and the gleeful absurdity of drawing-room comedy, this playful and effortlessly heartwarming story from one of America’s most gifted writers is a welcome reminder that sometimes what we find is more valuable than what we are looking for.",
