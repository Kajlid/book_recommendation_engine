  "description": "They say suicides are damned for eternity. But if coming back to life in the bodies of violent criminals is Hell, then Dan Jenkins will take it. And he does, every time a portal arrives to whisk him from his ghostly exile in limbo.Dan rides the living like a supernatural jockey, pushing out their consciousness and taking over. They're bad guys, right? Killers and brutes of every sort, which makes it okay. He doesn't know where their minds go while he's in charge, and for the most part doesn't care. For three weeks at a time, it's a chance to relax and watch movies, read fantasy novels, and have random conversations with perfect strangers.Normally, before the villain returns to kick him out, Dan dishes out a final serving of justice and leaves the world a safer place. It's one of the rules if he wants more rides, and he's happy to oblige. For a part-time dead guy, itâ€™s a pretty good gig ... until someone changes the rules.\"Kick\" is the first book in a series of dark fantasy paranormal thrillers. If you like \"Quantum Leap\" and \"Every Day,\" you'll love this gritty, hilarious, and original take on the body hijacking hero story. Vividly written, \"Kick\" is a wild ride with a sharp sarcastic wit and a flawed yet likable main character.",
