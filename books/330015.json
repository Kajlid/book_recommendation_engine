  "title": "An Anzac's Story",
  "description": "This book was written by an ordinary ANZAC soldier. Roy Kyle started writing this memoir at the age of 89 and almost completed it before he died. A typical Anzac, fiercely patriotic, he enlisted in the A.I.F. in 1915, several months underage. He spent his eighteenth birthday in the terrible tranches of Gallipoli and then went on to serve on the Western Front. Roy Kyle's story begins with his colorful, classic Australian childhood in country new South Wales and Victoria in the early years of last century. Bryce Courtenay, who helped get Roy Kyle's memoirs published, has provided a moving introduction to this life and times.",
