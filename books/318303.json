  "description": "Everything begins.Everything ends.Sometimes, it has to end before it begins.In the course of a year, I have had my heart broken, reforged, only to be shattered again. The tears won’t come. Not anymore. No more looking back. No more asking what if.Coop wants me to let myself feel it. Jake wants to distract me. Archie wants to put the world at my feet. Ian wants me to not make choices until I’m ready. I’ve got family ready to catch me, but I refuse to fall.No more waiting.No more holding my breath.The future is now.We have a chance to forge the path we want and I’m all in.So why does it feel like I’m running away?",
