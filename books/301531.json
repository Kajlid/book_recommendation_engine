  "title": "Lost in Yaba: Down and Out in Laos",
  "description": "Lost in Yaba is a true story about an expat who becomes addicted to the infamous drug 'yaba' in Laos. Walt Gleeson planned to only go to Laos on a visa trip from Thailand, but he ended up staying in Vientiane and Vang Vieng for over a year. Most foreigners who visit Vientiane can hardly believe it is a capital city. It is a sleepy, peaceful city in one of the most under developed counties in Asia. But there is a hidden side to Vientiane that most foreigners do not get to see. During Walt's time in Vientiane, he witnessed the underbelly of the city first hand - the drugs, the prostitution and the manipulation of western men for money. This provides a unique glimpse into the dark side of Laos.",
