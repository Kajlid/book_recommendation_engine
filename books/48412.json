  "description": "How did an image-obsessed shopaholic become an environmentalist and learn to achieve sustainability with style? It wasn't always an easy road, but after a few personal disasters Lisa figured out how to be green without losing her identity, and she's sharing her lessons with you.Part autobiography, part eco-guidebook and part cultural exploration, Lisa shares everything from learning the ropes of eco-fashion and natural beauty products, to understanding the best way to talk about the environment with non-greenies and how she eventually found her own eco-balance. If you've ever wanted to 'go green' but just can't picture yourself as a tree hugger, let Lisa show you how you can achieve sustainability without losing your personal style.Throughout her story Lisa also examines cultural and social barriers to climate change action. After all, the environmental dilemma is not just a scientific one, it's a human one, a cultural one, a personal one and a collective one, and understanding these barriers will assist the movement in entering mainstream culture, enabling a sustainable future for all.",
