  "title": "Coming of Age: Enslaved, Sold & Trained",
  "description": "This 109,000-word novel takes you through the trials, tribulations and challenges of a young girl whose bright future is imperiled by treachery. As a girl of privilege, she is not prepared for life as a slave. She is even less prepared for the life of a ponygirl. Will she adapt or is there an escape available?  Becoming an adult meant that Esme could now inherit her fatherâ€™s estate, long managed by her dower and unlikeable uncle. She would finally be out from under his direction and control. However, on the very eve of her emancipation she is taken by slave traders. Suspicious timing you may say. She is transported in the most degrading fashion to the slave market in the very town where she was to have come out.  As a slave she is kept under tight restraint and strict painful discipline.  Will she be able to find a way out of this situation or is she destined to be sold, and spend her life as a slave, or perhaps as a ponygirl treated always as an animal? Kept in constant restraints and never allowed to speak ponygirls are at least allowed, or compelled to be outside where she has become a means of transportation.  This book contains depictions of tight restraint, humiliation, Ponygirl conversion and training, and corporal punishment.",
