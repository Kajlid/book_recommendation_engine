  "description": "Did someone really kill Grandma or am I and my merry band of geriatric thieves imagining things? The best thing my daredevil husband ever did was give me his grandma. Even after his death, I remained close to her. When she dies, I'm naturally devastated.Grandma's knitting group of Jessica Fletcher wannabes are convinced Grandma's death wasn't natural. Something to do with knitting needle placement? No idea what they're talking about. The police think the old ladies are senile. I don't necessarily disagree, but I'm always up for a bit of excitement as long as it doesn't lead to a night in jail. Well, more than one night anyway. But someone is not happy with our snooping around, which only spurs us on to snoop more. Things are starting to heat up in our little town.Will we find Grandma's killer in time?",
