  "description": "Mills & Boon Blush series brings you moving, true-to-life romancesProsecutor Gwendolyn Haverty puts bad guys in jail…and keeps them there. That isn't easy when defence lawyers like Aaron Zimmerman try to spring them out again. Zimmerman is a rumpled do-gooder on a mission to free the innocent - which, of course, includes every single one of his clients behind bars!  His latest mission's success depends on convincing Gwen to listen to his witness. Fine. That ten minutes she gives Aaron to plead his case results in a ridiculous cell phone mix-up… and a play date for their two boys? She's not sure how the line between professional and personal gets blurred so quickly. But it can't happen again. She can't let this man, no matter how compassionate, into her heart.",
