  "title": "Ghosts and Other Aberrations",
  "description": "Ghosts and Other Aberrations is written by a former paranormal investigator. These stories are based on theories and ideas that I have developed over many years of study in this field. They not only set out to entertain and be downright spooky, but also examine the human side. Fear is not the only emotion that we feel, so why be one-dimensional? These stories also highlight the emotional side of a paranormal occurrence or a haunting. A few of my stories definitely tug at the heartstrings.Aberration is such a good word. The dictionary definition says it is 'a departure from what is normal, usual, or expected, typically an unwelcome one'. Most of my stories contain such things. These tales are fictional, and for entertainment purposes only (as all the paranormal TV programmes state), but that doesn't mean that they COULDN'T actually happen, does it? Some are meant as cautionary tales against using the paranormal and occult as a plaything. This book is a follow-on from my previous book 'Mysteria - An anthology of spooky and mysterious tales'. It is meant to be enjoyed in a quiet room when you are all alone. A room where the light throws certain corners into darkness. It is in those corners that the demons and anomalies in my book dwell - there.....and in your nightmares.",
