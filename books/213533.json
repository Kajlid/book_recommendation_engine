  "description": "Monk is tired of hearing critics bash Canadian film and culture generally, and lionizing mediocre talent just because it hails from south of the border. A music critic and entertainment writer for the Vancouver Sun and Canadian radio, she looks at over 100 Canadian films and hears from filmmakers in order to capture the essence of the Canadian film experience.
