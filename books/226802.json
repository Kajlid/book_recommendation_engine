  "title": "Genesis and the Big Bang: The Discovery Of Harmony Between Modern Science And The Bible",
  "description": "Here is a ground-breaking book that takes on skeptics from both sides of the cosmological debate, arguing that science and the Bible are not at odds concerning the origin of the universe.The culmination of a physicist's thirty-five-year journey from MIT to Jerusalem. Genesis and the Big Bang presents a compelling argument that the events of the billions of years that cosmologists say followed the Big Bang and those of the first six days described in Genesis are, in fact, one and the same - identical realities described in vastly different terms. In engaging, accessible language, Dr. Schroeder reconciles the observable facts of science with the very essence of Western religion: the biblical account of Creation.Carefully reviewing and enterpreting accepted scietific principle, analogous passages of Scripture, and biblical scholarship, Dr. Schroeder arrives at a conclusion to lucid that one wonders why it has taken this long in coming. The result for the reader - whether believer or skeptic, Jewish or Christian - is a totally fresh understanding of the key events in the life of the universe.",
