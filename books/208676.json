  "description": "She has a chance to find something more precious than gold, if she is brave enough to trust her heart. . . .\nHer intense passion for unlocking the secrets of the past is what made Carter Wessex an archeologist. Now she had been given a chance to dig on Farrell Mountain where a doomed party of minutemen lost their lives as well as the gold they were carrying during the Revolutionary War. Carter refuses to let the mountain's owner, Nick Farrell, rattle her, even though she is all too aware of his sexy yet sardonic presence. Her work on the mountain could be the most significant find of her career . . . if she can pull herself away from the smoldering attraction that is undeniably growing between them. Beneath the steely looks Nick Farrell wears like a well-cut suit, he is a man of hidden tenderness. From his first meeting with Carter, there is an immediate flare, hotter than he has ever experienced before. But no one is more surprised than Nick when his desire for her deepens into something enduring. Now Nick must find a way to convince Carter that the real treasure to be found on Farrell Mountain is a true and lasting love. . . .",
