  "description": "\"Even doctors--or perhaps especially doctors--need to be touched by something personally to understand the suffering of others.\" When Jane Wilson-Howarth's son, David, is diagnosed with serious neurological disorders, his family faces a major decision. They can stay in England, where David has access to the best in Western medical care, or return to their current home in remote Rajapur Island, Nepal, where he has the chance of living his life to the fullest. There, he would be freed from invasive medical testing, and treated as a person rather than an \"interesting case.\" This poignant memoir tells of the family's time in Rajapur and Kathmandu, conjuring in vivid detail the events of David's short--but cherished--life, the sounds, sights and smells of the exotic bazaars, the warmth and complexity of the people, and the stunning natural beauty of Nepal. Readers will be moved and inspired by this true story of courage, love and a family's determination to give their child the best life possible.",
