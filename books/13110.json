But we do not always work effectively - we work hard but not always smart. To increase performance many people believe they need to do more. We spend less time with our loved ones, neglect our health and put our passions and hobbies on the back burner. And we end up frustrated, out of control and stressed. Work Smarter: Live Better will transform your life - learn simple and practical tools to be in control at work, learn how to gain an extra two hours per day, and learn how to make room for what is important to you! This journey will challenge your way of thinking about work. You will learn how to work smarter and more importantly, live better.",
