  "description": "Five years ago, vampires came out of hiding and took over the world. It was meant to be a quick enslavement but it turned into a bloody battle that brought humanity to the brink of extinction.Isabelle Bryant is one of the “lucky” survivors, now living in hiding, scavenging for food through deserted towns. And she’s tired of it. So she’s devised a plan: find the king of the vampires and drive a stake through his heart.Except that wickedly sensual king Marcus is nothing like the monster she expected. And while landing on his bed was part of the plan all along, discovering that he might hold the key to humanity’s survival certainly wasn’t. The catch? Saving humanity also means ensuring vampire survival. It means giving up hope for a return to a human-ruled world. As sparks fly and hate becomes heat, Isabelle must pick a side -- before the darkness devours them all.** This is Book One of the Dark Tides trilogy **",
