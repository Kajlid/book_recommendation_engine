  "description": "Nineteen-year-old Ana Zhao has a laundry list of disorders that challenge her everyday life since she was a kid. Despite the onset of a global famine, Ana juggles school, family, a new relationship and friends while internally battling her afflictions. She has managed to keep it together until she receives news that her emotionally abusive grandfather and deceptive cousin are coming to stay with her and her family for the two-week celebration of Chinese New Year. A panic attack at school sends her on a downward spiral that causes tension for everyone at home. To escape the drama, she attempts to seek solace in her boyfriend Nathan by spending every moment she can with him only to realize that he and his family are hiding something. To make matters worse, she can’t shake the feeling that someone is following her around. On the verge of losing her mind, Ana eventually learns the reason behind her disorders and how much of a role she has in the global famine, leaving her in the middle of two opposing ancient forces. She is left with one final and difficult decision—trust a callous stranger who doesn’t hide his contempt for her, or the person she loves.",
