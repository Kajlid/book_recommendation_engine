  "description": "A hot baseball romance by bestselling author Mindy Klasky.  Drew Marshall, the Raleigh Rockets' bad-boy shortstop, is about to be cut from the team. In the midst of spring training his baseball skills are slipping, and his recent scrapes with the law have put him in hot water.  Drew's agent hires spin doctor Jessica Barnes to save the shortstop's career. Although she knows nothing about baseball, she is determined to work day and night to save Drew – and to prove she's over the death of her risk-taking husband.  Jessica's campaign spirals out of control when a well-intentioned teammate announces she is Drew's secret fiancée. Now trapped in the same hotel room, the couple crafts a fake relationship to satisfy ravenous reporters, all the while doing their best to resist a mutual attraction that's hotter than the Florida weather.  But how can a relationship survive when it's built on secrets and lies?
