  "description": "After spending six months caring for her terminally ill mother, Kori is shocked when she learns the true identity of her father. Armed with the name of a man she’s never met, Kori sets off across the country to meet the person responsible for half of her DNA. There’s only one problem: he’s the President of the No Prisoners Las Vegas chapter.  Raised as the step-daughter of an MC member, Kori has one rule when it comes to dating: no bikers. Following that rule becomes a challenge, however, when she meets Lucky, a member of her father’s club.  Lucky has his own perspective on the dating world: don’t do it. He’s a tried and true bachelor with a revolving door to his bedroom and no interest in a relationship. But what starts as some harmless flirting quickly escalates until he can’t get Kori out of his mind.  For a time, the relationship seems perfect, but Lucky is struggling with a secret. He discovered that the president and VP are breaking club bylaws in a way that might undermine the entire chapter. He was preparing to take action when Kori arrived in town. Now he has to make a decision: will he move against the club leadership knowing that Kori will be caught in the crossfire? And what will happen if he holds onto the secret for too long?",
