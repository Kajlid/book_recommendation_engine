  "description": "Payne:In search of: room to rent.Must ignore the patheticness of a forty-year-old roommate.Preferably dirt cheap as funds are tight (nonexistent).There’s nothing sadder than moving back to my hometown newly divorced, homeless, and lost for what my next move is.When my little brother’s best friend offers me a place to stay in exchange for menial duties, I swallow my pride and jump at the offer.I need this.I also need Beau to wear a shirt. And ditch the gray sweatpants. And not leave his door ajar when he’s in compromising positions ...Beau:In search of: roommate.Must be non smoker and non douchebag.Room payment to be made in meal planning, repairs, and dumb jokes.Since my career took off, I barely have time to breathe, let alone keep my life in order. I’m naturally chaotic, make terrible decisions, and scare off potential dates with my “weirdness”.So when Payne gets back into town and needs somewhere to stay, I offer him my spare room with one condition: while he’s staying with me, I need him to help me become date-able.And while he does that, I can focus on my other plan: ignoring that Payne is the only man I’ve ever wanted to date.",
