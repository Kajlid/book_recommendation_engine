  "description": "At one point the streets of Utopolis were not safe to walk down, but that was a long time ago, before the superheroes came. With crime fighters with extraordinary powers patrolling the city was left in peace, or so everyone thought. When guards were down, tragedy struck in the form of a murdered boy, a boy who had just developed his super powers. With no clear motives and no suspects, the superhero group, The Seven Deadlies, attempt to get to the bottom of the case, but at what cost? It appears like the deeper they dig to unearth the truth, the deeper they find themselves in the dangers way, and they soon suspect that they may be the true target of the criminal force behind the disruption. Join The Seven Deadlies for the humorous thrill ride in this comical mystery adventure, as we learn of their sorted pasts, and hope for their fated futures. Superhero's Welcome is a witty journey into the thin line known as good versus evil. With an assortment of characters that enjoy clever banter as much as fighting crime, this tale is a cross blend of Superfriends meets Seinfeld.",
