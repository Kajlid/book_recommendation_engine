  "description": "Vegas casino owner Reno Gabrini just wanted to take it easy. His beloved PaLargio was back in business and turning profits like the good old days. His headliner act, pop sensation Shay Grayson, was packing the house and making amends for her diva ways. His gorgeous African-American wife, Trina, was working hard to make her own mark on the business world and was holding her head up high despite rumors of his infidelity. His sons were happy, healthy, and completely devoted to their father. All, Reno thought, was right with the world. Until his oldest son falls in love with a ruthless woman almost twice his age, his wife reestablishes contact with a man he told her to stay away from, and he is nearly destroyed by an enemy that targets, not his mind, soul, or body, but his heart.  In the latest installment of the romantic Mob Boss Series (Book Eight), Reno Gabrini must confront the ghosts of his past as he seeks to protect his family from a subtle, but just as dangerous, foe.",
