Being a misfit didn't bother her until a G.J. aimed prank gone wrong caused her motherâ€™s death by killer bees. Since then she has moved to the other side of the country to live with her Aunt. In this new town being a social outcast is the least of her troubles. The head cheerleader wants her head and the hottest guy in school sends her to the hospital. In this bizarre world there is a new definition for normal. Along the way she will make friends, make enemies and discover she can't always trust she is in control of herself. She isn't the only one who can do the unusual.",
