  "description": "It's simple, settling now, means paying for it later. Since the very beginning, humanity has struggled with this reality. Time after time we have seen our nature prevail in regard to standards. My fear, is that we have become okay with it. We, the church, believe that God sent his Son to restore relationship between God and man, but do we believe that in that sacrifice, Jesus invited us and the Spirit enabled us, to live a life firmly secured by the standards of God himself? Do we truly know what it means to be “People of the Spirit,” or are we calling ourselves “Followers of Christ,” while living as people of compromise?",
