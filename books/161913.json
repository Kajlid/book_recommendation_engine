  "description": "Two people. A relationship with no commitment. What could go wrong? Javier Cruz definitely isn’t relationship material, but that suits Hazel Gellar just fine. She’s not a girlfriend girl and doesn’t plan on ever being one. But after a mind-blowing, bed-breaking night, she knows once isn’t going to be enough. Fortunately, Javi feels the same way. And it's not just the sex. Javi is funny and complicated and Hazel loves being around him, even when he drives her nuts. Will she and Javi make the choice to be together for longer than just right NOW? Or will their hangups about romance be the end?",
