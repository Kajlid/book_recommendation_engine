  "title": "Cultural Mythologies of Russian Modernism: From the Golden Age to the Silver Age",
  "description": "The twenty-two essays in Cultural Mythologies of Russian Modernism , six of which appear in Russian, display the enormous advances that have taken place among Slavists in the study of the fascinating, but tragically circumscribed period in Russian literature that extends from the turn of the century to the Stalinist holocaust. This collection offers a definitive statement of how features of the Pushkin era were transformed during the Modernist age into a cultural mythology that encompassed personal and literary behavior, and such far-reaching issues as national identity and cultural destiny.",
