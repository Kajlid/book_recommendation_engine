  "description": "Between Tads and Toads is an illustrated story in verse for adults about pretty frog Frederic who struggles to fit in with the pondling society of toads, frogs and tads. Set by a pond in the idyllic British countryside where everything rhymes, life is an endless parade of picnics, swimming races and all things nice, except for Frederic.“Author Christine May has captured the look, feel, and soul of true classic works with this excellent narrative tale, one which readers could get lost in again and again (…) The words flow just like the water, the breeze, and the characters do, making Between Tads and Toads a poignant and striking work that will certainly bridge the gap for those seeking modern classics to enjoy.” - Reader’s Favorite\"The story is charming, and so is the amphibian society depicted: toads in tailcoats and frogs in ascots eating ice cream on park benches, being measured for bespoke ensembles, and skiing. The pen-and-ink illustrations are a highlight, as whimsical and elegant as the characters they portray (...) Great for fans of Kenneth's Grahame's The Wind in the Willows and T.S. Eliot's Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats.\"- Booklife by Publisher’s Weekly",
