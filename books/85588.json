  "description": "Emily Paget, poor relation of an earl, shocks her family with her determination to earn her own living, rather than submit to a ‘respectable’ marriage. The adventure brings her to the notice of her eccentric Russian grandmother, who whisks her off to St Petersburg. There Emily finds the freedom she craves amongst the drawing-room revolutionaries; and falls passionately in love, never dreaming how close they are to real revolution.When it comes, bloody and brutal, Emily’s courage is tested to the full. Only she can save something from the wreck and bring the last of her family safe out of Russia. But she must leave behind the man she loves, not knowing even if he is alive or dead . . .",
