Mr Orange (not his real name) is an Art Dealer, mega wealthy, and totally drool worthy. He cares about her a great deal. Can she give Mr Orange a chance, or will she remain in the lifestyle she is accustomed to? Can someone who has never loved, or felt love, learn the art of Love? *** Please be aware the content of this book contains strong, and graphic scenes. Trixie also swears, a lot.
