  "description": "A dystopian distant future novel. An inquisitive heroine, smitten by love & fuelled by angst, seeks to break free of her enclosed community to make meaningful contact with another. The protagonist, Uncumber, begins life in privileged home. She's estranged from her family by their reliance on drugs to regulate emotions & social interactions. She leaves them in order to pursue Noli, a man she falls in love with on 1st sight despite a language barrier, which inhibits any relationship with him or his family. Noli unlike Uncumber is from the working class. She abandons him when he insists on using the drugs she abhors in love making. She makes it full circle when she's picked up afterwards by the police & imprisoned in a room remarkably similar to the one in which she began & is reconciled to the medicated life where every emotion exists on tap & intimate sex has been replaced by lying next to your lover experiencing entirely private hallucinations.",
