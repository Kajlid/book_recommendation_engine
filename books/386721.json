Mar is born into an age where magic is a mathematical science and technology is simply another word for magic. The consequences of a globe annihilating conflict hurl him as an infant into a mundane future where magic is no more than a despised fanatical religion. In order to escape a destiny that magicians long dead have written for him, he must learn to use the inborn abilities that make him the last true master of magic.",
