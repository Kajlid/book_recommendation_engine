  "description": "Possibly the first true best-seller of the new media era…From the author of the million-read “James Potter and the Hall of Elders’ Crossing”, comes an all new story, this time with a dark and unique twist: it is quite possibly the first magical adventure in which the heroine might also be the villain.This from the official website ( http://www.girlonthedock.com )“Returning to the home of her grandfather after her final school year, Petra Morganstern is a changed young witch. Confident in her recent choices, yet plagued by dreams of what they cost her, Petra is unsure what to do with the rest of her life. Petra’s one ray of hope is her young step-sister, Izabella, whose simple-minded charm is only offset by the awful Phyllis, her hateful mother. Desperate to protect Izabella from the increasing rages of Phyllis, Petra struggles to find balance between the forces that seek to rule her heart. Will she cling to the choices she has already made, upholding good over her own greatest desires, or will the ghost of power and revenge, always at work in the back room of her mind, be her final undoing? As things spiral out of control, Petra finds herself confronted with the unforgiving force of destiny, thrusting her into the ultimate choice one more time. Only this time, no one will be there to save the day. This time, the choice will be Petra’s alone.”Check out the professionally animated teaser trailer here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SAdyW...Read a free excerpt here: http://www.gatekeeperscurse.com/chapt...",
