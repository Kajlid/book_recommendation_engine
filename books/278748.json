Thus begins DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, the second book in the Laura Cardinal series. When two newlyweds are found murdered at an Arizona campground, Arizona Department of Public Safety detective Laura Cardinal is enlisted to investigate. Laura Cardinal has made a specialty of troubleshooting serious crimes in small towns. Teamed with a partner who is working her last nerve, and visited by the ghost of her mentor, homicide cop Frank Entwistle, Laura’s already walking an emotional tightrope. The lies she uncovers create a chilling portrait of the dark side of love. And when she discovers one victim’s ties to an underground organization, she is plunged into a high-stakes conspiracy played out against the unforgiving backdrop of the Mojave Desert—where there are no second chances.",
