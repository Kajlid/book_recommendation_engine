  "description": "I didn’t want to do this, in the middle of the restaurant, but there was nothing I could do. My body wasn’t under my own control and my response was involuntary, my thighs beginning to quiver, my breath coming faster. --------- FROM NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING & AWARD WINNING AUTHOR SELENA KITT NOW A MOTION PICTURE FROM ADAM & EVE --------- Charlie is just an average woman—mother, wife, teacher—living an ordinary life in a typical American suburb, and she isn’t complaining. She loves her husband, Jack, and their children, and wouldn’t ask for more even if she could. But Charlie discovers something has been missing. Something secret. Forbidden. Something that turns their intimate life from a mundane distraction into a mind-blowing, transcendent experience. This is the story of a woman’s exquisite unfolding, as her discovery and yearning for something more pushes her marriage to the edge, testing boundaries and forcing her to surrender to something much deeper than herself.",
