  "description": "Liza Moultrie has been on the run from her past for over a year, trying to make sense of the events surrounding the attack that brought her life to a screeching halt. Life in Helen, Georgia has been kind to her and the friendships she found there have made the healing process a little easier, if painstakingly slow. Unable to distinguish nightmares from memories, she turns to the two guys who stomped into her life with without warning. Parker and Kade James have secrets of their own, and apparently they’re bad at keeping them. Helen was supposed to be one more stop on the road, one more pay cheque. That was until they met their mate. Their mate. Two brothers, one seemingly human girl, and they’re both drawn to her. When Liza’s past catches up to her, can the brothers keep her safe? Can she let them in and accept her place as their mate? With danger stalking her, literally, throughout the town she has come to think of as her refuge, Liza has only one choice: Trust them.",
