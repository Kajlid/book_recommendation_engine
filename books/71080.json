What if there was a cult of adulterated men who would do anything to kill him for fucking their wives into useless shells of nymphoid lust? What if a woman possessed was so utterly tormented, that the only way to save her soul was to perform a Sexorcism? What if a scaticallogically inclined man found a way to pleasure himself with bed bugs? What if a woman fell in love with a dinosaur? What if a seemingly innocent Furry gangbang turned out to be a mating ritual for a tribe of nomadic cannibal were-teddy bears?These questions and many more will be answered when StrangeHouse books takes you on a journey unlike any you've ever seen before with their debut anthology of strange erotic horror fiction, “Strange Sex”. 13 tales of erotic fiction from Kevin Strange, D.F.
