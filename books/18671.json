He goes into hiding at his favorite town in Wind River, Idaho, and plans to spend a few months fishing before looking for his next job. But upon his arrival, he finds his longtime friends have fallen vulnerable to the foreclosure of their bar. He vows to help them fight a powerful and unethical newcomer, Mr. Templeton, not realizing that their struggles must overcome murder, cheating, and figuring out who they can trust. Trust even amongst themselves. Ben is forced down a road through seemingly unrelated events of fate, natural and supernatural happenings, all of which result in a composite of the man of confidence and skill, and his new found ability to love. This change that overpowers him begins when he lands in Wind River.",
