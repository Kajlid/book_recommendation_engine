  "description": "He’s my brother’s best friend.The hot single dad next door.And one accidental sext later, my massive crush on him is no longer a secret.It’s my own damn fault. I’m thirty years old, for heaven’s sake. I’m a kindergarten teacher and a (reasonably) responsible adult. I should know better than to get tipsy and draft a fake text listing all the dirty things I wish Officer Cole Mitchell would do to me.I wasn’t supposed to hit send. He wasn’t supposed to see it. And he definitely wasn’t supposed to text back telling me to go on . . . Because after that, things escalate quickly.Cole is everything I’ve ever wanted. He’s sexy and protective. A devoted father to his little girl. A dedicated cop the whole town adores. The kind of guy you can trust to keep his hands to himself, even when you’re desperately hoping he won’t. I’m not the girl he thought he’d end up with, but after all this time, I might finally get the chance to say the words I’ve always dreamed of . . . make me yours.",
