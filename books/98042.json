  "description": "They were promised weight loss, the cure for Cancer, Parkinsonâ€™s Disease and infertility; they were promised hope. The side effects were anything but hopeful. Surrounded by the most obstinate of madness, Mara will use the strength within herself to free both she and Sebastian once and for all. As Sebastian slips further away from her, Mara will have to fight as she never has before--alone. The bonds of love and friendship will be stretched to their breaking point as the world around them spins out of control, and the dangers continue to mount. Can she carry them both through the obstacles ahead and find a way to heal Sebastian? Can she accomplish all of this in time? This final chapter of The Nevermore Trilogy will leave you breathless, sitting on the edge of your seat screaming out loud for love to overcome and the goodness of human nature to prevail.",
