  "title": "Against Forgetting: Twentieth-Century Poetry of Witness",
  "description": "This landmark anthology, the first of its kind, takes it impulse from the words of Bertolt Brecht: \"In these dark times, will there also be singing? / Yes, there will be singing. / About the dark times.\" Bearing witness to extremity―whether of war, torture, exile, or repression―the volume encompasses more than 140 poets from five continents, over the span of this century from the Armenian genocide to Tiananmen Square.",
