  "title": "The Alpha's Hunger",
  "description": "When she took a short rest on the floor of her cubicle while working late, the last thing Ashley Bell expected was to wake up with the company’s notoriously hard-assed owner and CEO, Ben Stone, standing over her. The offer of a ride home is a bigger surprise, but the biggest shock of all comes when Ben asks her to work for him as his personal assistant.  Despite some misgivings about his intentions, Ashley accepts the position, but she has barely started the job when a phone call turns her life on its head. Her twin sister has been kidnapped, and the price for her life is Ashley’s help in a secret plot to destroy Ben’s company. But she soon discovers that Ben has a far more terrifying secret of his own.  From the moment he first crossed paths with Ashley, the beautiful young human from marketing, Ben has been consumed by her. When her life is threatened by his enemies he casts aside caution and fights with the rage of a beast defending his mate. Not sure he can trust her, yet determined to protect her, Ben kidnaps Ashley, planning to keep her under his watch for as long as necessary.  Ashley is none too happy with the situation, but a hard bare-bottom spanking changes her attitude… and leaves her begging for more. Though Ben knows a human girl is no match for the fearsome lusts of an alpha wolf, she ignites in him a hunger he can barely contain. Can he resist the urge to mark her as his own and take her harder than she can imagine?  Publisher’s Note: The Alpha’s Hunger contains spankings, sexual scenes, anal play, and more. If such material offends you, please don’t buy this book.",
