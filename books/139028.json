  "description": "How about a Quickie? \"Although it’s a novella – a mere 107 (or so) pages – Legally Wed has the same wonderful blend of sweet and sassy, sexy and serious, that I’ve come to love and expect from all of NM Silber’s books.\" Cindy Meyer, The Book Enthusiast  Best Selling author, N.M. Silber, follows up her outrageously funny hit Romantic Comedy, Legal Briefs, with the story of how former childhood enemies finally enter wedded bliss.  Adam Roth and Lily Adler have survived nutty neighbors, cow pajamas, mobsters and \"the diaper incident.\" They have learned to live, love, and work together in harmony. Most of the time. Now, with the promise of marital bliss on the horizon, they will need to tackle even bigger challenges, like Lily's anxiety-fueled libido, Adam's increasing exhaustion, two Jewish mothers and an eccentric wedding planner named Mr. Jonathan. Will everyone make it to the wedding alive? Find out in Legally Wed.",
