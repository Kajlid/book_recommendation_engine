  "description": "Before the worst day of their lives, wild horses could not pull them together. Now, nothing can tear them apart...or so they thought. A chance meeting, a bad decision, a stormy night; and the fuse is lit to their most explosive 24 hours yet. When the dead roam the streets; when enemies prowl in the shadows, and when strangers are not all they seem, the only people Wren and Robyn can rely on are each other. They have fought through hell together, but now, for one of these sisters, today could be the end of everything.",
