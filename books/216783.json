  "description": "There is a greater threat than the virus.  Locked safely away in Shepherd’s nest, Claire is unaware of what stirs above ground. Her time is occupied fighting a war of another kind. Due to her mate’s relentless exploitation of their pair-bond, the nature of their link has grown consuming to the point that Claire has difficulty differentiating where her feelings begin and his end.  Under its influence, she’s forced to sense the man behind the monster. She can feel the truth of his terrible history. Claire can see the source of madness that drives Shepherd to do such terrible things: Svana.  His mate is desperate to open his eyes, but no matter Claire’s progress, Svana is not yet done with him.  Thólos is coming apart at the seams, and Shepherd’s men can do nothing to stop it. Real war is coming, and unless the Alpha tyrant is willing to pay the ultimate price, everything he has sacrificed will have been for nothing.  Reborn, the final installment in Addison Cain’s bestselling Alpha’s Claim trilogy, is a dark Omegaverse tale with explicit sexual themes and complete power exchange. This is not your typical romance with an HEA. If such material offends you, please do not purchase.",
