Pleasance Dunstan is used to silently bearing the cruelties put upon her by her thoughtless family. But nothing can prepare her for the greatest indignity of all: being sold into servitude to a man as wild as Tearlach O’Duine.

For though he is her captor, only Tearlach can show her how freeing true passion can be... and while her servitude to him will one day end, nothing can stop the binding of their hearts...",
