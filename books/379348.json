  "title": "The Sugarhouse",
  "description": "Set in Cooperstown, New York—home of James Fenimore Cooper and baseball’s Hall of Fame—THE SUGARHOUSE recalls a simpler time in America when friendships were unqualified, peccadilloes were overlooked, and tradition defined the cornerstone of society. Donald O’Donovan takes us on a charming and sentimental trip back to a world of homespun characters, fertile fishing ponds, innocent love, and, at the center of it all, the town’s much-loved house of ill repute, the Sugarhouse. Excerpts from four novels by Donald O’Donovan accompany THE SUGARHOUSE, including ORGASMO, NIGHT TRAIN, CONFESSIONS OF A BEDBUG HAULER and TARANTULA WOMAN.",
