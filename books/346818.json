  "description": "\"What I like most about the poems in John Vanek's first collection is his commitment to the poetics of clarity. Things are said straight in these poems, with careful attention to illuminating what the poet calls 'a shelter for my shifting life,' by which he means our lives as well.\" --Bruce Weigl.\"With humor, sympathy, and an eye for what makes us most human, John Vanek offers us a far-ranging view of life that feels hard-earned and complete.\" --Elton Glaser.",
