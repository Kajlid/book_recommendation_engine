The one guy she could always trust.Now she’s a marine biologist working toward her PhD in California, and he’s an underwear model in New York. Despite the distance and their wildly divergent career paths, they’ve managed to stay friends.Dylan’s only in town for a few days, crashing on Brooke’s couch and repaying the favor by acting as her date to a friend’s wedding.It was totally an accident she saw him naked.Pretty soon, the “just friends” thing goes out the window, and they find themselves giving friends with benefits a shot.It’s all going great… until it isn’t.Dylan’s got a ticket back to New York at the end of the week, and Brooke may have accidentally broken his heart. Can they navigate these uncharted relationship waters? Or has she wrecked her oldest friendship?",
