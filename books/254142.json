  "description": "Gerald Samper, an effete English snob, has his own private hilltop in Tuscany, where he whiles away his time working as a ghostwriter for celebrities and inventing wholly original culinary concoctions â€” including ice cream made with garlic and the bitter, herb-based liqueur of the book's title. Gerald's idyll is shattered by the arrival of Marta, on the run from a crime-riddled former soviet republic. A series of hilarious misunderstandings brings this odd couple into ever closer and more disastrous proximity.James Hamilton-Paterson's first novel, \"Gerontius,\" won the Whitbread Award. He is an acclaimed author of nonfiction books, including \"Seven-Tenths,\" \"Three Miles Down,\" and \"Playing with Water,\" He currently lives in Italy.",
