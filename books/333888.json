  "description": "When the ghost of your dead best friend shows up at your doorstep and tells you that he's taking you back to the 1980s to fix everything in your life that went wrong, you shut up and listen...then pack your bags and get on your way.Both light-hearted and heavy, this venture through time transports you to a small town in Kansas, in 1983, when Ash Earnhardt and Miles Goodwin jump back into their 17-year-old bodies to give adult perspective and grown-up insight to their wild and decadent, turned tragic, senior year of high school. The pair quickly realize that the game theyâ€™re playing is much more difficult than either of them anticipated as they struggle to heal old wounds, let go of regrets, and put everything behind them.Part Dickens, part Spicoli, part Fear and Loathing, Blast from the Past is an edgy, true-to-the-time, bittersweet tale of friendship that puts a unique spin on finding closure and letting go.",
