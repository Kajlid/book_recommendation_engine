  "title": "Touch Magic: Fantasy, Faerie & Folklore in the Literature of Childhood",
  "description": "Subtitled \"Fantasy, Faerie, and Folklore in the Literature of Childhood,\" this small book of essays was first my position papers for the EdD I never quite got. Originally published in hardcover by Philomel and then brought out a few years later in a trade paperback, this book of essays has become well identified with me. And the phrase, \"Touch magic, pass it on\" shows up in the oddest places. After five years out of print, the book in an expanded and revised edition has been reissued by the folklore publisher, August House. The new section is called \"Touchstones\" and has six new essays: \"Fabling to the Near Night,\" \"Killing the Other,\" \"Throwing Shadows,\" \"Literature As a Social Disease,\" the eponymous \"Touchstones,\" \"An Experiential Act,\" and an updated and revised Preface. - Jane Yolen",
