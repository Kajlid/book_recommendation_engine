  "description": "Tau Bada: The Quest of a Vulnerable Man is a true-action memoir (with more than 100 photographs) about new love, jungle confrontations, cross-cultural relationships, and, throughout, a personal journey to establish lasting values. It takes place in the moneyed Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe, along little-traveled Western roads on a motorcycle, and mostly on the other side of the world. The author and his wife set out to develop a sustainable livelihood for themselves and hundreds of coffee and chilies farmers in remote Papua New Guinea. Dangerous, laughable and profound experiences follow â€“ and revelations that connect us all.    John E. Quinlan founded Growth Strategies Global L.L.C. (GSG), headquartered in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, in 1986. As managing director, he has designed the firm to operate from a unique philosophy that balances his broad range of experiences in upper management with tested management consulting practices, underpinned by behavioral science knowledge.  Mr. Quinlan has provided integrated financial, operational and change management services to U.S. and international companies. He was a founding CEO of a publicly traded financial services company. The successes and failures he experienced during that period played a major role in creating the foundation and operating philosophy of GSG. He has been an advisor to for-profit, non-profit and municipal organizations and has extensive experience in executive coaching.  He holds a BA in Economics from Albion College in Michigan and a Master of Science in Organizational Development from the American University, Washington, D.C.",
