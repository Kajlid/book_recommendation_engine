  "description": "Alone in his isolated, windswept chapel on the edge of Dartmoor, his only companions moor men and poverty–stricken serfs, who could blame the young priest, Mark for seeking affection from Jane, the local miller’s daughter? But when Jane’s body is found brutally stabbed, Mark is the obvious suspect—and the discovery that Jane was pregnant seems to confirm his guilt. Called in to investigate, Sir Baldwin Furnshill and Simon Puttock soon begin to have their doubts. Could it not have been one of Jane’s many admirers who murdered her in a fit of jealousy? Or her father, the miller, who is acting in an increasingly disturbed manner? And what exactly is the local Baron trying to hide? In their search for the truth, Furnshill and Puttock unwittingly place themselves and their families in the greatest danger they have ever faced.",
