  "description": "Somewhere amidst the buried ruins of an ancient alien civilization lies the answer to one of the greatest mysteries in our galaxy. But researching the desolate planet brings about more questions than could ever answer. And those questions need answered soon if Landon is to find out who just declared war on the people of Earth. Landon is the sole operator of the Tachyon Relay – an outpost that serves as an interchange point for wormhole transit throughout the galaxy. When some mysterious ships start attacking Earth’s outposts, Landon is forced to watch helplessly as the wormholes begin to collapse, severing the links to these colonized systems. When Landon’s post is ultimately attacked, his only mode of escape is to slip aboard a vessel heading toward an abandoned system. Much to his surprise, the system had not been abandoned at all and was now home to a settlement that had been excavating alien ruins for the past decade. The ancient civilization, he quickly learns, may somehow be closely related to the unidentified ships that have declared war on Earth. He may have to risk more than just his own life in order to get the answers he needs and put an end to the war.
