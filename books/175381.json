  "title": "Point of View",
  "description": "Point of View is a collection historical and contemporary fiction short stories with conspiracy theory twists and a little parody thrown in for good measure. Who is the “real” D. B. Cooper? You'll be intrigued by the identity of his parents. Learn the undisclosed reason for the Titanic’s loss. Can FBI Agent Susan Kane save the world from a repeat terrorist attack? How are Imelda Marcos, shoes and a shortage of chocolate responsible for the end of the world? You’ve read the “relationship theories” between Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy. This short story explores the “relationship” between John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald. Excerpts of P. J. LaRue's other books are included as a bonus.**************************************************************5 Star Review of Point of View by Chris Fischer of Reader's Favorite: \"One of the things I’ve always appreciated about short stories is that it’s all right to read one or two of them, then put the book aside for days, weeks, even months, and pick up right where you left off, with a completely new adventure waiting. But I couldn’t do this with Point of View. The stories were so great, so engaging, that I read them through from start to finish, all in one sitting. I almost wish I had restrained myself a bit, because I’d love to have more from P.J. LaRue to read. Several of the shorts in her book are intros to longer works, and definitely worth checking out. But I certainly will keep my eye out for more short stories from this talented author, and hope she’s hard at work at another collection as we speak!\"",
