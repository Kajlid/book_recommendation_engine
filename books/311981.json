  "description": "\"Pithy, funny, exasperated, and informed…You cannot read a more important hundred pages than Stop Saving the Planet!\" —Richard White, author of The Republic for Which It StandsWe’ve been \"saving the planet\" for decades!…And environmental crises just get worse. All this hybrid driving and LEED building and carbon trading seems to accomplish little to nothing—and low-income communities continue to suffer the worst consequences.Why aren’t we cleaning up the toxic messes and rolling back climate change? And why do so many Americans hate environmentalists?Jenny Price says Enough already! with this short, fun, fierce manifesto for an environmentalism that is hugely more effective, a whole lot fairer, and infinitely less righteous. She challenges you, corporate sustainability officers, and the EPA to think and act completely anew—and to start right now—to ensure a truly habitable future.",
