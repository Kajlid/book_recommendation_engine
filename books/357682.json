  "description": "Valerie Grace isn't quite sure how she went from heavenly angel to plunging into the killer whale tank at Niagara Falls' MarineLand, but that's what's happened. All she knows is that earth can be a tough place for a fallen angel, what with all the demon Tempters lurking around every corner, anxious to recruit her to the \"other team\" - the evil team. All she can do is keep an eye out for the elusive Key to Heaven, try to help people, and hope that somebody up there notices what an angel she is, even if she's not literally one anymore. And try to avoid that really cute tempter, the one with the pale gray eyes and hypnotic smile, the one that makes her forget her own name and the fact that she's supposed to be a good girl.",
