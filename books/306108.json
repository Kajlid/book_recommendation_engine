  "description": "When Dillon Jackson was called upon by the British army in 1940, national service and fighting for your country wasn't something you could ever escape by law. Yes, Dillon signed up and did become a soldier. Yes, Dillon then went AWOL and returned to his parents house in London to hide away. What Private Dillon Jackson didn't bank on though, was how a single kiss from a young woman called Muriel one day, would encourage a different kind of bomb to drop into his life. An adult comedy, where love in war time London was already hard enough, yet almost impossible for a young man just trying to stay out of trouble and not shoot anyone.",
