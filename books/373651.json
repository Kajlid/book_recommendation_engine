  "description": "There’s a killer in the museum. With a faulty memory and no alibi, Web just hopes he’s not the murderer.Daniel Weber (Web, to his friends) was on the fast track to success when his life was derailed by memory loss. A year ago, he was a grad student with a bright future. Now he’s the night watchman at a failing museum on the brink of shutting down.Good thing he hasn’t lost his sense of humor.In a last-ditch effort to stay open, the museum hires an expert taxidermist from Iowa to clean up their collection. What they get instead is his son, Jesse Ray Jones. Young. Sharp. And way too normal to be into something as weird as taxidermy.Jesse looks like a skatepunk and talks like a science major, which pushes Web’s every last hot-button. It’s lust at first sight…but hooking up proves difficult when a museum supervisor is found bludgeoned to death in the petroglyph alcove.Web relies on his trusty pocket notebook to remind him of things he can’t afford to forget. But for the time of the murder, it offers up nothing to exonerate his new love interest…or, for that matter, him.",
