  "description": "Secrets lurk in the shadows of a kingdom where the queen has never shown her face. Raiona once had a democracy, but after an uprising forced the president out of power, a monarchy was formed. The kingdom is home to legends and corruption, and 17-year-old Mavis Caverly finds herself in the midst of a conspiracy. An odd purple question mark tattooed on her wrist has served as proof that she is different. She has spent her whole life looking for answers about the origin and meaning of the mark, and when a mysterious stranger arrives in her city, the truth seems to be on the horizon. Mavis embarks on a journey across the kingdom uncovering the dark history of Raiona, and the crimes that the unseen Queen has committed. Along the way she realizes just how different she is, how important she truly is to the future of her kingdom, and that the Queen will do whatever it takes to find her.",
