Teaming up with local detective, DCI Brad Madison, Juliet strives to find out why she has been targeted and how it’s connected to the accident that killed her brother, nineteen years ago.Can Juliet use her knowledge of the human psyche to get inside the mind of the killer, before another body is found under a bridge?
