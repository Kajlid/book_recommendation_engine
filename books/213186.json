  "description": "SHE TRIED TO BE A LADY When her Montana cousin wrote that his three grown sons could use a lady's influence, headstrong Genevieve Heller left Boston on the next train. Pretending to be a prim and proper Massachusetts miss, the strawberry-blond beauty set out to tame the unruly westerners... especially the infuriating Sterling, who managed to fill her head with very unladylike notions! His broad shoulders made her dream of tender embraces; his strong hands made her yearn for intimate caresses; and the knowing look in his turquoise gaze made her want to slap the arrogance right off his handsome face! BUT HE WAS NO GENTLEMANSterling knew there was more to their unwanted houseguest than simpering smiles and mindless chatter. No woman with hair that glorious color could be as meek as Miss Genevieve Heller wanted to seem. He meant to uncover the real Genny... right down to that luscious, creamy skin. His kisses would fill her with sweet fire, his touch would sear her with passion's heat. And he'd melt her eastern heart with his wild Montana Magic",
