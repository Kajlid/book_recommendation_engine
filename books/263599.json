  "title": "Her Widow",
  "description": "Her Widow is the true story of a year in the author’s life, following the death of her wife, told through letters written by the author to her deceased wife. The letters reveal Alden’s greatest challenge in life, living joyfully without the “love of her life.” Accompanying the letters are black and white photographic prints of Catherine Hopkins’s work, showing why Catherine was considered by many to be a master in photography as well as in graphic design. Both talents appear on book jackets across the genres. What appears rarely in memoirs about a death in the family is on every page of Alden’s memoir, which offers intimate detail of the inner life of a relationship and the process of dying. Told simply and lyrically, the hard truths are expressed with an honesty that is hopeful. Her Widow comforts and inspires as well as teaches.",
