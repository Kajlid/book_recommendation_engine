  "description": "\"KNOCK AND IT WILL BE OPENED FOR YOU.\" --MATTHEW 7:7The Bible has the answers to life's most important questions. But for many teens, and even many adults, God's message can be lost in the Bible's often confusing terminology, dry language, or lengthy history lessons. Who begat who-and why should I care? The Bible: Enter Here opens the door to God's Word by breathing new life into key Bible stories, retelling them in a fresh, fun, and relatable way. You'll discover that the Bible is packed with drama, suspense, and even humor. You'll see that the Bible's main characters were real people, with the same flaws, fears, and dreams you have. And most important, you'll learn how Jesus' teachings are vital to your life today.Here are a few of the characters you'll meet:- JACOB: The guy who wrestled God-and got a nation named after him- PHARAOH: Ten plagues, and still didn't learn his lesson- DELILAH: Irresistible ... and dangerous- SHADRACH, MESHACH, and ABEDNEGO: The ultimate trial by fire- VIRGIN MARY: On parenting the Son of God- PETER: His agony and triumph, in his own wordsLearn how one man's life, death, and resurrection changed the world forever, and what that could mean for you-if you're ready to knock on the door and enter.",
