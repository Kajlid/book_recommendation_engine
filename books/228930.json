  "description": "They’re the most unlikely duo you could imagine. After all, what could a fiercely independent Fae possibly want with a stubborn dragon shifter who seems to think he needs to protect her?  Okay, sure, Darius is spine-tingling sexy with a wicked sense of humor, not to mention that cocky smirk on those deliciously perfect lips that can’t seem to stop smiling at her…   But Kaye isn’t that kind of girl.  She is a powerful fairy, and the last thing she wants is to be burdened by this mysterious shifter, even if he does insist that her life is in danger.   Who does he think he’s dealing with?  Kaye doesn’t need protection from anything, and even if she did; she can certainly handle herself. Or, so she thinks.  But when the dark shadows nip at her heels, and evil curls its inky fingers around her world, threatening to destroy everything she loves, she might just change her mind. That is, if it’s not too late.  Her only hope of survival may lie with the one man she doesn’t want, but can’t seem to forget. Her dragon.  Readers: This is the first novel in my brand new series, Shifting Magic - a world where shifters and supernaturals co-exist. My hero, Darius, is a dragon shifter intent on protecting the beautiful fairy Kaye, from the evil that threatens to invade her world. This is an adventure story with magic, lots of shifting and plenty of romance. I hope you enjoy this story as much as I did bringing these wonderful characters to life.",
