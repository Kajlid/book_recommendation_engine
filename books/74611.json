  "description": "Morphoses is a novel of transitions. It starts where Club Dishabille left off and it includes two of the more minor characters from that novel. The title itself gives the reader a hint into Miranda's kink. While a good bit of the story revolves around Miranda indulging this, there's another transformation that is taking Nicholas kicking and screaming into a normal functioning sexual relationship. By the end you will love Miranda and Nick as much as Dahlia and Alex.Morphoses is a love story for those whoare ready for a bit more than just a spanking.",
