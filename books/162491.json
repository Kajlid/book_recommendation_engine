  "description": "Furry-style fox hunts, breaking into waterparks, and masturbating in trees. It’s all just part of the queer life of author Allison Moon. This collection of 18 sexy, touching memoirs celebrates the humor and tenderness of falling in and out of love and in and out of bed.\"Allison Moon is a queer woman with a bisexual boyfriend or a 'bad dyke'--an identity she’s settled on after stints as a 'greedy bisexual' and a garden-variety lesbian. She chronicles and analyzes this journey in an essay collection that’s heartfelt, thought-provoking, and good, not so clean fun. - Lambda Literary",
