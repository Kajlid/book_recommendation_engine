His mother has been driven insane by the spirit of the earth she has served for decades. And he can’t contact his brother Ben, who has been helping him control the dark magic of the family curse he’s inherited. With his every step dogged by warlocks from the shadowy “Agency” intent on taking his power, Will doesn’t know where to turn.Luckily, he still has his loyal friend Harley Briar on his side. With Harley’s help, Will is reunited with an even more powerful ally: his father, who renounced his magic and his name over thirty years ago. Unravelling the magical conspiracies that have entangled his family will take all Will’s smarts and savvy—but will he be up to the challenge of reconciling with the father who failed to protect him from the evil of Aebedel Cowdray?",
