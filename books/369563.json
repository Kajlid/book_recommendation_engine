The subject of his first foray into nudes is a vision, Ryan Morgan. With each sitting, Harley finds it harder to ignore the fact he’s falling head over heels for the straight-arrow model.Their first kiss confirms that Ryan feels the heat, too—for about five seconds. Then he pushes Harley away and bolts.Ryan is less than proud of some of the things he’s done to survive his hand-to-mouth existence. Including model for a gay magazine—and accept money from his female clients in exchange for “extra favors”. The memory of Harley’s kiss still rattles the foundation of his sexuality even now, six months later.When they run into each other at a gallery opening, nothing has changed. The sparks flare brighter than ever, driving Harley to make an offer he desperately hopes Ryan won’t refuse. And Ryan is just desperate enough to say yes… Contains scenes of m/m intimacy; hot sex on a kitchen table and a man with a body to die for.",
