  "title": "Northern Heat: Best Canadian Erotic Romance Stories",
  "description": "In Northern Heat, Canadian authors put a pen to the erotic romance genre and show that Canadians are, contrary to popular belief, incredibly sexy. Long before the success of Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James, women were writing erotic romance stories that are brazen, seductive, and sexually liberating. Among these women is a group of prize-winning Canadian authors, including Kayla Perrin and Sharon Page, whose novels have reached the USA Today Bestseller List and the pages of Publishers Weekly. These stories will leave you yearning for more . . . and more . . . and dispel once and for all the myth that Canadians are as frigid as the northern climate. Contributors include Anara Bella, Leah Braemel, Opal Carew, Christine D'Abo, Bonnie Edwards, Cathryn Fox, Savanna Fox, Sharon Page, Kayla Perrin, Jan Springer, Kate St. James, and Sasha White.",
