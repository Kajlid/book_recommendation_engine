  "description": "After joining the Free Spirit Connection, Amalia Echevarria quickly rose to become a leader in her Local Gathering, and now would be a delegate at the Triennial Assembly. There she learns the intricacies of the Connection’s internal politics, as well as enjoying erotic interludes with submissive Darla and others. While at first her eloquence and passion garners allies, a spurious accusation threatens to undermine her credibility – and perhaps even the causes that she supports. Still, the Free Spirits are dedicated to the truth, and their leaders promise to find out who’s behind these rumors. But will it be enough to repair the damage done?",
