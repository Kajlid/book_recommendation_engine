  "description": "We all die –it’s inevitable. But what if you were offered the chance to come back? Change your ways, live life to the full, do all the things you wanted to do? Alma is gifted that chance, and she takes it without question. Barely in her teens, her life cruelly cut short in a world even more cruel. She seizes that opportunity with both hands, jumps in with reckless youthful abandon, waves away the small print. Thank you very much. Now, trapped between the world of the dead and the living she races against the clock, stalked by supernatural forces and even the enemies responsible for her demise –to fulfil her contract before it’s too late and is dragged kicking and screaming to the place with no way out, for the rest of time.",
