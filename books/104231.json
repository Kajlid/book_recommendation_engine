  "description": "Make an impact with your research data! Focusing on the guiding principles of presenting data in evidence-based ways so that audiences are effectively engaged and researchers are better understood, Presenting Data Effectively offers the best communication strategies available to those working with data. With this accessible step-by-step guide, anyone―from students developing a research poster for a school project to faculty and researchers presenting data at a conference―can learn how to present and communicate their research findings in more interesting and effective ways. Author Stephanie Evergreen draws on her extensive experience in the study of research reporting, interdisciplinary evaluation, and data visualization, as well as from diverse interdisciplinary fields, including cognitive psychology, communications, and graphic design, to extract tangible and practical data-reporting communication lessons and insights. She then demonstrates how to apply those principles to the design of data presentations to make it easier for the audience to understand, remember, and use the data.",
