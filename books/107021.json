Rhys thinks Silas is full of it, until he discovers vampires are real, and he's part of their main course.Silas Quint can't be distracted by a human lover, even one as lovely as Rhys. Stuck in the middle of the ocean, he has barely enough energy to hunt the vampires he's been sent to destroy. Rhys is full of the one thing Silas needs most--the element of living plants. Only sucking energy from Rhys would make Silas as soulless as the creatures he hunts. How can he keep Rhys safe, without becoming like the very monsters he hunts?",
