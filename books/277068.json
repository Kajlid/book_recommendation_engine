But once touched by magic and blessed--or cursed--with the love of an elfin lord, one cannot so easily escape the spell of Elphame. And, discovering a Wild Gate to Elphame in the library's basement, Ruth is certain this is her one and only chance to be reunited with her lost love, Rohannan Melior, High Lord of the House of the Silver Silences.Once through the Gate, however, Ruth realizes she's been followed by the library director, Nic Brightlaw.

And then Ruth learns just who is behind the turmoil in Elphame, and she knows that, for her, there is no turning back--for in a land betrayed by humans, only another human has any hope of restoring the rightful balance of the kingdom...",
