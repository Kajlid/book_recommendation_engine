  "description": "February 13, 1692. Thirty-eight members of the MacDonald clan are killed by soldiers who had previously enjoyed the clan's hospitality. Many more die from exposure. Forty miles south, the captivating Corrag is imprisoned for her involvement in the massacre. Accused of witchcraft and murder, she awaits her death. Lonesome, she tells her story to Charles Leslie, an Irish propagandist who seeks information to condemn the Protestant King William, rumored to be involved in the massacre. Hers is a story of passion, courage, love, and the magic of the natural world. By telling it, she transforms both their lives.As in her award-winning debut novel, Eve Green, Susan Fletcher shows that she is \"a novelist with the soul of a poet\" (Booklist). This deeply philosophical and dramatic book is about an epic historic event and the difference a single heart can makeâ€”how deep and lasting relationships can come from the most unlikely places.",
