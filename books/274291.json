  "description": "The worst day of my life happened when my boyfriend died.  As I grieve my loss, I learn that I’m carrying his baby. If my world wasn’t already crashing down, now it’s burning up in flames. My religious parents will never accept a pregnancy out of wedlock, and telling them means I risk losing them completely. To avoid disappointing my family, Hunter offers to be my fake husband. The lines become so blurred that neither of us want to admit we’re no longer pretending. The guilt of what we’re doing eats at me as I struggle to deal with my emotions. Just as I come to terms with our new situation, I learn Hunter’s been keeping secrets. And I’m left to make the hardest decision of my life—follow my heart or walk away from him.BABY YOURS is book 2 in the Hunter & Lennon duet and must be read in order.",
