  "description": "The Confederacy's grand scheme seemed to be working. They had substituted the mind of their best operator for the minds of four criminals - every one a top assassin - and sent one to each of the four Warden worlds to eliminate the resident Lord there. The agents on Lilith, Cerberus, and Charon had already reported in - success! Now only Taran Bul's mission on Medusa remained.On this frozen ice world, Bul quickly joined an on-going conspiracy determined to overthrow the hated dictator Lord Talant Ypsir - the rebel's mission suited his perfectly. But a combination of alien menace and Ypsir's secret power proved too much for Bul. At last, the operator over all - the Agent With No Name - had to prove his ability...with everything stacked against him!In this volume of his most gripping series, Jack Chalker brings to a grand conclusion the epic confrontation between the mighty confederacy and the small but powerful worlds of the Warden Diamond.",
