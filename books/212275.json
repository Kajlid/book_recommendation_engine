  "description": "No longer available. Updated edition re-titled More Than Distance. How could we ever make a relationship work while living nine hours away from each other?   Geir’s moved off to Oslo with his dad, something he’s not happy about. At the same time, it’s nice to have a proper family around him again. Thanks to Jørgen, he even makes a new friend in brash, flamboyant, out-there-and-proud-of-it Nikolai. Nothing makes him forget Jørgen, though—and he doesn’t want to.  Jørgen’s a broken man, but now, thanks to Geir’s psychiatrist uncle, he might get some professional help to come to term with his past and post-traumatic stress disorder. But he feels hollow and empty without Geir—because Geir was the one who made life worth living.  They might as well live worlds apart. Geir can only visit during school holidays, and Jørgen can’t face going to a big city at all. A year’s a long time; can a tentative relationship such as theirs survive so long apart?  Anything For Him is a gay romance novel of 57,000 words. It ends happily with no cliffhangers. It is part of a series and should not be read as a stand-alone.",
