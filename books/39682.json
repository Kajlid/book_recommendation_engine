  "description": "The day Madison Stevenson left her sniffling mother, Lois Stevenson, standing at Hobby Airport and boarded her Southwest flight into Seattle, she had no clue as to just how drastically her life was about to change. She thought she was getting away from her controlling and nagging mother and would be spending her days painting and enjoying the beautiful scenery the Pacific Northwest had to offer. There was no way she could have known that her two nearest neighbors would soon be rivals for her affections. There was also no way she could have known that one happened to be a werewolf, and the other man, the one her Aunt Mattie had loved for years - a man Madison had adored as a child - was not only still around, but just as young looking and handsome as ever and happened to be a vampire.",
