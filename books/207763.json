  "title": "Beasts of Prey: The Hard Truth about Men",
  "description": "\"Beasts of Prey\" asserts that men cannot be bound in lengthy relationships for good without crossing the line from time to time. The writer refers to well established theories, social, and biological research on men's hormonal and psychological structures to show how men's inclination to have sex with multiple women outside their bonds is at the heart of the matter. \"Beasts of Prey\" delves into the basics of males' cheating habits, tactics and schemes, and their sexual, social and cultural monopoly in the world. Following history of relationships from ancient times to the Internet revolution of our postmodern generation, \"Beasts of Prey\" exposes the stereotypes that lurk beneath the surface of male manipulated societies and their cultural taboos.",
