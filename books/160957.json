  "description": "...Written in Darkness, represents the quintessential statement of Samuelism. “I believe that mental isolation is the essence of weird fiction” he wrote in The White Hands and the isolation of the individual in society is still a major preoccupation, coupled with a singularly vivid understand-ing of the elusiveness of human identity. This last notion is at the roots of some of the greatest “horror” fiction of the past [....] but it is being tackled today, not least by Mark Samuels, with equal if not greater imaginative insight. - Reggie Oliver; from his introductionThe book contains nine uncollected stories, five of which are previously unpublished, along with an introduction by Reggie Oliver and calligraphy by Geoff Cox.The full table of contents is as follows:Introduction by Reggie OliverA Call to GreatnessThe Other TenantAn Hourglass of the SoulThe Ruins of RealityAlistairMy World Has No MemoriesOutside InterferenceMy Heretical ExistenceIn Eternity Two Lines IntersectThe book is a lithographically printed, 128 page sewn hardback with colour endpapers.
