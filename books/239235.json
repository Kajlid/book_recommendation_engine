  "description": "As the Conference of the Realms convenes in London, Jinx and the gang settle into adjoining rooms at Claridge’s determined to find a way to end The Agreement segregating the In Between.  In the three days before the opening ceremony, Lucas assumes the role of tour guide, taking Jinx to Hampton Court and the British Museum. But it’s the sites he doesn’t show her that prove to be the most critical after an assassination attempt puts Barnaby’s life in danger and leaves Jinx in charge of the Shevington delegation.  From encountering the ghosts of Henry VIII’s wives to meeting a troop of gargoyle guards in the Fae Houses of Parliament, Jinx and her friends take London by storm in the ninth book of this ongoing urban fantasy series.  Listen to what readers have to say about Jinx and her world:  “Absolutely terrific! The characters are great, the story is griping and you never want to end.”  “The Jinx Hamilton Mysteries, are full of surprise, fantasy, and feeling.”  “From the first book, right on through, you feel like you can become friends with each character.”  “Plot twists and new characters keep her work fresh and exciting. Lots of humor and romance. Love the series. Want MORE!!!!”  “The story has progressed -- we have a full bodied urban fantasy with a well thought out world, well developed characters of all descriptions, and a great and complex story line.”  “Great storyline and dialogue, lots of action and drama. The author has great imagination and insight into human behavior.”",
