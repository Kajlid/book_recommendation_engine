His immortality was bestowed upon him to teach him a lesson, and instead of remaining youthful, the curse turned him into the image of an old man. He’s waited for the day he could return to a mortal man, but when that day arrives and he must leave his beloved Druid’s Glen, he suddenly finds he might not want to be mortal after all.A secret kept...Kenna holds a great secret, one that if discovered could have her burned at the stake. She’s not just a healer, she’s a Druid. ‘Tis a secret she has buried deep inside her. Until Frang. He offers freedom in the Druids, a promise too heady to ignore.",
