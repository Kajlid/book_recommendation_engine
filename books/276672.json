  "description": "Whatever you do, don’t fall in loveWhen Whitley winds up on the top of a pirate hit-list, she finds an unlikely savior. Bluff, a pirate who can transform his appearance to mimic anyone, sweeps her away and sneaks her onto his ship to avoid capture. But Bluff has his own reasons to ensure her safety and he has no intention of letting Whitley in on his secrets. Pirates and sirens alike are after the subject of the prophecy, and it’s only a matter of time until Whitley learns just how powerful she is. And just how much control she has over Bluff. Resisting fate is never easy. Resisting Whitley will be near-impossible. But if he fails, it could mean enslavement by sirens, or worse—by the girl he loves.",
