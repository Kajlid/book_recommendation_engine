  "description": "You know that saying about how sometimes you're the windshield and sometimes you're the bug; Cassie Madison had shaken the Georgia dust from her feet fifteen years ago, vowing never to leave Manhattan. She had traded sweet tea for Chardonnay, fried chicken for nouvelle cuisine, lazy days on her aunt's front porch for ad campaigns and board meetings -- and the guy who broke her heart for her handsome boss, soon to be fiance. Then Cassie's sister called. They hadn't spoken for fifteen years, since she'd married the guy who broke Cassie's heart. She's called to tell Cassie that their father is dying and desperately needs to see her. Soon Cassie is back in small-town Georgia and face-to-face with her sister, her old boyfriend, and their children. Cassie feels like she's falling apart. And yet, the longer she stays in Walton, the more she begins to feel like she's falling home . . .",
