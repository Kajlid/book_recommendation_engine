  "description": "Could the writings of the ancient Hebrew prophets be relevant to events taking place in the world today?Did the Hebrew prophets foretell the events of 9/11? Are they relevant to our world today? 'Mega-Babylon' - where is it?The Hebrew prophets – from Isaiah and Jeremiah, to the apostle John, spoke of a city and nation they referred to by the codename, 'Mega-Babylon'. Have these prophecies been fulfilled already? What about Daniel's 'writing on the wall'? Is Mega-Babylon the Roman Catholic Church? A world super-church? Rebuilt ancient Babylon? Brussels, Jerusalem, or somewhere entirely different? Should this city/nation have a large Jewish population? Why all the talk about merchants, cargoes, commodities, trade?Can we rely on the words of these ancient prophets? If so, what else did they foretell that is still to be fulfilled? Do they refer to other major nations – USA, Russia, China, Europe? What about militant Islam?My background is in lecturing, publishing and radio/TV – but previously I ran a construction business. I still love to know how things are put together - buildings, origins of words, phrases – so I have used a similar approach in exploring, what I believe to be, an extremely important and relevant topic.",
