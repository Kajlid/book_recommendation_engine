Can the peace between the unitruvials and binurals be preserved? What will the magnificent Ephemerine Tree look like and what changes will it initiate on planet Artea?A fun-filled but thoughtful fantasy book, incorporating New-Age, Law of One, Positive Thinking, Law of Attraction, Environmentalist, Hidden History and Quantum Physics ideas.",
