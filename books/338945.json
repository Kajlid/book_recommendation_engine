  "title": "Why We Love the Church: In Praise of Institutions and Organized Religion",
  "description": "This book presents the case for loving the local church. It paints a picture of the local church in all its biblical and real life guts, gaffes, and glory in an effort to edify local congregations and entice the disaffected back to the fold. It also provides a solid biblical mandate to love and be part of the body of Christ and counteract the \"leave church\" books that trumpet rebellion and individual felt needs.Why We Love the Church is written for four kinds of people—the Committed, the Disgruntled, the Waffling, and the Disconnected.",
