But as I take in his chiseled jaw and sexy smirk, I remember why I agreed to this sham of a marriage.It's because I'm a glutton for punishment and love a good underdog story, and the more I get to know Liam, the more I can see that he's exactly that.The underdog.I just hope I'm not wrong about him.LiamMarriage is a load of crap and my dad knows it, which is why he insisted I find a wife if I ever wanted to touch my inheritance.Little does he know, I don't have a problem getting my hands dirty in order to get what I want. And if I have to use my little brother's nanny to prove it, I will.Besides, the girl drives me insane. It's not like we have anything in common other than our mutual disdain for each other.This'll be a walk in the park.I hope.",
