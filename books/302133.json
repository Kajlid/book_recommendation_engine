With the help of my girls, Guinevere and December, I'm happy, I'm thriving but there's one little problem. Okay more of a big problem. Thoren Black, aka Thor. Yes, he's blonde haired, blue eyed gorgeousness. Yes, he has muscles so big they can crack a walnut and yes his...ego matches.My problem? That lazy High School sweetheart won't sign our divorce papers so the new thor-n in my side thinks he can solve it. He puts a big ring on my finger, claiming me for the whole town and forcing my ex’s hand. Does he stop at that? No. He moves into my house, takes over my kitchen and demands a space in my bed, and I let him because that was the agreement. He's pushing all my buttons, breaking past all my excuses of why this would never be able to work out for real. I never experienced this...happiness, not Until Thor…. Feisty. Blonde. Sexy.I knew the second she threw an eight ball at my head I was going to have her. Husband, shmusband. I don't think with my head when I suggest the fake fiance act, at least not that head, but Jolie Palmer has got me all tangled up and I'd be a liar if I said I didn't like it. Now to convince her that ring on her finger should stay.Until Thor is part of Aurora Rose Reynolds's Happily Ever Alpha World. If you loved Until December, then you will want to read Until Thor.",
