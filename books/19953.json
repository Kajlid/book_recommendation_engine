  "description": "IT TAKES A VERY SPECIAL MAN TO WIN THAT SPECIAL WOMAN...Use-em-and-lose-em bounty hunter Flynn quickly sized up handy bystander Sara Marie McAllister: a sweet, shy, small-town woman who buried her bountiful curves and slumbering sexuality beneath baggy sweats and a passion for the piano. In short, the spinet-playing spinster was an easy mark for Flynn's impressive repertoire of five-finger exercises...So how did 'that nice McAllister girl' so thoroughly sabotage his cynical serenade? Butting into an ambush, she ended up in his arms. Whoa! Was Sara some she-devil in sheep's clothing...out to outfox the feral Flynn?THAT SPECIAL WOMAN! She's friend, wife, mother -- she's you! And beside each Special Woman stands a wonderfully special man.",
