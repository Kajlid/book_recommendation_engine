  "description": "After a night spent with two vampires – a night that left him sore from a spanking… and more – Tyler tries to sneak out without disturbing them. Doing so, he earns himself another punishment from Master vampire Alan. Only after a new spanking does he have permission to leave, as well as permission to return later in the day.Before dealing with Tyler, Alan ordered his Childe Jeremy not to intervene. Jeremy, however, can’t stand being left out and breaks his Sire’s orders. His punishment, although entirely different from Tyler’s, turns out to be just as agonizing, especially when Alan draws a painful confession from him.It all started as one night, but all three men were quick to decide they wanted more. For that, they’ll have to be honest with each other and themselves and together figure out the rules of this new game…",
