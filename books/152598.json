  "description": "WINNER OF 2 EISNER AWARDS. Winsor McCay was perhaps the greatest cartoonist of all time, and the Sunday newspaper strip Little Nemo in Slumberland was his greatest creation. Now, a century later, over 100 of the world's finest cartoonists and illustrators have paid tribute to the master and his masterpiece by creating new Little Nemo strips at their original broadsheet newspaper size (16\" x 21\"), following their own voices down paths lit by McCay. Contributors include Paul Pope, Bill Sienkiewicz, Peter Bagge, Farel Dalrymple, Nate Powell, David Mack, Jeremy Bastian, John Cassaday, Jim Rugg, Michael Allred, Scott Morse, Yuko Shimizu, David Petersen, J.G. Jones, Denis Kitchen, Stephen Bissette, Ronald Wimberly, P. Craig Russell, Gabriel Bá and Fábio Moon, among many others.",
