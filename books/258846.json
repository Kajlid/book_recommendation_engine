  "description": "What happens when the boy you've wanted your whole life finally wants you back?  I'm used to taking what I want, being the best at what I do. During the day, I make big bucks as New York's premiere consultant. At night, I can get any girl I lay my eyes on. I thought this life was what I wanted: working hard and playing harder--with penthouse apartments, luxury cars and bottle service every weekend. After six years in the city, I know I've been living like a monster for too long. I need to get my act together. I need to find something real. I need to come home. LA means family and a fresh start. My parents and my friends who are close enough to be siblings.  And Melina. Melina is nerdy smart, with a challenging sense of humor and legs for miles. It's so hard to describe her...enigmatically beautiful. I’m sure there’s a word for it in French. But I know there's a naughty girl hiding behind that shy smile that I'm dying to drag out. There was always something between us. I never forgot her laugh, never could get her off my mind. Nobody ever seemed to notice how my body would react when I was near Melina, how much more focused I became—maybe not even Melina herself. But this time it’s different.  The more time we spend together, the more I wonder if there was something there all along. After so long in the fast lane, I don't know if I can handle settling down. But seeing Melina's passion, I'm tempted beyond belief.  I have to admit it: temptation is hard to resist.",
