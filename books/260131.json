  "title": "The Dharma Bums",
  "description": "Two ebullient young men search for Truth the Zen way: from marathon wine-drinking bouts, poetry jam sessions, and \"yabyum\" in San Francisco's Bohemia, to solitude in the high Sierras and a vigil atop Desolation Peak in Washington State. Published just a year after On the Road put the Beat Generation on the map, The Dharma Bums is sparked by Kerouac's expansiveness, humor, and a contagious zest for life.",
