  "title": "Tapping Doesn't Work for Me.: What To Do When EFT Stops Working.",
  "description": "Millions of people around the world have used EFT tapping, many with remarkable results, so when it doesn’t work, why not? The catchall phrase is ‘resistance’ but it’s been my experience that this isn’t always true.“Tapping doesn’t work for me.” “EFT stopped working.” “I tried tapping and it doesn’t work.” “I used to tap but then I stopped. I don’t really know why.”“I can’t remember what words to say.” “It just made me feel bad all the time.” “EFT made me feel like a failure.”If you’ve found yourself saying or thinking any one of these, this book was written for you.It is for those people who are familiar with EFT, who’ve used it and have hit a hurdle with tapping but are willing to back up a little, perhaps learn something new or think about an issue in a different way, and set yourself free.It’s not that you’re an EFT failure. It’s not that EFT doesn’t work. It’s not that EFT stops working. You may have picked up some unhelpful habits when you learned EFT, and they are what this book seeks to address.“The purest purpose of tapping is victory over the struggles of those experiences and beliefs that make us feel less than we believe we really are and can be. That’s where the work begins, and that’s the purpose of doing it.”If any of these statements ring a bell with you and you'd like to set yourself free of them, please scroll to the top of the page and select the BUY button.",
