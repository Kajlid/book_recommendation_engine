  "title": "Black Magic Outlaw: Books 1-3",
  "description": "The first three books of the standout Black Magic Outlaw series featuring Cisco a necromancer, a shadow charmer, and a perpetual underdog who always punches up. Jack Reacher and Jason Bourne, meet Urban Fantasy. My name is Cisco Suarez, but I've been called a lot of things. Wizard, hit man, black magic outlaw. I guess one day I finally went too far because someone left me for dead in a dumpster. That should've been it for me. End of story. But I'm not like most people. Compelled by equal doses of voodoo and sheer grit, I came back... and I want answers. Which might explain the zombie pit bull sniffing after me. And the automatic weapons. But I'm too stubbon to back down. I'll go through a voodoo gang, a shape-shifting trickster, and a bloodthirsty vampire if it gets me out of this. And maybe I'll get a little more than that too. My old life back. A cleared name. A city to protect from the kinds of monsters who did this to me. Not too shabby for a dead man. This box set contains the introductory Dead Man, Shadow Play, and Heart Strings.",
