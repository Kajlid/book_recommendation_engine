  "description": "July 1942, Anne Frank and her family and friends go into hiding in a secret annexe. But what about those still living in Amsterdam beside the annexe; the pastor who was losing his faith, the café owner with no customers, the doctor who couldn’t treat his patients? Living and working alongside that annexe; how would they survive? While German soldiers stalked the streets confident in their victory, countless people suffered. All normality ripped away, human decency a thing of the past, the occupation put everyone to the test. Some became heroes, some cowards; most simply struggled in the daily fight to ‘make it through.’ None would emerge unscathed. Beside the Annexe tells the stories of those Amsterdammers.",
