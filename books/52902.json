  "description": "Every parent, at some point, imagines themselves capable of saving their child from even the most desperate of situations. When the fantasy of becoming that hero doesn’t work, how many would willingly become a monster if that’s what it takes?THE BLOOM is the heartrending journey of a father who struggles with his sanity as he undertakes horrific acts to try and save his daughter as a toxic algae bloom threatens the eastern coast of the United States. Mark isn’t some macho, former military superman who can handle every situation, he’s just a middle-aged, out-of-shape professor who has marital difficulties, financial struggles, and believes that his college-age daughter hates him, especially after his wife and young son die in a horrible accident. When the bloom strikes and the government declares martial law to control the mass evacuation from the coast, Mark takes his dog, packs his car, and attempts to drive from Virginia to his daughter’s college in Maine. Not only is he in a race against time to get there before the bloom reaches her, but he has to overcome every obstacle that tries to stop him while watching the Distance to Empty display in his car count down with each mile.",
