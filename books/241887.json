Because sometimes monsters like to pretend to be humans dressing up as monsters.As the body count rises and the Hidden cosplayers point fingers at each other, it’s up to Kam and her team to stop the insanity. One costumed faction has a secret they’re not sharing—even with each other—and if the bad seed isn’t found soon, the others are likely to be murdered…or worse.This book is approximately 65,000 words",
