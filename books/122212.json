  "description": "A dark and obsessive stalker romance that’s NOT for the faint of heart. My world changed forever the night I attended a party. Not just any party. A party for the rich and powerful elite. That’s where I made the worst mistake of my life. I caught the attention of the perfect man. Kaden Raskova is Prince Charming in a finely tailored suit. Mysterious. Sophisticated. Impossibly handsome. He’s taken a special interest in me and my musical talent. But there’s something off that I can’t quite put my finger on. Moments where I sense a monster behind the mask of a man. A predator that’s luring his prey to his dungeon of cruel delights. That prey being me. As the dark and morbid truth unravels, I come to a grim conclusion. I have to get him before he gets me. And there’s no way we’re both making it out alive. *** Cruel Delights is a dark and twisted romance with very sensitive subject matter that some readers may find disturbing.
