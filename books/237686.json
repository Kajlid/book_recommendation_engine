  "description": "Bulpin transports the reader to the mystical country Rhodesia, today known as Zimbabwe. In his remarkably engaging and romantic style of writing, he tells of stories long forgotten, played out at the foot of the majestic Victoria Falls and along the banks of the Zambezi, the greatest river in Africa. As the Zambezi River twists and turns its way through the beautiful landscape, it is witness to prospecting, hunting, wars, and dreams; and hears of great men who explore the undiscovered land - heroes and villains alike.",
