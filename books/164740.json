  "description": "\"Danger, love, fear, absolution, bravery and strength in a fascinating world are shown through wonderful characters in this absolutely beautiful story.\" G. S., reviewer  In the very near future, on the tiny island of Lanai, teens from very different worlds must find a way to survive when technology is destroyed.  Bea and Sam, Hawaiian kids isolated by a paranoid, alcoholic father, are thrown together with orphaned big-city pickpocket Nick when a disaster fries all technology. Aided by a mysterious `aumakua dragon that may or may not be Bea’s imaginary friend, the kids face fire, plane crashes, gangs, pit bulls, thieves, sharks, hunger, thirst and abuse in a coming-of-age that explores a post-technology world where only the strong and connected survive. \n“Deep, fast-paced, filled with action, suspense, and heart, this little book is huge!” B. Morrison, middle school teacher",
