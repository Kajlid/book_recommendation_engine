  "description": "Jeremy Cross always thought of his life as being normal, but in the wake of a recent tragedy, he’s discovered that his idea of “normal” couldn’t be farther from the truth. Jeremy is a genetic anomaly—one of only a handful on the planet—with a new ability that no one thought possible. Thrown into a world of clandestine government agencies, international terrorism, and assassins-for-hire, Jeremy’s new idea of “normal” is fighting for his life. His only hope of survival depends on reconciling the person he thought he was with the hero he needs to be.",
