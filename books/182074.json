  "description": "Saint or Sinner?  Miss Emeline Wright risked everything to escape the monster who stole her innocence, her dignity, her pride. Now no one in her little home town nestled in the West Virginia hills must ever know what she was forced to do while a captive in the city. Her only chance is to make a go of her uncle’s failing farm, but how can a woman alone, in rough country, survive?  With unfailing courage and an open heart, Em wins over the townspeople who’ve judged her so harshly, taking in a motley crew of misfits who show up, one by one, to lend a hand. But it’s the quiet strength and unfailing love of a single man that will show her how to trust again as they  build a  home to last forever…  DOWN IN THE VALLEY",
