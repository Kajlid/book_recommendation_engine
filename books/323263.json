  "title": "Write These Laws on Your Children: Inside the World of Conservative Christian Homeschooling",
  "description": "Homeschooling is a large and growing phenomenon in U.S. societyâ€”the National Center for Education Statistics recently reported that in the last decade it grew at twelve times the rate of public school enrollments. Yet information about this population is terribly incomplete. In this groundbreaking book, Robert Kunzman uses his unprecedented access to six conservative Christian homeschooling families to explore the subset of this elusive world that most influences public perception and rhetoric about the homeschooling movement, from its day-to-day life to its broader aspirations to transform American culture and politics.From the Trade Paperback edition.",
