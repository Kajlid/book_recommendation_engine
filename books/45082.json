  "title": "Sorry for the Lobsters",
  "description": "The tongue-in-cheek autobiography of the man reputed to be the world's last advertising copywriter. Although it's not only about advertising; more about 'Life. And how to enjoy it'. Including chapters on his experiences as a debt-collector, night club bouncer, pornographer, singer, matador (failed), rock-band (Judas Priest) manager, film actor, director, and in the end, by default, worldwide creative director of WPP. To quote one blurb, by Lee Clow, \"Neil is a master storyteller\"; and another by David Droga, \"Delicious and totally decadent; he may well be the most interesting and authentic person in our entire industry.\"This heavy hardback, fully illustrated in color, is currently available only from us, the publishers, on www.neilfrench.com...\"to avoid\" as he puts it, \"the financial ravages of the Amazons of this world.\"",
