  "description": "\"All the Roads was an incredible surprise...I rarely see a description or portrait of someone's mind so deeply and beautifully written as I saw in All the Roads.\" -Iris, book reviewer for Online Book Club. \"...there were certain chapters that were just spellbinding.\" -Sarah Elizabeth, blogger and book reviewer. \"...that's the path that All the Roads takes with gusto, moving protagonists and readers forward to the point where things fell apart to where they ultimately join again.\" - D. Donavon, Senior ebook Reviewer, Midwest Book Review. All the Roads is a romance unlike any other. “It has been so long since we’ve seen each other… It seems silly that we can’t, you know, chat and catch up.” She tried to play at being casual and nonchalant, looking calmly in his direction. “No,” Jay replied slowly, “it isn’t silly at all.” On a rainy spring morning, Jay stops for coffee in a small Alaskan town. The last thing he ever expects is to see her, after almost 18 months of silence between them. Jay and Elle have a past; running into each other leaves them both uncomfortable. Elle returns to a rented apartment in Maine, where she is set to begin working on a small film. Jay leaves for Anchorage before heading back to California. Their distance is minimized, however, by a constant flow of memories and thoughts, which hauntingly intertwine the two of them. Sometimes moving on really is impossible.",
