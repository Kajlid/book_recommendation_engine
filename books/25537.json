  "description": "Fourteen days. Ten parks. Two sisters.One chance to make things right.Seventeen-year-old Elise and her younger sister Wylla haven’t spoken to one another in almost a year. Wylla refuses to forgive Elise for everything that happened last fall, but when they both win an all-expense paid trip to ten of the best amusement parks in the country to ride rollercoasters, Elise thinks it could be a way for them to finally reconnect.As the pair set off with a ragtag group of misfits—including a licorice-eating biker, a doe-eyed sorority president, and an Irish guy who’s as sweet as a cinnamon roll—Elise hopes the hours of confinement in the back of a van might finally provide an opportunity to heal her relationship with Wylla. But Elise is struggling to recover from a trauma of her own, and Wylla has a secret that could derail Elise’s plans. As the girls navigate the ups and downs of their long history, will Elise find a way to reconnect with Wylla, or will she lose her sister, and her sanity, forever?",
