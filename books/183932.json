  "description": "The 'Gender A Diary' is an intriguing and insightful record of how people treat girls and boys differently.When Ros Ball and James Millar’s son was born in 2010 they instantly felt people treated him differently to his big sister. Inspired by the 1980s best-selling diary 'There's a Good Girl' and driven by 21st century technology, they started to tweet about the differences they experienced. What began as an attempt to retain their sanity in a gender obsessed world became a life changing experiment about gender identity.In this collection of their online writing they’ve brought together thoughts on how society, family and even themselves, are part of the ‘gender police’ that limit kids’ lives, along with ideas for how we can all work to break these stereotypes together",
