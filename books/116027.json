  "description": "I'd never believed in love at first sight. I mean, it had never happened to me, so I guess I just didn't think about it. But then... Darcy. Beautiful, kind, intelligent Darcy, who showed me a whole new meaning to the word love, and how to live when I thought there was nothing to live for. While teaching me how to play the guitar a deep friendship developed between us, but it only made me want what I couldn't have...or could I? Faced with difficult times and hard choices, Darcy becomes a crucial element in my life. I'm hiding something from her though. Something big that could destroy all the trust we've built. Was it love at first sight? No. It was so much more.",
