  "description": "Kathryn Morgan used to love Shakespeare. That is, until the night she attends a production of Macbeth in London's West End and is nearly murdered. Thrust into a world as bloody and unnatural as the one in Shakespeare's play, where creatures of myth and legend exist, Kate soon discovers, to her astonishment, she's one of them.  Part dark fae muse, and part something she hasn't been able to name yet, Kate is quickly caught at the center of a centuries-old obsession promising madness and death. Under the looming threat of the Concilium Exsanguis, a vicious governing body of supernatural creatures, she is left with no other alternative than to accept the help of the arrogant Earl of Nottingham, a man as vexing as he is scintillating. As Kate struggles to understand and acclimate to the new world she's entered, unearthing her otherworldy heritage and the capabilities it lends her - powers of prescience, seduction, and inspiration - she begins to also uncover the breadth and scope of the earl's dark secrets. Will he prove her salvation? Or will the truth of his past show him to be the treacherous monster others claim? The answer will alter the course of Kate's future, forever changing her life.",
