  "description": "\"In this revised edition of the highly praised Engaging India, Strobe Talbott updates his bestselling diplomatic account of America's parallel negotiations with India and Pakistan over nuclear proliferation in the late 1990s. The update looks at recent nuclear dealings between India and the United States, including Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's 2005 visit to America. Under the highly controversial agreement that emerged, the United States would give India access to U.S. nuclear technology and conventional weapons systems. In exchange, India would place its civilian nuclear program under international monitoring and continue the ban on nuclear testing. Praise for the hardback edition \"\"A fascinating study of how diplomatic dialogue can slowly broaden to include subtle considerations of the domestic politics and foreign policies of both countries involved.\"\" Foreign Affairs \"\"An important addition to the literature of modern diplomatic history.\"\"—Choice \"\"Detailed and revealing... an honest behind-the-scenes look at how countries make and defend policies.... A must-read for any student of diplomacy.\"\"—Outlook (India) \"\"A rapidly engrossing work and a welcome addition to modern world history shelves.\"\"—Reviewer's Bookwatch \"\"A highly engaging book; lucid, informative and at times, amusing.\"\"—International Affairs\"",
