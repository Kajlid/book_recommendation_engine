  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B09LTN5NNLAfter a disastrous family Thanksgiving, all I wanted was to avoid anything holly and jolly this year, so an unexpected business trip seemed like the perfect escape plan . . . until I landed smack dab in the middle of a freaking winter wonderland, otherwise known as Carole Cove, Montana. It’s merrier and brighter than the North Pole. The town even comes with its own Mr. Holiday—Noel Holiday, that is. Not only is he holly and jolly but he’s hotter than the lattes he sells at his café. And for some reason he would love nothing more than to share the magic of the season with me.Unfortunately, this little trip of mine isn’t exactly filled with good cheer. But Noel’s kisses have a way of making me believe in Christmas miracles. And a miracle might be exactly what it takes to keep the holidays from being ruined forever.",
