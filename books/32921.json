  "description": "Sinclair Sexsmith presents a cornucopia of lesbian kink — tantalizing tales rich in variety and saucy details of girls put in their place — and held there firmly. A girly-girl reaps a sweet punishment for refusing to mess up her oh-so-pink lipstick and a well-equipped top takes charge. Whether readers dream of surrendering to a lover or of taking control, Say Please offers plenty of erotic inspiration and gives readers exactly what they want!In \"The Cruelest Kind,\" Kiki Delovely's naughty narrator gets her just desserts from her butch girlfriend with some fierce back alley bondage while D.L. King's domme makes her submissive strip before un unseen audience, binds her to a bench, and gives her a good strapping in \"A Public Spectacle.\" Anna Watson' bored housewife gets more than she bargains for in \"The Keys\" when she follows a lesbian animal trainer out to a queer bar and anything goes in Xan West's sexy \"Strong\" when a transgender butch and genderqueer sub engage in some very tough love.",
