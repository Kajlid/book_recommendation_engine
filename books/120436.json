  "title": "Avatar Anatomy: A Soul's Journey into the Body",
  "description": "Join Angela as the little voice in her head leads her on a journey of self-realization. From a woman filled with fear and contraction to a global traveller seeking the next psychological cliff to jump, she learns to literally get inside her body and be comfortable in her own skin. From esoteric experiences of brain training, Kundalini activations, plant medicine, breath work, yoga, medical intuitive training, sexual healing and more, the complete Body Ascension Series shares a wide array of tools and techniques that bring true self into the body to interface with and express through our physical avatar forms. Book One, Avatar Anatomy, is her journey into the body as she learns to recognize the guidance of her true divine self, following it blindly as it leads her to open the energy pathways to fully embody her true essence. Once in the body, the realms of the subtle energetic world opened to her perceptions while notions of needing to fix herself fall by the wayside and a deeper understanding of truth and love is remembered.",
