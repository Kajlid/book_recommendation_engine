  "title": "Living In The Brambles: A little book of poetry about my personal experiences with OCD, Depression and Anxiety",
  "description": "This debut poetry collection details the author's experiences with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Depression and Anxiety. It shares some of her poems, both Haiku and traditional rhyming, about these subjects. Suzi is going to donate 25% of the profits from her book sales to the charities MIND and OCD UK. Most of us have some experience of depression, whether it be ourselves or someone we know. Suzi wrote this book in the hope that her personal journey would help others see a way out of their own dark places. It gives a brief summary of her painful journey from her nursing career, through various self-employment roles, to her current role as an author.",
