  "description": "Dark humor, paranormal women's fiction.Mother Teresa’s Advice for Jilted Lovers is a hilarious, irreverent take on the darker side of spirituality. Every time Tara Holland thinks she’s getting close to finally having her white wedding, the man who should be on his knee, giving her roses, winds up on his back, pushing up daisies. Needless to say, Tara’s beginning to think she’s cursed when it comes to men. Her best friend, Betsy, who’s always there to put the pieces back together, convinces Tara she’s the cause of each of her boyfriend’s untimely exits to the other side. Could it be that Tara has that kind of psychic power? And is Betsy right that women all over the world would pay a pretty penny for it?What follows is a wild and humorous trek down the path of Tara’s spiritual growth and ultimate awakening. But the road to enlightenment is no cakewalk. It’s fraught with stacks of ill-gotten cash, death threats, and orange jumpsuits.***1st Place winner for best Mystery/Suspense in the Chanticleer Chatelaine Awards, recognizing emerging new talent and outstanding works in women’s fiction and romance novels.Nominee for the Whistler Independent Book Award, fiction, recognizing excellence in Canadian independent publishing, 2016.“Donna Barker’s dark humorous novel has a fresh, snarky voice that will leave readers laughing out loud and turning pages right until the end.” Eileen Cook, author of With Malice",
