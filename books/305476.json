  "description": "\"A Turn in the South\" is a reflective journey by V. S. Naipaul in the late 1980s through the American South. Naipaul writes of his encounters with politicians, rednecks, farmers, writers, ordinary men and women, both black and white, with the insight and originality we expect from one of our best travel writers. Fascinating and poetic, this is a remarkable book on race, culture and country. 'Naipaul's writing is supple and fluid, meticulously crafted, adventurous and quick to surprise. And, as usual, there's the freshness and originality of his way of looking at things ...a fine book by a fine man, and one to be read with great a book of style, sagacity and wit' - \"Sunday Times\". 'A tissue of brilliantly recorded hearsay, of intense listening by a man with a remarkable ear' - \"New York Times Review of Books\".",
