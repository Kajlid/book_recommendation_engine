  "description": "One special lady will help this cowboy lawman win his father's ranch -- and steal his heart in the bargain....  Kade McKettrick's got five mail-order brides-to-be camped out at the local hotel, all more than eager to provide him with the heir that will win him the Triple M ranch. But Kade, the newly appointed marshal, has his hands full with a troublesome outlaw gang. Why, then, is he so easily distracted by pretty \"Sister Mandy\" -- who most assuredly is not the nun she claims to be?  On the run from her outlaw stepfather, Mandy Sperrin hides beneath her solemn disguise, and vows to keep her wild, passionate nature from the respectable citizens of Indian Rock. Yet when the handsome marshal makes it clear that he wants her, Mandy gives in to her heated desires....  Despite the secrets that may lure them both perilously close to danger, Kade knows that proposing marriage may be the only way to keep this spirited woman by his side. But are her ties to a shadowed past more threatening -- and closer -- than Kade knows? His strong, sensual embrace may charm Mandy's wild heart -- but will she surrender to a lifetime of his deep and powerful love?",
