  "description": "Grimm Brothers MC president, Snake, battled his way to his position by any and all means necessary. He was powerful, respected, commanding; but most importantly, he was feared. Then, at the height of power, one ruthless misstep crumbled his kingdom in an instant. Beaten within inches of his life by a member of a rival MC, betrayed and left for dead by his own club, Snake has only two things left to focus on: healing and revenge.As a physical therapist working in the trauma unit, Amanda thought she had seen it all. That is until she met a patient known to her as Nick, a broken man who had sustained the most severe beating she’d ever encountered. Surly, brooding, and angry, he should be a nightmare patient. But under the rough exterior, Amanda couldn’t help but be drawn to his determination to heal. Not to mention he was ridiculously attractive, to the point that she found herself giving him some extra attention.Women like Amanda—kind, sweet, intelligent, independent, respectable—don’t exist in Snake’s world. When she offers him a place to live after his hospital stay, he can’t figure her out. The more time they spend together, the more torn he becomes between two realities: a gruesome MC world full of lies, betrayal, and hatred, or a life with Amanda that promises healing and peace.As Snake helps Amanda through some troubling times, passion flares. For the first time in his life, he actually cares about a woman. It’s enough to make him question everything. But after leading a life as a dedicated outlaw, is it too late to turn around? And if not, is he willing to leave his vendetta behind?",
