  "description": "Carissa Shea, half-elf/half-human apothecary, has been through two harrowing events this year. With the October All Hallows Eve celebration coming up, her friends and family use the festivities as a way to lift her spirits. They've volunteered, along with several Moss Hill residents, to decorate the old ruins of Fairfield Castle as a haunted house, and they've elected Carissa to lead the decoration committee. Reluctantly, she accepts the position, but regrets it immediately when a tragic accident occurs on the castle grounds. When foul play is suspected, fear threatens to cancel the celebrations. Can Carissa remedy the situation in time for the holiday?",
