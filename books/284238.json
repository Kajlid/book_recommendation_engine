  "description": "A Minority of Joy is a coming of age and self-discovery novel which focuses on the life of a young woman named Joy, who has Asperger's. The novel is about the minorities she faces in her emotions and as a person. How the workings of her mind lead to challenges, affecting her ability to show feelings, read emotions, communicate and deal with her conflicting mind. For she is disadvantaged; she has struggles in understanding people, their actions and motivations. Joy is marginalised by society. All because she is different and yet she is exceptional in how she views the world and all that goes with it. For Joy is a minority, an outsider. She feels small in the eyes of the world. Thus she is a minority in her own self, but also a minority in how she views the world and how she expresses herself. Yet, because of her differences, Joy is an indefinable character. I believe that makes her someone special and new that people deserve to discover.",
