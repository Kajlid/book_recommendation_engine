  "description": "What’s the worst present you can get for your 45th birthday? An online dating profile you didn’t want. And Mack was all set to delete it, until a message from Hayden lands in his inbox. Hayden decided the best way to celebrate ending a long, loveless marriage was to have a one-night stand. Pity she didn’t count on a sexy, fire chief foiling her plans. Neither of them wanted a relationship, such a shame fate didn’t get the memo.",
