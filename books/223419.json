  "title": "More than a Werewolf",
  "description": "\"My name is Leah, and I never planned on finding the other half of my soul at 19 years old. I didn’t think I’d end up co-leading a pack of wolves with said soulmate, either, but as a wolf shifter, I guess I shouldn’t have bothered planning my future anyway.\"  Being raised to believe she was a member of the lesser gender in a world where humans and shifters coexist in peace, Leah is determined to change her people's culture. She'll give up anything to do so--even the other half of her soul, if that's what it takes to make a difference.  Unfortunately for her, the other half of her soul is a stubborn Alpha, and he isn't nearly as ready to let her go as she is ready to let go of him.  Between fighting off shifters and discovering what it really means to be someone's mate, something will change, and it's not the world.",
