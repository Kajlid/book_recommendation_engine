  "description": "Fictitious memoir. Richard Heller has spent most of his life on horseback, skis, bike, or on foot in Californiaâ€™s High Sierras, Alaska, Mexico and recently the Highlands of Scotland. A farrier and blacksmith for thirty-five years, he spent seven of those first years working with troubled children as a horseback riding instructor. As a writer, his subject matter is diverse, ranging from poetry to technical writing for the horse industry. As a sculptor, his bronze works are as varied as his writing, from a holocaust survivor to a series of wolves. Throughout this time, he has built things, including his own home in the Hollywood Hills. Heller was born in Los Angeles and now lives in Washington State.",
