  "title": "Soul Food, A 90 Day Journey of Self Discovery While Building Nourishing Habits",
  "description": "Soul Food is a “play book” to help establish heart-centred habits in a gentle and positive way. The first 30 days focuses attention on gratitudes, doing something you love, your Top 3 Priorities for the day, as well as some mandala colouring to help relax and rejuvenate you. The next 30 days expands the practice by adding body and health focus, as well as a beginning meditation practice.From there, the final 30 days builds another layer of your foundational practice by adding daily journaling prompts to take you even further inward for some soul reflection. Towards the final days, you have the opportunity to create your own mandala designs.Each month, as you gradually and progressively build on the previous month’s groundwork, you can easily deepen your communication within. You will discover your soul voice that is as unique as you are. After 90 days, you will have created a daily practice that suits you, your interests and your schedule. Most important of all is who you will become while on this journey!!",
