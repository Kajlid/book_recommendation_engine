  "description": "The contract didn't make me his. He did.I shouldn't be here.My clothes shouldn't be scattered around the room, my bottom shouldn't be sore, and I certainly shouldn't be screaming into the sheets as a ruthless tycoon takes everything he wants from me.I shouldn't even know Houston Powers at all, but I was in a bad spot and I was made an offer.A shameful, indecent offer I couldn't refuse.I was desperate, I needed the money, and I didn't have a choice. Not a real one, anyway.I'm here because I signed a contract, but I'm his because he made me his.Publisher's Note: Indecent Invitation includes spankings and sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book.",
