It's weird that I don't remember them—thanks, amnesia! Wyatt's an amazing person. He's a Big Brother, volunteers at soup kitchens, delivers food to the hungry—your basic angel. Your basic filled-out-in-all-the-right-places, naughty-thoughts-inducing angel, that is.Might be the perfect lie…In fact, the more I get to know Wyatt the harder it is to believe he's my boyfriend. The more I find out about my life before the accident, the more I don't like who I used to be. I can't understand what a guy like that—kind, considerate, generous—would see in a girl like me.I don't know what's worse, living in the darkness of amnesia or discovering the despicable person I once was. But I've got to figure out if I have what it takes to be the person Wyatt truly deserves—before I lose my heart as well as my memories.90,970 words",
