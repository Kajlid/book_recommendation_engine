  "title": "The Shop Dogs of Parnassus",
  "description": "Who hasn't wondered what it's really like to be a Parnassus Shop Dog? This special 10th anniversary book is written by Ann Patchett, with an introduction by Kate DiCamillo, an afterword by Mary Laura Philpott, and illustrations by Theo Hall. It remembers the early dogs, the iconic dogs, and the dog who ran away. It takes you through the highs (biscuits!) the lows (there were a few mistakes, quickly cleaned up), and the unbrilded joy the dogs bring to customers and staff every day. And if that wasn't enough, all proceeds go to the Parnassus Books Foundation, which provides books to schools and underserved communities. Woof!",
