  "title": "Apocalypse Atlanta",
  "description": "We've all seen it on the news every year. A hurricane, a tornado, a tsunami, a flood. A BAD thing happens, and all hell breaks loose.Some people are caught in the chaos, others are victims, some run, others wait for help, most sit at home watching for everything to be fixed for them, and a few dive in to do whatever they can.The thing about a zombie apocalypse is whether or not you're in that initial wave of people who get hungry and start snacking. And where you are as few turn to many. As we all know, when it's zombies, soon many turns to most. And it's over when most become all.Apocalypse Atlanta follows three people as the zombies start eating and bring the world down around them a bite at a time.One is a retired Marine. The second is a widowed single mother. And the third is a biker.Are there right or wrong answers when zombies are involved? Do things like morality and decency matter? Is it better to be alive to feel guilty, or dead and honorable? Who decides who's right or wrong when a single mistake can make you dinner for a ravenous horde of the undead?",
