  "description": "Beckford is an ordinary bloke trying to rebuild his life after a tragic loss and a divorce, by restoring an old wooden yacht with the intention of sailing around the world away from his troubles and a dead-end job he hates. His despair is gradually subsiding with the help of the irascible old boat yard owner, when he stumbles on people intent on wrecking other lives in the same way. What lengths would an ordinary man go to in order to prevent this and gain some sort of vengance? The author's experience as a Royal Yachting Association Yachtmaster gives realism to the nautical scenes in this thriller, and and the underlying violence is lightened by the author's trademark humour.",
