  "description": "BESTSELLING BOOK: #25 Spirituality / Personal Growth / Divination  \"The Tarot Key\" was designed to work with any deck. If you are a beginner, you will find it easy to learn to read the cards and develop your own intuition. If you already have experience reading the Tarot, this book can enhance and deepen your understanding. Author Aliyah Marr, the creator of two Tarot decks, introduces a revolutionary and easy-to-learn intuitive system for reading the cards that she has developed which allows you to interpret any Tarot card instantly. Also a handy reference tool, with a substantial introduction on the historical wellsprings of the Tarot, \"The Tarot Key\" contains a complete glossary of symbols, a Tarot Tableau, astrological correspondences for all the cards, and a section on numerology.  Often used in divination, the Tarot is solidly rooted in universal archetypes—described by Carl Jung as as psychological organs. Using the Waite-Smith Tarot deck and her own deck as examples, artist/author Aliyah Marr explores the Tarot in detail discussing the archetypes, symbols, historical roots, emotional content, numerological attributes, keywords, and artistic composition of each Tarot card. And while her discussion is comprehensive, she encourages the reader to draw their own conclusions, and develop their own intuition and meanings as they familiarize themselves with their own Tarot deck.  ~ Excerpt from \"The Tarot Key\" ~ THE ONLY TAROT BOOK YOU WILL EVER NEED  Introducing a New System for Reading Tarot In this book, I introduce my system for reading the cards that blends four ways of seeing the cards, and rewards the user with instant ways of interpreting the images, numbers, and symbols in each card.  Dealing From Two Decks Reading more than one deck at once is called doing a \"comparative Tarot reading.\" This technique gives more depth to a reading than possibly can be obtained from one deck. Even if you don't want to do comparative Tarot readings, or if you only own one deck, the additional information in this book can increase the depth of your readings. If you have only one deck, such as the Rider Waite Smith Tarot, you will still benefit from the information provided in this book for the corresponding \"Tarot of Creativity\" card.  Two Books for the Price of One In this book, I show you how to work with two decks: the \"Rider Waite Smith Tarot\" and with my own deck, \"The Tarot of Creativity\".* These decks are complimentary the meaning of each card from one deck adds to the depth of the meaning of the equivalent card in the other deck however each card system is complete in itself and can be read alone as well.   The Tarot is a tool that can put you in contact with your Higher Self and inner guidance by helping you access your natural intuition. Reading the Tarot involves a creative synthesis of the Reader's personality, intuition, knowledge, and wisdom, married in a mystical union with the reader's Higher Self.  The Tarot explores the same existential and universal questions that mankind has asked since the beginning of time: What is out there beyond our senses? How can we access our true creative power? And how can we understand, align, and create with the forces in our lives?  * \"The Tarot of Creativity\" is a deck of 78 cards that is sold separately. You can obtain \"The Tarot of Creativity\" from the author’s website: www.parallelmindzz.com.  -:-:-  Dreams, Earth-Based Religions, Celtic New Age & Spirituality, Channeling, Goddesses, Meditation, Mental & Spiritual Healing, Mysticism, New Thought, Self-Help, Theosophy, Inner Child, Earth-Based Religions Celtic D",
