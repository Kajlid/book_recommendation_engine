  "description": "A collection of chilling tales that are \"equal parts H. P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe.\" Ghosts, murderers, monsters, and more lurk within the pages of It Came from Anomaly Flats!\"Scary as hell!\"\"Creepy and brilliant.\"\"A true resurrection of classic American horror writing!\"\"Another triumph!\"The oddest little town in the Midwest has a thousand demented stories to tell...some of them are horrifying enough to send shivers down the strongest of spines. There’s the tale of a man whose utter fear of germs sends him plummeting to the depths of depravity, and the victims he takes with him; the story of a couple escaping Missouri to fulfill their California dreams who take an innocent detour and find themselves trapped in the most unexpected of nightmares instead; the legend of a demonic creature who thrives on human flesh, which may be more reality than fiction. In this first collected volume of chill-inducing stories from everyone’s favorite transdimensional town, you’ll find reason enough to question your own sanity, even as you try to reassure yourself that things like this only happen in stories.Don’t they? Welcome to Anomaly Flats.How loud can you scream?",
