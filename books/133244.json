  "description": "These stories of derring-do on the battlefields of the Napoleonic War have deservedly become classics of the boy's own genre. Featuring a hero who is as devastating to women as he is fearsome to his opponents, Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe novels are fast-moving, full of wit and always historically accurate. This barnstorming 9 book set follows Sharpe from skirmishes in India at the side of the Duke of Wellington to Portugal, where he comes across a prickly English governess, giving the reader barely a chance to pause for breath! Titles in this set include Sharpe's Triumph, Sharpe's Fortress, Sharpe's Trafalgar, Sharpe's Eagle, Sharpe's Gold, Sharpe's Battle, Sharpe's Regiment, Sharpe's Siege, and Sharpe's Waterloo.",
