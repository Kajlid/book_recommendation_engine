  "description": "Drake Fallon's impulsive decision to stop and help a stranger change a tire leads to intriguing possibilities. What he doesn't know is that there are two J. Cahills. After miserable years looking for love in other places, Jesse and Jay Cahill have accepted that for them, illicit passion is the only one. They've built a life, a home together. A chance encounter on a rainy night brings something Jesse never expected- an attraction for another man. Still, he's committed to the love he has for his twin, Jay, and he pushes Drake Fallon away. Drake is intrigued by the vulnerable man he met in the downpour. Though Jesse claims to be involved, Drake is certain the relationship can't be fulfilling or Jesse wouldn't have returned his kiss with such passion. Jay Cahill is devastated when his lover whispers another man's name in his dreams. When Drake calls, how can Jay resist meeting the man who's crept into his twin's dreams?",
