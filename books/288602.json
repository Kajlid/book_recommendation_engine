  "title": "A Heart in the Highlands",
  "description": "Set in a 'time of discovery, excitement, and intoxication with ideas', this breathes the very essence of the world in which Scott lived. Beautifully recreating the course of his life - his childhood, love of family, literary success, encounters with Wordsworth and Lord Byron, and later tragedies and financial disasters, Oliver brings to vivid life all the spontaneity and genius of this 'mighty magician who rolled back the current of time'.",
