  "description": "Jenna and Hallie, twelve-year-old identical twin sisters, live a fairly normal life. They have a mom, Lou, who is pretty cool as far as moms go. They have four best friends: Alan, Jules, Lindsay, and Thomas. They go to school. They play games. It's all normal. That is, until it's not...When Jenna and Hallie arrive home from school to find a stranger in their kitchen, she tells the twins the truth: they were born in another world called Pawcombe, and it is their birthright (theirs, and their four best friends') to put an end to the evil man reigning terror over Pawcombe. This will mean journeying back to a lush, forested world they don't remember, meeting strange creatures, and fighting in deadly battles. They are the only ones who can help. They are the hope Pawcombe has waited for. They are the Sought Six.",
