When Regi and Samuel's close friends suspect a kidnapping, Regi with the help of her sister, Claudia, and friend Wakanda resolves to follow Samuel to Alaska but soon learns secrets about her fianc√© she hadn't bargained for. While Samuel struggles with his faith and with understanding why he has been accused, Regi risks life and love to set him free.",
