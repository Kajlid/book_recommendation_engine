  "title": "The Witchling Apprentice",
  "description": "Witches, potions, and magical spells â€” that all made sense. But seeing men turn into animal-like monsters in the middle of the night? That had to be fiction, right? Cassandra Booth thought her life in the world of the witches would be complete when she joined her coven. Fate had other plans for her. Joining the coven brings new knowledge, like mates and men who turn into animals, all things Cassie would rather have been clueless about. As her plans unravel, she must find a way to join the coven in a way that doesn't involve committing her life to an old friend that she now hates.",
