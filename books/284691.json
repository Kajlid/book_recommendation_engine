  "description": "\"He thought I was his muse. Turned out, he was mine too.\"Maggie Stevens is done feeling objectified.After spending her entire life in the spotlight and climbing the high fashion ranks as a model in LA, she’s willing to leave it all behind for a fresh start. Moving to Seattle seems like the perfect solution.A clean slate.New adventures.Endless opportunities.All is going according to plan. Until she meets the drop-dead gorgeous cooking instructor who delights in adding to her misery.Desmond Blake is determined to make a name for his culinary school—one that speaks to his hard work and undeniable passion.When his food photography hobby garners attention from an unexpected source, his dreams are finally within reach. The obstacle he never sees coming is the sharp-tongued bombshell with a distaste for all he stands for.When Desmond accidentally captures a photo of Maggie during a moment of weakness, he starts to see there’s more to the fashionista than meets the eye…Sometimes what can be seen through the lens is a skewed version of reality. A bent perspective. Manufactured, therefore losing all sense of authenticity. And sometimes all it takes is a different angle to see what’s right in front of you.",
