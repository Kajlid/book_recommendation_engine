  "title": "Abide in Christ: The Joy of Being in God's Presence",
  "description": "So many Christians, instead of accepting God's invitation to enter His throne room, stand alone outside the door, uncertain and ashamed. Christ beckons them to His banqueting table and offers them a room in His house, but they foolishly give up the glory of the life He has offered. They come to Jesus as Redeemer but never go beyond the doorway to abide in Him and experience the unspeakable joy of dwelling with the King of Kings. Andrew Murray knew what it meant to be continually in the Father's presence. Read these thirty-one heart-searching readings and learn how to live daily in closer communion and fellowship with Him. Accept God's invitation and live in His blessing and glory instead of shuffling your feet at the gate.",
