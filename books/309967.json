  "description": "Daniel Rice hasn’t felt right since his return from a dystopian future. Curious dreams repeat with detailed precision. A voice – or something – seems to be calling him. His problem isn’t medical, it’s not even scientific, and it’s driving his wife crazy. Nala is worried, and she’s not the type to pace the halls while her overly analytic husband procrastinates. Earth’s scientific power couple is soon halfway around the world to consult with alien android, Aastazin. Zin is no doctor, but he has friends in high places. Next stop, a thousand light years from home where an alien megacity shaped in a six-petaled flower hosts species from dozens of worlds. But there is more going on at this gathering place than meets the eye – aggressive security bots, an ancient mystery, and a pending vote that could shun humanity from the greatest collection of civilizations the galaxy has ever known.",
