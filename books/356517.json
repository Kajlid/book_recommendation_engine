  "description": "Part noir, part psychedelic romp, all Thomas Pynchon â€” private eye Doc Sportello comes, occasionally, out of a marijuana haze to watch the end of an eraIt's been awhile since Doc Sportello has seen his ex-girlfriend. Suddenly out of nowhere she shows up with a story about a plot to kidnap a billionaire land developer whom she just happens to be in love with. Easy for her to say. It's the tail end of the psychedelic sixties in L.A., and Doc knows that \"love\" is another of those words going around at the moment, like \"trip\" or \"groovy,\" except that this one usually leads to trouble.In this lively yarn, Thomas Pynchon, working in an unaccustomed genre, provides a classic illustration of the principle that if you can remember the sixties, you weren't there . . . or . . . if you were there, then you . . . or, wait, is it . . .",
