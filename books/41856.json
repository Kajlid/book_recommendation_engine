  "description": "Believe it or not a gentle young man who had just gotten out of a state psychiatric hospital in Oregon showed me this when I was twelve or thirteen. I do not know where he first learned it. I never forgot it. In fact the impression it left, and the things I discovered will stay with me to the end of my days. Everyone I have shown it to loved it so how could I resist sharing it with you? Basically we are going to create a spontaneous journey in your mind, step by step. Sporadically I will confront your subconscious with a challenge, and the way it reacts are the keys to your inner kingdom so to speak. It takes only a few brief moments but the illuminating effects will last a lifetime. Here you are, so maybe you should come and find out what perhaps is waiting beneath the surface of your conscious self, with me as your humble guide.",
