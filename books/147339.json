  "description": "From Bestselling Author, Abby Reynolds.  This is a stand alone novel. It is not a cliffhanger. And it is the first novel in the Forehead Kisses Series.  Can there be too many pieces to piece back together?  This is a question Keira faces every day. It’s impossible for her to go anywhere unaccompanied by her cousin, the only person who knows what happened on that horrific night a year ago. The guilt and pain weigh her down every day. Unwilling to open up to anyone and give someone a chance, she lives in solitude.  For her, that’s the only way to live.  Liam struggles with his own demons. After losing someone who means the world to him, he combats his anger and pain on a daily basis. He dives into violence and sex, losing himself more and more. But as soon as he meets Keira, he recognizes the same pain he suffers every day. And he pursues her, wanting to connect to someone who understands.  Keira can’t put herself back together, and neither can Liam. But can they do it together?",
