  "description": "Creatures of evil roam the shadows - the Drakhyn. They may look like humans, but their taloned hands and razor-sharp teeth serve one purpose only; killing. A Sentinel's purpose is to patrol and protect. They are highly trained soldiers with superior skills and abilities. Whether they be Vampyres, Lycan, Castors or gifted Akrhyn, their purpose is the same; hunt the Drakhyn and rid the world of their evil presence. Tegan has been training all of her life in seclusion to be an Elite Sentinel. Having now passed her final Trial, she is selected by the Great Council to become a member of the Elite Guard. Tegan is the youngest Sentinel to be granted such an honour and she accepts, nervous and anxious to finally be with her family. A family who never even knew she existedâ€¦ until now. Soon, fitting in with her family are the least of her worries. The Drakhyn are rising, even as unrest between the Akrhyn grows. What's more, Tegan finds herself bonded to the most arrogant Castor she has ever met. War is coming.Tegan needs to be ready. She must fight to keep her world - and her place in it - free from the destruction that threatens it.",
