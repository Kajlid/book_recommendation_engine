  "description": "This book was written for people with an interest in psychiatry. This tells how people with a psychiatric illness can be misunderstood. How psychiatry has advanced from 30 years ago. Due to patients privacy, no names or correct initials were used. It is important to understand that mental illness is reality. Most people don't think about people with an illness, until they read the news and someone has been shot. If people would seek help before their anger got out of hand, they could get help. It is important to realize if a family member is abusive. There are things you can do. Leave before it is to late. There are shelters for men and women who are victims of abuse. If you know someone in danger contact your local police agency.",
