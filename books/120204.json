  "title": "Sacred Selfishness: A Guide to Living a Life of Substance",
  "description": "This book guides the reader to discover what self-forgiveness, self-love, and loving life truly mean by helping resolve problems in modern life - unhappy relationships, stagnating career, financial issues, and even weight problems. Using strategies such as analyzing dreams, developing inner dialogue, and keeping a detailed journal, Sacred Selfishness wisely assure us that our lives are sacred tasks, where holiness is love and the way to the Divine is through self-knowledge.Sacred selfishness is valuing ourselves enough to develop into authentic human beings, who give back vitality and hope to all around us. While growing up, unselfishness was usually defined as putting the needs of others above our own. As a result, we became outward-directed people, cut off from our inner source of energy and vitality. If we have failed, through the years, to develop our own individuality, eventually we may slide into depression and ill health. It is only after becoming whole again that we can help others and truly renew our society. In the tradition of Scott Peck's The Road Less Traveled and Thomas Moore's The Care of the Soul, Bud Harris shows us to value and love ourselves, to think for ourselves, to have lives of our own, and to be able to love others without losing ourselves. It is only after becoming whole again that we can help others and truly renew our society. This is the path of sacred selfishness.",
