  "description": "Gwen’s never wanted to be a leader, but when no one else stepped up, she took on the role. As the mayor of post-apocalyptic Shreveport, she’s made decisions to protect her people…and most of them have backfired disastrously. When she discovers that the dangerous gold dragon lurking outside of the fort has decided she’s his mate, heartsick Gwen thinks that the best thing she can do is confront him and take him far away from the city.  She does this to save her people - her sister, her friends, her fort.  She doesn’t expect to understand the dragon.  She certainly doesn’t expect to fall in love.",
