  "description": "Curiosity has the ability to turn the smartest person into a reckless fool.  \"Few dared live as close to the border as us. Not even the long-standing peace treaty between our two nations could make people forget how the savage Men of the North used to hunt down and kidnap women here.\"  If only Devina hadn’t been so damned curious by nature, she would have never picked up that letter thrown across the Northern wall. Now, she is horrified to see that it’s from a teenage girl who is only weeks away from being auctioned off in a bridal tournament. With no time to waste, Devina is determined to help the girl escape, even if it means putting herself in danger.  Forbidden Letters is a stand-alone prequel to Elin Peer’s wildly popular dystopian romance series, Men of the North. The entire series is out, so if you like binge reading there will be no waiting for the next installment.  Get this book and see why readers are raving about the masterful dialogue and unexpected plotline.",
