  "description": "Hawley Cooper is left alone to die by Josiah Weeks, with no food or weapons in the middle of winter in the Rocky Mountains. Just six months ago, Cooper was a youth on the edge of manhood, one looking for adventure. Now he wonders if he will live long enough become a man. With a few items he had hidden-a bit of pemmican, a few strips of jerky, two shards of flint, and his penknife-he heads off into the teeth of winter. When he goes down under the weight of an attack by a pack of wolves, he figures his time has come... until he awakes in a Shoshone lodge. Nursed back to health, it is time for him to become a man, and keep the vow he had made while fighting for survival-kill Josiah Weeks.",
