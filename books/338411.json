  "description": "Roy Aron stepped off a sun-kissed beach and plunged into the fiery pits of hell.He had a life-altering vision. To actualize his epiphany, he metaphorically descended the bowels of hell to grapple with manâ€™s ruinous frailties. He followed in the footsteps of Dante Alighieri as he witnessed each of the nine sins: limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, wrath, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery. He came upon unexpected and macabre sagas, engaged in intriguing and enthralling events, which bore testimony to all that these sins manifest, and observed how the sinners end up sundering devastation around them. After observing the lowest of lows, he pulled himself out of these depths and vowed to fight the intoxicating attraction of sin.Roy undertook this odyssey, again and again, every year to make himself a better husband, a better father and a better human being.Journey with him through the heart of darkness, live through these bizarre and metamorphic incidents and emerge in the sunshine of hope.",
