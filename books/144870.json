  "title": "The Encounter",
  "description": "Rite of passage travelogue, social criticism, denunciation of environmental disaster, these are some facets of the ambitious novel by this Argentine resident of the United States. The protagonists, developed on a double plot structure, are Ernesto, a mestizo youth adopted by a Spanish couple residing in San Diego, and Rosa, a Huaorani girl from Ecuador. The symmetries and vicissitudes experienced by each are interwoven in a narrative that brings them together for just one meeting on a single fleeting, splendid day. Ernesto travels from north to south in search of his origins, but what he finds is redemption for his adoptive father, who is implicated in the pollution of the rain forest. Rosa, for her part, leaves Amazonia behind and sets off northward in response to a call from her ailing mother, who immigrated, years before, to Oregon. Both itineraries, with attractive and convincing characters as center of gravity, inspire passion. (Translation of the Spanish language review of the original title in Spanish, from Êl Cultural, Spain's leading literary supplement, by critic Carmen Blásquez).",
