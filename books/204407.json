  "title": "Fear Busters: 14 Ways To Kick Fear To The Curb",
  "description": "Studies indicate that 74% of the population is afraid of public speaking and 68% fear dying. Certainly fear is an emotion that many struggle to overcome. The paradox of life is that what we fear, we eventually magnetize straight into our lives. What we don't understand is that fear is often a pre-programmed response that roots back to childhood. Through repetition in a fear-based environment, our subconscious mind can actually be programmed to initiate a fear-based response to virtually any situation. Then, we basically run on autopilot, and often fears of various sorts dominate our behavior. We may fear losing money, and eventually do. We may fear losing a relationship, and eventually jealousy creeps in and they're gone. We may fear our health, actually creating illness. We may fear losing employment, only to eventually drive it further away. The good news is there are ways to recognize and re-program our paradigm to remove fear from our lives for good! This book is intentionally a quick read. It gets straight to the point and doesn't waste words. It shows you this connection between past programming and reveals 14 technologies, or tools, you can use on a daily, repetitive basis, to program fear right out of your life. The book also includes a FREE audio meditation download plus a number of additional resources that are available on the website",
