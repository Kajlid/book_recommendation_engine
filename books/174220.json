Samantha craves passion and romance but has settled into a familiar routine between raising her children and being a housewife. When she reconnects online with Ryan Benson, an old high school friend, sparks fly. Ryan is deployed to Iraq, and their only forms of communication are by the computer and phone. With each passing conversation, Ryan and Samantha fall deeply in love. They have to wait another five months until he comes home for R&R to see each other for the first time in eight years. While Samantha struggles with her husband finding out about her online affair and passing the days until her love comes home, Ryan faces war every day, knowing there is a chance he may not make it home at all. The two weeks they finally spend together are amazing yet come with trials and challenges as Ryan tries to adjust to the changes in his life. Will the love they share be strong enough to survive after he returns to Iraq?",
