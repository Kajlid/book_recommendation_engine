  "description": "When you think of fairies what comes to your mind? Beauty, joy, never aging, never knowing disease. Masters at sorcery and magic? Yes all of that is right but you never think of the dark side of the fae. Things are not always sunshine and rainbows where I come from. In the night where all that live in the darkness run free. And those so called \"fairy\" tales where the boy and girl fall in love and everyone lives happily ever after. Well this is by far is not one of them. This story is only one chapter in my crazy fae life. It is full of lies, sex, pain and love. But really, who can tell the difference in those. Nissa is not just the fae princess to the Unseelie Court but she is also an empath. After she finds out about her empath power she embarks on a journey of self discovery. But she finds more than just herself and maybe realizes things do happen for a reason. Nissa will have to make tough choices of love, growing up; trying to stay alive and just maybe she will be a great queen.",
