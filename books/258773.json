  "description": "So, this is me. Lily Allen. I am a mother, and I was a wife. I'm also a singer and a songwriter. I have loved and been let down. I've been stalked and assaulted. I am a success and a failure. I've been broken and full of hope. I am all these things and more. I'm telling my truth because when women share their stories, loudly and clearly and honestly, things begin to change - for the better. So, this is my story. These are my thoughts exactly. **Includes an exclusive new chapter**",
