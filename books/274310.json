  "description": "\"From the not so lofty perch of middle age, Androla sees in all the blue smoke of days gone by, the gray & golden now, the certain shadow of the future's ass end. He knows the reaper's on the road & closing steady, still a little light remains & not all the fruit has soured. There's time left for small victories & he wins with this the strained cadence of a life lived hard, words as natural as spit & poems built of flesh, breath & bone.\" -Bart Solarczyk",
