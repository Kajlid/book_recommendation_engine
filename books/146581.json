  "description": "Saddle up for another wild ride with the Four Horsemen.  Ex-Marine Daisy Weston is going undercover, by uncovering it all. Every night the pretty blonde wraps herself around a pole in a club owned by the Raptors MC--the club involved in her sister's disappearance. One lap dance at a time, Daisy gets closer to discovering Rose's whereabouts. She intends to free Rose, no matter who she has to do. There's just one big, muscular obstacle in her way--a handsome biker named Cowboy who won't leave her the hell alone. And what's worse, she's not sure she wants him to. Former rodeo star, Cowboy, poses as a customer in the strip club for The Four Horsemen MC. He and his brothers despise the Raptors for running drugs and women, and they'll go to any lengths to bring the Raptors down. But when Cowboy's search for intel puts him up close and real personal with Daisy, he realizes she's no ordinary stripper. This stripper is on a mission--one that might end her life, unless he can keep her alive.",
