  "description": "This past May, Samantha lost her best friend, Juliana, to cancer. Now there is no one to share secrets, gossip, and dreams; no reason to go to dance class by herself. The way she sees it, there's only one thing to do: close that door, and try to move on. Then, in summer school, Samantha meets Mona, who has her own set of challenges. The two girls click right away. By summer's end they've found jobs, boyfriends, and an apartment in San Francisco. But doors don't always stay closed. Just before the anniversary of Jules's death, things begin to fall apart. Can Samantha and Mona come to terms with their separate pasts and make their friendship strong again?",
