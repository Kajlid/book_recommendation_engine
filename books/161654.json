  "description": "Who is Ted L. Nancy? Is it Jerry Seinfeld as many believe? Or is Ted L. Nancy someone else? Mr. Nancy’s hilarious, notorious Letters from a Nut series documented his correspondence with celebrities and companies, who took his outlandish ideas and suggestions at face value. In Hello Junk Mail!, Nancy tackles one of the most pernicious evils of the modern the junk mailer. Now writing with the Kabobbys of Glendale, a newly arrived foreign family and their relatives, Ted and his new neighbors answer scores of junk letters with riotous results. Responding to a solicitation from a pest control company, Hamooli Kabobby requests that they eliminate his freeloading cousin, then tells the pest control company about his family problems of body odors and stinky backyards. Geela Kabobby writes the distributors of free instant breakfast samples to ask if they cure eye infections. Grandfather Bahir Kabobby writes to a mortgage \"Yes, I want financial freedom and healthier toes.\" Laid out as copies of the actual correspondence, the letters are as authentic as they are ridiculous — and all are wildly entertaining. So who is Ted? Jerry Seinfeld or The Kabobbys of Glendale?",
