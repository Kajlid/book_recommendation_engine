In the tradition of The One Thousand and One Nights, the stories explore a bizarre and ancient world through a series of connected tales.Long time ago when the Earth was Flat, beautiful indifferent Gods lived in the airy Upperearth realm above, curious passionate demons lived in the exotic Underearth realm below, and mortals were relegated to exist in the middle.

And yet, Azhrarn held inside his demon heart a profound mystery, which would change the very fabric of the Flat Earth forever...Enter this vivid world of brilliant darkness and beauty, of shimmering palaces and extraordinary elegant beings, of merciless passions and undying love. Discover the exotic and wondrous landscapes of the Flat Earth.",
