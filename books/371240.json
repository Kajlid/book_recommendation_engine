  "description": "The first collection of poetry from Teri Louise Kelly showcases the methodology of an author whose life has been lived both within, and beyond, the borders of the binary system.\"The poems are vivid and awaken the senses with intense imagery and seductive scenes which are often shockingly sexual. But, it is hard to take offence to any of these poems because you know what is written is the truth, described from a unique perspective. Her phrases are such that they make you wonder whether she has created them for the shock value, purely because she can and is so good at it, or because she feels that no other combination of words could fully express her feelings. Whatever the motives, Teriâ€™s poems are intense, distinct, and memorable.\" - Kimberlie Wiese, M/C Reviews",
