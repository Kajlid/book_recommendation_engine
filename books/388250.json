  "description": "From author Lynn Galli comes two original short stories. See how the Virginia clan series started with \"Finally\" and enjoy a new stand-alone tale in \"Objection.\" Epilogues to all the Virginia friends' books are included. Finally - Willa Lacey is confident, smart, and ambitious. A few months away from being granted venture capital to start her software company, she's barely able to maintain her day job, attend to her family, and keep up with friends. It's been a long process, but her hard work is about to pay off. So, why is it that all she can think about is the friendship she's just made with a professional basketball player? She's never been distracted before, yet something about Quinn Lysander is making her rethink her priorities in life. Can the potential for a relationship outweigh the importance of her life's ambition? Objection - When a pattern of judicial bribery appears to benefit someone in the mayor's office, Lindsay St. James, political problem solver, is tasked with fixing the issue. Used to dealing with all kinds of legal ramifications and potential publicity nightmares, Lindsay has never had much trouble resolving these situations in the past. She doesn't expect this problem to be any different. However, when she enlists the help of a sassy but all too lovely superior court judge, she may find her focus blurred for the first time in her life.",
