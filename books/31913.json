  "description": "Mitchell Andrews made a bad mistake. His failure to cope made it worse. He turned to alcohol, and his angry outbursts drove his wife away--but it drove him to find Christ, sobriety, and newfound hope. He attempts to win back the love of his life, but the mistakes of his past threaten to undo his second chance. Will he come undone at his weakest moment, or will God give him the strength to endure?",
