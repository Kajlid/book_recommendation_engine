  "description": "Ex special-ops officer and security expert Ryan McLean is getting a much-needed vacation. In the Caribbean for his best friend Connor’s wedding, his plans include nothing more strenuous than working on his tan. Until he meets a beautiful woman in the hotel bar. Their connection is immediate and intense, and they spend a passionate night together with pleasure as their only goal.  Until Ryan wakes the following morning to discover the beautiful woman has vanished, along with millions worth of jewels from the safe of the Saudi prince staying in the suite next door. Realizing he was duped, Ryan becomes determined to find the mystery woman and bring her to justice. If only he could forget how explosive their chemistry was, how her kisses drove him wild like no other woman before.  A notorious thief known to authorities only as the Dragonfly, Mariana Lora has made redistribution of wealth her life’s work. She only has one more score to settle until she can retire, but the sexy-as-hell Marine she spent one explosive tropical night with is hot on her heels at every turn. She has to outwit him to stay out of jail, but fighting their magnetic attraction soon becomes a game neither one of them can resist.  When Mariana’s last job goes dangerously wrong and she needs Connor’s help to survive, he has to decide if their game of cat and mouse is only a game, or if he can trust this beautiful thief with something no woman has ever his heart.",
