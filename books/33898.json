  "description": "Before most pioneers had moved to the Wild-West and even before many of the cowboys had built their cattle ranches, sixteen-year-old CHARLES DOBBS returned from hunting to find the family farm has been attacked by Indians, their home burned to the ground. His father’s tortured body lies tied to a wagon, and his mother is dying. The agony they have suffered makes a deep impression on Charlie’s young mind, one that would haunt him for many years to come. In this adventure, he becomes a man as he interacts with different tribes, builds lasting friendships--and even longer-lasting enemies.",
