  "description": "When Captain Pieter Thomas arrived in the New World roughly one hundred years after Columbus, he sought a new and more prosperous life as a fisherman in the fertile waters of the Caribbean. What he found, or rather, what found him, is an entirely different story. When a pair of ancient Arawak tomes are unearthed on the island of Camahogne, their discovery sets off a chain of events never recorded in the traditional annals of history.Word of this revelation soon reaches Jeringas Mortifer, the malevolent king of the mainland south, who long desired to find the tomes of the lost prophecy and unlock the secrets of the scripture for himself. To recover them, the king sends forth his most harrowing servant - a mysterious being older than all of human history, with terrifying powers and an agenda of his own.Shortly after the birth of his first son, Captain Thomas has a chance encounter with a local fortune teller, who confides that his family is at the very center of the unfolding lost prophecy. While a skeptical Pieter initially dismisses her claim as primitive folklore, he is dangerously unaware of the many pieces in play, and that the hunt for his infant son had already begun.Beautifully composed and amazingly descriptive, Cimmerian Rising is a heart pounding adventure over exotic lands and faraway seas. Intentionally styled as a complete departure from the standard formulaic narrative and written in high definition, Cimmerian Rising will utterly transport you into another world and a forgotten time, arriving at the very colorful genesis of Eternidad.",
