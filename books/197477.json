  "description": "A brand-new contemporary novel from bestselling author Eric Walters Still reeling from a breakup with his long-term girlfriend, Graham Fox is less than thrilled to have to move to a new city and switch schools for senior year. But his decision to keep his head down and just get through the year is quickly challenged by Ethan Frost, former basketball player and trouble maker, whose talent at getting girls to go out with him is unmatched. In fact, he seems to have it down to an infallible science. Almost. Graham soon finds himself playing the role of wingman, as Ethan plunges them into a whirlwind of all-ages clubs, diners, support groups -- anywhere there's a chance to meet girls. Distracted from his own pain, Graham finds himself absorbing the \"lessons\" from Ethan, turning meeting girls into a game. That is, until he meets someone who challenges everything Ethan has taught him.",
