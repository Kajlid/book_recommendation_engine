  "title": "Stone Embrace",
  "description": "In the New Realms, love can be the most dangerous battle of all...Terak has fought all enemies to claim Larissa. It doesn't matter that his own Clan looks upon the union with misgivings. It doesn't matter that her family sees a monster when they see him. It doesn't matter, because Larissa is his. And any who would try to take her away? They'll see what a Gargoyle will do to protect his mate.______________________Stone Embrace is not a complete story. It would best be described as an extended 30 page epilogue to the novel Stone Guardian. You'll probably have the most enjoyment reading this story if you have read Stone Guardian and already know the characters and world of the Entwined Realms series.",
