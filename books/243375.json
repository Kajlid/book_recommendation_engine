  "description": "The Winter Games have begun…I’m the life of the party. A little loud and some buzz kills might say obnoxious, but if you’re around me I guarantee you’ll have a good time.Unless your name is Demi Harrison.If that’s the case, you’d act like I’m the devil incarnate and go out of your way to avoid me. Which makes zero sense because at the last Olympic Games I rocked her world.Whatever though. I need to concentrate on winning gold anyway. I was at the top of the standings coming into the games, but since arriving in Korea I’ve lost my edge. I was never one for superstitions, but I can’t deny that there’s only one difference between my previous medal winning games, and these ones—her. I’ve pulled off amazing feats in the past, but getting Demi to agree to sleep with me throughout the games might require divine intervention",
