  "description": "A young couple resign from their jobs in the midst of a recession to embark on a journey with their life savings, a tent and very few plans in tow. Told by the pillion, Beads in the Headlight is a travelogue of their quest for adventure through the American continent on a motorcycle that is older than them both. Wild animals, brutal climates, mechanical troubles, kind strangers, magnificent landscapes and ocean crossings fill 31,254 life affirming miles in this inspiring and heart warming account. From the Although this journey was undertaken on a motorcycle, I wrote Beads in the Headlight with the hope of inspiring those who don't ride, as much as those who do. I set out to capture the incredible people we met and the cultures we had the pleasure of experiencing as a result of riding - rather than putting the bike at the centre of everything (although it gradually takes that place anyway!). Before we embarked on this journey, I never had the intention of writing a book but as a result of what we saw and the people we met, I hoped to inspire others to take a leap of faith and explore for themselves. I hope you feel that way after reading it - whether you ride or not. Enjoy!",
