  "title": "Plastic Girl",
  "description": "Eva grew up in a climate apocalypse, her parents are dead, and the boy she once loved is probably trying to kill her. Just when she's about to give up, she discovers a new species born from plastic waste. More incredibly, she can mold these creatures into other beings - first a butterfly, then a fish, a deer, a bear, and eventually, a sister, Iris. As Eva dabbles with creating life, it becomes frightfully clear that her creations, Iris included, will either save humanity or end it.",
