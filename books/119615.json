  "title": "Lady Annabelle's Abduction",
  "description": "If Lady Annabelle Chatfield’s reckless brother had to die in debt, couldn’t he have borrowed from a handsome, dashing young creditor? Of course she wants to save her family from disgrace. Only it is too cruel that a spirited girl eager for adventure must marry the stout, dull, balding Earl of Brackenbury.  But when a dark stranger climbs into Lady Annabelle's window at midnight, slings her onto his horse, and gallops into the forest, she stops wishing for excitement. Who is this ruthless brigand known only as Hawk? Where has he taken her? What does he plan to do to her?  Tied to a rickety chair in a woodland hut, Lady Annabelle prays for anyone, even Lord Brackenbury, to save her. For according to her kidnapper, she is merely a pawn in a deadly chess game. To win, Hawk intends to ruin her.  Will help arrive in time to save her honor, her wedding, and her desperate parents? At Chatfield Hall, the new footman finds a clue and sets out to rescue his missing mistress. But as Lady Annabelle and Hawk warily grow acquainted, she begins to wonder: Will I mind if it doesn't?",
