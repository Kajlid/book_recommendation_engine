  "description": "Bestselling author Lisa Suzanne's romantic comedy features rock stars, a best friend's older brother, and an accidental Vegas wedding.I've never seen Emily Clarke as anything more than my little sister's best friend.One drunken mistake later, she's my wife.My first thought is how to get out of this, except our wedding video has gone viral and record sales are skyrocketing. My manager thinks following the newlyweds on the second season of my band's reality show will keep up the momentum.I just have to get Emily to agree to faking this marriage for six months, and then we can quietly divorce.Right?Wrong.Nothing is quite that simple when feelings blur the line between a contract and reality.I ended up with more than just a hangover when I found myself waking up married.",
