  "description": "SYNOPSISTHE NECROMANCERã€€ Omar Satinov, the Necromancer, has become a secret, whispered legend across several continents. His lure is a mystical religion based upon Witchcraft; his hook, the natural herbal products that addict his followers. But does he really have supernatural powers, as many of his disciples believe? Michelle perceived a kind of magic when she met Omar, dazzled by the handsome, charismatic, wealthy older man. Older men seem safer, less likely to become ardently aggressive in a bout of excess testosterone. Michelle was brutally attacked while on a business trip in Las Vegas. The police didn't believe her and thought she must have lured a man up to her locked hotel room for a little sexual adventure, which went dangerously out of control. Michelle sustained visible scars from the terrifying and almost lethal attack, but the scars on the inside motivated the move from her home in California to Hawaii. Now she has a successful career and she figures abstinence is an acceptable, if lonely, way to live. Michelle decides that an affair with Omar might cure her of the humiliating, embarrassing, and uncontrollable anxiety attacks which plague her whenever she finds herself alone with a man. How could she know that she made the worst possible choice?",
