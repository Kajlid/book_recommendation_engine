  "description": "Sydney Willows, a professional photographer boasts a long list of world famous musicians as clients.  She's beautiful, ambitious, and about to shoot the most lucrative job of her career when she meets Ben Gallo, lead singer and guitarist for his band, Reckless.  Tall, handsome, and with enough rock swagger to melt any woman's heart, Ben plays to win.  Will he be the one to show her that the path to 'happily-ever-after' is possible with a music man, or will a juvenile bet made between brothers prove stronger than a bond of love?      For All The Right Reasons is ribboned with deception, lust and love and will leave you aching for an encore.",
