  "description": "\"The Sun Is Snowing: Poems, Parables and Pictures\" is the second edition of C. JoyBell C.'s very first published work, \"The Sun Is Snowing: Poetry and Prose\", which has been revered by many as \"A masterpiece!\" It has also been said to be \"The key of the angels,\" \"Profound,\" and \"Very human.\" This second edition keeps the legacy of the first book by holding onto all the favored original writings while featuring expressive, beautiful photography by various international photographers, as well as those taken by the author herself! But more than holding onto the old ways, in this new edition she introduces well-kept secrets by unfolding her own unheard-of philosophies, never-before-seen writings, and some new poetry! Overflowing with food for the soul, \"The Sun Is Snowing: Poems, Parables and Pictures\" is an essential relative to your C. JoyBell C. collection of books, or to any collection of inspirational, philosophical, enigmatic writings! The author says, \"I wrote this book so I could have a sort of seashell into the Heavens. I used to hold seashells up to my ears and listen to the echoes of the ocean waves inside of them; in that same sense, I wanted to create an echo of angels' voices, not necessarily for everyone else out there, but primarily for me to return to over and over again! But of course I want to share that seashell, I want to tell people to hold that shell up to their ears and listen to its echo!\"Note: This edition is out-of-print, please look for the current, third edition, \"The Sun Is Snowing: The Scrapbook.\"",
