  "description": "A Dark Reverse Harem Romance. My name is Stella, and after twenty-five years of living, I am finally starting to understand what it means to be alive.  Edward and Lincoln have taken my life and made it a whirlwind of sex, pain, and blood. They show me things I never would’ve imagined, made me feel real, genuine emotions for the first time in my life. I owe them everything.  There is a darkness inside of me, one I never knew existed until Edward and Lincoln, and together our beasts collide and make something truly new and terrifying. We are alike in more ways than one.  But the Angel Maker draws closer with each passing day. When he reveals himself to me, when he finally sheds his mask and steps into the light…what will I do? What can I do? I am drawn to him just like I’m drawn to my two psychopaths.  Whatever happens, you know it’s going to be bloody.  This is a dark, why choose romance intended for 18+ readers.  ***TW: This is a dark, psychologically twisted tale involving graphic scenes of violence, stalking, and other topics some readers might find triggering. 18+ Be warned.***",
