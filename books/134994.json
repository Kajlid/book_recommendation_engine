  "description": "Jake had his cock so far in Hillary’s cunt, that he was close to orgasming and stopped when he heard her say, “Did you hear that?” Looking towards the door she said, “I think David is home”. Not moving Jake listened and asked, “Isn’t he due home next week?” “Yes”, she said and continued to watch the bedroom door. Not hearing anything he slowly started to fuck her again and lowered his head as he was about to shoot his load into her. “Jake”, she whispered and heard him say, “Hillary I’m about to off load, it is nothing, now move your hips and fuck me”. Still looking at the door she said, “I can’t do this anymore and got out of his embrace and quickly dressed. On his back, he blew out a breath and said, “You wanted to fuck me remember?” “I know and I’m sorry”, she said and opened the bedroom door. He got the hint, dressed and walked past her and said, “Next time you’re looking for a fuck think twice about it as I won’t be as willing”. Seeing his jeans stretched she looked into his eyes and saw the hurt in them and said, “I’m sorry”, and watched him walk out the back door.",
