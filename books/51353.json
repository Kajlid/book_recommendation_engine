  "description": "When Kiana Sheridan begins investigating her family's roots as part of her doctoral dissertation, she is motivated as much by a personal desire to reclaim a family legacy that has long been denied. Kiana believes her great-great-grandfather was an artisan working in decorative glass on a Tennessee plantation. With his wife he fled slavery via the Underground Railroad just before the outbreak of the Civil War - but there the trail goes cold. If only Kiana can piece together the missing link, she'll understand what happened to the glass and complete the research her mother had started before her death.But Kiana's plans cause turmoil in her family. They are furious and deny the plantation ever existed. Her ambitious step-sister does everything to sabotage Kiana's agenda. Nevertheless, Kiana is aided by Rex Tandy, a handsome photojournalist, and together they set off on an adventure that retraces the route to freedom Kiana's ancestors took - and leads finally to an isolated mountain village where the secret of her family is still jealously guarded.There, deep in the remote hollows of the Smoky Mountains, Kiana and Rex discover their roots and the longings of their own hearts. Yet quite suddenly danger is all around them - danger to their very lives. For this is the place where passion and ideals once met a violent end...and now the shocking confrontation that has waited over a century is about to begin.",
