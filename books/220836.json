  "description": "Humans control the mortal realm, archangels command the heavens, Nephilim reign in Olympus, and Hell is Lucifer’s own. That’s the way it’s been for thousands of years. But now, everything is changing. Archangel Michael has seized control of Hell, and Zeus is dead. The Hell-Heaven Accords could falter at any moment, and when they do, bedlam. Cats marrying dogs, fire raining from the sky, chipmunks stuffing taxidermists... And the throne of the Underworld being tossed up for contention. Marc Angeletti was one of the good guys, emphasis on was. The last place the priest ever thought he’d end up was in Hell, vying with fallen angels for power. Marc’s faith, however, may prove the key to winning the day—the only catch being that that means making the love of his life, Riona, into the enemy. Can’t a condemned man of the cloth catch a break? Meanwhile, Riona, Jerry, and Dee finally decode the Keystone’s prophecy, making them realize the true implications of the coming battle. New alliances and old adversaries vie for favor, and Marc shows up to aid the Pure Souls just as a revenge-bent Greek goddess demands both Hell and Heaven’s attention. Only, Riona isn’t sure what Marc’s true goal helping the Pure Souls defeat the fallen, or undermining her marriage to Jerry in a last hour attempt to woo her. And when Marc suddenly becomes the de facto Satan, he may be an even bigger target for the fallen’s wrath than she is. At the end of the world, who do you trust? The devil who will destroy you, or the devil you know?",
