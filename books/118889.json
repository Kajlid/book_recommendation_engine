  "title": "Bear: The Hard Life & Good Times of Alabama's Coach Bryant",
  "description": "A reissue of Paul \"Bear\" Bryant's autobiography, this edition features a completely new introduction and an accompanying audio CD of Bryant himself, in his own voice, talking about his life and football. It's all here, in his own inimitable words and with a candor that is both remarkable and eminently revealing. From his hardscrabble youth as the third youngest of 13 children of a dirt-poor farmer in Moro Bottom, Arkansas, to his playing days at the University of Alabama and fortuitous marriage to the remarkable Mary Harmon Black, to his first stabs at coaching as an assistant coach, to his 38 years as a head coach, coaching marquis names like Namath and Crow and Parilli, to his 323 victories and a record six National Championships.",
