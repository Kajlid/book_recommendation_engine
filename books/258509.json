  "description": "Bard didn’t hesitate to run from his old pack when his best friend needed him. His feral years were hard and even a tough gamma would rather live in a pack—so long as it is a good one led by an honorable alpha. The Rogue Pack proves to be the perfect new home for him to make his life. The only thing he lacks is a mate, and he has fought his attraction to the exquisite omega, Loki, for a while. When he is charged with Loki’s care, he is both elated and frustrated. He doubts the brat will ever see him as anything other than a captor.  Loki doesn’t understand why his brother forced him to leave their birth pack. No one who knows the answer is willing to tell him. That includes Bard, the annoyingly bossy and always right gamma who has dominion over him. Thwarted from returning to his arctic home, Loki takes his misery out on Bard in the form of bratty behavior. The sad thing is that he wants nothing more than to be happily mated and raising a family with a virile male like Bard. He simply can’t let go of his resentment toward those who keep him essentially a prisoner in the Rogue Pack.  The test of wills between Bard and Loki is coming to a head. Loki is no longer a pup. He’s becoming a mature omega and his heat is imminent. Bard will do anything to keep the boy safe, but when Loki refuses to be bred, Bard faces a terrible decision. The course he chooses may forever doom his growing love for the omega.",
