He called it ‘Journal Therapy’ and said it would help me cope with my feelings.\"\"I’m not sure where to begin, except to say that I had a wonderful life. Actually, it was a perfect life. A loving family and everything money could buy. A life envied by all, but it was stolen from me. I know I made a mistake. But I'm the one struggling to forgive myself.\"\"To explain I need to start from the beginning. But before I do, I must be honest and admit that I wasn’t perfect. No, I had a secret. A secret that came with a price. A secret that will haunt my dreams forever.\"Prepare yourself for an emotional roller coaster.(Contemporary Adult Fiction - Mild Suspense - Drama)(Portions of this book contain violence and strong language)",
