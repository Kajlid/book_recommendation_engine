  "description": "It's never easy staying ahead of the pack, but for Penny, it might just save her life…Since ditching her pack after an offer she “couldn't” refuse from her tyrannical pack alpha, Penny’s been on the run. Always on the move, she never stays in one place for long, avoiding other werewolves like the plague. As the full moon approaches, this one brings with it her toughest challenge yet—her heat phase. And so, rather than letting her animal instincts rule, to force her to bed the first man she comes across, Penny hatches a plan that involves a basement and chains, but sadly, the non-kinky kind.But lone wolf Cade Steele has other ideas. He's watched Penny from afar since she was turned, and now that he's found her, he's determined not to let the little she-wolf face her heat on her own. Cade is wolf enough to match her animal instinct, and alpha enough to claim her. As his mate, her body may become part of his territory, but her heart would be an altogether different matter.When Penny’s past finally catches up with her, her ex-alpha isn't taking no for an answer this time. The question is, with their lives on the line, can Penny and Cade answer the call of the wild?Publisher’s This title has been previously released with another publisher.Please This title contains erotic content and is intended for individuals over the age of eighteen.",
