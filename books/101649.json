  "description": "Werewolves were always meant to find their mates inside their packs, but now a very selective group of females are awakening one after the other. In addition, when they don’t find their destined mate in time, their lives are on the line. Melissa is young and innocent, and just when she thinks her vacation in London is going to be the best of her life, strange feelings of want in her body start to take over her every essence. When she’s ready to crumble, though, a mysterious man appears from the shadows. His name is Lucien, and the things he’s about to do with her body will definitely change her life forever.",
