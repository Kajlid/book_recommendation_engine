After he takes special interest in her welfare, they’ve been warned, any contact between them outside of filming is strictly forbidden. He has other ideas. She’s a phoenix rising from the ashes, the only one who understands the pain that lies beneath the persona. Though he’s not sure if he’s too bad for her, he can’t stay away. All sinners have a past. All saints have a future. But, does being born in fire make the fissures weak in all the wrong places, or stronger than they’ve ever known?",
