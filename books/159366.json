  "description": "Hannah’s farm is facing a new threat – a water company wants to flood the land to make a reservoir. How can she stand by and watch as the land her family has farmed for generations, and the wildlife, all disappear under a deluge of water? Hannah won’t go down without a fight, and the school play might just be the answer… When the going gets tough, the tough take to the stage!This hugely anticipated sequel to The Secret Hen House Theatre has the same hallmarks as its predecessor: great writing and an emotionally engaging, entertaining story.",
