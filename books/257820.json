  "description": "Jodi Chenault has a lot of things going for her; she has a successful business, looks, and intelligence. And she’s a master flirt. She has no problem meeting women or getting dates. She just can’t hold on to any of the women she goes out with. It’s not because she’s unlikeable, she simply can’t handle commitment.  Val Mason is hoping to find the right woman to build a life with. At her best friend’s weeklong pre-wedding party, she meets one who appears to have potential, and she’s hooked. The only problem is, she’s unknowingly hanging her hopes on the Temporary Girl.  Robin Alexander has mixed up a summertime cocktail. The ingredients are friendship, secrets, family, friends, love, and a double shot of humor.",
