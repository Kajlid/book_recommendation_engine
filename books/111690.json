  "description": "Unleashed Under the Mistletoe is the first standalone novella in the Pleasure Grove Hot Romance series with a happily-ever-after ending and no cliffhanger. The pretty girls never say yes to a guy like Leo. But when he overhears the ladies in the office laughing at him behind his back, he does the unthinkable: he accepts a mysterious invitation to a holiday party at The Grove. Thinking he's at an exclusive business party, Leo is shocked when leather clad beauties order the guests to strip! The moment Evie lays eyes on Leo, she's drawn by his dark, exotic good looks. Once she gets his clothes off and sees him for the shy but sexy guy he is, she's tempted to shed her Domina persona. Can an office geek wake up and see that this free-spirited woman might want more than to tie him up and make him beg? Enjoy Isabel Winsor's sexy novella! *** \"If you like your a holidays a little steamier, Unleashed Under the Mistletoe might be the book for you!\" - Becky Moe \"A story that will keep you warm on a cold winter night...\" - Romantic Reads and Such",
