  "description": "Scottish maid Bess McLintock, companion to the Princess Elizabeth, enjoyed an ambiguous position at the court of James I. With her flaming red Tudor hair and her passionate loyalty to the Royal family, what other reason than secret kinship stood between her and the love of Elizabeth's brother Henry, the Prince of Wales? But Bess soon discovers that she has powers that hint at another, more ominous heritage. Premonitions, dreams, visions come so strongly to Bess, that she knows she must be seeing the future. Learning brutally the hideous truth about her mother's death, Bess begins a lonely journey of self-discovery and adventure that takes her through Europe at war to Prague, to make her fierce, proud bid for survival. The new relationships she forges are bizarre and powerful ones, and courageously she forces herself to use, for her companions' survival, those very skills which earlier had her life at court condemned as that of a witch.Well researced and rich in detail, the court of James I, the Thirty Years' War, and the tragedies of the Counter Reformation are woven together in MORGANA with authority and style. A stunning new period novel with a distinctly occult flavor.",
