  "description": "Would you accept yourself to find your humanity.?Ellie Cooper comes from a long line of witches but wishes she could be normal. When she nearly kills herself cursing a vampire, her dislike of her heritage deepens. She must find a way to accept her magic or forsake her family.After feeding on a witch, 693-year-old vampire Charles Dumphrey wakes to find he is living a human teenage life, complete with parents, school and girls. He must adjust to his new life as a human and find a way to break the curse Ellie put on him.Lee is a werewolf who is not yet shifting regularly. He worries about who he will be when he regulates. Lee searches for the balance between his humanity and the wolf before the wolf takes over.All three have to overcome their uncertainties and accept themselves in order to save Ellieâ€™s life.NB: This is not your usual vampire story. A lot of stories take a human character and turn them into a vampire early on, this is the opposite. If you're looking for a typical vampire/witch romance (e.g. 'the Vampire Diaries'), this book might not be for you. Please be aware that this story uses Australian English spelling and syntax.",
