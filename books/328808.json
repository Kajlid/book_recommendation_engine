  "description": "An inexplicable condition. An excruciating reaction to human touch. No one she can trust.When high schooler Cassie Merritt is found in a river with no memory, it's a miracle she survives. But there’s nothing miraculous about her scars or the burning agony she feels at the simplest touch. Her new guardian, who she lovingly calls Gram, can’t hug her. If she had any friends, they couldn’t get close, either.Seeking medical attention could rip her away from Gram and the only life she can remember. Which leaves Cassie to turn to the one person whose touch doesn’t burn her: Gabriel Knight.Gabriel believes her condition is tied to a missing locket, and more crucially, an ancient relic and the power she’s destined to wield. But it seems he and his odd family are keeping secrets from her… dark secrets that could prove more painful than touch itself.In order to find the truth of her past and get a chance at love, Cassie must decide if she trusts Gabriel. But with an ancient war between this world and the next looming, she must decide soon… before evil ravages her small town in irrevocable ways.Readers are addicted to TOUCH, the first book in the Five Senses series.",
