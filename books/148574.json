Her intimate friendship with Elliot gives her strength to face the new challenges, but he's a man of contradictions, and she's uneasy about his hard mobster interior lurking behind the grinning goofball exterior. When she starts to fall for him, however, memories of her past world resurface that begin to sway her. Clover is a dangerous place for hesitation. Beware the talking doors!",
