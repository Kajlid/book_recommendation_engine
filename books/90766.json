  "description": "A Love story. \"Two couples, one desire, separated by thousands of years\" will come to define \"True Love\" for the reader. The first couple, Mikolas and Helena, meet during the Festival of Dionysus in the last row of a Greek amphitheater. It is 326 BC and fate brings the two together. In the second love story another young man, Nikolas, is brought by chance to what is now the ruin of the same amphitheater lying along the Crimean coast of the Black Sea, and he meets Elena, again in the last row of the amphitheater.For both couples their first eye contact lights a flame that will burn bright as they explore their intense feelings. Other shared interests will be revealed: Mikolas and Nikolas's love for the sea and the ships and yachts that sail the world, Helena and Elena's love for painting and its meaning will become evident as both stories unfold.These short but beautifully told tales will answer the readers question \"Is all of this simply coincidence?\" or perhaps the similarities reveal a truth about one of the Novel's quotations: \"Some love lasts a life time. True Love lasts forever.\"",
