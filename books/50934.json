  "description": "Something terrifying is happening all over Oslo: celebrities are turning up dead in macabre ways. A talk show host has her tongue cut out, a politician crucified with a copy of the Koran stuffed inside of her, a literary critic stabbed in the eye with a pen. The killer is sending a message - but what? Police Commissioner Adam Stubo and his wife, profiler Johanne Vik, are both exhausted by the arrival of their new baby. At home, Johanne is haunted by a pattern she remembers from the FBI, a time she tries to forget. But as time runs out, she must confront the demons of her past to stop the killer.",
