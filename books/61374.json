  "description": "Expanded from the original, Vampire Dreams Revamped is bigger, longer, and hotter. Revisit the world of Brandon, Arden, and Vasilije and meet new characters too!A vampire for hundreds of years, Brandon Ridley is surrounded by others of his kind who enjoy their world to the fullest. Orgies, debauchery, and sensual delights leave him empty, though. What he wants is that one woman who will share his life. Homeless and without any family, Arden Stephens must live on the streets of mid 19th century London, never a safe place for a young woman. One night, as she is running for her life from an attacker, she is rescued by Brandon and offered a place in his home as his maid. Brandon is enchanted by Arden from the moment they meet and yearns to make her one of his kind. Nightly, he visits her in her sleep, preparing her for the night he will finally make her his own. For Arden, the wanton dreams she has about her handsome employer seduce her and each day when she wakes up, she finds herself more drawn to him. But love and desire aren't enough for Brandon to sire her. He must first obtain the approval of his own sire, an ancient vampire named Vasilije who has thwarted his chance for happiness before. But if Brandon can convince him, he may finally find the love he's been without for centuries.",
