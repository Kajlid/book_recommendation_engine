  "description": "Another sweet & steamy read from New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Skye Jordan!Some women want roses and I love yous. I want hot guys and great sex.Maybe I've absorbed too much testosterone employed in the male dominated world of mechanics, only, I'm no longer working on a cruise ship with sexy men around every corner. I'm building a business with my two best friends in a small town where reputation is everything.But it’s only six months before I can take my money and run--straight back to the sea. Only this time I'll have my own sailboat, choose my own destinations, and live by my own rules.When I meet Dr. Delicious over stitches, we've got instant heat, but he comes with major drawbacks, starting with an affinity for dating and ending with his status as a single dad.Before I know it, I'm putting together a frilly \"dream bed\" for Christmas and teaching his oldest to repair a carburetor.Dr. Delicious is the very definition of commitment, and falling for him is a non-negotiable no way.Too bad my heart hasn’t gotten that memo.",
