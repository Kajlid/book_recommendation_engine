  "description": "Like it or not, you’re a part of my life now, and I’m a part of yours. I don’t know what to say here. I get that a lot. Miller Cassidy didn’t need one more complication. So when Eliza Sullivan pops up in his life, he's worried. What if he can’t trust her? He has one goal- to get to know her and find out if she’s another obstacle in his path. Eliza Sullivan just wanted to get through detention. And she almost did…except for the part where she freaked out and threw up. Luckily, no one’s in the room to see her…or so she thinks. She’s mortified to discover Miller Cassidy saw everything. What she doesn’t know is that this is just the beginning. As the two embark on a friendship that quickly turns into more, they find out what it really means to trust. But when Miller’s life catches up with him, it threatens to hurt them both. What’s Eliza willing to do to protect him? And what will Miller do when it all comes crashing down? I don’t want to hurt you. I know. And I think I might. I know.",
