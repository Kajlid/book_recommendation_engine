  "description": "After getting kicked out of school and sent to live with her grandmother, Sabine Rose is determined to become a \"normal\" teenage girl. She hides her psychic powers from everyone, even from her grandmother Nona, who also has \"the gift.\" Having a job at the school newspaper and friends like Penny-Love, a popular cheerleader, have helped Sabine fit in at her new school. She has even managed to catch the eye of the adorable Josh DeMarco. Yet, Sabine can't seem to get the bossy voice of Opal, her spirit guide, out of her head . . . or the disturbing images of a girl with a dragonfly tattoo. Suspected of a crime she didn't commit, Sabine must find the strength to defend herself and, later, save a friend from certain danger.",
