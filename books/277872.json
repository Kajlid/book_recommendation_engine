  "title": "Final Moments: Nurses' Stories about Death and Dying",
  "description": "What was it like the first time a nurse witnessed death? How do nurses cope with death when it becomes almost routine? What lessons can we learn from their experiences? Twenty-five nurses-from hospitals, private practices, and in home health care-tell about their experiences with death. Hear from people new to the field as well as those who have been in nursing for decades about how they deal with grief, the controversies about end-of-life decisions, the challenges of caring for people as they die, and the harrowing experience of telling their family members. Edited and introduced by a registered nurse, the book is a resource for both nurses and anyone who wants to better understands death and dying.",
