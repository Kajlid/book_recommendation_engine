  "title": "Terminal Decline: A Surgeon's Diagnosis of the Australian Health-Care System",
  "description": "Tackling the riveting and extremely topical subject of the healthcare system in Australia, Dr. Mohamed Khadra incisively shows how Australian hospitals came to be stifled by bureaucracy; and discusses whether they can and should administer universally free health care to the population. He also peppers his history with examples of real people he has treated, and why some have had to suffer so profoundlyâ€”patients whose lives and health he should have been able to improve, but who have become stuck in a system that has made their lives considerably worse. Heath care is an incredibly emotive topic that everyone has an opinion on. With the release of Prime Minister Rudd's proposed reforms at the beginning of 2010, this book is a timely reminder of how they may or may not help resuscitate a system that is in crisis.",
