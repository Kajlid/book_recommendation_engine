  "description": "Bored with the privileges and duties of a member of the first family, Ferro finds himself in the slave tents as a consequence of his antics, knowing he’ll be rescued before long. At least, that’s the way it’s always worked before. This time, though, Ferro finds himself sold as a sheep-tender along with an intriguingly mysterious slave called Lisias. For the first time, Ferro’s met someone who seems immune to his wiles, and he’ll soon learn that Lisias has more to teach him than just shepherding.",
