  "title": "Buddha's Smile Poems on Zen Living and Mindful Way of Life",
  "description": "This book is a bunch of poems on mindfulness and the essence of Buddhahood. The themes move around Buddha's teachings on mindful living, the Buddha way, joy of mindfulness, and realization of our true nature. The profound but gentle wisdom encased in these poems will help readers to arrive at greater self-understanding and peacefulness. Why such a name -'Buddha's smile'? Buddha's smile was not an ordinary smile. It was an emblem of his enlightened heart after he attained Buddhahood. This smile was the reflection of his compassionate heart that reached to thousands of suffering beings in his lifetime as it continues to reach millions and will reach many more in the ages to come. Buddha's smile is magical, transforming lives and enlightening the hearts of all sentient beings suffering in the darkness of ignorance. The theme of the book is seeing life and feeling its pulse with the eyes and the heart of the Buddha. Banani Rayâ€™s deep understanding of Zen and Buddhist philosophy is reflected in her poems. The poems on emptiness and love are particularly heart-touching. Whatever our religious beliefs, the simple compassionate lucidity of her expressions will inspire us to culture and reap the benefits of mindfulness in our life. The poems in this book may lighten your heart and inspire you on your path of mindful living in your daily life and in the journey of realizing your Buddha Nature.",
