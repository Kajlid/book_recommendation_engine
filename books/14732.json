  "description": "Convictions is Julie Morrigan’s bestselling debut novel. Published in 2011, it featured in the Grift Magazine readers’ survey of the best books of the year, and was voted one of the top five books of the year at the Crime Fiction Lover website. A stolen child. A family devastated by loss. A man of God. When 12-year-old Tina Snowdon and her little sister Annie gratefully accept a lift from a helpful stranger, she has no way of knowing that only one of them will make it home. As days turn into weeks with no news of Annie, Tina must face her mother’s anger; she would do anything to turn back the clock. As her life is torn apart by pain and recrimination, the only evidence the police have points to George Cotter, a respected pillar of the local church. But as the investigation continues, it seems that perhaps a deeper and more disturbing truth may lie behind Annie’s abduction. And until Tina learns what that truth is, she will always be the little girl who escaped, only to be imprisoned by her own grief and guilt.",
