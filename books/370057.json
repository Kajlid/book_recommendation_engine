  "description": "Discover the single greatest secret to a successful marriage!Â  Psychological studies affirm it, and the Bible has been saying it for ages. Cracking the communication code between husband and wife involves understanding one thing: that unconditional respect is as powerful for him as unconditional love is for her. Itâ€™s the secret to marriage that every couple seeks, and yet few couples ever find. Today, you and your mate can start fresh with the ground-breaking guidance that Dr. Emerson Eggerichs provides in this audio book. His revolutionary message, featured on Focus on the Family, is for anyone: those in marital crisis... wanting to stay happily married... who feel lonely. Itâ€™s for engaged couples... victims of affairs... pastors and counselors seeking material that can save a marriage.",
