What Dane finds in the woods is not quite the problem he a group of dragon kits and their sick father.  When he learns the real reason the family was in the woods, his case only grows more dangerous, and while Dane is plenty experienced at watching his own back, taking care of baby dragons and their handsome, distracting father almost makes danger look easy.",
