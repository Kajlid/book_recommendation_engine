  "description": "Do you wonder why, as a citizen, it seems that you are no longer represented? Do you wonder why half the nation is incensed no matter who is the President? Do you wonder why the nation feels so politically divided? Do you wonder why people in this country are polarized and enmity between each side is on the rise? Do you wonder why people in the media speak in many tongues providing different “truths?” Do you wonder why our politics have become a matter of name calling, closed-door maneuverings and political persecutions rather than a matter of respectful debate between parties of mutual respect and good intent? Do you wonder why we seem to be reaching for solutions, not through democratic processes, but through intrigue, hatred and violence? You have the right book in your hands right now - As we must set about to actually “know” our nation as she is… at this pivotally important moment. “Shadows of the Acropolis: Volume II” helps readers understand our nation as she is … at this pivotally important moment.",
