  "description": "Will Ashby was never supposed to end up in Paradise. The hazy New England town has been off-limits to him for as long as he can remember. But just as he begins his first year of college, he’s forced to live with a grandmother he’s never met, in a home where he’s unwelcome, and with a list of rules longer than the train ride from North Carolina.  The most important rule? Never go near the neighboring house on the hill. It’s an order that’s easy to follow—until Will meets the mysterious stranger living there.  Gorgeous and undeniably intriguing, Roman Price knows better than to go near Nan Ashby’s grandson. After all, it’s an uneasy peace that allows him to stay in Paradise undetected. But Roman finds it impossible to stay away from Will, and the more he resists their connection, the more Will is determined to understand why.  Soon, Roman’s past comes calling, and when Will finally discovers what Roman is hiding, he’ll wish those secrets had stayed buried in Paradise.",
