  "description": "When Lessi Decker finds her marriage crumbling as much as her house that's under construction, there is nothing to do but ask Carlos Oller, the Puerto Rican contractor, to step in. Carlos shaves his head, sports tattoos and makes her melt with his signature dimple and full lips. He is everything her husband is not. Carlos agrees to take on Lessi's home renovation to keep his workers and company afloat. Having to deal with an opinionated, artsy woman comes with the job. When his work turns from pouring cement to keeping an eye on the dark-haired bella, he knows he's in trouble. She picks the flooring, he picks the dinner. She drives him mad while he tempts her fate. It's an unlikely match that is most inconvenient but highly desired.",
