  "description": "Leroux has spent his life having everything handed to him – everything except the hand of the alluring Beauty, which he covets above all else. When Beauty is “kidnapped” by a Beast, Leroux sets out to reclaim what he feels is rightfully his from the frightful monster, but when the unexpected occurs, Leroux discovers that not all monsters take the form of a Beast. A fast-paced, reflective Fairy-Tale retelling in the tradition of the Grimm’s Tales, The Beauty of the Beast is a dark visit to the land of possibilities.",
