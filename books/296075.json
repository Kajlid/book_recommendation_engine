  "description": "For over six years, Rania Al-Baz was the smiling face of a family program on Saudi television. She was a young, beautiful Saudi TV news anchor-the first woman to have such a job-when her abusive husband beat her into a coma and left her for dead. She later underwent thirteen operations to reconstruct her face. When she agreed to make horrifying pictures of her ravaged face public, her story sparked general criticism of Saudi culture. A month later, the first Saudi research into domestic violence began at King Saud University in Riyadh.",
