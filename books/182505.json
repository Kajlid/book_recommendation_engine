  "description": "For three years, ballet teacher Natalie Taggart has lived across the hall from grumpy, reclusive, sexy Greer Wilde. Save for a handful of hellos and the occasional heated glance, they never spoke to each other. Until the morning Greer lands on her doorstep, bleeding, beaten, and bullet-riddled. Greer doesn’t need or want her help. He has only one revenge. And nobody—not his brothers, and certainly not his too-hot-for-his-sanity next-door neighbor—is going to get in his way. Each book in the Wilde Security series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order.Series Book #1 Wilde Nights in ParadiseBook #2 Wilde for HerBook #3 Wilde at HeartBook #4 Running WildeBook #5 Too Wilde to Tame",
