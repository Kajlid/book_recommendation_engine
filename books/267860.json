  "description": "I've never had a problem getting the girl, until Mallory. Her resistance might have something to do with my incoherent introduction and the pickup line I used. But come on, who doesn't love a bull rider? Okay. So, maybe I didn't make the best first impression but that's what second chances are for. Right? I don't know what it is about Mallory, but I've got to have her. I need to get to know her. Who knows, maybe she will be the one to finally settle me down. There's just one problem, I've only got a few weeks to win Mallory over before she flies back to Florida and the odds are stacked against me. But I think I can do it. I am Beau Cooper after all.",
