  "description": "In the second book in the Wolves of Icaria series, Kent remains an oversexed and entirely rebellious young werewolf jockeying for position in the Icarian pack. His refusal to shift into wolf form continues to bring derision from his peers and when the pack's imposing beta wolf makes an unexpected return, Kent finds himself suffering even more under the watchful eyes and firm hands of his elders.The only bright spot on the horizon is a business trip with dominant alpha Stavros, but a simple jaunt soon turns out to provide a strong clue to the mystery of Kent's heritage. The misbehaved whelp may just have claim to a powerful lineage, but power is not always desirable, especially when there are those who guard it jealously.Kent struggles against the alpha's control and his own wolf nature often end up costing him more than he cares to pay, but accepting his true nature could result in even more dire consequences, not just for the young Englishman but for all the wolves of Icaria.",
