  "description": "Everyone in the village of Badstein knows how to eliminate the vampire preying on its young daughters: Find the coffin he sleeps in during the day and drive a wooden stake through his heart. But how can you find you quarry if you don't know who he is and your suspects are many. There's a dark-complexioned Latour, given to wandering at night and sleeping during the day. . . and handsome Baron Meinster, supposedly traveling in the Orient but rumored to be hiding in his ancient chateau. . . and the stranger, Professor Van Helsing . . . it could be anyone.Meanwhile, the victims multiply - all female, all young, and all marked with the telltale sign of the vampire. This is the first volume of \"The NightMare Series\" from noted film historian and author, Philip J Riley. The purpose of the series is to preserve the 50s and 60s Horror Film, movie tie-in novels that are printed on old crumbling pulp paper; to bring them in this new format for a new century. These are the original novels by various authors, not the scripts as in the editor's \"Filmonster Series\" and the MagicImage Filmbook series.",
