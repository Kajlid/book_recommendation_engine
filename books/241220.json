  "description": "***ARC REVIEWERS*** The arc was sent out before the final proof came back from my proofreader. All typos, errors have been fixed for the live version. Thank you for understanding:)Kids adore him.Women pant after him.When he kisses her—she hears the angels sing.But single mom Kate Gilletti has her hands full as it is. Falling for the hunky single-dad every woman in town is hot for—is not on her Christmas list.So what, if the looks he gives her could melt the North Pole? She has no plans to get involved with another man who looks like sin on a stick.But maybe this Christmas, Kate will learn that some men are totally worth melting for.Authors note: This is meant to be a yummy, funny and sexy holiday read that will leave you feeling all mushy and gooey... like a melting piece of chocolate Santa stuffed into a stocking hanging on a mantel on Christmas Eve. No Cheating, HEA with plenty of fire to melt those Kindles. I hope you fall in love with Gianni just as Kate did!",
