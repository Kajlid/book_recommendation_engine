  "description": "A new town, a new school, a new start. That's what fourteen-year-old Gray Wilton believes as he chants, \"It's gonna be better, gonna be better here.\" But it doesn't take long for Gray to realize that nothing's going to change--there are bullies in every school, and he's always their punching bag. Their brutal words, physical abuse, and emotional torture escalate until Gray feels trapped in a world where he has no control, no support systems, and no way out--until the day he enters the halls of Greenford High School with his father's semiautomatic in hand.Award-winning novelist Nancy Garden, author of the groundbreaking novel Annie on My Mind , once again goes out on a limb, this time to show readers the cruelty of bullying and the devastating effects it can have.",
