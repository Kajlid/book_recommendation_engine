  "description": "Can be read as a standalone.At sixteen, Hunter Nolan became my foster brother. At twenty-three, he’s the only one I call family. He’s been my protector since we aged out of the system, getting me jobs, convincing me to apply for school, covering my half of the rent when money falls through. He even plays impromptu bodyguard when staff is short at the club where I dance. But he’d never ask me to quit. Hunter has his own sinful job, after all. The Eros app has taken the adult industry by storm, and Hunter is one of Eros’s top erotic models. Sex is a part of both our careers. It doesn’t become weird until Hunter’s boss, the ambitious and entrepreneurial Britain McCulley, sees me dancing and wants to hire me. The money is too good to turn down, even if it means pairing with Hunter for the sexiest shoots Eros has ever produced.Even if it means falling for the one guy completely off limits.",
