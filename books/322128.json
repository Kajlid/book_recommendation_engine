Faith is in danger.Faith is a naturalist and ranger at Silver Mountain. \"Sublime\" means both beauty and danger and she's surrounded by it on a daily basis. The breathtaking vistas are truly wonders from God, though its hard to live in such a solitary wilderness by herself, When trouble heads her way because of her brother's seedy past, Faith is dragged away by a man who says he's there to keep her from getting killed.Does Faith have it in her to trust a brooding stranger? Goodness! He's sublime incarnate, isn't he? Apparently she's a sucker for his kind of beauty and danger, especially when her life... and heart depend on it.",
