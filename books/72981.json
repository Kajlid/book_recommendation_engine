Here she will encounter many unexpected dangers and unusual creatures. However, none could be stranger than Plopbottle, a timid goblin who longs to escape to the surface – although his fantasies of topside life are a little out of date (he still thinks that glitter balls, roller-discos and dodgy 70’s lapels are the latest thing).In time they will learn about the construction of a vast war machine, which will eventually rise from the earth taking the heart the capital with it.Together this unlikely duo will have to find a way to stop the machine, which threatens to engulf the world in a planet wide war, and at the same time take on a ruthless king and rescue Angelica’s schoolmates before they are baked alive inside a giant pie.",
