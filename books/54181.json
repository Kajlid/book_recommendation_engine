  "description": "Scribbles is a collection of short poems, extended poems, proetry, haiku, and senryu, with a twist of Volatalistic Phil.\"...It can't be found in solid colors, stagnant or even dried-up streams; and there certainly are no deserts as vast as the human being; the empty place that can be felt but not seen...\"\"...But as a warning indication I must tell you this is the substation for my frustration, the dirty needle of my hesitation, the loss of words of a failed relation...\"\"...And lined up against the wall, this firing squad launches from my mind's tongue. Oh, the ecstasy, this moment, at a loss, eternity...\"\"...And the plants, they crave sunlight, the night creatures want moonlight, the hot desires cold, the cold wants what the hot can bestow, the rivers desire the land, and the land wants the bodies of water, the mother regards the sons and daughters, the fathers desire all the strength they can trotter, the bird wants the worm, the worm wants the dirt, the dirt wants the rain, silence wants to scream, the man chases the dream, and death wants the living!...\"\"...The cracks in the floor, the spiders in my head, the monster in my closet--the waiting to be fed, the scratching and clawing, the snarling and gnawing will wear me out, so in writing I'm giving you my warning shout...\"Adult audience intended.",
