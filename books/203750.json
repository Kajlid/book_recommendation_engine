But her star burned too bright for the men in her past, and she's sworn off relationships, complications, and above all…actors.

His personal life comes with a six-year-old, a gold-digging ex…and a raging crush on his luscious new costar. She thinks they're too different. He thinks opposites attract. But the world is watching—and judging—their every move. In Hollywood, appearances are more important than reality. And everyone has a hidden agenda. Can the Funny Girl and It Boy combine their star power and live happily ever after?Or will the bright lights of Tinseltown blind them to what's right in front of them?",
