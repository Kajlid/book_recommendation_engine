  "description": "BOBBI DAVIS has a secret friend, an imaginary friend, or maybe not. A little girl that has been with her since she was a child. Now a mother of three, with daughter JAZMINE, and twins JAHLIL and JAHMEER, she finds herself in a dilemma, to either continue ignoring the girls request for help, or support her. The twins wait patiently for their mother to begin her tales of the things that went on at the house where she lived with her parents. At first, Bobbi refuses to participate, then, at the coaxing of the twins, reluctantly agrees. When it was time to return, the twins asked to see the house. Bobbi agrees to a drive by, but they wind up stopping and parking in front of the house. Although boarded up downstairs, the upstairs was not and you could see the inside. The twins want to go inside. Bobbi gives them a firm no and forbids them to return. After watching, their mother struggle with the past and the entity that continually seeks her out, they seek the help of their uncle, a Philadelphia Detective, in finding out what happened in the second-floor apartment of the house on Galloway Rd. Along with some friends, their uncle, and paranormal friends of their uncle, they enter the house. Bobbi calls for ANGEL, the apparition that appeared to her as a child. Angel appears for a moment, then shouts, 'She's coming.' And then . . . .",
