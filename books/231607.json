  "description": "There are strange things out there. Things I thought only existed in fairy tales.My name is Kailani Ericson and my life pretty much sucks. My mother is an indentured servant in this lonely house, serving a hateful old woman who gets her kicks by terrorizing me. One of my few comforts is the sea in my backyard. Diving into its frigid depths is the one thing that makes me truly happy.Then he shows up, and my entire world shifts. Bryce Howell is gorgeous, every girl’s fantasy. He’s also arrogant, insolent, and strictly forbidden. But he’s not normal. He’s something different. Something magical. Our attraction to each other just may be my downfall.As it turns out, I’m not normal either. I am the stuff of myths and legends. Suddenly, my love of the sea and its pull on me make a lot more sense. They say legends never die, and I hope that’s true. There are those who want me dead, and if I can’t put a halt to my seemingly inevitable transformation, there will be nothing I can do to stop them.I love the sea, but ultimately, it might just be what kills me.",
