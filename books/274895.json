  "description": "Quinn Dedhem, wealthy Chicago playboy and chronic ne’er-do-well, arrives in the spring of 1858 in a divided New Orleans, following yet another incident in his life of bad behavior. Unfamiliar with the local customs and always susceptible to the whims of his unscrupulous father, he finds himself attached to a beautiful and beguiling woman who shows him everything he didn’t know he was missing.  Lucia Carmondy is the pampered daughter of a white southern lawyer and his mixed race mistress. Together with her siblings, she’s navigating a world full of absurd laws, family and societal traditions, and a religion that many outsiders find both mysterious and terrifying. Magnetically drawn to Quinn, the handsome and seductive northerner, the two embark on a love affair fraught with missteps and turbulence in a country on the brink of war.  With a smidgeon of humor, a dash of voodoo, and pretentious but sexy literary references, Quinn and Lucia learn that love doesn’t always come softly - sometimes it’s loud and raucous and fun and just a little bit illegal.",
