  "description": "The discovery of a traditional Welsh blanket in the palace of the former ruler of Yemen inspires this fascinating exploration of the link between Cardiff, once the world's biggest coal-exporting port, and Aden, where the coal that fueled the British Empire in Africa was bunkered. This narrative travels through mountain passes, deserts, ports, and the ancient cities of southern Arabia, encountering former seamen and remote communities in which stories of Cardiff loom large. As the journey progresses, this remarkable and timely account reveals the history of Yemen, a country at the center of Arab and world history, and the way in which two cultures touch each other.",
