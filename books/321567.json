  "description": "Rita Sterling, at the age of twenty-seven, was about to make the biggest mistake of her life, hoping to find the kind of love her parents shared until her mother was tragically taken away from them. She was about to settle for a man she thought she loved, searching for that special love. Rita was pure and innocent in every sense of the word, but that was about to change!

He extended his hand, reaching for hers. \"Forgive me for staring. I have never seen such a beauty before me!\" His voice came out coarse and dry. \"I am Vittorio delle Rose.\"",
