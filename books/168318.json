  "description": "\"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.\" Thus speaks W.E.B. Du Bois in The Souls of Black Folk, one of the most prophetic and influental works in American literature. In this eloquent collection of essays, first published in 1903, Du Bois dares as no one has before to describe the magnitude of American racism and demand an end to it. He draws on his own life for illustration, from his early experiences teaching in the hills of Tennessee to the death of his infant son and his historic break with the conciliatory position of Booker T. Washington.Far ahead of its time, The Souls of Black Folk both anticipated and inspired much of the black conciousness and activism of the 1960's and is a classic in the literature of civil rights. The elegance of Du Bois's prose and the passion of his message are as crucial today as they were upon the book's first publication.",
