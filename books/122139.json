  "title": "William Tell Told Again",
  "description": "Most children are familiar with the legend of William Tell, the Swiss hero who successfully shot a cross bolt through an apple placed on his son's head gaining his and his son's life from the evil Austrian, Gessler. William Tell Told Again by P.G. Wodehouse gives the legend new life. In this book the tale of Tell is retold, with variations. So much doubt has been cast on William Tell's doings-some going to the length of saying that he never existed--that the publishers feel that this book should be a valuable contribution to the history of the great archer, as showing what it was that he really did. This is the classic story of William Tell - Swiss patriot and great apple-shooter - as seen through the eyes of English humorist P.G. Wodehouse. No Swiss were (permanently) injured in the telling of this story; however, results differed for Austrian tyrants.",
