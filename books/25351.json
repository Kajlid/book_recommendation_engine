  "description": "Daniel and Claire Morrow are newlyweds with different pasts-Daniel lived a life of privilege while Claire was born into poverty. But yet, they fell in love. When they move to Manhattan from their Midwestern college in the days leading up to the Great Recession, the disparities in their background become more prevalent. Daniel struggles to succeed in the financial arena as the economy implodes, and Claire questions her ambitions as a dancer. As the foundation of their marriage and the romanticized ideas they brought to the city erode under the pressure, they're forced to question who they are becoming, both as individuals and to each other.",
