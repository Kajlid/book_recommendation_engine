  "title": "Passing on Bypass: Using External Counterpulsation : An Fda Cleared Alternative to Treat Heart Disease Without Surgery, Drugs or Angioplasgy",
  "description": "Over 58 million Americans have some kind of heart disease. Far too many people are unnecessarily forced into surgery or angioplasty when a safer alternative exists. This book describes External CounterPulsation, which is a painless, non-invasive, successful treatment for patients with heart disease and angina. Pressure cuffs wrapped around a patient's legs and hips squeeze the leg muscles in conjunction with the beating of the heart. The idea behind ECP (Medicare and insurance covered), is to boost blood flow to the heart through the natural growth of bypasses around arterial blockages. This amazing treatment even works in bypass failures.",
