  "description": "Roberta “Birdie” Radford is a fashionably independent spinster in the Antebellum South. While the term had a sad connotation to most, she had seen it as a secret freedom only some were lucky enough to achieve. Her younger sister, Annie, is the mirror opposite. She married the most eligible, wealthy bachelor in town, Earl. However, when wedded bliss soon becomes a prison, she tries to leave him. Their careful plan for Annie is ruined when Earl suspects her intentions. When Birdie finds Annie with Earl’s hands around her throat, slowly killing her, Birdie acts. The sisters say their last goodbye to Earl. Afraid of the ramifications of their crime, the sisters disguise themselves and go on the run.In rural Arkansas, they rent a cabin with the intent of keeping away from prying eyes. Their entire plan is thrown for a loop when their nosy neighbors take too much of an interest in their lives.",
