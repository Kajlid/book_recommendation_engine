  "description": "Cosplay. Anime. Manga. Shipping. Cons.Meet Alice Leira — geekette and fangirl extraordinaire. Donning a Hogwarts scarf, reading Tumblr metas in science class, drawing fanart of her favorite ships, Alice loves all things fandom. Especially the Winterland fandom. But in the social hierarchy of Charles Dodgson High, Alice's fangirl tendencies have made her a grade-A outcast. Excluded from the party of the year, Alice is left to write her Winterland fanfiction alone. But when a case of writer’s block strikes, she finds herself falling down a rabbit hole — and into the world of her fanfiction. Now, Alice must confront an evil Snow Queen, reunite her OTP, and navigate a whirlwind romance with her fictional crush — not to mention, find a way back to her own world. Being a fangirl has never been more complicated . . .A homage to fandom culture and geekdom, Alice in Winterland celebrates the nerdy side of life and encourages readers to take pride in who they are.",
