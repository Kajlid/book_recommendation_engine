  "description": "Librarian's Note: This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN B00JRC0BCYThings aren't going at all like Wilhelmina had planned. First, she shows up at, George, her significant other's office to surprise him with a romantic holiday getaway, but finds herself on the receiving end of a surprise herself, instead. Hurt, betrayed, pissed off and single now, Wilhelmina decides to take the trip alone, have her own holiday, just for one. Then things go from bad to worse when George shows up and can't take 'no' for an answer. In the midst of all this, something large, white, hairy and completely abominable shows up and decides to settle their dispute himself. The creature must have noted something of worth in the feisty, hot tempered, curvaceous beauty, stealing off with her, heading deep into the woods with his prize. Wilhelmina soon finds herself in the middle of a primitive looking camp of snowy white creatures, on some kind of alternate plane, realizing quickly that she's just unwillingly participated in what could only be deemed as 'a bridal hunt'. Is Wilhelmina fated to be an abominable snow beastie's bride? Or can she find her way back home before it's too late? Reader Advisory: This book contains one female partnering with multiple males(m/f/m/m/m)(no male/male) abduction and violence",
