Now that he’s back in town, he wants to come over to play. And I’m not talking hopscotch.  But he’s hurt me once, so I’m sticking to my side of the fence no matter how good he looks pushing that lawnmower in all his tanned, toned shirtless glory.   Samantha Trotten...

I've been to hell and back over the past few years. She doesn't even know the half of it.  But now, I'm back in town. And though I know I should keep my distance, all I want is a do-over...And I won't quit till I get it.
