  "description": "Nestled in the picturesque Rocky Mountains, lies the quaint town of Merryton, Colorado. You will never find finer people or better friends. But try keeping a secret in Merryton and you will soon find that the good townspeople are better than any private investigator or undercover journalist. The men and women of Merryton are like living barometers, and when a storm is brewing in the life of one of their own, they are sure to get to the bottom of it--and forecast it on the Merryton grapevine. Jessie Summers and her husband Blake just haven't connected since their baby was stillborn and they learned that Jessie couldn't have more children. And then Blake drops a bombshell-he fathered a child with Jessie's old roommate when they had broken up briefly. It was before they married thirteen years ago, but it's still devastating to Jessie, considering she'll never have a child of her own. But in the midst of the chaos and uncertainty, they discover that Madeline may just be what the doctor ordered to heal their broken hearts and mend their own tattered relationship.  Will they have the courage to look forward and find a greater love than they could ever imagine? Or will past hurts and the town grapevine tear them apart?",
