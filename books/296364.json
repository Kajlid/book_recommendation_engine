  "title": "Unreal: An Anthology Of Speculative Fiction: Volume 1",
  "description": "Each of the twenty stories is set in its own independent world. So this single book is your ticket to twenty diverse lands where mind-bending things happen! Speculative Fiction is a vast genre, but we have got delicacies from almost every subgenre. There's AI, magic, monkey gods, time travel, vampires, scary organisms, strange hidden-dimension particles, pirates, oppressive governments, ancient temples, weird futuristic tech . . . and of course aliens! These short stories (by the way, none of these are very short) are some really serious works of art. And since this is an anthology, you'll get to meet a bunch of some really terrific authors.Contents: ..* A Door for Miriam / short story by Jeff Sullins ..* The Hidden Entity / short story by John Campbell, IV ..* Monaro Goes on a Walkabout / short story by Steve Carr ..* The Runners / short story by Lorenzo Crescentini ..* Blood of the Swan (2011) / short story by Vonnie Winslow Crist ..* The Wizards of Snails and Woodlice / short story by David Donachie ..*The Garden / short story by James S.
