  "description": "Maditude is an honest, funny tale about how Paul Starsoneck’s early life shaped him for better or worse into the successful human being he is today. But it’s a lot more than that. It’s a comedy of errors about a young man from working-class Riverside, Rhode Island, climbing the class ladder while discovering social etiquette. It’s a college and work memoir, and finally it’s a love letter to Starsoneck’s beloved Boston Red Sox as well as to the grumpy and gritty characters and towns of Rhode Island",
