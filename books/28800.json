Isak agrees -- if she’ll spare O’Riley’s life. In their sensual lessons, he awakens his own dark animal -- and unleashes her feral passion.But there’s a hitch -- Patrick O’Riley, the charming blackguard she hunts, desires her too. What’s more, he also wants Isak. And to Isak’s surprise, the farmer finds he’s curious about the three of them together.Yet over their heads hangs the specter of Anna’s blackmailer -- her uncle, who wants Patrick dead. Knowing they must confront him and learn the truth, Anna, Isak, and Patrick embark on a journey that takes them over land and sea and pushes the boundaries of their turbulent relationship.
