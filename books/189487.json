  "description": "What would you do if you found yourself cast 22 years into the future? Into a world where your home is no longer your home and youâ€™ve been declared legally dead?  This is the situation that Daniel Fisher finds himself in at the beginning of this novel, the latest release in The Time Bubble series.  Stranded in the future, in a place where his outdated currency is worthless, things go from bad to worse for Dan very quickly. Before long he finds himself incarcerated in a secure psychiatric unit, his hopes of ever returning to the past looking bleak.  Elsewhere, Josh has unlocked the secrets of the time bubbles, and can now freely travel in time. He returns to the scene of past encounters, as well as travelling to the future to join Peter on his adventures through time. But has he been careful enough to prevent others from discovering his secrets?  This book concludes The Time Bubble trilogy, tying up all of the loose ends from the first two books, as well as linking in to the spin-off novel, My Tomorrow Your Yesterday.",
