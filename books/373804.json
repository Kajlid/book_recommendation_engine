  "title": "The Fight for Naturah: The Reclamation",
  "description": "When U.S President, Mark Ashton, leaves office in the winter of 2085, he is shocked as a cruise across the Pacific Ocean - with his wife Reanna and best friend Bobby Johnston - opens up a gateway to a dark and mysterious world. A world where two unique civilisations, the magical Naturahans, ruled by Queen Samoiyra, and the highly advanced Tekhnans, ruled by Cyphinium, are on the brink of war. As Mark begins to understand the complexities of this strange world, he soon finds out that a thousand year old treaty established to keep both races separate is about to be broken once more. With a fight for land and a special stone, known as Herminite, at the heart of the conflict, Ashton embarks on a quest to uncover the truth behind two murders shrouded in conspiracy, close to Queen Samoiyra's heart. Until the truth is set free, the only outcome is war.",
