  "description": "A unique blend of \"A Christmas Story\" and \"The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer.\" The year is 1961, and eleven-year-old David Duncan wants two things for a go-cart, and the girl of his dreams, Susie Sweeney. Unfortunately,, his Mom thinks go-carts are too dangerous, and Susie only has eyes for David’s best friend, Veto. Mix in a Sky-Diving Santa, guidance from The Gasket King, a bully, an abusive Principal and a family dog that humps anything with a leg, and you’ve got a story that could only happen “Once Upon A Christmas.”",
