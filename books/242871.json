  "description": "Ten years of heaven on earth dissolved in an instant for Cari McKenna when her husband Ben died. She knows she needs to be an inspiration for her young children, but she can't seem to shake her grief. The only moments she feels whole are when she's baking the cookies and quick breads her children love. With Thanksgiving fast approaching, Cari is dreading the thought of weathering the holidaysâ€¦until Ben's spirit visits with a special message just for her. If she can pour her energy into a holiday baking business, maybe she won't spend that time grieving for him. Cari finds it hard to imagine undertaking such a challenge, but she puts up flyers and business pours in. Is there a chance to make her own life as sweet as her cookies?",
