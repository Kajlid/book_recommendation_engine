  "description": "Pride and progress are the only things I’ve worried about since graduating medical school. Pride in the work that I’m doing, and the progress we are making a difference in the world. Risks are not part of the equation in my line of work, when I take risks people end up dead. I’ve taken so few risks in my life up to this point that when Callahan Reid shows up on my doorstep with an ultimatum, I take the risk and plan for the outcome. I know the side effect of this deal is heartbreak but what if forcing him to face his feelings is the cure? What if the boy I had a crush on in high school could end up being the man who forces me to risk it all?",
