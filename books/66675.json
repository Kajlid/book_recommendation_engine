  "description": "Nothing is quite as it seems. A US senator introduces a bill that could change the course of history - then his daughter vanishes. A woman wakes up on a riverbank with no idea who she is or how she got there. Three strangers meet, strangers whose lives appear to be entwined already, but why and how? Behind the scenes, powerful forces are at work, manipulating leaders and influencing the decisions of ordinary people. Only one person stands in their way, identity unknown. Will the mysterious forces be able to find and defeat their enemy before it is too late, or can a single warrior destroy their plans?",
