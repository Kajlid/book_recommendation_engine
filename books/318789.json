  "description": "He plays to win; only she changed the rules....As Manchester Athletic’s record signing, I should be basking in the adoration of fans and enjoying the perks that come with the job.Only that’s never been my style. I keep a low profile and stay focused on doing my job.A chance one-night stand on my way back from the States is about as anonymous as I can make it. She had no idea who I was, and I was pretty sure she gave me a fake name too. No numbers were exchanged, and we headed back to our so-called ordinary lives.The chance of a repeat should’ve been zero. Until we meet again in Manchester. Different names this time, but the same chemistry.Two people escaping their realities in anonymous hotels.It’s the perfect relationship until the media reveals our true identities to the world - and each other.Hollywood Ball is the second standalone in the Manchester Athletic series. It’s a fake identity, insta-lust, jet set romance with a super geek soccer player and a super-sassy heroine.",
