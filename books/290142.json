  "description": "I'm Valerie, a recently divorced CFO from LA. After discovering lesbian erotica, I joined an online book club and have been indulging in steamy novels ever since. A new chapter in my life starts when Syd, a fellow member I've been sharing a sexy online exchange with, invites me to her house in Quebec. It seems excessive to get on a flight for someone I don't know, but my curiosity wins over my deeply grounded sensibilities, and soon I find myself tangled in a web of discovery and raging desire.",
