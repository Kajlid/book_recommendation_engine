  "description": "Shunryu Suzuki is known to countless readers as the author of the modern spiritual classic Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind .  This most influential teacher comes vividly to life in Crooked Cucumber , the first full biography of any Zen master to be published in the West.  To make up his intimate and engrossing narrative, David Chadwick draws on Suzuki's own words and the memories of his students, friends, and family.  Interspersed with previously unpublished passages from Suzuki's talks, Crooked Cucumber evokes a down-to-earth life of the spirit.  Along with Suzuki we can find a way to \"practice with mountains, trees, and stones and to find ourselves in this big world.\"",
