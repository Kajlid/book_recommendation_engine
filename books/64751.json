  "description": "Another Posadas County mystery with Estelle Reyes-Guzman as the undersheriff, but with the ever more popular Bill Gastner peering out of the wings to which he dispatched himself upon retirement. Estelle's new job continues to be far from easy, and now she is faced the death of a young woman on a motorcycle - a death that could have been caused by improper driving from one of the county's traffic officers when he tried to stop her for speeding. But there is more than meets the eye, Gastner is there to help, but Estelle can go far to cope. This series continues to gain readers, thanks partly to the resurrection of the older books by Poison Penn Press.",
