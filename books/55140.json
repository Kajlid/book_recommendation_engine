  "description": "thriller/sports Sports writer Paul Tenkiller and pro-football player Chesty Hake have been roommates for eight seasons. Paul's Choctaw background of poverty and his gambling on sports, and Hake's dark memories of his mother being killed are the forces which will make their friendship go horribly wrong. Chesty Hake, the last man chosen in the draft, has been dubbed Mr. Irrelevant. By every yardstick, he should not be playing pro football. But because of his heart and high threshold for pain, he preservers. Paul Tenkiller has been on a gravy train. Gleaning information vital to gambling on football, his relationship with Hake is at once loyal and deceitful. Then during his eighth and final season, Hake slides into paranoia and Tenkiller is caught up in the dilemma. Paul is behind the curve, and events spiral out of his control, until the bloody end comes in murder and betrayal. Football will never be viewed the same again.",
