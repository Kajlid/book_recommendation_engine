  "description": "ANGEL I know what you're whispering in the car as you pass me by. Hitchhiker. When you see me walking along the side of the road with my thumb out, you'll probably keep driving without giving me a second glance. You probably think I'm foolish. Naïve. You might assume I've made some bad decisions. You might think I'm too young to be on my own. You might be right.TRAVIS I love my job, but driving an eighteen-wheeler comes with a certain stereotype. When you hear I’m a trucker, a specific image might come to mind. Uneducated. Dirty. Perverted. Rough around the edges and a little bit dangerous. But the truth is, I’m not any of those things. In fact, I’m pretty far from it. You’d be surprised to find out I’m one of the good guys.Although TRUCKER is the first book in the Good Guys series, it can be enjoyed as a standalone. Due to language and sexual content, this book is intended for readers 18 and older.",
