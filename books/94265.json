  "description": "Written with the intention of breaking fantasy conventions, and influenced by contemporary social turmoil, D.W. Craigie presents Broken Volume I of Through Darkness Tall. After two centuries of relative peace, a war of religion and long-standing hatred between the nations of Carodan and Norizaad is set to reignite. Amidst this conflict are those willing to use the chaos of war to their advantage, and those simply trying to survive. Kailen Tidespinner has served the Cardanan Legion his entire adult life, but the scars of service in an un-tamed and brutal frontier haunt his dreams. Hoping to find escape, he turns to drink, only to be reminded that nothing erases the past. He is starting to question the nation he serves, as he sees a small ruling elite living off the hard work and bent backs of the common population. Carra Nightsong, Tidespinner’s lover and friend, attempts to balance their life-long connection against the increasing stress of his prolonged absences, the growing discontent that haunts his actions, and her own attempts to numb the loneliness of their relationship. Morrikii Stonestriker, an exiled revolutionary who failed to reform Carodan in his youth and was banished for his insurgency, is determined to return home. He has the best intentions for his people, but will go to any length to achieve his goals, even if it means returning to Carodan at the head of a Noriziem army. Skal Rend’arr watches from the shadows. He weighs the agony brought upon his people, the Grenar, by the Cardanans decades ago against the realization that something much darker threatens both races. Should the wrongs of the past decide the fates of both nations? Can he make that judgment?",
