  "description": "Chances are the warm fuzzies aren't what you will get when you pick up Ignorance, Thy Name Is Bucky . Instead, you'll get LOL moments as Darby Conley pumps hilarity into living the single life with pets.The family Rob Wilco, the tallest member of the family, is a single, mild-mannered ad executive who pays the bills and often the price, thanks to his curious and anthropomorphic housemates. Rob gives guidance and all sorts of \"material\" to Bucky, a temperamental cat, who clearly wears the fur pants in the family. Satchel, a good-hearted pooch, plays neutral, but usually ends up on the receiving end of Bucky's mischief.\"Thanks for Get Fuzzy , the funniest comic strip on planet Earth. Sweet-natured Satchel Pooch and the utterly crazed Bucky B. Katt are much more fun than Odie and Garfield.\" --Stephen King, Entertainment Weekly* Three Get Fuzzy collections have become New York Times Bucky Katt's Big Book of Fun , Blueprint for Disaster , and Say Cheesy .* Recognized as Best Comic Strip in 2002 by the National Cartoonists Society.",
