  "description": "Sardine is back, and she's got a whole host of new problems to face even before the spaceship Huckleberry can get off the ground! In the fourth volume of this exciting series, Sardine must tackle, among other things, monsters under the bed, flesh-eating tattoos, time machines, and even boredom. As always, Supermuscleman, Chief Executive Dictator of the Universe, lurks in the background, trying―unsuccessfully and incompetently―to make Sardine and her crew behave.",
