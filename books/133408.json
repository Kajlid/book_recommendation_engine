  "description": "Alaina Mathers—a pretty typical girl, fond of literature and delving into her own psyche to find even the most minute defect. . . Because, yes, she has depression. That is to say, according to her mom, therapist, and the rest of the medical industry. Does anyone else know about this though? No. Not her best friend. Not her school. But maybe the boy who also frequents the counseling center, a boy with his own problems. When the therapist gives advice to reach out of her circle—her rather small circle. . . it starts a turn of events. It brings the two teens together in a way Alaina could have never anticipated. As they try to help each other through their situations, it opens a whole new group of people into Alaina's life. But with her own brain against her, is that going to be enough?",
