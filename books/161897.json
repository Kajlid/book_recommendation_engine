Is Lexi more afraid of her father, or of missing out on love?  EXCERPT:   “I’m coming, I’m coming,” I yelled, and pulled on a bathrobe over my pajamas before opening the door.  “Glad you finally decided to grace us with your presence, you lazy little whore,” my father said.  I didn’t roll my eyes, even though I wanted to. I was running out of makeup.",
