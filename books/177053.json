  "title": "Weltenbrand: Worlds Aflame",
  "description": "It is the beginning of the 22nd century. Mankind has left the cradle. New technologies allow humanity to push ever deeper into the void and exploit the resources of the solar system. But with new frontiers come new conflicts. Old and new Great Powers are locked in a constant struggle for dominance in the solar system. The peace between them is maintained only by a delicate balance of power. All it takes is one spark to light the fuse. A small incident near the Moon starts a war between China and the US that quickly grows to engulf the entire world in flames and spread to the distant corners of the solar system. For the first time in history, battles are fought on the Moon, on Mars and beyond. The conflict rages from the plains of Poland to the wastes of Mare Imbrium, from deep space to the endless desert of the Tharsis Highlands. The stakes are higher than ever. The victors will rule the solar system. The vanquished will be ground underfoot. Weltenbrand is a 200,000 word novel of war in the far future. From the perspective of Generals and politicians directing it to the view of the soldiers who have to fight it, this story shows how war has changed in the year 2114 - and how it hasn't.",
