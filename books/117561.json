  "description": "William \"Kid\" Collins was once a respected boxer. Now he's a drifter, on the run after escaping from a mental institution.  One afternoon he meets Fay, a beautiful young widow. She is smart and decent -- at least when she's sober.  Soon Collins finds himself involved in a kidnapping scheme that goes drastically wrong almost before it even begins. Because the kid they've picked up isn't like other kids: he's diabetic and without insulin, he'll die. Not the safest situation for Collins, a man for whom stress and violence have long gone hand-in-hand.",
