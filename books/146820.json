  "description": "What happened? How did we get here? Those are the two main questions that have been asked since we all realized we were no longer in Kansas. Us, our homes, streets, buildings, cars, I guess pretty much everything came with us, too. Which also leaves us the questions - what did we leave behind and how are we going to survive? When it started, most were outside looking to the sky. It was tornado season and watching for tornados is how most people passed the time. Seriously, it was that or watch the wheat grow – which do you think you would do? Small town life is great in some ways, but entertainment is not one of them. Try being a 17 year old in a town of 1000 that has one grocery store, one convenience store, a library, 9 churches and 3 bars. You take your entertainment were you can find it. Especially if you are like me; I don't have a lot of friends, let alone a boy friend. I am one of those kids that spend my time with my head either in front of a computer or buried in a book. I’m sure you know the kind – the ones that seem nice enough, but you don’t really know? Yea, that's me. I don’t know if that has made all of this easier or harder on me. I was lucky enough to have one of my friends hanging out with me that afternoon. He knew how scared I was of storms, so he stopped by to keep me company. I don’t know if I should feel guilty that I’m so happy he is here, but I don’t. I’m just glad someone is with me.Everyone always said that we were safe from tornados. Some Indian legend about the way the creeks crossed or something. I, for one, thought they might be right. Our little town had been in the same place for over 140 years without getting hit, so really, what were the odds of it happening now, right?",
