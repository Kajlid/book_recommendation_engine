Now, he’s the man on my mind.Our paths haven’t crossed in over a decade when I find myself back in Boston, desperate to save face in front of my ex-fiancé. With a devilish smirk and wicked blue eyes, Austin steps back into my life to be my plus one for a summer filled with weddings and events. Should be fun and effortless, right? Then why the need for rules?And why do I crave his touch at the small of my back and wish for his kiss on a moonlit beach? Suddenly, things begin to feel complicated, messy, and real. When I look at my first friend, I don’t see the boy-next-door, but the man I want to spend forever with.If Austin learns the depth of my feelings, will he give us a real chance? Or are some rules better left unbroken?",
