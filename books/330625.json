  "description": "A beautifully paced supernatural thriller for our times in which a malignant spirit returns from the dead seeking immortality. A young lady is in mortal danger, but events are not what they seem. 700 years ago, Margar sought immortality and kept herself young by draining the life force of children. Caught, she was killed and buried, her spirit imprisoned for eternity. In the present day, her spirit is accidentally released. Weak from centuries of internment, she seeks to recover her powers at the same time searching for a new body to inhabit. Her presence causes sickness and tension in the lives of Mark and Eva, newly weds. Yet, all is not as it seems. Mark is behaving strangely, Eva is unwell, what is going on? Where is Margar? And what is she up to? Worried by Eva’s decline in health, Eva’s friend Ruth persuades Brendan Murphy, a reluctant ghost hunter to take a look. He finds Margar but also finds himself in a difficult situation, surrounded by disbelief, antagonism and unwanted desires. Can he break through it all, can he work out what is really going on and can he save Eva?",
