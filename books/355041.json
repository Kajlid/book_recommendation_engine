  "description": "Odin--shamanic Scandinavian God of magic, poetry, and death--is the central figure in this collection of nine short stories written as a devotional offering to Him. Some of the tales in this book feature bold re-interpretations of familiar stories from Heathen lore such as the winning of the Mead of Poetry, the death of Balder, and Odin¿s sacrifice of self to Self on the World Tree, Yggdrasil, to obtain the runes. Others take the reader on absorbing new adventures. Edgy and provocative, this volume offers startling and insightful glimpses into Odin's nature, and is designed to help the reader draw closer to this multi-faceted God of light, shadows, and paradox.
