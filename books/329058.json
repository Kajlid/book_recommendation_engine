  "description": "My life was spinning out of control. A force was at work I could not understand. I was trying to put pieces together, to remember - some whisper of a memory, about my Dad, when I was young. I was broke, unable to go look for a job, down enough to think about ending my life, mystified as to why it was all happening, and then I got the call - come home, Dad is dying. \"Freedom's Just Another Word\" is a memoir, set in Houston, Texas, in 1987. It is a complex narrative of a spiritual journey; a compelling and uplifting perspective on self discovery, family dynamics, the grief process, and healing.",
