  "title": "The House of Four Seasons",
  "description": "This book is a feast of color - from the striking prism-patterned endpapers, to the last lovely double-spread picture showing the old house, with its big lawn enclosed by a garden wall, and the apple orchard just coming into bloom.In fact, the old house in its glistening new coat of paint looks so inviting that many readers may want to move right in with the family who bought it. But before the house was painted, Father, Mother, Suzy, and Billy each began imagining it a different color to go with the four seasons. And in the end, Father had to play some color tricks to get them to agree.These color tricks are not the only magic in The House of Four Seasons. Every page is touched with Roger Duvoisin's characteristic gaiety and charm, and will draw the children reading right into the enchanted circle of the family in the book. Ages 4-8",
