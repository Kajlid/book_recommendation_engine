  "description": "Here is a typical Stone Age family, reimagined by Roy Lewis in this hilarious novel as characters in some glittering drawing-room comedy. Father, who has a scientific turn of mind, has just discovered fire. Mother makes sure the children finish supper, even when the plat du jour is toad. Uncle Vanya thinks that the species has been flirting with disaster ever since it began to chip flint into tools. While little Alexander has gotten himself in deep trouble by making the first cave artists are always so misunderstood.Long out of print, The Evolution Man  would make Charles Darwin turn over in his grave. Lewis has written a witty, intelligent satire of the lives of our remote ancestors, complete with highly revisionist accounts of everything from the origins of courtship to the staples of Pleistocene cuisine. It's the funniest thing to happen to prehistory since Raquel Welch donned a fur bikini in One Million B.C.",
