When he signs up for every ski race in the White Oak/Harrington Winter Festival, Mary-Kate does too. Hans isn't the only super-athlete around -- and she's going to prove it! But then Mary-Kate gets into major trouble -- and is thrown off all the teams! Can Ashley help her sister get back on -- or is Mary-Kate out of the race for good?",
