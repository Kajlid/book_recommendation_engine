With no way to fight it, no way to go back, things are only looking to get worse fast.  Breaking protocol is cause for severe consequences in the time and world Levi Blackburn lives. But, after a year of government regulation, the crackdown is easing up and he begins to relax. Everything he's worked for is hinged on keeping his reckless brother in check. But, while he's been protecting Milo from falling under the government's ever-vigilant radar, his brother has been working on a surprise present for him, one that's the cat's meowâ€¦ Dani is that gift--a woman from the past that Levi has been fixated on.  Milo never anticipated having his brother's dream girl come to their time with a snarky cat that can not only talk but doesn't have a clue how or when to shut up!Formerly Book 1 of the Charmin Marvin series.",
