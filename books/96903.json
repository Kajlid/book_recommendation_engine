The Delicious Torment is a Story of O meets 9 1/2 Weeks coming-of-age tale fueled by lust longing and based on the author's personal diaries. The Delicious Torment takes readers to Sunset Strip way up in the sky in a penthouse apartment overlooking Los Angeles with a love affair ensconced in an S&M relationship filled with corsets crops and plenty of kink. In the introduction Tyler notes \"This is a novel with me at the center. That is my heroine is based on me. I've sketched her with broad strokes but at our core we are the same. She's gotten herself entwined with an older man -- nothing new there. But now she has to learn how to maneuver a 24/7 relationship.\"",
