  "description": "Beginning with Cider with Rosie, Laurie Lee writes evocatively of his idyllic childhood in the Cotswolds of the twenties, a world of rich sensuousness and native innocence. As I Walked Out One Summer Morning picks up the story as he leaves his valley for London and then for Spain. There, equipped only with a violin and his wits, he crossed the dramatic landscape of a vibrant and still almost medieval Spain for which he developed an abiding affection. In the winter of 1937 he returned to a country now in the grip of Civil War and joined the International Brigade, describing in A Moment of War his journey into the dark side of Spain with unsparing honesty and poignancy.Cider With Rosie: \"A prose poem that flashes and winks like a prism.\" - H.E. BatesAs I Walked Out One Summer Morning: \"The vivid, sensitive, irresistibly readable story of what happened after he left home.\" - Daily MailA Moment of War: \"A great heart-stopping narrative of one young Englishman's part in the war in Spain... crafted by a poet, stamping an indelible image of the boredom, random cruelty and stupidity of war.\" - John Sweeney in the Literary ReviewThe cover shows a portrait of Laurie Lee by Anthony Devas in the National Portrait Gallery, London",
