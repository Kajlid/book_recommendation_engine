  "description": "\"The war between life weavers and necromancers impacted these lands far more than anyone could have imagined. The war was said to have wiped out both races. But I believe survivors of both still exist. I have found several necromancers but have yet to find a life weaver and research about them is scarce. This has led me to believe that those who survived found a way to hide themselves.\" The five of them had grown up together. Ancient magick bound them as children. Friendship binds them as adults. But when the Princess of Father Willows is kidnapped, each one is pushed to use their gifts further than ever before. For the outcome of the battle that marches forward will be decided by the five. If the wrong side is victorious, an ancient black magick will devour the lands.",
