  "description": "What should feminists be fighting for? In this study Janet Radcliffe Richards demonstrates what she believes to be the precise nature of the injustice women suffer, and sets out to expose as fallacious arguments by which it has been justified. Her analysis leads her to considerable criticism of many commonly-held feminist views, but from it emerges the outline of a new feminism which sacrifices neither rationality nor radicalism.",
