  "description": "It's your worst nightmare: instead of being dead, you're alive! Seen from above, Dot is just another dot, barely distinguishable from a bug, a berry, or gum on the pavement. Up close, she has a magnificent but mysterious hubby, a collection of tea cosies swiped from old ladies, and the perfect face for her era: tight-lipped, pointy-nosed, pink-skinned, blonde-haired. She also has a Fatal Flaw. So Dot decides to End It All. But Dot BLOWS it! A hilarious and poignant journey through our puny universe, this is a masterpiece of disquiet - Lucy Ellmann at the height of her powers.",
