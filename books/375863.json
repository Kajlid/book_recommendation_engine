  "title": "Falling Star",
  "description": "Fifteen year old Katie Jenkins has what her grandmother called a \"gift\" - an ability to see things that others can't. Her grandmother taught her to harness her ability using Tarot cards, but after the old lady's death, Katie begins to realise there is more to it than just predicting the future. She meets a strange girl called Star, who has runaway to escape from an abusive home life, and is being followed at night by an evil shadowy figure called the Dark Man. He wants Star's soul, and Katie knows she must not let that happen, whatever the cost. Not fully understanding how, Katie must protect the physically and emotionally scarred Star from the Dark Man, and also help to bring out into the open the real reason Star left her home, before it is too late.",
