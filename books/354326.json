  "description": "The principles you live by today create the world you live if you change the principles you live by, you can change your world.In the life-changing tradition of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The Power Principle teaches the core principles that dramatically affect our careers and our lives. Dr. Blaine Lee, an extraordinary teacher, shows how principle-centered power is the ability to influence others' behavior, not to control, change, or manipulate it. Power is something other people feel in your presence because of what you are as well as what you can do, what you stand for, and how you live your life. When you honor others, they will honor you. Lee shows you how to overcome powerlessness, create legitimate power and influence with honor, and create a legacy that will outlast you in the lives of the people you care the most about.",
