When her girl-next-door fame prevents Avery from doing the in-depth research for the sensual role herself, her assistant insists on traveling to an exclusive couples resort to handle the job. But when her friend goes missing, Avery’s focus shifts from landing the role of a lifetime to finding out what happened on the sultry Caribbean island.A weekend that will change her life…Avery contacts Aegis Securities and hires one of their elite operatives to accompany her to the resort. She just doesn’t expect to get former undercover FBI agent Cade Blackwell—the man who ripped out her teenage heart twelve years before. Avery’s a good actress. With a little work and a convincing disguise, she’s confident she can fool the staff at the resort. The question is…can she fool Cade? Because one weekend at the sexiest resort in the world with the only man she’s ever loved will expose her to more than just a kinky new lifestyle. It’ll expose her to numerous wicked firsts that will test every ounce of her self-control. And if she’s not careful, she could lose her heart—and her life—in the process.",
