  "description": "“If the raw reality of stillbirth, loss of pregnancy, or miscarriage has rendered you senseless if you feel helpless in friending a grieving family, then you will be touched by the words of care and concern that you can't always think to say at the time. I highly recommend this unabashed account of Kalan Lloyd's journey toward wholeness.”-Susanna Fitzgerald, MSW \"A cry-laugh, laugh-cry. What makes it so good is how she conveys the terrible sadness and madness of losing a child.\"–Heath Mueller, M.D., Psychiatry “Kalan’s frank, honest expression of her personal experience will bring hope and encouragement to many.” –Lisa Nolan, Associate Pastor, Cornerstone Fellowship “Rarely as healthcare providers do we have the opportunity to hear the intimate thoughts and feelings of a patient who has been delivered the most heartbreaking news. This memoir will help us all be better friends, family members, and caregivers to those that have experienced such loss.” –Shara Young, M.D., OBGYN",
