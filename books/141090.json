  "description": "THE MANGLED SPOON is about what happens when evil finds a home in the Catholic Church. Cello-playing psychiatrist Marcus Rukeyser has a problem: Miss Jane, his newest patient is catatonic. Discovered foraging for food in a dumpster clutching a curiously damaged antique spoon, Rukeyser learns she’s connected to three dead or missing nuns from a prominent Chicago parish. With only two weeks until she’s committed to a state mental institution, authorities make it clear they'll go to any lengths to prevent him from uncovering the ugly truth—including destroying his career, his home and potentially his life. This novel by author Joan Mauch is by turns frightening and thought provoking.",
