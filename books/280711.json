From hidden bases within the ruins of scorched cities, she and others like her have become accustomed to a life of violence and terror.When Tasia's brother becomes ill and her family is ripped apart, she must leave all she knows in a desperate attempt to save him. Haunted by her failure to protect her loved ones, and burdened by powers she doesn't yet understand, Tasia finds herself on a daring journey she never intended to take ... with someone she never intended to care about.As the War for Earth rages, Tasia's path leads her across a wounded, imperiled planet. Aided by unexpected companions, she heads toward her greatest fears--unaware that she's no longer the hunter, but the hunted, and that her fate has become her foe.",
