  "description": "Remember the white feathers. Remember the thorns.  Hell leaves scars, even on the Devil. And when a human gets a glimpse into the Pit, they’re changed in a way that can’t be undone.  Even by love.  The gates to Hell are finally locked, but it’s too little, too late. When Lucifer’s bloody past is thrown into their present, he does the only thing he can think of to protect his newfound family.  He walks away.  There’s always another infernal creature to hunt in the streets of the Crescent City. Always another crisis. When Lucifer’s absence triggers a chain of events with devastating consequences, it’s Grace who pays the price this time.  Escape seems impossible, and deals with the Devil are the least of Grace’s fears now. The only path to freedom requires the help of a sworn enemy, and beneath it all, Grace is changing.  He lit the stars, and she is his sun.  But what happens when that light goes dark?  Warning: Grace contains dark themes and adult content and is recommended for readers age 18+.",
