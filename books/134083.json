  "description": "Her bright energy throws their lives into absolute chaos.She paints his world in a spectrum of colors he didn’t know existed.But she may just be his calm.Paisley. I was just trying to help. I can’t afford to add more to my plate. My office is opening a new location in Topaz Falls, Montana, and I’m the maid of honor at my best friend’s wedding. I still need to build the gazebo for the ceremony. When I told Trent’s ex the little white lie, I figured I’d never see her again. I don’t want to ruin Lachlan and Aislinn’s wedding so no one can know this relationship isn’t real. He’s always grumpy with more secrets than I can count, but maybe I can be the light that brightens his life. Even though I’ve never lived with a man, can I pull off a casual roommate with benefits arrangement for the next month, or will my heart shatter when the month is up? He told me not to fall for him, but I’m afraid that’s exactly what I’ll do.Trent. The DNA test kit sits prominently on my kitchen counter, taunting me with its mere existence. When Paisley announced we were not only dating but moving in together, I saw my life flip on its end. In one sentence, my quiet life as a single man went up in flames. I moved to the ranch to give myself more space and a shorter commute. I have too much going on in my personal life to give her more than a physical relationship. With my past and the possible ramifications of the test results, I can’t get involved with anyone emotionally right now. I’ll be the best man in Lachlan and Aislinn’s wedding and put my clients first at work, but I can’t be who she needs, and I don’t think I ever will.",
