  "description": "WINNER of the PACEM IN TERRIS PEACE AND FREEDOM AWARDThe Kurdish activist who became a global iconA powerful portrayal of a little school girl who defies Saddam Hussein's regime, survives Anfal Genocide and goes on to become an award-winning champion for human rights.By combining crisp prose with utterly enthralling storytelling, Widad pulls back the curtain to reveal in vivid detail and with unflinching honesty the experiences that have shaped her â€” from her childhood in Kurdistan region where she was doomed to persecution, to her years as a university student undertaking the grueling task of chronicling crimes against humanity when she was just 17 years old, to her phenomenal resilience in exile. The Daughter of Kurdland takes the reader on an intimate journey to uncover deep truths that are valid in any age but especially so in our present context. Sparkling with wit and wisdom, this book poses universal questions: Should we always do what others tell us to do? How important is it to defy norms? How much of ourselves should we be willing to compromise for the sake of others? And how much should we be prepared to pay?A profile in courage, Widad is today an international icon for peace and women empowerment, and is the youngest winner of the Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award, ranked among world-renowned figures like John F. Kennedy, Mother Teresa, Desmond Tutu and Dalai Lama. A testament to the power of human endurance, The Daughter of Kurdland will inspire and surprise men and women alike.",
