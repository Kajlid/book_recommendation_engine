  "title": "Connected Christianity: Engaging Culture Without Compromise",
  "description": "Connected Christianity is a clarion call to Christians to robustly engage with the world we live in for the sake of the gospel. It calls us to be both Christian AND worldly, surely an unnerving tension when first considered but absolutely necessary if we are to truly reach the lost of this world we live in with the gospel they so desperately need to hear. The Great Commission is your commission. You need to feel the weightiness of it. You need to own responsibility for it. It is not the commission merely of your church’s pastor. The work of evangelism is not reserved to one man who stands in front of the people on the Lord’s Day, or occasionally goes out into the open air. This is the job and responsibility and privilege of every one who names the name of Jesus Christ. But how do we engage the world meaningfully without compromising the integrity of our Christianity? Is it possible for a follower of Jesus Christ to be both “worldly” and Christian? These are the questions this book seeks to answer.",
