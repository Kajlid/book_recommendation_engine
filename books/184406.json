  "description": "Teresa Garcia-Lorca was raised as the favored daughter of “El Gato Negro,” the infamous Mexican revolutionary. She lived in sheltered bliss until the day the truth of her paternity comes out, and her former “father” becomes furious. Teresa and her mother are forced to flee for their lives to escape El Gato’s murderous rage. Her only hope lies in the home of her biological father, Bill Burkhart, but nothing could have prepared her for the treachery of gringo/white greed. Her new-found father’s bastard daughter, Judy Burkhart, has had everything—and every man—she’s ever wanted. Her indulgent world shatters when Judy learns she’s been disinherited in her father’s will. She and Teresa must learn to fight for all they have lost—and only one of them will end up with the man they both love.",
