  "description": "Fans of Tomie dePaola’s kindly Strega Nona will love this charming look at the early days of her good-hearted but clumsy helper Big Anthony. From the day he is born, Big Anthony never pays attention. As a boy, he leaves the gates of the farm open and all the animals escape. As a young man off to make his fortune in the world, he accidentally “fixes” the leaning Tower of Pisa. Will Italy survive the hilarious mishaps of Big Anthony? “Readers of all ages can be grateful that dePaola continues to practice his magic so well.”—The New York Times Book Review “Big Anthony and Strega Nona certainly qualify as celebrities in the realm of picture books, and this latest installment will bring smiles to the faces of their young fans.”—School Library Journal",
