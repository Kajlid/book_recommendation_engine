  "description": "This is a very dirty book about a loving couple who begin to explore a fetish. By accident, Michelle and Mike find themselves drawn into their newfound fetish and with all the awkwardness and excitement which comes with it. They each have different reasons for the intense interest, but they are both interested in testing the same boundary. Mike and Michelle are faced with the challenge of either keeping a fantasy in the imagination, or bringing it into the relationship. This is really a dirty book, and it is the first part of our two part series.This book is for mature audiences, 18 and older. Please be responsible for your copy of this material and keep it out of the hands of minors.Love and fantasy take on so many shapes and sizes. This book is not for everyone. Some of the topics in this book may be too much for you and your significant other. We cover topics like toilet, pee, golden shower, farts, flatulence, and so on. If that's not your cup-of-tee, you might not like this.However, even if you don't have the same exact fetish, you may like it because it is such a real account of a couple in sexual transition and awkward exploration. Anyone who has been there can certainly find this book engaging and relatable.",
