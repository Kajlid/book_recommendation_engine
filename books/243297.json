  "description": "All her life, Lexi Summer has dreamed of one thing: to become a mother. As the youngest of six, she’s accustomed to the chaos and camaraderie that comes with a big family, which is why she has been anxious to get a jump on this next phase in her life. She thought she had it all: the perfect house, husband, and future. Until one secret rips it all apart.  Nothing in Linkin Stone’s life has been easy. Raised by a single mom, working two jobs, and helping with his much younger twin brothers which keep him on his toes. He busts his butt to right the wrong of someone from his past and keep the ones he loves safe. He doesn’t need anyone or anything. But that all changes the moment he meets his sexy, feisty neighbor, Lexi.  When fates collide, two people on separate paths suddenly find themselves traveling the same road. Could an easy friendship turn into something more? Or in the end, will their decision kinda create one big mess?   *Though part of a series, this book can be read as a standalone. It is intended for those 18 and over due to graphic language, descriptive sex, and the world’s most inappropriate grandparents.",
