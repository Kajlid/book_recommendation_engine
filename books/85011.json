  "title": "Cloud 9: Black Eyed Demons",
  "description": "They called it Cocomeh; a previously unknown Stellar Cloud of RNA. RNA: the Catalyst, the key to diversity in life, and the backbone to every virus ever imagined. It came with every breath, touch, and swallow. All that is green is now red. The animals rebel with suicidal savagery. Genetic Disorders are suddenly and miraculously cured. Super plagues have become pandemic and Chaos is enveloping the earth. When it mutated for the ninth time it became the virus know as Cloud 9. The majority of the population is either dead or infected. The infected are mindless, ravenous cannibals. Others though, were bumped up the evolutionary ladder and have become Black Eyed Demons. They are stronger, faster, and no longer human. They are the most vicious, ruthless killing machines ever created and to make matters worse...they're more intelligent now too. It is now a world where the heroes are psychopaths, the mass of the population are infected, and the new gods transform inside Cocoons. The Black Eyed Demons are engineered to protect the Cocoons from what is left of the world, but who protects the world from the Black Eyed Demons. Change comes in many forms and only a handful of them are good. This is the beginning of their story.",
