  "title": "Mindfulness and Money: The Buddhist Path of Abundance",
  "description": "From two leading instructors in business and Buddhism comes a fresh approach to making peace with your finances and creating true abundance.It may seem contradictory that Buddhist teachers Kulananda and Dominic Houlder have also been highly successful in the business arena, but they have learned that Buddhist teachings do not require a life of poverty, and can indeed go hand-in-hand with wealth and prosperity. Mindfulness and Money brings to light the teachings of Buddha as they apply to the money part of life, and shares the stories of others who have found the Buddhist path to freedom, creativity, and abundance.Using the Buddhist Wheel of Life as a starting point, the authors explore the mechanism by which desire for money and material things is confining, and how mastery of desire can free us to live peacefully with our finances. Kulananda and Houlder offer five precepts for living on the Path of Abundance, including kindness, generosity, contentment, honesty, and awareness. Through prescriptive meditations, reflections, and exercises, we can begin to earn and spend more purposefully–the key to finding financial peace, whatever one’s income. An enlightening combination of practical wisdom and spirituality, Mindfulness and Money is a valuable asset for all seekers.",
