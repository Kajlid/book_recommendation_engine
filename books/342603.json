  "description": "Gwion loves Gareth, but the truths of Gwion's past threaten to undermine more than just their relationship. Gareth does love Gwion, too, but he'd like Gwi to be more like some of his past lovers - more generous. Beth-Ann loves Wales with all her heart and American exuberance its wild landscapes, its ancient language and its poets but now she wants to explore new territory. And Ben Llewellyn touches them all. This novel paints a vivid and lyrical picture of rural Wales, and is the first full-length work of fiction from a prize-winning author. Welsh Boys Too , Jones's first collection, was a 2002 American Library Association Honor Book. His second, Fishboys of Vernazza , was longlisted for the 2004 Welsh Book of the Year. Praise for these two previous \"Contemporary, yet timeless, these tales of young gay men living in rural Wales have a pathos and dignity that sustains this slim but vibrant collection\"- Gay Times \"Funny, poignant and ultimately revealing\"- The Western Mail \"Those who enjoyed Welsh Boys Too will find that Fishboys of Vernazza is even better. These ten stories are sometimes poignant, often witty and always perceptive\"-John Davies, author of The Penguin History of Wales \"These intriguing short stories look at homosexuality through the lens of Welsh culture, subtly linking homophobia to other kinds of discrimination-racism, religious intolerance-with objectivity and sensitivity\"- Publishers Weekly \"Sensitively written\"- Kirkus Reviews John Sam Jones grew up on Cardigan Bay in a bilingual family. He lives with his partner of eighteen years near the river Dee in Cheshire.",
