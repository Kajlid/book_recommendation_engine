  "description": "The first in a series of Christmas Valley Romances. From storyteller Chastity Sinclair comes this compelling novel of love, lust and delicious erotic dreams. Jessica Daniels is restless and beautiful, and anxious to escape the doldrums of small town life. For now, she’s a good daughter caring for her dying mother and grieving daddy on the family’s Clydesdale breeding farm. Nothing much happens in Christmas Valley, it’s barely a pin-dot on the map, that is, until Will Bronco, a gorgeous hunk of mystery man drifts into town. With Budweiser coming to inspect their foaling operation, her daddy is desperate for another pair of hands and a strong back to get the place in shape, and he hires the drifter, knowing little of his past. Tragedy, courage, loss, celebrity, forgiveness and unquenchable desire all make guest appearances as the story unfolds. But no one, least of all Jess, could have foreseen the drama about to explode, nor the unstoppable love affair that would leave Christmas Valley changed forever.",
