  "title": "Bailey and the Professor",
  "description": "Bailey’s graduate science classes are much harder than she expected them to be, and strict, young Professor Jacobs, in particular, seems out to get her, finding minute mistakes in her work, making her re-do assignments she’s already meticulously completed. When he forces her to start staying late in the lab, Bailey complains to her roommate that she’s about ready to quit school altogether, but what she doesn’t know is that her stern professor has a carnal lesson he’s waiting to teach her. Bailey is about to discover that she and Professor Jacobs share a great deal of “chemistry” together!",
