  "title": "A Tree for Max: A Fable",
  "description": "A Tree for Max, an illustrated story for children, tells the story of Grandfather Apple Tree, the King and all the trees of the forest, messenger swans, and a dog, all cooperating to help a young boy, Max, obtain a tree to help him adjust to his new home. It is “...entertaining, educational & just plain fun”, a story of loss and discovery, a fable of growth and change, and love of the natural world. Max is three and a half years old when his family moves to a new home, leaving behind his ‘forest’ — a stand of trees in their old yard. His forest becomes the focus of his feelings of disruption and loss related to the move. The forest sends the swans with a message to alert the King of the Trees about the problem. The King holds a conference and many species of trees compete to live with Max. Finally, Grandfather Apple Tree resolves the question, and an apple tree is sent to be a companion to Max. The main characters are unusual even in books for children—an elm tree, forest trees, apple trees, swans, and a Canaan dog—and early readers are enthusiastic. The book is in a new long form, 131 pages with 64 luminous color photographs, yet despite the unusual length, young readers devour the book in one sitting, eager to find out if Max does indeed get a tree. Parents and grandparents may choose to read the book with younger children over a few bedtime sessions. 4-6 as illustrated read-to book5-7 as a read-alone (with help as needed)Second grade and up, for classroom sharing and discussion. epub, mobi/kindleIt is suitable for children, their parents, and grandparents, as well as teachers.",
