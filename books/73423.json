  "description": "One hundred years ago, my people retreated under the sea.A century later, they surrendered, one by one, to the water.My name is Chey, short for an embarrassment of a name. A name I'll never tell. All my life, I was told of the impossibilities of life above the ocean's surface. Then I met Jesse. When he swam down, from above the water, my life changed. Rather than submitting to the blues, I finally had a purpose. Search for a cure. Save my people. Save myself.While my ocean world's immersed in beauty, pretty reefs don't make up for my parents' abandonment or the loss of my best friend. Isolation allows the blues to seep in faster, after all. But my journey is also one of friendship and romance, of hope and determination. Of survival. Jesse didn't save me, but he provided a way I could fight the plague of one thousand blues. For I will never succumb.",
