  "description": "***This book has been professionally edited and polished, and will be re-released as \"Ghostly Murder--PI Assistant Extraordinaire Book 1\"Before the events in The Catcher in the Eye, Kelly and Archangel were summoned to solve another impossible case...Archangel vs. a Murder in a locked room?!Working for Michael Archangel was always an adventure, one that keeps Kelly Kinki on her toes - and near the tabloids. As the consulting detective for the busy Washing D.C. Police Department and FBI, Archangel took the confusing or unsolvable situations and spun a Sherlock hue over them, finding answers amongst the clues and closing cases even the most skilled law enforcement agents found confounding. Working as both his assistant and sounding board, Kelly had an intimate knowledge of the inner workings of Archangel's amazing mind, and of his fabulous closet. Not only is he a Detective Savant, he is also a towering specimen of a man with an appetite for women's high fashion that could put a runway model to shame - a fact that leaves his dowdy, and far less fashionable assistant, flummoxed, and slightly jealous.Their most recent case sends the mismatched duo to a wooded area of Arlington where a locked tennis court serves as the final resting place of one Thomas Weitzman, a well-known man who was found stabbed, with no weapon in sight in a sealed court that was locked from the inside. How and why did the victim ended up dead in the locked room?",
