  "description": "Werewolves... in space.   In 2096 BCE, Earth became uninhabitable. In 2168, the last survivors of Earth cling to survival on three hastily-built ark ships: NightPiercer, LightBearer, and  Ark .  Young werewolf Lachesis of  Ark is chosen out of the Creche Pool to produce a child. She expects the usual no-fuss, no-muss artificial breeding using frozen semen from a werewolf she'll never meet.  Instead, she's transferred to  NightPiercer  for things to be done the old-fashioned way. Her new husband makes it clear he doesn't believe in permission or forgiveness, barely humors the chain of command, and has zero intentions of siring another generation destined to drift in the cold dark.  In the close quarters they share, Rainer's true nature, and his ultimate plan for both Lachesis and  NightPiercer, are impossible to hide. If the rest of  NightPiercer finds out, they'll both be killed.  That is, if they don't kill each other first.   Fated mates romance meets space opera in a dark, near-future where human and werewolf live at the very edge of survival. Contains sexy times, solar radiation pressure calculations, and algae vats.",
