  "description": "“You’re trouble, you know that?”  Fire captain Cameron McClain thinks I’m the meddlesome one, but he’s the instigator. His rugged good looks and confident sense of humor should be illegal. Not to mention his dimples.  They’re partially to blame for why I leave this party and follow him back to his room. I knew we had chemistry, but from the second his lips meet mine, my body catches on fire. All it takes is one touch and the attraction between us combusts into an undeniable heat.  One hot night. That’s all we were meant to be. But now that I know how good we are together, how can I stay away?  One Hot Night is a prequel to Caught in the Lies.",
