  "title": "Eating Stone: Imagination and the Loss of the Wild",
  "description": "Long believed to be disappearing and possibly even extinct, the Southwestern bighorn sheep of Utahâ€™s canyonlands have made a surprising comeback. Naturalist Ellen Meloy tracks a band of these majestic creatures through backcountry hikes, downriver floats, and travels across the Southwest. Alone in the wilderness, Meloy chronicles her communion with the bighorns and laments the growing severance of man from nature, a severance that she feels has left us spiritually hungry. Wry, quirky and perceptive, Eating Stone is a brillant and wholly original tribute to the natural world.",
