  "description": "One night changed an entire town.Ten years ago, I left Hawk Valley. I never planned to return. Not to the regrets. The bitter memories. The guilt.My baseball career gave me both the excuse and the money I needed to start over. Then my mom called, and I found myself headed back to the one place I swore I wouldn’t step foot again.Meeting Delilah wasn’t part of the plan. Falling in love with her adorable son was even less so. And yet, what’s brewing between us is too intense to be denied. The unexpected passion is almost enough to distract us from the crumbling of both our worlds.But even as the sparks fly, someone is waiting in the shadows to burn it all down.",
