  "description": "It was beginning to look as if Shadow Mountain was living up to its Indian reputation of being bad medicine. A range war and three murders spell bad luck in any man’s language.The Triangle J was oiling its artillery and getting ready for trouble. While dead men tell no tales, the cowboys were convinced that the sheep men could explain at least two of the shootings. A mystery surrounded the third. Every herder was accounted for. Suspicion pointed to the yodeling cowboy. He was in the vicinity and he had a possible motive. The motive was the boss’s young and attractive daughter. This is a hard-riding, fast-shooting story of a war between cattle men and sheep men for the right to the range and of a smaller but none the less bitter war between two men for a girl.",
