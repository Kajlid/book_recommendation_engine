  "description": "I hope you realize the chain of events you cause.One word. One whisper.One promise.Could lead to a domino effect that ends with blood on your hands. 'Blood' doesn't have to be literal in this case. Ten years ago I made a promise. I would have etched the words on this vessel that I call 'skin', to make it true. I would have slit my wrists and poured myself out to stand by my word. Alexis Pavette is a seventeen year old girl with an addiction to the next obsession. The only way to get rid of an obsession is by getting a new one. And oh, what a hot, sinful obsession Hunter Reed is. Maybe in his eyes, *I* was the one who barged into *his* life, but i'd call it kismet. You reap what you sow, and sweetheart, if you think you're gonna have the last laugh with me then yeah, kismet is a bitch to send me to you. I'm immune to your cruelty. You can't break me any more than I already am. That honors went away to my first victim.Who is Hunter Reed?He's the son of my mother's lover. Adultery isn't as sexy when it's your mother doing it.Well, technically it's not adultery when your parents are separated, and you just didn't know about it. The only question now is, who is gonna burn the house down first?And if i knew what was lying ahead of me, would I stay and burn?",
