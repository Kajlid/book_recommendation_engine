  "title": "Toxic",
  "description": "Think carefully about reading this book. It’s filled with things like sword fights and flying horses, death and magic, violence and huge evil monsters, and there is absolutely no hope that life will turn out okay at the end. If you do choose to read this book, prepare yourself. This is not a story for the faint of heart. Your beliefs are guaranteed to be challenged. The monsters will never give up until they catch you, the magic is too strong to fight, and the disease from the water is impossible to cure. Kai, Taryn, and Lizzy have to purify the toxic water of Eltiria before anyone else dies. If they don’t, life as they know it will cease to exist. A Winged Horse sets them on the search to locate the source of the poison and to find their faith while battling to see the truth in a world of chaos and destruction.",
