  "description": "Along the Delaware River, in a quaint riverside neighborhood, the murkiness of the water tends to go unnoticed. For James, however, its darkness is utterly unmistakable. The image of his high-school girlfriend Abby's lifeless body, still floats in his mind.It has been ten years since her suicide,and since he fled to Philadephia. Time and greed hardened his heart. His career as a prominent attorney dominates his life. As his doomed marriage finally fails, unsummomed memories of Abby upheave his sanity, and drive him back to his grief, and unanswered question.To find the truth (although at first to avert it,) he takes all the help he can get -no matter how incredulous. When neither physcian nor psychologist prove to be of any assistance, a mysterious drifter, and self proclaimed psychic named Celeste, becomes his guide. James' search for answers, and possibly a killer, becomes of dire importance, as he walks the tightrope of mental breakdown versus breakthrough.He's finally able to ask the bigger questions. And, even though it's too late to save Abby from her ill fate, having the courage just to ask, is what he's needed more than knowing the answers. $8.99 +shipping VISIT the ESTORE TO PURCHASE and use discount code courtesy of the author: GUPARTR6 for $1 off! www.createspace.com/3761569",
