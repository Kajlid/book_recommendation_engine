  "description": "Fans of Louis Sachar will welcome the adventures of a contest-crazed seventh grader who uses his wits and way with words in hopes of winning a big cash prize to help his family avoid eviction. Benjamin is about to lose a whole lot more than good toilet paper. If he doesn't make tons of money fast by selling candy bars and winning contests—like the Royal-T Bathroom Tissue slogan contest—his family will get kicked out of their apartment. Even with his flair for clever slogans, will Benjamin be able to win a cash prize large enough to keep a promise he made to his dad before he died? Or will he lose everything that matters to him? Praise for Death by Toilet Paper   \"Readers can't help but enjoy this heartening book about hanging in there.\"-- Kirkus Reviews\"Ben is a character kids will root for.\"-- Publisher's Weekly \"Would make a fine classroom readaloud.\"--The Bulletin  From the Hardcover edition.",
