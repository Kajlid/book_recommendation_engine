  "description": "This is no fairytale. After Des defeats her evil grandfather, she just wants what every girl wants… her happily ever after. But she’s not like every other girl. The coven of souls wishes to open the mouth of Hell and it’s up to Des to save the world—again. But to keep out the darkness, she will have to gain favour from the fabled, creatures not exactly fans of the fairies. Doing what she can to smooth interspecies relations, it is her promise to seal the portal that wins them over. But when Jax is taken by the coven, Des will have to choose—open the mouth of Hell and betray the fabled, or seal the portal and doom Jax to an eternity of torture in the demon realm.",
