  "title": "The Music and the Wood",
  "description": "This book, the second in series, is also in large print for the partially sighted, and is the continuing story of a British boy, covering the second decade of his life, from the post-war years of 1947-57.Between the ages of 10 and 20, the author explains how he overcame his academic difficulties at school, being both dyslexic and having a short attention span, by concentrating on his creative and artistic talents. He tells about leaving school, starting work in a factory, always enticed by the smell of newly cut wood, and finally getting the apprenticeship he really wanted. His love of cycling and keeping fit in his spare time was only outweighed by his developing interest and talent in music, learning to play the harmonica, skiffle and rock 'n roll.",
