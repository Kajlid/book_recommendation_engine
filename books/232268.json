The locals are bigger, stronger, and faster than most. That includes Nick, the boy next door who's become her silver lining in this godforsaken town.She wants to trust her instincts--about Nick, about what she suspects in Seaton Falls--but rumors of wolves and dragon shifters makes it hard to tell what's real. With a history of odd dreams and the nagging sense that she's never belonged, Evie fears she's losing touch with reality. Her concern only grows when someone who's haunted these dreams is suddenly tangible... and claims to hold the key to unlocking her true identity.Finding out her entire life has been a lie is scary enough, but what's downright terrifying is discovering who she's destined to become.Evie's much more than your average, seventeen-year-old girl.And this is her genesis.",
