  "description": "I've never been certain I'm humanOh, the X-rays and blood tests are normal, and most people have no reason to suspect I'm more than I appear to be. But if I tell you to do something? You do it—no ifs, ands or buts.I call my power the 'press.'My name is Mercy Hollings, and if you think that having the power to control people makes my life easy, you're dead wrong.Because when I get angry, everyone around me is at risk—Sukey, my friend who has frightening taste in men; my clients, who, ironically, come to me for help; my neighbors, who regard me as a loner; and Sam, aman who wants to know my darkest secret.I have hurt people in the past, and I don't want thatto happen again. But now a powerful stranger is threatening the new life that I've made for myself. And I'm afraid my anger is taking over.",
