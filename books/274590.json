  "description": "THE SOURCE OF TRUE SATISFACTION.Isn’t it true—we really don’t know someone until we understand what makes that person happy?  And so it is with God!What does bring delight to the happiest Being in the universe?  John Piper writes, that it’s only when we know what makes God glad that we’ll know the greatness of His glory.  Therefore, we must comprehend “the pleasures of God.”Unlike so much of what is written today, this is not a book about us. It is about the One we were made for—God Himself. In this theological masterpiece—chosen by World Magazine as one of the 20th Century’s top 100 books, John Piper reveals the biblical evidence to help us see and savor what the pleasures of God show us about Him.  Then we will be able to drink deeply—and satisfyingly—from the only well that offers living water.What followers of Jesus need now, more than anything else, is to know and love—behold and embrace—the great, glorious, sovereign, happy God of the Bible. “This is a unique and precious book that everybody should read more than once.”J.I. PACKERRegent College, Vancouver, British Columbia Includes a study guide for individual and small-group use.",
