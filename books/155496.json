  "description": "\"The British boarding school mystery meets the best imagined of fantasies at breakneck speed and with fully realized characters.\"-Sarah A. Hoyt, author of the best-selling Darkship Thieves.Before coming to Roanoke Academy, Rachel Griffin had been an obedient girl-but it's hard to obey the rules when the world is in danger, and no one will listen. Now, she's eavesdropping on Wisecraft Agents and breaking a lot of rules. Because if the adults will not believe her, then it is up to Rachel and her friends-crazy, orphan-boy Sigfried the Dragonslayer and Nastasia, the Princess of Magical Australia-to stop the insidious Mortimer Egg from destroying the world. But first she must survive truth spells, fights with her brother, detention, Alchemy experiments, talking to elves, and conjuring class. As if that were not bad enough, someone has turned the boy she likes into a sheep. Oh, and the Raven with blood-red eyes continues to watch her. It is said to be an omen of the Doom of Worlds. Will her attempts to save her world bring the Raven's wrath down upon her?",
