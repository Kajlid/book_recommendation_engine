  "description": "I decided to stay behind at the arena even after Jake's concert had ended, waiting for it to empty out. As I was leaving, I accidentally collided with Jake. His muscles rippled as he caught me in his arms, preventing me from hitting the ground. As soon as our eyes met, I felt my heart skip a beat. He asked me out, and I said yes. I'm like totally obsessed with Jake. I've been following him since he was a nobody on YouTube. Jake's popularity and all the girls he had didn't bother me when I was a fangirl. Now that I love him, it's irritating to see all these girls crushing on him. I'm worried about how Jake and I can keep a strong and faithful relationship when I have the rockstar all the ladies want.",
