Iris Davenport is an ordinary 16-year-old high-school student until a mysterious young man crosses paths with her and sets in motion a series of events that turn her entire life upside down. Suddenly, nothing around her makes sense anymore. Before she even has time to take it all in, she is enrolled in a battle for the Amulet, a rare mystical gem, essential in locating a supernatural entity called the Fountain of Truth, which grants the person who summons it the answer to any one question of his or her choosing. Since whoever comes into possession of the Amulet holds the key to all of the world's secrets, morals are shaken, friendships are broken and unexpected alliances are formed, with Iris at the center of it all, she herself with a burning question that she needs answered.",
