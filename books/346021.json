  "description": "Toby's heart sinks when he hears that Danny Lamb is coming to Lindley High School. Danny will expect Toby to be his friend, and Toby doesn't want that again. Danny is different and Toby is embarassed to be his friend. It would destroy his street cred and put his friends off him. He doesn't want to harm Danny. He wouldn't bully him. Of course not. But on a school trip to France, close to the D-Day beaches where men fought to defeat Fascism, a harmless game goes dreadfully wrong. Toby has to choose sides—the bullies or Danny—and his choice could save a life.",
