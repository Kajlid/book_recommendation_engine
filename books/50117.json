  "title": "The Brutus Gate: A Bailey Crane Mystery",
  "description": "Bailey Crane, auxiliary cop for the Phoenix PD, is set-up by the bad guys and nearly consumed by a warehouse fire as this adventure begins. One of the thugs utters a mysterious phrase, 'Beware the Brutus Gate, ' and the boys in blue have a good chuckle and try to figure out its meaning. This simple string of words marks the start of a tale that leads our southern muser/sleuth to the worst criminal elements in our society, elements that reach the highest levels of government and politics. Bailey encounters the players of the drug world, murder, and political corruption with his special panache and contempt. It's a case that has it all, and there are some personal changes in the life of our crusader for truth and justice. Bailey's emotions run the normal gamut as he plods and ponders his new realities, his life, and the meaning of it all. The climax to THE BRUTUS GATE plays out at an old ranch on the Mexican border, just south of Yuma, Arizona. It's a fun caper you won't want to miss.",
