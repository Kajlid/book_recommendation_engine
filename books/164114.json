But as though facing the death of her brother, and best friend wasn’t enough, Hadley’s father has informed her that he can’t sit back and allow Hadley to meet the same fate her brother met. Unwilling to allow her to remain in the city, he sends Hadley to a Ranch in the deep Alberta Rocky Mountains where he’s certain no temptation will cross her path…and her life will remain intact. Unable to fight the unstable man Hadley had always known as her rock, she agrees to allow her father to send her away for six months, to experience a different way of life than the Toronto city has to offer. Hadley arrives at The Donnelley Wild Land Tours Ranch with a bad attitude and a broken heart. The Ranch is the last place she wants to be…until she meets Collin Donnelley in a most humiliating way. Somehow, the man gets under her skin with lady killer grins and cocky innuendos, and in him, she learns to view the world in a different way. He pushes her to experience and to live her life outside the box-like confines of how she thought she should live. Before long, Hadley is losing her heart to Collin Donnelley, and the biggest player in the Rocky Mountains is losing his heart to a broken girl from the city.",
