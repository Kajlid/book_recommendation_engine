  "description": "WINNER of the 2017 GOLDEN FLOGGER AWARD for Novella!Novelist and competitive board game player, Kira, sits down opposite her Scrabble opponent, Grahame Gaines, a few moments after the buzzer rings. Little does she know that A-P-O-L-O-G-Y is more than his first word of the game; it is also her first sense that Grahame is less an opponent than the Dom sheâ€™s been hoping to meet to help her explore her hidden submissive urges.When this kinky and ultra-wealthy corporate magnate spots her again during her introductory visit to a local S&M club, he offers up his services as a mentor to indoctrinate her into the world of sexual slavery, and her lessons in Communication Skills begin.During their visit to a private Manhattan sex parlor, Grahame has a catsuited Dutch Domme and her harem of slave girls put a reluctant and defiant Kira through her paces, using fetish wear, bondage, canes, floggers, dildos and an introduction to bisexuality, to ensure that Kira will be adequately prepared to serve her Master--but only should she prove pleasing enough for his collar. Kira slowly learns that serving Grahame--no matter how perverse his demands--is far more rewarding than winning any word game.",
