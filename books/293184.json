  "description": "Juliet Wayborn did not hesitate to avenge her brother's beating in a London alley, especially once she discovered the perpetrator was the notorious Geoffrey Swale. When opportunity arose, she got even. But humiliating Swale in public is a sin for which there is no forgiveness. For Swale is the sort of gentleman (and she uses that term loosely) who doesn't like to lose, a man who coldly vows to challenge her every move in her determination to ruin him. A man who is proving dangerously, unthinkably...seductive. Geoffrey Swale will not stand for being bested by the outrageous Miss Wayborn, nor accused of a crime he did not commit. If Juliet were a man, Swale would deliver a well-aimed punch...or two. But since she is quite unmistakably female, he does the next best thing. He kisses her. And then he kisses her again. Suddenly, Swale wants so much more than defeat from the woman who has openly declared war on him. He no longer cares about winning...he simply wants her surrender.",
