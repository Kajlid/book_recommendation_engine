Hers was the name on the dying Wither's lips -- \"the time will come.\" And now that Windale's \"little witch girl\" is all grown up she, along with her friends Kayla, Abby, and Hannah, must face a demon like none the world's ever known -- an unseen evil that \"bides its time.\" A yellow-eyed, seven-foot beast whose blind allegiance to Wither fuels its hunger -- \"captive to the urge to find its special prey....\"",
