  "title": "The Sexual Life of Catherine M.",
  "description": "The New York Times and national best-seller hailed as \"brilliantly literate, utterly unabashed....consistently provocative\" (The Philadelphia Inquirer) and \"shamelessly trashy...excellent\" (Jane), The Sexual Life of Catherine M. was the controversial sleeper hit of the year--a candid, powerful, and deeply intelligent depiction of unfettered sexuality. Since her youth, Catherine Millet, the eminent editor of Art Press, has led an extraordinarily active and free sexual life--from al fresco encounters in Italy to a gang bang on the edge of the Bois du Boulogne to a high-class orgy at a chichi Parisian restaurant. A graphic account of a life of physical gratification and a relentlessly hones look at the consequences, both liberating and otherwise, of sex stripped of sentiment, The Sexual Life of Catherine M. is \"truly a masterpiece of sexual exploration [that] will be a classic\" (The Hartford Courant).",
