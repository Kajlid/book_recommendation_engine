A stranger arrives in town, the beautiful Hanna, being pursued by the fanatical General, who wants to literally devour her. He comes after Tom and his friends in order to remake reality the way he wants it to be, and they fight to survive while trying to navigate an LSD-inspired apocalypse. As reality burns in a primordial fire, Tom and Sparrow have no choice but to become their true selves in order to fight the General as he wreaks havoc and kills off their friends in the punk rock scene, while protecting Hanna from being devoured.
