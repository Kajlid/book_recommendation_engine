  "title": "One Last Time: Andino + Haven - A Companion",
  "description": "Andino and Haven are back … one last time. Nearly a decade married, and Andino and Haven Marcello are well into starting their life. Everything is beautiful. Their home is a happy one. But that doesn’t mean everything is perfect. They only want one thing now—one more child to complete their family. Add in a dose of the family business to make things harder and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Note: One Last Time is a 16k novella companion to the Andino + Haven duet. It is not and should not be read as a standalone.",
