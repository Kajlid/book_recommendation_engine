  "title": "The Way to Love: The Last Meditations of Anthony de Mello",
  "description": "From the international bestselling author of Awareness, a pocket-sized guide that will bring you to new levels of spiritual awareness.The Way To Love contains the final flowering of Anthony de Mello's thought, and  in it he grapples with the ultimate question of  love. In thirty-one meditations, he implores his  readers with his usual pithiness to break through  illusion, the great obstacle to love. \"Love  springs from awareness,\" de Mello insists, saying  that it is only when we see others as they are  that we can begin to really love. But not only must  we seek to see others with clarity, we must examine  ourselves without misconception. The task,  however, is not easy. \"The most painful act,\"  de Mello says, \"is the act of seeing. But in  that act of seeing that love is born.\" Anthony  De Mello was the director of the Sadhana Institute  of Pastoral Counseling in Poona, India, and  authored several books. The Way To Love   is his last.",
