  "title": "The Message: The New Testament in Contemporary Language",
  "description": "Written in the same kind of language you'd use to talk with friends, write a letter, or discuss politics, The Message preserves the authentic, earthy flavor and expressive character of the Bible. With more than six million copies sold, Eugene Peterson's unique paraphrase has opened up new understanding and insight into God's Word. The Message brings the life-changing power of the New Testament, the passion of the Psalms, and the practical wisdom of Proverbs into easy-to-read modern language that echoes the rhythm and idiom of the original Greek and Hebrew.",
