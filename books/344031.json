  "title": "House of Windows",
  "description": "For the last few years, Veronica Croydon has been at the center of scandal, first as the younger woman for whom her famous professor left his wife, and then as the apparent widow of that man. When a writer staying at the same vacation home as Veronica has the chance to hear her story, he jumps at it. What follows takes him to the dark heart of a father's troubled relationship with his only son, in a story that stretches from a college town in the Hudson Valley to the battlefields on Afghanistan, from post-9/11 America to the height of Victorian England. It is a story that leads inexorably to the Belvedere House, the home Veronica shares with her husband, within whose walls a father's terrible words to his son echo and gain in awful force. With nods to Peter Straub, H.P. Lovecraft, and Charles Dickens, House of Windows is a tense, frightening exploration of a marriage under strain from forces psychological and supernatural, a meditation on the ways loss haunts every one of us.",
