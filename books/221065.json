  "description": "Joel Layer believes he is battling a failing marriage and music career. He is visited by an imaginary, childhood playmate who has taken on some rather sinister traits. He realises that it is his sanity that is failing. The last chance he has to save himself and his relationship lies in the hands of an elderly school caretaker, Danya Mihailov.  Danya, a bear-like Russian, reveals a shadowy past as a defected Russian intelligence operative and uses‘not entirely’ retired contacts to lead Joel on a journey into the past through France, Canada and the USA.  Accompanied by Imran, the homosexual son of an Asian hotel magnate, the three men embark on a seemingly hopeless mission to uncover the truth behind a 1970's airline disaster, which Danya believes may hold the key to unlocking Joel's depression.  As they unveil a cover-up that could shake the very foundations of corporate America, Joel’s grasp on reality is pushed to breaking point.  When their investigations attract the attention of Gabe McAllen, a ruthless billionaire who will do anything to eliminate the threat to his financial empire, the stakes become even higher. Joel’s resolve to battle the demons within him is tested again. Finally, he is forced to realise that those same demons could set him on a path to recovery and would ultimately give him the strength to bring McAllen to his knees.  Based on actual events, Worry Monkey shows that comedy and tragedy are never far apart and that a troubled mind can be both your destroyer and your saviour depending upon how you embrace it.  Which events and occurrences in this story are true, the author leaves to your imagination.",
