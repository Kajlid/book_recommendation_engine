  "description": "Watching Peter and never having him filled me up with an ache so deep, so empty, I was sure nothing could hurt worse.That is, until I had Pete.And lost him.I hear Peter, I feel Peter, but I also know the dead don’t come back.Unless, of course, Pete isn’t dead at all and a certain Whitcomb-I-Used-To-Have-Clown-Hair spiked the metaphysical epi-pen, so he could keep us apart. Although, it’s kind of hard to fake someone’s death when you can feel them inside your heart.Metaphysical bonds between Humans and Lesser-Breds aren’t supposed to be possible. But then, I’ve been breaking the rules all my life, so what’s one more to add to the collection?",
