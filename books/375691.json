  "description": "The classic and controversial novel made available again; Acclaimed winner of the William Whitehead Memorial Award for a lifetime's contribution to gay and lesbian literature, bestselling and award-winning SF author Samuel R. Delany wrote Hogg three decades ago. Since then it has been one of America's most famous 'unpublishable' novels. The subject matter of Hogg is our culture of sexual violence and degeneration. Delany explores his disturbing protagonist Hogg on his own turf - rape, pederasty, sexual excess - exposing an area of violence and sexual abuse from the inside. As such, it is a brave but necessary book. A shocking and contemporary insight into a parallel world of sex and cravings that lies in wait in the shadows of our own world.",
