  "title": "Tamaitai Samoa: Their Stories",
  "description": "Although it has been long overdue, yet how opportune it is for these stories of our women to be written as we draw nigh to the close of the twentieth century. We need to tell our stories. The recollections shared by the contributors to this collection remind us of the richness of values and faith of our women. But much more, these written records also add to our history and heritage to be passed from generation to generation. Each of these stories unfolds like the blending and distinctiveness of the motif and decorative patterns of a siapo. In times of adversity, they literally shrugged their shoulders and kept going, adapting to every life event.",
