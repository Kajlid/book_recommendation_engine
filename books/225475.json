  "description": "Bridget Isichei wanted to help people and make a real difference in the world. However, she had no idea what she was in for when she accepted a two-year volunteer post to train women to be pre-school teachers in the popular tourist destination of Vanuatu. But instead of cocktails by the sea in a luxury resort, Bridget found herself in Luganville, a shantytown whose people were still practising black magic and wearing the same fashions bought in by missionary women in the 1800s.",
