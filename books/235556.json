  "description": "If you read Finding Love, then you know… some characters are unforgettable.George Hughes never minded being the spare heir – at least, he didn’t mind until his brother and father almost got themselves killed six months ago. He might be brawny and good at fixing things, but without his older brother’s charm or cleverness, what good is he? Then George meets a woman whose problems he can actually fix, and he knows he can’t just walk away. Not when she might hold the key to his brother’s recovery, and especially not when she looks and acts like his dream come true. As luck would have it, George seems to be exactly the right man for this job.Poppy Whitlock can usually take care of herself, but these days she’s got problems on top of problems: a less-than considerate roommate, a petty faculty advisor determined to sink her career hopes, and a looming health issue making everything else feel perilous. But then a gorgeous British man with a knack for saving the day barrels into her life, offering not only his help, but his heart – and going it alone doesn’t look nearly as inviting. When Poppy saddled him with the nickname Burning Love, she never could have guessed how accurate it would turn out to be.If you loved Finding Love, then you know…you just have to learn what happens when George and Poppy get LOST IN LOVE.Includes the bonus short story LUCKY IN LOVE!Two men, two bars, and one very big secret – Charlie Hughes is about to find his perfect match, and it’s going to change everything.",
