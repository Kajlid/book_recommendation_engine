  "description": "With her acting career in the doldrums, thirty-something Kate Thornton plays internet backgammon to while away the hours. Playing against others from Beijing to Bolton is like having a window on the world, and she soon makes many online friends, finding herself increasingly drawn to Andy, the Canadian cowboy. When he falls from his horse and breaks his arm, Kate rushes to his aid in the South Cariboo, only to find that Andy is at least as attractive as she expectedâ€”but he is not expecting her. In fact, he has no idea who she is. Should she stay or should she leave? After such an embarrassing beginning, do she and Andy stand a chance? Somebody has been playing tricks on them both, but who? And why?",
