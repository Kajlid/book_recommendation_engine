  "title": "Hot Wet Touches II: The Sauna Revisited",
  "description": "Claudia and Jake are back. At Christmas the two strangers shared an explosive, wordless erotic encounter in a sauna. Now it's Easter, and though they're both still consumed by the thought of that magic day, there's no hope of them finding each other again. They live in different countries, after all, and they didn't exchange names or numbers. It will take the intervention of fate to bring them together once more...  Did you miss Hot Wet Touches 1? Well, never fear - it is available as a stand-alone in the Kindle Store. Even better, buy my anthology 'Breaking Free' and you will get three other short stories along with Hot Wet Touches 1!
