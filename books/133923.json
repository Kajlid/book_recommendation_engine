Business and adventure literally fall his way as Aaron sets about creating identities, bases of operations, and a client base; all accomplished with the guidance of his partner Steve Austin. Aaron quickly discovers that various illegal enterprises present him an opportunity for acquiring stock (women), cash, and other enticements too good to pass up. The windfall of millions of dollars and the easy acquisition of slaves leads to a reanalysis of his business ethics and personal morals.",
