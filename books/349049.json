  "title": "Geoffrey Chaucer of England",
  "description": "A delightful book which introduces Chaucer as more than the author of Canterbury Tales--as courtier in the retinue of Edward III, as diplomat, business man, who rose to high places in 14th century London. Rich experience in life fed the springs of poetic genius & made it possible for him to portray completely civilized human beings. Excellent picture of life of the times--good introduction to his poetry--fun to read.--Kirkus",
