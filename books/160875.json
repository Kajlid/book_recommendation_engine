  "title": "Relentless Angels",
  "description": "Rebecca Weatherhead, PhD, has arrived in the Atacama Desert on a mission to observe a total eclipse of the sun. Her personal mission, during this journey to such a remote place, is to review the choices that seem to be making her life less than it should be. Even though superficially successful, she is a grown woman pathologically afraid of the dark, with no belief in any kind of higher power, and no confidence she will ever be able to sustain a mature romantic relationship. Although the narrative begins, and ends, in an unusual place, the bulk of the story - told in the first person - takes place in the English countryside, and in the Bible Belt of the American Midwest.",
