  "description": "Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN: B00EXXDA0C.Sex, drugs and money. Preston Tyler's fight to save his company from a hostile takeover is not your average business deal. Worse than the lying, scheming and back-stabbing he must deal with, however, is having to go to his company's largest shareholder for help; the woman who jilted him at the altar, Maggie McKenzie. If Preston plays his cards right, maybe he can not only save his company, but win back Maggie's heart as well.",
