  "description": "Spring 1944: Emily Bennett, a young English girl, has come to stay with Molly McIntire's family to escape the bombing of London. Emily's parents sent her off with the reminder to be \"a brave soldier for England,\" but Emily doesn't see how she can do that. Molly tries hard to make sweet, shy Emily feel at home, and Emily is grateful for Molly's friendship. Emily is delighted that she can help Molly with math and is pleased and proud when she impresses Molly. But it is not until Emily makes a big mistake and has to ask Molly for help that Emily shows how truly brave she is--and both girls learn what friendship really means.",
