  "description": "Some things in our lives we don’t put much thought into because we either think they don’t hold much importance, or maybe, we just don’t want to put in the effort to find out just how wrong our little worlds are. My name is Sadie, and this is how I have survived all eighteen years of my life. I have ignored the things that I shouldn’t have, and didn’t ask the questions I should have. I am a Norm. Just an average Joe, living in a world obsessed with genetic enhancements. He? He is everything. Gorgeous, smart, and a Norm as well. He is also my new science teacher. And when he came into our small little town… hell came with him.",
