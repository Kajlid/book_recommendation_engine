A misunderstood act of chivalry places Scott at the mercy of a town hiding a sinister secret.As they say, no good deed goes unpunished, and for Scott, that punishment could be his life. Sit back and enjoy this stay-up-all-night serial killer psychological thriller.Author Commentary‘Brother’s Keeper’ is my first psychological thriller, and it was simultaneously fun and challenging to write. It tells the story of Scott Sharp, a traveler whose train makes a stop at the tiny town of Burdensville. There he begins to unravel the goings-on, which pulls him into the dark secrets the town holds, and the secrets won’t let him go.Writing this story was fun for a variety of reasons. It was off the beaten path compared to most books I write. The monster in this book is not a vampire, witch, or zombie; instead, the monster is an unknown man.Scott walks into Burdensville without the slightest idea of what has been happening to this town. The whole place is off, and he can’t seem to put his finger on what is happening around him. I wanted people to really be in Burdensville while they read this. I also wanted readers to get a very specific feel for the town, Mayberry, without a shower. I did my best to convey the gloom of the constant shadows that seem to hang over the place, even when the sun was shining. That’s more or less what happens in small-town life and, evil or not, Burdensville is no different.",
