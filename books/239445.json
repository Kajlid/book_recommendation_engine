  "description": "Jamie McAdams expected it to be an open and shut case of embezzlement. The finger seemed to be pointed right at Andi Morrow, the quiet young lady who ran the daycare center at his godfather's plant. Of course, she didn't exactly have access to the cash, but she did live seriously outside her means. Andi smelled like vanilla, tasted like sex, and moved like sin. It only took a few days for Jamie to realize he was hooked, and she was being framed. But maybe he should have told her that, before they used her as bait to catch the real embezzler. Jamie always gets his man, even if it means coming in last with the woman he's fallen in love with.",
