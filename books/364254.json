When his boss and the other associations’ leaders are assassinated, James has no choice but to return to the one place he never wanted to see again—Freak Town. Yet saving the life of the one friend he has in Triad City might be worth risking it all.Magpie can’t believe he’s been shot and his boss assassinated. Waking up shortly afterward, he discovers he’s in Freak Town where all the mutants live. Nuclear radiation from the war has changed some people into creatures. Wigging out because his friend, James, is one of the Freaks seems sensible to Magpie. Falling in love doesn’t.Together, the two men must find a way to survive the revolution being planned by the Freaks. Getting out of Triad City is the only way, but will Magpie stand beside James to save himself? Or will he lose his heart to a Freak, proving that the heart loves where it wants instead of where it’s wise?Genres: Gay / Fantasy / Futuristic / Action / Adventure",
