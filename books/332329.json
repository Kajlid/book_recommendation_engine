  "description": "Two strikes—and she's out!Caitlyn Waite didn’t mean to get into trouble. Ok, maybe the first time she caused a stir, it was her own fault—but her run-in with Kellen Karma? No way. She didn’t plan to get tangled up with the big football player and go viral with what was actually was just a big mistake! And whatever people may be saying, thinking, and writing about her, none of it’s true.But this isn’t baseball, it’s real life. It only takes two strikes before Caitlyn loses her job, her friends, and all her dreams for the future. She’s out.Or maybe not. Because the next time Kellen Karma pops into her life, the Woodsmen wide receiver has a proposal that might help the both of them get onto the right track. They’re going to scam everyone into thinking that they’re in love, which is going to be harder than it sounds. Sure, Kellen’s gorgeous with a body that makes her get gooey. But in terms of personality? He struck out there, himself. Everyone knows he’s a jerk.Or maybe not. There seems to be more to Kellen Karma than Caitlyn had noticed. But that just makes their plot even harder! Yeah, it’s going to take some fudging, some outright lying, and a lot of nerve, but if she and Kellen can pull this off? They’ll both get what they want.But what does she want, anyway? Is it a return to how things were? Or does Caitlyn’s future suddenly have a lot more to do with the guy in the football uniform?",
