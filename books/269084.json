  "title": "Awakened Love",
  "description": "From broke college student and phone sex worker to unwitting bearer of Cupid’s love powers to Hades' prisoner in the underworld, Locke has had a rough few months...  After making a deal with Hades to save her lovers, Locke faces down an eternity in the underworld. Of course, if there’s one thing she’s learned so far, it’s that a god’s word isn’t always what it’s chalked up to be, and her sacrifice might have been for nothing.  With the threat against the pantheon coming to a head, Locke must discover a way to escape the underworld, rescue Byron, Mads, and Rane, uncover who is behind the nefarious plot to destroy the world of the gods, and save the day before it’s too late.  The odds might seem impossible, but with love on the line, Locke will do whatever it takes to win.  Awakened Love is the final novel in the Operation Cupid series, a slow burn reverse harem romance with sexy, godly avatars and steamy scenes.",
