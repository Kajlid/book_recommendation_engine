  "description": "When a stranger shows up and infects almost everyone Matt Tanner knows with the zombie virus that destroyed the world fifteen years prior, he's forced to make a decision: flee with only a handful of survivors, or stay in the mountains and rebuild.But when Matt discovers the stranger was carrying a letter addressed to him from someone he thought he'd never hear from again, he's forced to reconcile demons from the past with the chance for a future with the brother he left behind.Avoiding the withered zombies that roam the wastelands and the flesh-eating humans that stalk the night, Matt struggles to find the balance necessary to keep everyone alive and his own mind sane.But when things go wrong and he watches friend after friend die, can he survive, or will the wastelands consume him, too?",
