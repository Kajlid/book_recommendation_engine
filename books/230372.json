  "description": "Sentinels are as dangerous as they are mysterious. Not satisfied with the rumors that abound, the two necromancers at the Dragon Court of D’Vaire make the courageous decision to summon their soul bound assassins only to discover the two are mates. Ripped from isolation, Gavrael and Gedeon were never taught about matebonds. They quickly realize their old lives have ill-prepared them to understand the complexity of their new connection. Before the pair can grapple with the concept of loving, an old foe returns intent on settling the score against Grand Warlock Dra’Kaedan and the D’Vaire family. Gavrael and Gedeon soon discover it takes more than their trusty daggers to finally lay the past to rest.",
