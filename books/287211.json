  "title": "Joni Mitchell: The Complete Poems and Lyrics",
  "description": "In the generation of singer-songwriters who came to fame in the '60s, none has had more impact--or created a more evocative, bittersweet, literate, and reflective body of work--than Joni Mitchell. Today's music owes much to her innovation and inspiration. This complete collection of her poetry and song lyrics reads like a poem cycle that finds unexpected meaning and beauty on the page.After displaying a haunting and sophisticated quality in her first albums, Joni Mitchell (1968), Clouds (1969), Ladies of the Canyon (1970), and Blue (1972), Mitchell reached her poetic apotheosis in the surreal and mythical Hejira (1976) and Don Juan's Reckless Daughter (1977). During the '80s, Mitchell used her words to explore and mirror the commercial energy of the decade. She became more reflective in the following years with Night Ride Home (1991) and Turbulent Indigo (1994). Mitchell continues to grow her already remarkable talent, as is evident with her latest work, Taming the Tiger (1998).The importance of Mitchell's entire oeuvre is unequivocal when seen as a lifetime of accomplished writing. As epic poet and tragedian, the power and honesty of her voice has inspired generations past and those to come. Joni The Complete Poems and Lyrics gives us the first opportunity to reconsider Mitchell's written work and her exalted place among the great poets and lyricists of our time.This paperback edition includes the lyrics to Joni Mitchell's new album, Taming the Tiger, as well as an index for easy access to all titles.",
