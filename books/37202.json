  "description": "Cross never forgives because he never forgets.Haunted by the Hell of his past transgressions, he sets out on an epic journey across the underworld to paradise--not to frolic in the gardens with the righteous, but to drink from the river Lethe which causes complete forgetfulness. He's a rare soul who remembers his life before death, known throughout the underworld as \"The Man Who Remembers\". There's a bounty on his memories, and envious spirits hunt his head to steal them.Erasing his mind will get the spirits off his neck and allow him to keep his crown on its throne, but he will have to continue his afterlife in an ignorant bliss. Even more unfortunate for him, paradise is guarded by a great wall that annihilates any soul that gets too close. No member of the damned has ever broken in.Burn in Hades is an action packed and fast-paced fantasy by Michael L. Martin Jr. It is the first book in The Darker Side of Light saga and is approximately 113,000 words long (about 400 printed pages).",
