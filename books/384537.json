  "description": "Miles craves adventure but he's started to believe that perhaps it isn't in his stars-until a late night encounter makes him wonder if the creatures he creates in his stories could possibly be real.PC is a wolf. A lycan since birth, he's spent the first twenty-four years of his life trying to be the exact opposite of what everyone expects of him. He hunts supernatural troublemakers, hangs out with vampires, and refuses to settle down-no matter how much everyone else might want him to. One confusing night, his body responds, turning into his wolf form and hurling him into the darkness to save a stranger.Pulled together by a physical force stronger than either can resist, PC and Miles must learn to live with each other because separation, even for just minutes, means unendurable pain. Miles finds himself falling for the unpredictable lycan, his strange friends, and their nightly adventures but his reluctant lover is determined to find a way to break the bond between them.Together, they are drawn into a mystery full of werewolves, lycans, bad vampires and a growing pile of dead humans. Finding the truth at the bottom of it might just be the hunt of PC's life--especially if he wants to keep Miles alive.",
