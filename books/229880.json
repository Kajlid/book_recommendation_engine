She couldn't believe it. If his brother was back in their lives, wouldn't Tomas be, too? She didn't jinx it by asking Kelsey that. Nope, but she was on the next flight.Tomas was on top of the world. He had a hot girlfriend. She knew about time travel, so he didn't have to keep secrets around her. So why did the sight of his old friends Amber and Kelsey make him uncomfortable? His girlfriend kept telling him to forget about them. But he couldn't. He wished he knew why.",
