  "description": "Reylan Hawke stood in awe at the breathtaking sight before him. There lay a ruined underground city with shattered skyscrapersâ€”only looking with more devastation beyond his imagination. So, what had caused this to happen? By mere chance, he stumbled upon a mysterious machine called REQUIEM, which whisked him away to a dystopian world ruled by advanced technology and engulfed in unyielding fear. And escape seems impossible.Note that each \"edition\" after September 2024 is an \"amendment\" to the third edition (2024). Amazon's \"From the Publisher\" details the differences between the first and third editions.",
