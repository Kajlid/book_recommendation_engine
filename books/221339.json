  "description": "I’m Penny Caspian, and my life is damned near perfect. I have a beautiful new baby who I love so much it hurts, and his dad, Detective Lachlan Flint, is still as wonderful as he’s ever been. We never thought we’d ever be this lucky, but here we are. Of course, the Eaglelinx corporation is still using their candies to create rogue dragons. I swore I’d stop them, but I’ve been a bit busy changing diapers and doing night feedings the past nine months. When Eaglelinx threatens to use their influence to take my hotel, I realize my time is running out. I have to stop them now. But we’ve just taken on a new murder case. Beckett James Stanley, a figure from the early days of gargoyle rights, has been killed while he lay in his hospital bed. We’ve got to find the murderer and bring him or her to justice. It’s fine, though. I’ve got this. I can do it all and still be home in time to put my son to bed.",
