  "description": "First published in 1907, My Life as an Indian is the memoir of J. W. Schultz’s life as a young white man among the Piegan Blackfeet in the Montana Territory. Out of curiosity and in search of adventure, Schultz went west and became a trapper and trader. He was inspired by the journals of Lewis and Clark and George Catlin’s Oregon Trail , but found a wholly different source of inspiration when he met the Blackfeet and quickly settled into their lifestyle, even taking a Blackfoot woman for his wife and riding along with the men on buffalo hunts and wars with neighboring tribes.",
