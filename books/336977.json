Can they put aside the experiences that have made them guard their hearts? Or are their differences too much for them to find true love?The Exception to the Rule is the first book of the Series, Memoirs of Being an Omega, which follows four Omegas - Violet, Rachel, Alex, and Mia - in their quest for true love.",
