Volume one of Yellow begins with a brewing personal interest between Taki and Goh, though Taki is still unwilling to answer to Goh's desires. A gangster's jealousy leads to Taki's kidnapping, and it's up to Goh's cunning and charms to save him. Working solo, it's also up to Goh to find the drugs he was hired to steal while sidestepping a police conspiracy powder keg.",
