  "description": "The last thing Addy Davidson wants is to be on a reality TV show where the prize is a prom date with the President's son.She's focused on her schoolwork so she can get a scholarship to an Ivy League college, uncomfortable in the spotlight, never been on a date, and didn't even audition for it.But she got selected anyway.So she does her best to get eliminated on the very first show. Right before she realizes that the President's son is possibly the most attractive guy she has ever seen in person, surprisingly nice, and seemingly unimpressed by the 99 other girls who are throwing themselves at him.Addy's totally out of her comfort zone but that may be right where God can show her all that she was meant to be.",
