  "description": "They told me I’d be an escort; they made it sound so easy.Really I’m just a high priced call girl.Desperation brought me to this and it led me to him, my one and only client.Hating him is easy, he reminds me of my shame.Wanting him is wrong it fills me with guilt.Loving him is a losing battle yet it’s become everything.A gift and a curse, he consumes my every thought and I’d rather play my part in his bed than to spend one day without him.",
