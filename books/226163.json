  "description": "LEX - The victim of a human trafficking ring, I was confined to a tiny bedroom with seven other women. The conditions were horrific. They’d taken my freedom, my clothes, and, eventually, what little hope I clung to. Then, one night, we heard gunshots. Prepared for the worst, I stood with my eyes fixed on the door, ready to meet my fate. And he opened the door.He saved me from the monsters. Then, he simply walked away. Never in my wildest dreams would I have though that one day I would save him from his. CHOLO – My focus was the Motorcycle Club, boxing, and work. I’d never been on a date. I guess it goes without saying that I’d never been in love, either. I had my share of sex, but my relationships always ended when the night was over. That all changed after I rescued her. I wasn’t trying to be a hero, but she saw me as one. She said I saved her from the monsters. Want to know the truth?She saved me from mine. DIRTY is a stand-alone MC Romance with no cheating, no sex outside the relationship, and no cliff hanger. It has an HEA, and is book III of a series. Although no other book is required to tell this tale, it is recommended that you read HARD and ROUGH to fully understand the ancillary characters.",
