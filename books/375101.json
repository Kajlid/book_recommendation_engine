  "description": "On 24th May 1940, Hitler's armies were on the brink of a shattering military victory. Only ten miles away, Allied Troops were pinned against the coast at Dunkirk. Only 11 days later, by the 4th June, 338,000 men had been successfully evacuated to England. How did it happen? Walter Lord's account of how \"the miracle of Dunkirk\" came about is based on hundreds of interviews with survivors of all the nations that fought among the sand dunes.",
