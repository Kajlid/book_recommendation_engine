  "title": "Charles Harper's Birds and Words",
  "description": "Birds & Words is a true reflection of Charley Harper, that rare species of a man with twinkling eyes and smile, with wit as infectiously keen and light-hearted as his paintings. Harper the humorist is as captivating in the self composed stories that accompany his serigraphs as Harper the artist. This boxed reissue of the highly collectible 1974 classic is perfect for every bird lover, art collector and Charley Harper fan alike. Specially made cloth wrapped boxes open to reveal a numbered cloth bound book and one of four beautiful silk-screen prints, each estate stamped and hand numbered. A perfect gift for any occasion.",
