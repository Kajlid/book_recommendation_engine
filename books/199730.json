  "description": "Librarian's Note: Alternate-cover edition for ASIN: B0109H2VJ6Everyone wants a piece of the dakaran/human hybrid Chesara, from her two human mates to the entire Human Federation. The simple task of staying under the radar of the authorities proves to be more complicated than the fugitives could imagine. Especially with the additions of a feisty nut-cracking human girl, and a ship wrecked dakaran male to her admirers. Maybe threeâ€™s company but five may well prove to be much of a crowd.  Contains graphic M/F and M/F/M scenes and some violence. It is intended for a mature audience only. Word count: 54,000 plus 10% excerpt from Hybrid 4: Fight. This book was formerly published as the first part of Cat Clan Hybrid 2: Fight or Flight.",
