  "title": "Mexico: A Traveler's Literary Companion",
  "description": "Mexico has long been the top travel destination for Americans. But until now, there has not been such a panoramic vision of offered by some of Mexico's finest contemporary writers of fiction and literary prose. Here are writings — many translated for the first time — that bring you to the people of the beaches, the deserts, jungles, snow-capped mountains, and megacities. The voices are rich and diverse, the stories enthralling and strange. These writings shatter stereotypes as they provide a rollicking journey from the Pacific to the Gulf, from Yucatan to the U.S.-Mexico border, from humble ranchos to a fabulous mountaintop castle. Contributors include Daniel Reveles, Carlos Fuentes, Inés Arredondo, Jesús Gardea, Elizondo Elizondo, Agustín Cadena, C. M. Mayo, Carlos Monsiváis, Juan Villoro, Guadalupe Loaeza, Fernando del Paso, Mónica Lavín, Pedro Ángel Palou, Ángeles Mastretta, Raúl Mejía, Martha Cerda, Araceli Ardón, Bruno Estañol, Ilan Stavans, Raymundo Hernández-Gil, Julieta Campos, Alberto Ruy Sánchez, Rosario Castellanos, and Laura Esquivel.",
