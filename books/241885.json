  "description": "Supernatural bodies are piling up fast. But can Parker and Daniel save those they love, before they kill each other?As one of the top data security specialists in the US, Parker Johnson has exposed hundreds of digital villains, and their crimes. The hacker is smart, savvy and good at keeping secrets. Parker is also one of the few humans aware of the existence of werewolves, and it’s a secret she will do everything to protect.But for how long? Weres are dying by the dozen, and it seems Wildfire—a new drug sold on the internet—is somehow involved. Parker is called in to help the investigation under the protection of Daniel Locke, the icy Alpha Commander who, three years earlier, she had the misfortune of pissing off. Big time.Daniel has spent his life defending those he loves, but he’s never faced an enemy that’s invisible, and everywhere. No matter how much he distrusts Parker, with the future of his race on the line, his duty to his people comes first. It’s just too bad that his steely self-control fails to smother the animal attraction that flares each time he meets the curvy, brunette investigator. The fiery woman is as much of an enigma as the puzzle they are unravelling.It is a race against the clock to track down the killers behind the lethal drug before it rages well beyond their control.",
