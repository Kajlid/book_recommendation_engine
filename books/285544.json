  "description": "I know finding and signing a military vet to the agency is a long shot--but it’ll be good press just letting him try out. That’s what I tell my family, rather than admit I can’t get the letter he wrote us five years ago out of my head. But what I tell the bartender in his hometown is a lie. I know veterans protect each other. So I pretend to be a graduate student. Sparks. Flame. Fire. I accidentally got in too deep.I didn’t expect to develop feelings for Gunner Camden.And there’s no way I can admit to my lies now, not without destroying what we share. So I’ll keep faking it.***There are two versions of me: before, and after deployment.Back then I was a screwup kid. I’d lie, cheat, and steal my way out of everything. My only love was baseball.After I started fighting, I found out there had been another path for me. One that involved my dream. But by then I had seen too much.
