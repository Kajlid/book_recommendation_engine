Those bad decisions have haunted him ever since. No matter what he does, people still see him as the town’s screw up. The boy that sold his soul to the Devil. Years later, he’s turned himself around. Made amends and ultimately turned into a generally good guy. Only, it’s hard to act like a good guy when people still treat you like the old you, and not the new you.Enter Waylynn Jennings.Waylynn has watched Darby Valentine from afar for a very long time.She’s witnessed the changes in him and knows the only reason he’s so mean is to protect the man that lies within. A battered, injured soul that deserves more than what he’s received. Even his own family takes him for granted.She’s made it her new mission in life to prove to everyone that Darby isn’t the bad guy. That he’s a kind-hearted, sweet soul that’s just looking for a place to fit in.Only, Darby is fairly sure that Waylynn is out to kill him, not help him. How else do you explain all the fights he’s having to break up on her behalf, or all the times he has to come to her rescue when she’s managed to put her cute little butt right in the middle of something where it shouldn’t be?There’s obviously only one solution. He has to make her his. Then everyone will know not to mess with her. Darby Valentine protects what’s his. No matter what the cost.",
