And that they were willing to share? Nope, couldn’t be happening. She must’ve hit her head harder than she’d realized because something was clearly messing with her usually sensible thought processes.But how the hell could she explain the crazy way she heard their thoughts in her head? Or the inexplicable way her body reacted to them all even though they were absolutely not her type? Oh, and, yeah, the wild, blazingly hot dreams of foursomes? They totally sucked.So why then, when faced with a chance to reclaim her quiet life, was Andrea suddenly desperate to make Xavier, Daegan, and Isaac live up to their promise of forever?Note: There is no sexual relationship or touching for titillation between or among siblings.Genre: ParanormalLength: 33,266 words** A Siren Erotic Romance **",
