  "description": "Those who enter the Gabriel H. Penn Home for Childhood only get to leave one way...In the near future the gap between rich and poor has become insurmountable. Life as a street child in the big city is only made bearable by who, and what, you know. And by the rumour circulating of a haven for children, a place of true safety. This rumour appears to be nothing more than a fairy-tale until Devin, and his new friend Kit, meet someone who promises to take them there. But when Devin and Kit arrive they begin to understand the real price of safety...A disconcerting vision and a beautifully imagined novel of suspense and adventure from debut author, Tania Unsworth.",
