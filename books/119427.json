  "description": "Raven Baxter may seem like a typical teen, except for one little thing: She's psychic! But what she foresees isn't often what she gets. When Raven has a vision that her friend Eddie fails his Spanish test, it's up to her to keep him from going loco. And when Raven envisions her little brother's ill will toward her, will a surprise from the zoo tame his animal behavior?",
