  "description": "Immigrant Dreams & Alien Nightmares documents twenty-five years of José Torres-Tama’s performance poetry in his unique bilingual voice. Labeled a “Permanent Resident Alien” when entering GringoLandia at age 7 in 1968, Torres-Tama’s work explores the psychic, physical, and open wounds of an Ecuadorian immigrant balancing two languages and cultures—challenging the United States to realize its mythic ideals as the beacon of democracy. Inspired by writers like Ntozake Shange, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, and Martín Espada, his poems document migratory leaps from Guayaquil, Ecuador to New York City, where his family owned a coffee wagon business in Union Square, and Jersey City, where his teen-age rites of passage forged his urban warrior persona, to the Caribbean-influenced port city of New Orleans, his muse and adopted home since 1984.",
