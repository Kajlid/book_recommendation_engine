  "description": "A Love as Bold as a Texas Sunset . . . Ex-army medic Katya Smith has always healed other people's pain. Now she has to deal with her own. Taking a job as an athletic trainer on the Pro Bull Riding circuit seems like the perfect escape from her grief—except Katya doesn't know anything about bulls, and even less about the tough men who ride them. She doesn't expect to fall for the sport, or for one tantalizing cowboy who tumbles her defenses. For rodeo champion Cam Cahill, fifteen years of bucking bulls have taken their toll on his body. Before he retires, he wants a final chance at the world title—and he doesn't need some New Age gypsy telling him how to do his job. But when the stunning trainer with the magical hands repairs more than his worn muscles, everything changes. Soon Cam finds himself trying to persuade Katya to forgive her past so she can build a future . . . with him.\"Touchingly real. Tender and timely. Laura Drake creates characters you know you've met and you have to root for.\" -Pamela Morsi, USA Today bestselling author on The Sweet Spot\"An emotionally packed story that will pull all the heartstrings.\" -Christie Craig, New York Times bestselling author on The Sweet Spot",
