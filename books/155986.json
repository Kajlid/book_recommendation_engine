  "description": "When the green dragon Sylla discovers an orphaned human baby, she adopts him and raises him as her own. Wiermig grows up a child of two worlds, but the dragons are a dying race whose existence has been forgotten by men. Wiermig fulfills the expectations of the elder wierms by following the path of a fledgling dragon, first traveling the land with his uncle in disguise and then setting out on his own to learn his destiny from the Seeker in the Deep. Along the way he encounters demons, witches, and pirates as well as dragons, each with a part to play in changing Wiermig's life.  The past returns to shape the future when Erozur, the black dragon who devastated Weshura in an ancient war, resumes his bloody campaign against wierms and men. Wiermig, now a young bard, embarks on a dangerous journey to defeat Erozur, not with swords or strength, but with the knowledge he possesses and a powerful relic left by a long dead champion from the past.",
