  "title": "Rough Surrender",
  "description": "One master, one woman who craves surrender, and a sky that will challenge them both. At a time when airplanes are as new-fangled and sensational as the telephone, Faith dares to fly. The one territory she has not explored is her own sexuality. In Leonhardt she discovers the man who can teach her how a woman surrenders her body and her mind. However, Leonhardt has a shadowed past and his own learning to do. He doesn't have the right to keep Faith from flying, even if he thinks airplanes are flimsy death-traps made of canvas, timber and their inventor's prayers. Faith has her limits, Leonhardt has his flaws, and sometimes the nicest people get murdered by unscrupulous bastards. Even if Leonhardt can save the woman he loves, the battle for Faithâ€™s heart will be the hardest one of all.  BDSM, anal sex, orgasms galore, and a Dom who likes to claim his property with pen, ink and bondage.",
