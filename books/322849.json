  "title": "Ben Baker's Christmas Box: 40 Years Of The Best, Worst And Weirdest Christmas TV Ever",
  "description": "Join Ben Baker for a rustle through the selection box of stars, genres, movies, cliches, one-offs and programmes that made up the 20th century Christmas TV experience. From the obvious to the ridiculous, these are the British telly things which made us feel festive with everything from Noel Edmonds' seasonal sweaters, the rise and rise of Del Boy and the Trotters, The Box of Delights and other children's classics, music from The Beatles to B*Witched, the madness of the Muppets, the Queen's greatest hits, game show giveaways, how the UK celebrated New Year on the small screen and every major Christmas Day movie from 1960 to 1999. Plus lots more.",
