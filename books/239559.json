  "description": "On December 23, 1946, Charles Reynolds murdered his pregnant wife in a houseful of party-goers, then committed suicide. Neither the house nor the powerful Reynolds family have ever recovered.Twenty-five years later, a car accident forces four friends to take shelter from an approaching storm in the abandoned Reynolds house. Married couple Michael and Susan Wright, nurse Linda Vincent, and her brother, Vietnam vet and PTSD sufferer Johnny Vincent, are too smart to believe in the supernatural, but they might have a change of mind. The car crash wasn't an accident: Johnny, Linda, Michael, and Susan have been chosen as pawns in a dangerous battle of wills. As the darkness falls, each will be tested - fighting not only for their lives, but for their sanity.",
