After getting out of his crappy trailer park on the back of his alcoholic father’s bike, he spent two years travelling around the country before finding the Iron Raiders.

Austin, for the first time in his life, can’t get her out of his head, and he decides to pursue her. Meanwhile, outside forces start to threaten the club, and it will take everyone to ensure the future of the Iron Raiders.As Austin begins to fight for the only things he’s ever wanted, it will take everything he’s got to prove his loyalty, to the club and to Ellie.",
