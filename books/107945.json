  "description": "Perhaps there is no other word hiding as much power as the word Dream. Dream may be the most secret desire of our hearts and souls that makes our lives more beautiful and gives us a reason to smile every day. Dream may be the power that drives us to accomplice our ambitions and always fuels us with the strength to go on, until we reach our goal. But Dream may also be the darkest and most terrifying of our fears that haunts us and makes us numb, when it transforms into a nightmare. In this treatise, the dreamer steps from the vertigo of Eros, the cruel god of love, into the world of Dreams and the Realm of Morpheus who rules it. Facing his fears and overcoming them steps out into the light, under the rays of Apollo, the god of the Sun and knowledge of future things to come, and into reality that unfortunately cannot be escaped but in Dreams.",
