  "title": "The Sweetness of Venus: A History of the Clitoris",
  "description": "For millennia, scientists thought women were inside-out versions of men, and male anxiety about female sexuality generated ludicrous ideas and perpetuated inaccurate information. The Sweetness of Venus is a provocative, straight-talking history that exposes the denial, misunderstanding, brutality, and lies endured by this taboo part of human anatomy.Much of the story of the clitoris has been defined by those who discovered and mapped her. However, even after the true anatomy of the clitoris was finally fully mapped with 3D imaging in 2005, it still hardly gets a mention in America's bestselling teen sex education book for girls, and no mention at all in the parallel book for boys. Equality when it comes to sex has not been achieved.This book challenges Western culture's definition of female sexuality and will have you laughing out loud, shouting \"clitoris!\" with abandon, and championing sex equality and pleasure for all.",
