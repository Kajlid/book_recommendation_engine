  "description": "VERSES FROM A DEEPLY DARKENED MIND Yes, “Deeply Darkened.” These are the words which reside within the depths of a mind haunted. A haunting, of neither the ethereal persuasion, nor the ghosts of a hidden and unrelenting past. Here before you, etched upon parchment, are verse written from a mind haunted by “words.” This tome is unlike your typical, modern day collection of “Horror Poetry.” It is rather an assemblage of “Horror Stories” written in poetic form. Written to tease that final nerve, before the fatal break. Ah, yes. Here, this “DEEPLY DARKENED MIND,” who with pen in hand (black ink a must), has taken meter and rhyme to send a heartbeat racing in terror from one page to the next. “DEEPLY DARKENED,” is my mind, my world; and I offer you entrance. That’s right… Turn my page… Crack my spine… I want you to cringe, squirm, look over your shoulder into the shadows and dare you to shut out the lights once this cover has been closed. This “DEEPLY DARKENED MIND,” bids you “welcome.” Yes, join me… in my darkness… Mary Genevieve Fortier",
