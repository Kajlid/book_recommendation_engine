  "title": "With Murderous Intent",
  "description": "n the 1991 true crime With Murderous Intent, author Robert Hemming recounts an all too familiar the tale of a greedy husband whose only goal is to profit from the \"unfortunate, accidental\" death of his wife. What gives this story its uniqueness is how the murderer, David Richard Davis, planned and schemed his wife's, Shannon Mohr Davis, murder and managed to elude authorities for eight long years. Although a bit tedious at times with (too) detailed backgrounds on cops and others for whom I could have lived without, With Murderous Intent holds strong as a must read as it focuses as much on efforts of the victim's family as it does on the crime itself. -- True Crime Book Reviews",
