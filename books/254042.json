What they learn is helpful but incomplete. The story of their past is hidden deeply within the Varangian Cross, and Sophia must have it to fully understand the connection that Justin and Lucy share. However, the cross is with its new owner in London and far too valuable to be loaned out for such an implausible tale.Disappointed, they prepare to return to London and confront the challenges from which they fled, resigned to leave the past behind, but the struggles of the past seem determined to revisit them. Justin and Lucy are meant to be together. They are meant to know their past. The cross is the key to unlocking their story, and the source of their eternal and unbreakable bond. Join Justin and Lucy as they put together the pieces to uncover their epic love story in Always With You, the trilogyâ€™s poignant and passionate conclusion. Note to readers: This book contains scenes which may be triggering to survivors of sexual violence.",
