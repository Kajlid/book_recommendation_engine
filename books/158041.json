  "description": "Given the choice between chocolate or sex, Rebecca always chose chocolate. That is, until a series of transformational experiences caused her to let go of three decades of sexual repression and shame. A serendipitous encounter with a Brazilian man sets the stage for a six-year journey toward the discovery of a new sexual and spiritual truth and a love that comes full circle. Set against the backdrop of Buenos Aires and London, with the soulful music of the blues intricately woven throughout the journey, this book is more than just a captivating love story. Healing sources of spiritual guidance accompany the joyful and romantic ride. Deeply intimate, insightful, and enriched with playful humor, this story invites readers to not only engage in the beauty of one womanâ€™s journey of self-discovery, but to embark on their own journey toward living life to the fullest and highest degree possible.",
