  "description": "Pride hasn't had an easy life. No matter what he does, things seem to go bad. This time, though, he's not sure he can get out of his predicament, and he figures he might just have to call it quits. Bear is a mountain of a man, making a home where most folks woudn't, and he comes across Pride right when the other man's irons are all hanging in the fire. Bear doesn't even hesitate, he just barges in and saves Pride's bacon, taking the man home with him to give him a second chance. Or third or fourth. When they get snowed in for the winter, they figure they have plenty of time to get to know one another. They laugh, learn, and love, both of them finding it incredibly easy to get to know all about the other. It's not all easy with these two hard-headed men. Pride lives up to his name, and Bear is just as stubborn. They can survive their petty struggles, but will the bigger demons in Bear's past tear them apart before the spring thaws come? Kiernan Kelly spins a great tale of the late 1800s in Colorado, with a heartwarming relationship that will keep the home fires burning for a long time to come.",
