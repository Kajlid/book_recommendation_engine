Along his journey, he meets LaRae DuFont, a famous show dancer, who tells him a story in which Mary Magdalene thought Jesus was a gardener, teaching Andrew that not everything is as it seems. This lesson will change his life forever. An uncontrollable twist of fate separates the two lovers and leads Andrew to wander again.

However, her ex-husband has placed a fiendish curse on Iris and Andrew soon finds himself trapped within the enchantment.
