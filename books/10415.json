  "description": "There is a thin line between justice and vengeance. In a vast universe of advanced weaponry and superior technology, a century-old dispute causes two powerful armies to speed past that line in furor. With the defeat of the Kulusk Empire, the First Osguard, Michael Genesis, and the Universal Science, Security Trade Association of Planets -- USSTAP face their greatest military challenge ever -- the Tuit Consortium. In the name of justice, the Tuits introduce a new era of war fighting, employing a planet killing weapon, which obliterates entire solar systems within minutes. USSTAP is outnumbered and outgunned. With the association disintegrating; the continuing rise in the USSTAP body count; and Osguard 11, Jarod Stone missing and presumed killed in action, Michael forms a daring military plan and forges unlikely allies to combat the Tuits and end the Universal War once and for all.",
