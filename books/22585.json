  "description": "On the eve of her graduation from college, Marshall Sullivan celebrates her success and blissfully ignores the weight of her bills, no job and no clue how to use her B.A. in English. In the midst of the celebrations, Marshall has the first of several hardheaded run-ins with Gabriel Somers. Marshall's inability to turn off her klutz switch leads to a job as the only female courier in the firm where Gabriel works and creates a lasting impression on him that deepens into love. Through it all, Marshall relies on the advice of her roommate, Sam, and her grandmother-by-proxy, Marva. Ultimately, her future is of her own making, and Marshall must find her own inner compass to guide her. As Marshall attempts to win over the male bike messengers, manage her growing relationship with Gabriel and face the uncertainty of life after college, she transitions from student to actualized adult.",
