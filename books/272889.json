  "description": "Playing a malicious diva on a popular daytime soap, actress Kelly Trent has garnered more than her fair share of hate mail. She doesn't believe anyone would really confuse her with her character, but when an accident on the set hits too close for the producers' comfort, Kelly is unceremoniously put on hiatus.At her agents suggestion, she agrees to appear in a music video, thinking the time away filming in the Florida Keys might be just the thing to put her life in perspective. But with two left feet, Kelly only hopes dance instructor Doug O'Casey can work miracles.A former Miami cop Doug still has a lawman's instinct for trouble, and the continued threats made against Kelly tell him that she is in danger. Now, as a deranged fan closes in, Doug realizes that someone close to Kelly wants more than her character killed off the show--someone wants her stone-cold dead.",
