  "description": "StoneyI learned the hard way to never trust a woman. They don’t do anything but cause headaches and heartbreak. I know this from firsthand experience. To top it all off, I see a pattern with these bitches lying too. Which is why I swore to never let another woman into my life. While they might be in my bed, they'll never be in my heart. I refuse to go through it all over again. You know what they say about history repeating itself? Well, yeah, I always get the short end of the stick when it comes to lying, no good women. Call me an ass if you want but I’ll never have to deal with someone like Horse's mom ever again.I had a great plan and I was doing just fine until a woman I never expect waltzes in my life. From the first moment, I knew something was different and she came crashing through my walls, breaking down the defenses I had set in place for a reason. I don't know why the fuck I did it, but I claimed her, and now she's my property. She belongs to me. Question is, can I trust her, or will she lie and deceive me the way every other woman in my life has before herOnly time will tell.",
