  "title": "Ulalume",
  "description": "Ulalume\" is a poem written by Edgar Allan Poe in 1847. Much like a few of Poe's other poems (such as \"The Raven\", \"Annabel Lee\", and \"Lenore\"), \"Ulalume\" focuses on the narrator's loss of his beloved due to her death. Poe originally wrote the poem as an elocution piece and, as such, the poem is known for its focus on sound. Additionally, it makes many allusions, especially to mythology, and the identity of Ulalume herself, if a real person, has been a subject of debate.",
