  "description": "Take a road trip with a small-town mechanic and a prince on the run in the Kings of Carolina Box Set,  Between a Rock and a Royal (Book 1) Blue Bloods and Backroads (Book 2) BETWEEN A ROCK AND A ROYAL A foreign prince on the run, a local girl in a serious jam, and a ’65 Mustang headed for Georgia. What could go wrong?  How my brother talked me into ditching our security team and embarking on this ridiculous adventure, I haven’t a clue. But it’s my duty to keep the idiot safe—something made even more difficult now that we’re stranded in the middle of nowhere with a local mechanic as our only hope. But this wrench-wielding beauty has problems of her own and a smile that might make me forget my obligations entirely. > With one look at Leo Baxter, I know down to my cherry-painted toes that he and his pain-in-the ass brother are nothing but trouble. Given my family’s dire circumstances, however, I’ve got little choice but to take these rich country-club rejects up on their offer. A fat stack of cash in exchange for a ride through the mountains. How bad could it be? BLUE BLOODS AND BACKROADS Love is a four-letter word. So is jerk. The only thing worse than a guy sneaking out in the middle of the night is finding he left a fat stack of cash as his only goodbye. Well, Leo Baxter can take that blue-blood money and whatever connection we had and shove it where the sun don’t shine. It’s time to focus on hunting down my jailbird cousin, saving the family business, and keeping my uncle from taking a one-way trip to crazy town. Luckily, I’ve got some help from an unexpected source. I’m gonna wrap this up, tuck my heart away, and get back to real life… not the fairytale I was stupid enough to start believing in. It shouldn’t have come as a surprise. Being used and exploited for my name and position is, unfortunately, not a new experience. But I thought Ruby was different—which is what makes her deception cut so deep. Now it’s time for damage control and for Malcolm and me to go home and attend to our duties. Life is less complicated when you stay on the straight and narrow. Too bad those winding backroads are calling my name, and there’s only one person my heart wants to travel them with. Books 1 and 2 cover Ruby and Leo's entire hot and hilarious story. And, of course, it comes with an HEA!",
