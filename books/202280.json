  "description": "The Brown Brothers, Chad and Brad, are two private investigators on the road, looking for love, adventure and a cure for Chad’s terminal disease … before it’s too late. But when they come across the small town of Turtle, Texas, their lives will never be the same… The night before the happy merger of the bride and groom of the two most influential families in West Texas, wedding bells turn to gunshots as post-rehearsal dinner drinking goes terribly wrong, ending in a bloody massacre — and the bride’s mysterious disappearance. Into the fray stumble Brad and Chad Brown, two private investigators with a live cover band … as a cover. It’s up to the bumbling Brothers, one alive and one undead, to solve the mystery of the massacre, find the bride, save this town and themselves, before Chad — or anyone else — dies.",
