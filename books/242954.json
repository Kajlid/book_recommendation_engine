  "description": "Dear Reader,Considering that I'm married to Cedar Cove's private investigator, you might think I enjoy mysteries.But I don't -- especially when they involve us!Roy's been receiving anonymous postcards and messages asking if we \"regret the past.\"We don't know what they mean....On a more positive note, we're both delighted that our daughter, Linnette, has moved to Cedar Cove to work at the new medical clinic. A while ago I attended the humane society's \"Dog and Bachelor Auction,\" where I bought her a date with Cal Washburn, who works at Cliff Harding's horse farm. Unfortunately Linnette is less enthusiastic about this date than I am.Speaking of Cliff, the romance between him and Grace Sherman is back on. But that's only one of the many interesting stories here in Cedar Cove. So why don't you drop by for a coffee at my husband's office on Main Street or our house on Harbor and I'll tell you everything that's new!Corrie",
