  "description": "After releasing the first book, Jimmy Tudeski assumed the project was over, but due to popular demand and after being nominated for a small comedy award in somewhere like Outer Mongolia, he's back with a second instalment.You can expect a lot more confusing rants, a lot more of his artist doodles, where we've asked him to once again deliver his stand up comedy routine inside a book, then be even more controversial with it. In this one he fights back against bad reviewers, lets a friend randomly interview him, does more with astrology in his own special way, then goes head to head with bra cup sizes and Santa Claus.A book like no other, where Jimmy once again risks it all, simply to entertain his readers the only way he knows how. He said it couldn't be done, he said he didn't have enough material for a second book, yet here it is, proving it's not just his comedy that goes wrong.",
