  "description": "It’s been eight years since I last saw him; Jaxson Stone. His departure from my life catapulted a string of events that nearly destroyed me. In a way they did destroy me; I’ll never be the person I was before. I thought seeing him again was just a coincidence, but apparently I thought wrong. Before I knew it the person I fell in love with all those years ago was engrossed in my life making it feel whole and meaningful again. Unfortunately with someone from my past set on controlling me, that new life might not be as prefect and long-lasting as I thought. Am I fated to be with my lost, but never forgotten love? Alone, miserable and hurting? Or under the watchful eye of my enemy?",
