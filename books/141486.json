  "description": "In this fourth collection of stories, Simon Strantzas establishes himself as one of the most dynamic figures in contemporary weird fiction. The nine stories in this volume exhibit Strantzas’s wide range in theme and subject matter, from the Lovecraftian “Thistle’s Find” to the Robert W. Chambers homage “Beyond the Banks of the River Seine.” But Strantzas’s imagination, while drawing upon the best weird fiction of the past, ventures into new territory in such works as “On Ice,” a grim novella of arctic horror; “One Last Bloom,” a grisly account of a scientific experiment gone hideously awry; and the title story, an emotionally wrenching account of terror and loss in the baked Mexican desert. With this volume, Strantzas lays claim to be discussed in the company of Caitlín R. Kiernan and Laird Barron as one of the premier weird fictionists of our time.ContentsIntroduction “Dig My Grave,” by Laird Barron“On Ice”“Dwelling on the Past”“Strong as a Rock By Invisible Hands”“One Last Bloom”“Thistle’s Find”“Beyond the Banks of the River Seine”“Emotional Dues”“Burnt Black Suns”Cover artwork by Santiago Caruso",
