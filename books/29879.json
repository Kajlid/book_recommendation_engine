  "description": "Recalling a visit to the dangerous Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea, bestselling author Sheri Dew admits that she knew she had gone somewhere she shouldn’t have gone and in doing so had put herself in peril. She uses that frightening personal experience to encourage listeners to stand well back from the line that separates the Lord’s territory from Lucifer’s. Plus, in a special bonus second talk, she reflects on the good that resides in the sisters of the Church. Includes bonus talk, \"If We Build It, They Will Come.\"",
