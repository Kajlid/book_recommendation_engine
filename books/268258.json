  "title": "Paul Destroyed Jesus",
  "description": "Jesus came to set the world free with TWO BASIC TRUTHS:1. That his Father—not the Yahweh of the Jews or any other gods—is the “One True God”;2.That he—Jesus—is “the Messiah” sent by his Father to bring the fullness of life to the world.But then came the Apostle Paul and concocted his own “Gospel of Salvation” that practically turned Jesus and his true Mission for the world upside down. Unfortunately, the world falls for his Gospel. And the world suffers.The Apostle Paul is the most destructive force that has ever fallen upon Jesus and his true Mission for the world. The earlier we can resurrect Jesus from the Gospel of Paul, the better for the life of the world.Behold in this book how “Paul’s gospel destroyed Jesus.”Amen.",
