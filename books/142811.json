  "description": "After the Fall of the Days of Tech, the world is a harsh and desolate place. Protected behind a massive Gate, the citizens of GateWide live out their days in the shadow of an evil Sovereign. When Mathew unexpectedly becomes a Stray, his whole life changes. Suddenly he must leave behind everything he’s ever known or face life as a slave in the Sovereign’s House. His only chance is to escape into the wilderness, but with no skills to help him endure that harsh and dangerous environment, there is little hope that he’ll survive. When he stumbles across a fellow Stray, one with a strange need to do the right thing even if it endangers her own life, he thinks he just might have a chance. But he soon discovers that the forbidden device that he possesses puts him in far more danger than he ever imagined. Hunted by the Sovereign’s Enforcers and surrounded by mutated creatures in the vast wilderness, Mathew must learn to do more than just survive. He must find a way to live.",
