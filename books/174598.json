  "description": "Colin has a dark side… one that takes me places I've never been  Everyone thinks Colin Fairgood is exactly what his PR machine tells them—a country superstar with a killer smile and dazzling blue eyes.  But I met him before his country makeover and the fame. Colin has a dark side… one that takes me places I've never been. One that makes me want to do very bad things with him. One that makes me scared of him. And even more scared of myself.  I don't know what kind of endgame he's running on my heart, but he's definitely playing for keeps. And if I'm not careful, he's going to win.  But what happens when he finds out about my past? And discovers all my secrets?  One thing’s for sure: when country superstar Colin Fairgood collides with me, a songwriter with everything to lose, it’s going to be one hell of a story.  Reader Beware: This dark romance is not for the faint of heart or sensitive. It's guaranteed to please those who prefer extra hot loving with a wickedly kinky hero. But seriously, do not One-Click the heat unless you know how to handle the FLAME!",
