  "description": "Move over wild women and women who do too With this irreverent tribute, author Brenda Knight casts a lovingly arch eye at the women who have devoted their lives to books. From Sylvia Beach and other booksellers to librarians, editors, writers, bibliophiles, and celebrated book clubs, Knight takes readers on a ribald ride through the pages of history. Chapter titles include \"Prolific Pens\" (such as Joyce Carol Oates, author of over 100 books); \"Mystics, Memoirists and Madwomen\"; \"Salons and Neosalons\"; \"Ink in Their Veins\" (literary dynasties); and the titillating \"Banned, Blacklisted, and Arrested.\"",
