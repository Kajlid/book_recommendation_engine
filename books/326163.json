  "description": "Have you ever had a dream where it felt so real, that it leaves you questioning reality when you wake up? Yeah, well…welcome to my world.After almost dying like a noob in my last boss fight and having serious heart to hearts with NPC’s, the wires between reality and fantasy are starting to blur. I mean seriously, who in their right mind begins to develop real feelings for video game characters?As if that isn’t enough, the game decides to throw in a tyrannical king, relentless assassins, a looming war, and the remnants of a long lost bloodline.Life is definitely not as simple as it was when all I had to worry about was my pet cactus, two trusty butt plugs, and how to spend my massive inheritance.But then again…It’s just a game, right?",
