  "description": "Raif has always believed in honour and duty. When he is asked to travel to the distant north to wake the dragon Arden from his centuries’ long sleep, he embraces the opportunity. But Arden is not what Raif was expecting: whimsical, mischievous and charming, he frustrates and flusters Raif at every turn.When danger draws them to the lagoon city of Aliann, Raif’s troubles deepen. The city is complex, political, and overwhelming, but he finds himself drawn into its challenges, from the political machinations of its upper classes to the prejudices faced by its refugee population.The city, not unlike its new dragon, is seductive and full of secrets, but when those secrets spill over into violence, it is Raif who is must challenge his own assumptions to save both the city and everyone who lives within it.",
