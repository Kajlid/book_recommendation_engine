Coté deftly weaves the captivating true story of her grandparents’ lives at the turn of the century with her own childhood memories of the Fabulous Fifties and the Seismic Sixties. Her grandmother tells the story of their lives in service to Ambassador and Mrs. Robert Woods Bliss of Dumbarton Oaks, Georgetown, surrounded by sumptuous wealth in mansions and palaces around the globe. As the eldest of four girls in a nurturing, although sometimes contentious three-generation household, Carol transports the reader to a much simpler time.
