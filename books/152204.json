When she finally gets the opportunity to come to America, she doesn't look back. She is sure that America will be great and that she will get the financial prosperity she lacked. At first, it appears that way, but as America continues to unfold, she begins to see a side that no one told her about, a side that causes her to make plans to return to Nigeria.On her first visit back, Deka realizes that she has changed. Irrevocably. She can no longer live in Nigeria the way she had previously done. Since she does not want to live in America either, she arrives at a cross road. Does she continue with her plans to return to Nigeria or does she learn to work with America?",
