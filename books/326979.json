  "description": "Gorgeous, sweet and far too flirtatious, Cody Barnett is absolutely adorable. The perfect guy for some lucky girl, just not me.I'm only in Rockhead Point to get to know my sister. I have a boyfriend, a job and a life, hours away from this tiny mountain town.Only the more time I spend with the Barnetts; the more I see that their world is full of the type of love I thought only existed in films; and seeing it is making me wonder if my happy ever after, is really as happy as I thought it is.When betrayal leaves me heartbroken and questioning everything, Cody stays at my side, ready to be my rock, my shoulder to cry on and so much more. He's determined to offer me all the colors in the rainbow, but I'm not looking for a fling, and that's all that we can be.So, I run. Away from my sister, away from her new family and away from the man who says I'm his.But it doesn't matter how fast I run, because fate will still catch me and right now it's knocking on my door. It turns out Cody isn't prepared to give me up, and no matter how hard I fight him, I'm not sure I can escape the love of a mountain man.",
