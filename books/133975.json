  "description": "As the last dragon left, Laeka’Draeon holds the key to finding his missing kin and restoring the magical barriers of the towers of Klonnoth Aire. The problem is he has no memory of his past, or what happened the fateful day the dragons disappeared and the towers fell silent.With the surrounding kingdoms in disarray, and strange terrors spreading across the lands, Laeka’Draeon has no choice but to take action. If the barriers of Klonnoth Aire are not restored, the consequences could bring about the return of an ancient and devastating enemy.Finding aid in the unlikeliest of allies, including a spirited unicorn filly, a colossal forest guardian, and an eerie-eyed phantom, Laeka’Draeon braves unknown and often dangerous realms in search of answers, and quickly finds himself swept up in an adventure far bigger than he could have ever imagined.",
