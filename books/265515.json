  "description": "In the land of gods and monsters, she was a toy. A plaything. A pet.  His pet.  Taken, stolen, beaten, used.  Pet remembers nothing before his touch, and afterward she craves nothing more.  Sinful and merciless, Ares is her god now. He alone says when to beg, when to come, and when to kneel, but he never said anything about leaving.   Warning: In the Land of Gods and Monsters is a dark romance novel. It contains strong sexual themes, dubious consent, graphic violence, and may contain triggers for some readers.",
