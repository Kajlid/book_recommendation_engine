  "description": "Childlike Faith for Grownup Miracles is full of contemporary examples of childlike faith in operation and the unfolding of the miraculous in some of toughest areas of life.  Learn how 1. Believe God for the Salvation of Loved Ones Sometimes we have to get out of the way and let God do what only He can. One person may plant a seed, another may water the seed, but God is the One who brings the increase of souls through radical rescue.  2. Forgive the Unforgivable Being radically rescued not only includes being forgiven and made whole from the pain we’ve inflicted on ourselves, but also taking the sting out of the hurt inflicted by others and replacing it with unmistakable joy and freedom.  3. Restore Hope for Fertility When God makes a promise, we must hold on to it and hope in the face of shame, condemnation, guilt and any other negative report. We must receive God’s will for our lives.  4. Recover from Infidelity Receiving Christ in our lives doesn’t mean we won’t face difficulties but we should be courageous in the face of adversity knowing the God has over come them all. Often our greatest victories come in the middle of our greatest trials.  5. Trust God for Financial Breakthrough God made provisions for a lifestyle of abundance that’s connected to serving His kingdom. He wants to ensure that whatever we put our hands to prospers and that the timing of our endeavors is perfectly in line with the yes of heaven. It pays to serve God and to honor God with our words and actions.  6. Be Sensitive to The Spirit A wise person doesn’t try to figure out everything on her own but realizes that God is a god of order and principle. Recognizing, adopting, and implementing systems that God put in place shows that we trust His ways over ours. This sensitivity guides us into the truth for our specific circumstances to ensure our success.  7. Resurrect Your Dreams It’s never too late or too early to follow our God-given dreams. Often plans fail for lack of counsel and advisers. God is prepared to give the clarity we seek when we patiently await His response and His strategies.  When Chantale Williams rededicated her life to God in January 2007, she was fascinated by how God began constantly revealing Himself to her through His miraculous power. As she shared some of her testimonies a coworker made this profound “God spoils baby Christians.” Immediately Chantale envisioned a newborn baby and a loving parent. She imagined the parent doing everything for the baby, like diaper changing and bottle feeding, trying to establish trust and make a connection with their child. Chantale wondered if babies really do milk it, or whether parents just enjoy spoiling them.  With a daughter that was less than a year old at the time, Chantale likened God’s love to the love she had for her unconditional. Chantale reasoned that if God really does spoil baby Christians, then she would not miss out on this part of her journey—She was going to milk it through great expectation. And just like a doting parent establishing a relationship and fostering dependence, God held her hand and began walking her through this way of life.  The more she got to know Him, the more He became her master orchestrator. Chantale remains amazed by His attention to detail and the way He weaves the lives of others into hers with such impeccable timing and harmony.  Chantale realized that her journey as a baby Christian has been a journey of childlike faith. With every baby step she took in faith, God performed a very grown-up miracle.",
