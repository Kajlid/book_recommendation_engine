  "description": "HARLEYWhat happens when the most successful boy band on the planet breaks up?How about twenty thousand fans screaming my name.But the price of fame comes with an increased risk to my safety.I’ve been avoiding the dreaded B word for as long as I can, but after a close call with a rambunctious fan, I can’t do it anymore.It’s time to give in.I need to hire a full-time bodyguard.And when he shows up, he not only screams badass, he’s another B word I try to stay away from: boyfriend material. BRIXProtecting people is not what my company usually does, but the boss knows I need money, and the pop star is offering an insane amount to live with him and make sure no more crazy fans break into his house.I’m doing it for the money and nothing else.He may be the prettiest man I’ve ever seen, and I may feel sorry for the celebrity life he’s been forced into since he was a teenager, but that doesn’t mean anything.Just because he fascinates me, that doesn’t mean I like him.It doesn’t.Professionalism. I’m gonna live it. Breathe it. Enforce it … Mostly.",
