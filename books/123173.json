Both Layla and Noor are passionate about getting their guide completed so it can help those in need, but Laylah treats their project with an urgency Noor doesn’t understand—that may have something to do with the strange goings-on between their mosque and a local politician.Fighting for what they believe in may involve even more obstacles than they bargained for, but the two best friends will continue as they always together.",
