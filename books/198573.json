  "description": "College student Kalinda is a cat shifter, but she doesn’t turn into anything big or scary like a jaguar or a panther or a lion—no, she’s a sweet little housecat with a hankering for milk, who just wants to find the right woman who won’t rub her fur the wrong way.  While exploring as a cat one night, she finds Amber in the passionate embrace of another woman. Kalinda can’t help but watch from a tree outside Amber’s bedroom. She tracks Amber down later, determined to seduce her and win her heart. They have the beginnings of a purr-fect romance, but if Kalinda tells Amber the truth, will Amber be able to accept her, fur and all?",
