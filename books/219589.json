  "description": "A young woman is found brutally murdered in the close-knit college town of Hensley Grove, Kentucky. But she wasnâ€™t the first in a series of shockingly similar killings occurring over a span of nearly sixty years. The main suspect is the father of college student and graffiti artist, Tango Baldwin. Her dad is notorious for breaking into houses, and he has seemed to vanish into thin air. But could he be a cold-blooded murderer too? Desperate to clear her family name, Tango begins investigating the murders while secretly trying to redeem her dream of dancing and staying one step ahead of the local police painting her town in graffiti. As she digs deeper into the mystery, she finds herself torn between two loves-a mysterious stranger and a man whose motives for being in Hensley Grove may be deadly for Tango and her friends. Ultimately, Tango begins to uncover more town secrets than she bargained for and secrets that lead her right on to the trail of the killer.",
