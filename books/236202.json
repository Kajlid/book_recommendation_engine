  "title": "The Time Machine",
  "description": "A scientist and gentleman inventor in industrialized Victorian England claims to have irrefutable proof that time is not simply a concept - it's a whole other dimension. When he reveals the prototype of a time-traveling machine to his peers, he's met with skepticism at first ... until he returns one week later, disheveled, bloody, and with a fantastic story to tell.A cornerstone of speculative science fiction, The Time Machine launched the time-traveling genre, influenced generations of writers, and is recognized as a prescient vision of twenty-first-century fears - those of an impending environmental nightmare and the irreversible fate of a dying planet.Revised edition: Previously published as The Time Machine, this edition of The Time Machine (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions.",
