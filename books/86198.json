  "title": "Old Man On Campus: A middle-aged engineer blunders into medicine, goes back to college at 58, and becomes a physician assistant",
  "description": "At some point, many of us consider doing something radically different with our lives. This book is a sometimes humorous, sometimes poignant, first person account of what happens when you are 58 years old, quit your job, move away from home, and go back to college as a physician assistant student with strangers less than half your age. The book details the twisted path from being a frequent childhood medical casualty to finally leaving home for school at a time when others might be thinking of retiring to play golf. Told as it happens, the story describes medical training and what it feels like to be going through it. New experiences evoke old memories, while new friends, preceptors, and patients teach important new lessons. The book comes full circle with a view of what it is like to be a PA, one of U.S. News & World Report’s “50 hottest careers.”The story is told from a perspective that hopefully will help others follow their own twisted paths, whatever they might be.",
