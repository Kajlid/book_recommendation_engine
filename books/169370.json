  "description": "WHEN YOU LOVE TWO MEN, THE STAKES ARE HIGHER.  I love Beast and Muscle. The two brutal Warlords of the Bedlam Butchers have taken me into their arms and their life. Nothing can ruin my happiness…except the rest of the club. They’re tough, rowdy, and everything I’m not. It’s clear I need to fit in or hit the road, because I can’t make my guys choose between me and the Butchers.  To make matters worse, cocky, outrageous Muscle has shut down entirely. Something’s bothering him, bringing war flashbacks with it, and it’s threatening to destroy our fragile new relationship.  One thing’s for sure. I may be down, but I’m definitely not out. And I’ll fight to the death for my men if I have to.
