  "title": "Drug Crazy: How We Got into This Mess and How We Can Get Out",
  "description": "Drug Crazy is a scathing indictment of America's decades-long \"war on drugs,\" an expensive & hypocritical folly which has essentially benefited only two classes of people: professional anti-drug advocates & drug lords. Did you know that a presidential commission determined that marijuana is neither an addicitve substance nor a \"stepping stone\" to harder drugs only to have President Nixon shelve the embarrassing final report & continue the government's policy of inflated drug addiction statistics? Did you know that several medical experts agree that cold turkey methods of withdrawal are essentially ineffective & recommend simply prescribing drugs to addicts & that communities in which this has been done report lower crime rates & reduced unemployment among addicts as a result? Whether he's writing about the American government's strong-arm tactics toward critics of its drug policy or the reduction of countries like Colombia & Mexico to anarchic killing zones by powerful cartels, Mike Gray's analysis has an immediacy & clarity worth noting. The passage of medical marijuana bills in California & Arizona (where it passed by a nearly 2-to-1 majority) indicates that people are getting fed up with the government's Prohibition-style tactics toward drugs. Drug Crazy just might speed that process along.",
