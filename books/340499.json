  "title": "Love is a Verb: Stories of What Happens When Love Comes Alive",
  "description": "Dr. Gary Chapman has spent his life helping people communicate love more effectively and in turn build more satisfying and lasting relationships. His book The Five Love Languages is a regular on the New York Times bestsellers list--even after being in print for fifteen years--and has made the term \"love language\" a part of everyday speech. Love Is a Verb takes his teaching to the next level. Rather than a typical relationship self-help book filled with lengthy explanations of principles and techniques, it is a compilation of true stories displaying love in action. These stories--written by everyday people--go straight to the hearts of readers, who often say that illustrations are the most effective parts of a book. Gary Chapman adds a \"Love Lesson\" to each story, showing readers how they can apply the same principles to their own relationships.",
