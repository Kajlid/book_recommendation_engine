  "description": "\"I was the FBI’s dirty little secret, until I wasn’t.\" I’m Brennan Collins, but my associates call me Belfast. Perhaps you’ve heard of me? I’ve been known to be everything from a gentleman gangster to a cold-blooded killer. Men fear me and pledge their undying loyalty. Women desire me and the power I possess, but there’s only one worth my time… Agent Georgia Cohn. As tempting as Georgia may be, she’s the definition of off limits. We stand on opposing sides of the law, and I like my side just fine. But when we’re forced to team up to save both our lives, we’re drawn together, complicating an already intense situation. All the reasons for resisting her no longer matter. I take what I want, when I want it. And Georgia is mine. She just doesn’t know it yet. *This is book 1 of a duet. Edge of Forever, book 2 will complete their story*",
