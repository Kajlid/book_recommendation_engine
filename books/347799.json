  "description": "Neil Bartlett's 1990 novel Ready to Catch Him Should He Fall is now a classic of modern gay writing. In that book, Bartlett's intelligence, wit, and imagination dazzled and seduced us. Now, in The House on Brooke Street he has again found ways to startle and surprise us. At first glance it is a love story between two London men that stretches over 30 years, but Brooke Street turns out to also be an examination of how history and sex, secrets and fantasy, merge to form the basis of what we call everyday life. Bartlett is that rare find: a brilliant writer who is interested in the life of the body as well as the mind.",
