  "description": "My boss, John Powers, represents everything I want in a man. He’s the CEO and founder of a powerful company, that position having made him a billionaire, striking in an I-survived-a-bar-brawl sort of way, and too clever for my sanity. I’m his assistant and desperately in love with him. I’d willingly serve him both in the boardroom and in the bedroom. There’s one problem. He doesn’t mix business with pleasure. Ever.  The Good Assistant is Book 2 in the City Sizzle series and is a STANDALONE story. You can read it on its own. It is also a Billionaire Contemporary Erotic Romance.",
