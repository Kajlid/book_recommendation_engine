  "description": "Armed with a floral-print Bible cover, Julia must pretend to be “born again” for her Christian housemates—EMT Mark and his church-lady mom. Their place is within walking distance (cough, stalking distance) of Dylan, her latest musician crush. Mark is a cute Christian guy who knows she’s faking her faith. But he needs someone like her to crash his boring life. So he becomes her friend and brings her to his Evangelical church. Hiding her Catholic past, she bumbles her way through hand-raising worship. Other times she sneaks into Mass. Meanwhile, Mark tries to explain how to be “saved.” (Sure, she needs saving—from her alcoholic dad, her copier-jamming job, and Mark’s suspicious mom.) But does he just want to save her? Or date her?Then Dylan shows up and sings her a song. Suddenly, he’s the only long-haired messiah she wants. But she could lose her chance at real love. Not just with a guy. But with God.Note: This novel received the Catholic Writers Guild Seal of Approval.",
