  "description": "Mazak is a cyborg mercenary set to turn in one last bounty for his debt to a deadly trade lord to be paid. He is furious to learn he first must complete one last job—to deliver a human female to a dangerous space station to complete an illicit transaction. The clock is ticking, however, and the female lights a fire in Mazak’s synthetic hearts like no other.Cora Fleming curses every choice she made that landed her at the mercy of an alien trade lord. So much for a harmless adventure after a sheltered life. Now she’s in the hands of a gorgeous cyborg who holds his feelings close and his secrets closer. They are in a race against time to get this done and win both their freedom, but learning what the transaction will pay for changes everything…as does their deepening bond.Mazak’s choice is not easy: try to stop the destruction of an innocent species at the risk of losing those he cares about, or remain a mercenary to save Cora’s life, but lose her love.This is book six of the Stryxian Alien Warrior series but can be read alone with no cliffhangers and no cheating. I write what I love to read, so there is always consent and always a happy ending.",
