  "description": "Best friends. A virgin firefighter hero. And a woman who knows exactly what she wants …Hell, I love my job as a Chicago firefighter. The thrill of the save, the camaraderie of my brothers in fire, the appreciative looks from women everywhere I go. Shallow as it sounds, I can’t help enjoying that last one.Pity I have no idea what to do with all that attention.While I might be an experienced firefighter, I’m a rookie in the bedroom. Last of a dying breed, a virgin with absolutely no game when it comes to women. I have good reasons for holding out this long, one of which is my best friend, Evie. So, I’ve crushed on her for years and don’t stand a chance, but if anyone can help me figure out how to close the deal, it’s her. She’d make the perfect wing girl in my quest to get it done. Only I’m about to find out that Evie has a few ideas on how to help me score … and none of them involve me with anyone but her.",
