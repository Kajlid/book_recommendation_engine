After years of wandering throughout the natural world, limitless revelations as to the importance of nature in our lives had slowly unfolded.The author, who forever will be a teacher, provides him the opportunity to share important lessons that seem to have become lost to our children and their families in today's fast paced culture. These lessons are filled with meaning and messages that have the power to enrich our days, shine wisdom into our souls, and change lives.There are 150 of the author's favorite photographs, along with lessons he has learned in the book. It also includes information about each image and are organized into 12 thematic chapters with short essays explaining why someone would want to go out everyday just to wander in the woods.",
