  "description": "WHO WAS CHASE SULLIVAN?Stevie Holt found herself watching for him, waiting to hear her neighbor's motorcycle roar into his driveway. All she knew about Chase Sullivan was that he filled out a simple white T-shirt and a pair of tight, worn jeans better than any man she'd ever seen, and that the rugged loner wasn't interested in making friends - until the day Stevie gave Chase no choice... The strawberry blonde next door with the sky-blue eyes had a heart that was just asking to be broken. Chase didn't just look dangerous, he was dangerous - to anyone foolish enough to care about him, to love him. Forced to live in the darkness. How could he ever take the sweetness Stevie was offering?",
