  "description": "Sometimes the universe is chaos, and sometimes it’s kind. If we are meant to be together, we shall be.”  It's 1897, and fresh from Oxford University, William Owens returns to Maryland to find his entire life planned for him. His law practice, his home, and his wife. Unable to stand up to his mother, William resigns himself to living the life she's chosen for him, until one day the Universe chooses a different path for him.  Literally stumbling into his life, the blind writer, Theodore Renard, changes everything. Confronted with a life he desires, and the love of his life, William must find the courage to stand up to his mother and take his life into his own hands. But none of that comes without a price. Facing heartache and tragedy, William must learn to navigate through the chaos of time and the tide.also included in the Love Through the Ages: A Romance Anthology",
