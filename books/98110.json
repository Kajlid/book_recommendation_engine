Keep still, you little devil, or I'll cut your throat !\"Little orphan Pip scarcely imagines how a terrifying encounter with a convict on the lonely marshes will later transform his life. Pip is more troubled by his visits to strange old Miss Havisham—her decaying wedding dress and the house full of memories—and the beautiful girl Estella who makes him ashamed of his country manners and coarse hands. A blacksmith's apprentice could never hope to win Estella, but then, young Pip's future might not turn out quite as expected. Exclusive material includes \"The Backstory,\" in which readers can learn about Victorian convicts.",
