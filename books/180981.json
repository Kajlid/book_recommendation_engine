  "description": "When Tessa Gibson reluctantly embarks on a desperate plan to secure her daughter's safety, she never dared dream of falling in love - especially with a cop and a town that makes her feel like one of their own. The moment Constable Dylan (aka Dodge) Myers meets Tessa, more than his internal cop radar is activated. With his career on shaky grounds, he doesn't need additional complications in his life. But neither Tessa nor Dodge are a match for his grandmother and her CWA cronies and their own ideas on revitalising the struggling rural township of Bindarra Creek. And not even the monster from Tessa's past will stop them.",
