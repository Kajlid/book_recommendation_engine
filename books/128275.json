  "description": "Flight Sergeant Danny Wilkinson, a young bomb aimer panics when his aircraft encounters heavy flak over Germany. He prematurely orders the release of the bombs, hoping that his skipper would order the aircraft to return to England. When the Lancaster bomber is hit, he bails out and discovers that the bombs that were intended for a munitions factory had in fact struck a concentration camp for women and children. As he descends, he views the horrific sight of the victims, some mutilated, others being burnt alive. The self-confessed coward at first refused to help the woman and children that he encountered, but later reconsiders, his conscience troubling him. He agrees to lead them to Switzerland, but sadistic Jew hater, Major Richter, The Black Hawk, employs extreme and brutal methods to hunt down the escapees. A sad, harrowing and sometimes disturbing account of bravery and heroism.",
