  "description": "Fifteen year old twins Lily and Tyler are on a mission. Escape from their abusive mother, hop a train to Charleston, South Carolina, and don't get caught. They've been kept in virtual seclusion their entire lives, and in one night make a break for it and succeed. However, something isn't right with their new Aunt and Uncle, and they realize they've escaped one nightmare and stumbled into something even far more sinister and deadly. Lily and Tyler both feel the call of the moon, and the first night she's able to go outside and feel it on her skin, Lily dramatically changes into something that both fascinates and scares her. Desperate to escape their Aunt and Uncle the twins devise a plan, but are thwarted at the last second. With time running out they finally manage to escape, and find help in the form of a smooth talking teenager named Talon with fire in his hands and an otherworldly aura. Just who are they, and where are they from? Are they even human? They must rely on one another if they're going to find out and manage to survive.",
