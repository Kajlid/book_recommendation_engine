  "description": "A sprawling metropolis to rival even the most capitalist of cities. Streets jammed with cars, store fronts open wide to commerce; vice abounds. Welcome to Vidu, Population: 1.It's the hangover that makes him forget, and that's usually the good part. A lifetime of memories he tries to escape nightly, and typically--at least on those nights when he finds the bottom of enough drinks--it works. Except last night. Last night was different. He can't tell from the memories that aren't there, but it's made clear by the blood on his clothes. And the way he can barely function. And the gun in his hand.Vidu wasn't empty when he tipped that first bottle the previous day. His world was simple; uncomplicated. Now there's a dying voice on his phone and a trail of clues leading him through a city he's never really known. A city whose shadows barely touch the darkness he's realizing in himself.",
