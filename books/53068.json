The only reason she is caught up in this mess is because of me: my pack, my enemies, my secrets  I’ll stop at nothing to keep them from destroying the only thing that matters to me. My Mate. What I fear most is that my betrayal will be too much, and she’ll never forgive me.BriI thought he was different. I trusted him, and he turned out to be just like all the others. Not that any of that matters anymore because I’m a hostage in a world surrounded by murderers, kidnapping, and secrets. As I discover the truths once hidden in plain sight, I wonder what my future will hold now. That is, if I have a future.Deception, ransom, and a search for the truth drive these two warring wolf packs to the brink. Nothing like a little blackmail between packs to settle old scores.
