  "description": "When sixteen year old Cheyenne Hawkins tries to ignore the fact that she is different than other kids her age, she learns the hard way that life can spiral out of control and people can get hurt, even die, when she goes with the flow rather than facing the truth. For Cheyenne, a teenage triplet living in the Washington, D.C. suburbs, life has recently begun to take a strange turn. Things were crazy enough with the insanely hot new guy in her life that comes with a mysterious past; her nosy, showboating brothers constantly interfering in her love life and flirting with her friends; her sister’s Mixed Martial Arts activities; and her old friend getting jumped and being hospitalized. As if balancing all of that with homework and softball wasn’t enough, she suddenly seems to possess some sort of bizarre the ability to see or feel things about people- usually frightening things that she definitely doesn’t want to see or feel. Danger and violence seem to be looming everywhere. Are these visions real or her imagination? What does it all mean? And why does it seem like her Aunt Fabulous knows something about it?",
