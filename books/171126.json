  "description": "A team of con artists descends on Sarasota to defraud wealthy widows and widowers out of millions of dollars by promising romance to the grieving spouses. P.I. Kathy King investigates and enlists the services of a homeless man with an explosive past. A chameleon, he poses as a butler in the home of a widow in jeopardy. Kathy's parents are once again involved as their new neighbor, who is caring for his demented mother, turns out to be one of the widowers targeted for trickery. As the attempted seductions sprint hilariously toward a climax, the investigators engage in a race against time. Can they prevent money from changing hands and discover the identity of the brains behind the fraudulent operation, or will they be too late? It's another imperfect day in paradise!",
