Together with their Speakers, Sam and Rick, they start a new life in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Escape is not as easy as changing their names. They must learn to live in a world where they not only have to pay bills, but hide their magical nature. With the help of the local demon hunting population, they learn to love freedom in the Steel City, but the Tribes are never far away. The seven Uncommon Animals stories tell one large tale of family, unconditional love, and demon hunting.",
