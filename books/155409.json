His sister dropped that little nugget over dinner one night and he damn near choked. Six years older, five years—doesn’t really matter.

Infatuation, longing, guilt—he's nothing but a messed up tangle of emotions he wants no part of.He tells himself the feelings will pass.They always do.Caleb Donovan doesn't do love, he doesn't believe in forever. The only thing he knows for sure is that love will burn you, that loss and betrayal will leave you reduced to a pile of ashes.It's not always rainbows and sunshine...No, some love stories are messy.The Let Me series by Lily Foster is a collection of stand-alone Coming of Age and New Adult Contemporary romances intended for readers 18 and older due to mature language and sexual content.",
