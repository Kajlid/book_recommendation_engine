  "description": "Do people say they hate someone’s guts so that they can still fall stupidly, head-over-heels in love with the other parts? Asking for a friend.  Okay, fine. I’m not asking for a friend.  I’m asking for me—and I’m begging you to tell me that the practice of falling in love with your should-be-enemy is common.  Please tell me that I’m not the only person to track down a guy—who used to be Hollywood’s baddest bad boy before he left LA for good—at his off-the-grid cabin in Alaska, show up unannounced, and find him gloriously naked.  This probably happens all the time…right?  Tell me I’m not alone in my stupidity—that I’m not the only woman who would fall for gorgeous blue eyes and a sexy devilish smirk, even if they belong to a broody, mysterious jerk.  Please. Please. Please. Tell me I’m not alone in this.  For the love of everything, I need all the supportive girl power I can get if I’m going to convince Luca Weaver to come back to Hollywood—otherwise known as the place he hates so much that he ghosted Oscar-level success and escaped to no-man’s-land for the last eight years just to avoid it.  Yeah, don’t worry—that smoke you’re smelling isn’t your house catching fire as you read this…it’s just my career and what was previously known as my heart going up in flames.  Gah. Is it just me, or am I totally, completely, and utterly screwed?",
