  "description": "It's a dog-eat-dog world and Cassie is back to take part.    Wanting to explore her sexual boundaries, Cassie signed up as a shared submissive with a difference. A live-in pet with four housmates to indulge her, to train and pet and fuck her silly.  It was supposed to be just a bit of fun, but her first taste turned out to be almost too much to handle. When she discovered she was falling for her master, Greg, Cassie considered walking away.  Now, like a dog with a bone, Cassie has returned to the house to meet Sarah and Andrew. A couple with a cage in their bedroom and a penchance for barking commands.  Cassie knows she'll have to deal with Greg eventually. First her new master and mistress will take Cassie to her limits, and demonstrate that some barking dogs do bite.  This novella is 16,000 words of hot, explicit pet-play erotica. It is meant for adults only (and kinky adults at that). It contains elements of BDSM, anal play, bisexual acts (girl on girl), and spanking.",
