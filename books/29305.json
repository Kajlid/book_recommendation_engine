  "description": "Bowser the Hound isn't very clever â€” certainly not as clever as Old Man Coyote, who's full of tricks! There's one thing, though, that Bowser's really good at, and that's pursuing someone who'll give him a long, hard run. Actually, he'll go without eating just for the pleasure of chasing Reddy and Granny Fox or Old Man Coyote.One day, Bowser gets more than he bargained for when Old Man Coyote decides to lead him on a long chase, just for fun, and make Bowser run and run. In fact, Bowser runs out of the forest and the old pasture until he's so far from home, he feels as if he is in another country. But with the help of Blacky the Crow and other friends, Bowser finally gets even with the old coyote.Young readers and nature lovers of all ages will love this appealing story of exciting animal life in the Green Forest.",
