  "description": "Reese is falling. For weeks his dreams have been plagued with the sensation of spiraling out of control. They were easy to ignore at first, but they're becoming darker. He's falling down a hole. There's no light, and the darkness is pulling him deeper. Even if he lands, he knows there's something waiting for him at the bottom. Something he isnâ€™t sure he wants to see.At home, his mother clashes with him every chance she gets. At school, his best friend Viv keeps pressing him to open up. Then there's Donovan, the boy whose locker is next to Reese's. Though he's had a crush on Donovan since they first met, Reese can barely speak to the other boy without becoming flustered.With a bit of scheming, Reese sets a plan in motion to get Donovan's attention, but the results are bigger than he expected. There's more to the dream than just getting the boy, and Reese isn't sure if he's stumbled into his greatest fantasy or yet another sinister nightmare.",
