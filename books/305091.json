  "description": "It started as a peaceful visit to his weekend getaway in the Sierra foothills. Hours later teacher Phil Lynch finds himself living a nightmare. Paralyzed and taken prisoner, his body is used as an unwilling host in a bizarre and grisly series of parasitic infections. On board the alien vessel within which he is imprisoned are more than a hundred other humans - and like Phil - just as confused and terrified - their bodies subjected to unfathomable violence for a dark and malevolent purpose. As the terrible truth about the alien visitation unfolds, a small group of captives must first understand - then fight for escape. That struggle will cause them to stretch razor-thin the limits of the human will to survive. 323 pages.",
