  "title": "Christmas Magic",
  "description": "A tragic fire has put a major damper on Laura Payne’s holiday spirit. She’d just as well skip Christmas all together. A series of circumstances brought self-imposed bachelor, Justin Carron to care for his sixteen year old niece, Richelle, whom he’d never laid eyes on.  A winter storm, and an unexpected turn of the wheel, on their way home from the airport, changes all three of their lives forever. Each one is faced with their own mortality, the prospect of becoming a family, and the kindness of strangers.  Mr. C. is a kind old man, who lives alone, and tends to a stable of deer.  There is something different about the jolly old man with a white beard and suspenders. After a series of unexplained incidents, he shows them that all things are possible, if they’d just let go of the past, and believe in the magic of Christmas.",
