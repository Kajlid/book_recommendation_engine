Dead and confused, James discovers he has a he can move on into the afterlife, or he can stay behind. Unfortunately, since James has done some very bad things, moving on into the afterlife can only mean one the fires of Hell. Or so he thinks. Forgoing eternal damnation, James instead chooses to haunt his old apartment building.Now James's days are mostly spent visiting his daughter and ex-wife, welcoming new neighbors, and talking to those who can see the dead. It's a simple, peaceful life, but with each passing day, James discovers something more and more memories of his former life — and even his own identity — begin slipping away. Faced with the prospect that he is rapidly deteriorating into a state of nothingness, James sets out to save his eternal soul. With the help of his daughter and a world-class medium, his journey to peace and forgiveness will not be an easy one, especially for a ghost who still wishes to be a father — and who fears he is destined for a fiery Hell as punishment for sins he cannot remember. Now, as James begins to uncover the devastating secret that connects his soul to earth, he will discover that even in death life has a few surprises.**Acclaim for the Novels of J.R. Rain**\"Gripping, adventurous, and romantic — J.R. Rain's The Lost Ark is a breakneck thriller that traces the thread of history from Biblical stories to current-day headlines. Be prepared to lose sleep!\"—JAMES ROLLINS, international bestselling author of Altar of Eden and The Doomsday Key\"I enjoyed this immensely. The protagonist, Samantha Moon, is a female vampire with a husband and children. Those predate her condition; six years ago she was attacked by a vampire and rendered into one. Now she's trying to carry on with family and private eye business, and she's a feisty, skilled person, so is doing mostly okay. It is not a horror story; she buys animal blood to eat and doesn't generally prey on humans. But her husband has an increasing problem with her coldness — not of spirit, but of body. 'You sicken me and scare the hell out of me,' he tells her. 'And when I touch you it's all I can do to not gag.' She replies, 'Words every wife wants to hear.' I love this! What makes it special are her character and nature.\"—PIERS ANTHONY, New York Times bestselling author of A Spell for Chameleon and On A Pale Horse\"Dark Horse is one of the best books I've read in a long time! A great classic detective story with a modern twist. Unique and interesting characters (I think I'm half in love with Jim Knighthorse now!), a great plot that kept me guessing until the end, and some of the funniest lines I've read anywhere.\"—GEMMA HALLIDAY, author of Deadly Cool and Play Dead\"Impossible to put down. J.R. Rain's Moon Dance is a fabulous urban fantasy.\"—APRIL VINE, author of The Midnight Rose\"Moon Dance is absolutely brilliant!\"—LISA TENZIN-DOLMA, author of Understanding the Planetary Myths\"Moon Dance is a must read. If you like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter, be prepared to love J. R. Rain's Samantha Moon, vampire private investigator.\"—EVE PALUDAN, author of Letters from David and The Romance Writer's Pink Pages\"I totally loved The Body Departed. As someone who communicates with those who are either earthbound or have crossed over — your descriptions and interpretations of the dialogue and circumstances could not have been written more accurately.",
