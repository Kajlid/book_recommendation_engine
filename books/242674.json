  "description": "‘Your orders are to kill Conroy … We shall approve any method you like to use.’ This is the ultimatum that sends Commander Esmonde Shaw, dynamic agent of British Defence Intelligence, to join a Moscow-bound coach tour in West Berlin. Somewhere among its passengers is Ivan Conroy, fanatical British communist planning to assassinate the man next in line for the Soviet leadership. From the moment that two passengers force the driver of the Moscow coach to crash through a Russian road block, and Shaw finds himself a fugitive from the bullets of the Soviet police, he and the young American girl with him are suddenly swept into a labyrinthine intrigue of sabotage and treason.
