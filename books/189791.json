  "description": "This superb collection reprints the very earliest work by Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Jules Feiffer - much of it shot from the original art! \"Clifford\" reprints most of the weekly humor strips Feiffer did for Will Eisner's Spirit newspaper insert, and includes a seven-page Spirit/Clifford story done by Feiffer and Eisner! This charming precursor to Dennis the Menace and Calvin and Hobbes continues in the next volume.\" The Collected Works clearly shows Jules Feiffer's development as a comics pioneer and as an artist, writer, and social commentator of the first degree, beginning with his witty-but-wide-eyed boy characters Clifford and Munro (both startlingly prescient of such hits as Calvin and Hobbes). - Los Angeles Reader",
