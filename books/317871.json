  "title": "Song of Serenity",
  "description": "Being a muse in the twenty-first century is a lot harder than it was in Ancient Greece.Life was simple when Calliope Ardalides, firstborn of the nine Muses, only had to concentrate on music and justice. But now she’s arbitrating between arguing gods, answering complaints from cantankerous humans irked by how their prayers are being answered, and keeping her eight sisters in line. When it’s time for her annual break from Afterlife, Inc, she goes to the one place she can count on to keep her the Temple of the Muses in the quiet countryside of Scotland.But Jordan James shows up with her contractors, builders, and noisy equipment. Her adventure park will take up most of the idyllic region, turning the serenity Calliope treasures into a haven for adrenaline junkies.Jordan is resistant to Calliope’s powers of persuasion, but Calliope's beauty remains a potent force. Stubbornly, Jordan vows to take on even the most beautiful immortal to make her dream come true, especially if it means spending more time with her.",
