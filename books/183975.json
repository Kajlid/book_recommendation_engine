  "description": "While sheltered in the clan's stronghold, Syssi is unaware that Kian and Amanda are not human, and neither are the supposedly religious fanatics that are after her. She feels a powerful connection to Kian, and as he introduces her to a world of pleasure she never dared imagine, his dominant sexuality is a revelation. Considering that she's completely out of her element, Syssi feels comfortable and safe letting go with him. That is, until she begins to suspect that all is not as it seems. Piecing the puzzle together, she draws a scary, yet wrong conclusion...\n\nKian and Syssi's story culminates in Book 3 of the series: Dark Stranger Immortal, and the characters embark on a new adventure in book 4: Dark Enemy Taken.\n\n\nThis is a new and re-edited version, professionally proofread by JuliaProofreader.",
