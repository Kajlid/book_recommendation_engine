  "description": "When Sheriff John Everett Sage returns from California to the town of Bear Creek, Colorado, he’s prepared to get married. He’s not prepared to confront a bunch of killers in the company of both a bounty hunter and a preacher. A daring daylight bank robbery puts him on the trail of murderous outlaws. When he and the posse return, John soon finds himself a married man with two children. How will he balance the responsibilities of his life with the politics and perils of a job that ultimately plunges his little family into mortal danger? As the 19th Century draws to a close, life is hard on the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. For John Everett Sage, it’s hard to stay alive. He’s a husband, a father, and a celebrated lawman, committed to do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with his God. Even though the newspapers will probably get it wrong, as Colorado prepares to enter the twentieth century, John Everett Sage will become part of the legend of the west.",
