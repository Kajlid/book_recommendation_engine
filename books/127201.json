  "description": "This story is set in the year 2098. Technology has developed to allow the Solar Alliance's fastest ships to move at 99% the speed of light. Captain Ron Henderson is the captain of one of these vessels. His latest assignment is to ferry a group of the brightest scientists representing all the disciplines needed to explore the furthest regions of our solar system.Their exploration is interrupted by an anomaly that threatens the entire ship. Captain Henderson decides to act as a decoy and deploy the Samson to draw the anomaly away from the main ship. He has no crew, but that is soon to change because of the lead scientist's experimentation in the lab with nanite technology. Dr. Moe is a Navajo scientist who has led the research into nano-technology and genetics.This story blends the rich heritage of the Navajo people, specifically around the 19th century, with the future. It is the author's wish that, although enjoying a science-fiction thriller, the reader will also develop a little knowledge and appreciation of the Navajo peoples and their experience.",
