  "title": "MOUTH TO MOUTH",
  "description": "Poetry. LGBT Studies. Departing from Abigail Child's previous books of poetry, MOUTH TO MOUTH spans the past two decades focusing on a series of romantic and sexual relationships with both women and men. From inside the sexual whirlwind of these relations and after, Child's attention to language as embodied material highlights how mediated and multiple layers of desire can be just as thrilling and physical on the page. Even as this divergent collection of writing ranges through these relationships, it also ranges through poetic methodologies, using computers as a writerly id and organizing principle, employing constraints and aleatory processes, and recalling the body's desires in a constant process of titillation, problematization, and ongoing translation.",
