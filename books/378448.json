  "title": "The Splendor of Antiquity",
  "description": "Blurring the boundaries between reality and fantasy, can faith and science unite to save two desolate hearts. Can love triumph over deceit, and can a man and a woman put history aside and rediscover just how deep their bond lies. Antiquity follows French Archeologists Joliette Deneauve and Olivier Botton as they grapple with the mystic implications of a discovery hidden deep within the Siberian mountains. As Joliette pursues her obsession, she becomes bewitched by the spirit of a long dead God-King, and torn with despair, her grip on reality is tested.Â  As Joliette attempts to decipher the incantations of a strange burial rite, painful memories from her own past begin to overcome her, and her faith in Botton is tested. Will she learn to trust him again, trust in her own heart, or will they slip farther away from one another, into the abyss and beyond.",
