  "description": "This history of England in the 18th century is not a chronological narrative of ministries and wars, but a history of the development of English society; the ministries and wars, of course, have their place, but no greater a place than the economic, cultural, and social history of the time. The book is divided into three the ages of Walpole, of Chatham, and of Pitt.",
