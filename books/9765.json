  "description": "Pradeep and his friends lived a life full of fun and adventures. They had all the money and time. Life was a rosy picture with girls, smoke, booze, sex and night-out escapades. It was their choice to live such a life & they continued even when ..... things took a bizarre turn and as an outcome of few small unexpected incidents, they started stealing cars. But they were smart, at-least that’s what they thought before getting thrown in the jail. That was just the beginning for 15-years-old Pradeep. The fun continued; just that the definition of ‘fun’ kept changing for Pradeep. He had better things to do, scores to settle, a life to live and a journey to begin. Meet the new age youngster of India – the one who believes in making a comeback and does it too!",
