  "description": "This Edition Features● A Detailed Biography of Mary Shelley● A Fully Interactive Table of Contents● Superior Kindle FormattingMathilda is the story of a young woman whose mother died in her childbirth—just as Shelly’s own mother died after hers—and whose relationship with her bereaved father becomes sexually charged as he conflates her with his lost wife, while she becomes involved with a handsome poet. Yet despite characters clearly based on herself, her father, and her husband, the narrator’s emotional and relentlessly self-examining voice lifts the story beyond autobiographical resonance into something more transcendent: a driven tale of a brave woman’s search for love, atonement, and redemption.Seahorse Classics brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in e-book production and celebrating reading in all its forms.
