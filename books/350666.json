  "description": "\"The Rabbit's Umbrella,\" as large and gay as a circus tent, and with a strange assortment of characters, houses a plot as full of twists and surprises as a troupe of juggling clowns. And as for the rabbit himself, the umbrella-holder, whether at the close of the book you think him a figment of the imagination, or actually feel him standing behind you watching you read the book, you'll never forget him after having seen him carouse through Mr. Plimpton's light-hearted fantasy. \"The Rabbit's Umbrella\" is peppered with amusing, imaginative illustrations by William PÃ¨ne du Bois, which are a complete delight in themselves.",
