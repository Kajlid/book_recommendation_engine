  "description": "Having led a sheltered life—except for a major trauma—twenty-three-year-old Belinda easily falls in love with the handsome, suave Adam. He talks her into running a scam. An extremely wealthy woman is dying and wants to find her granddaughter, who disappeared at three years old. Belinda agrees to pretend to be Kathy, the granddaughter, but while exploring the mansion she has flashbacks and wonders if she really is Kathy. After she marries Adam, his actions sometimes indicate that it was only for the inheritance. Kathy suspects that her grandmother is being poisoned. She doesn’t know who to trust in the household: her grandmother’s doctor, the nurse, the chef, the memoirist, even her husband. When her grandmother makes Kathy the sole beneficiary of her will, the lawyer includes a stipulation to protect Kathy from any fortune hunters. She now believes she is safe. But is she?",
