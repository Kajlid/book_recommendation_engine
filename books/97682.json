  "description": "Three Candidates. One Perfect Bride.Whitfield Calder, Earl of Danning, would much rather spend a fortnight tending to his estate than entertaining three eligible young ladies. But when his valet insists that marriage is an earl's duty, Whit agrees to the house party. He has no intention of actually proposing to anyone...until flame-haired Ruby Hollingsford declares she'd never accept him anyway. Ruby has been tricked into attending this charade, but she certainly won't compete for the earl's attentions. Yet, Whit isn't the selfish aristocrat she envisioned. And with a little trust, two weeks may prove ample time for an unlikely couple to fall headlong into love. The Master Matchmakers: Wedding bells will ring when downstairs servants play Cupid for upstairs aristocracy",
