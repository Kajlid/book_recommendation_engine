  "description": "I bought the wrong face soap. Why? Because it says smooth face cleanser on it. I put it on my face and I'm fairly certain it's lotion. I also bought something that says \"Body souffl√©.\" What is that? Is it a lotion? Is it shower gel? Am I supposed to eat it? When did they start changing the names of everything to things I don't understand? It feels like everything I buy is something like, \"Cake Batter Happy Hands!\" or \"Incredible Feet Pudding!\"Heather Jonasson is a Texan who made the long journey to Sweden many years ago, trading in cowboy hats, horses, and oil wells for dancing like a frog and listening to mandatory Abba music. If you see her on the streets of Stockholm, please wave hello. She will be the one freezing in the snow while chewing on a piece of beef jerky.",
