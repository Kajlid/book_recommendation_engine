  "description": "Rose Gardner collects secrets the way other people collect junk—and now she’s being asked to expose them. Special Prosecutor Mason Deveraux has called a grand jury to investigate the corruption in the Sweet Branch Police Department, and he’s summoned Rose as a witness. Any topic is fair game, and the criminals in Fenton county are rightly scared of what she might share under oath. While trying to placate the lawless men, Rose is also caring for her dying sister, Violet. Only Violet’s doctor has fled town after selling prescriptions, and Rose is sure big-time drug dealer Denny Carmichael has his hand in the situation. She has no intention of investigating, but like with a lot of her cases, clues keep falling into her lap. Then, just when it feels like everything’s at a boiling point, Rose gets shocking news that turns her life upside down. Now, she’s not just soothing the criminals’ anxiety, but actively seeking allies for a fight she hasn’t asked for—and her enemy just might be the man she loves.",
