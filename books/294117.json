Then Keane happened. He was a crude, rude, ruthless Southie bully who only cared about his hockey career and pucking his way through a string of girls. I hated him and I thought he hated me, but then one unexpected spring break kiss changed everything.I had no business spending one night with him, much less that wild, intense summer. He was freedom and ruin in one ridiculously sexy package. Moving across the country to go to med school and eventually marrying Keane’s total opposite seemed like the right things to do at the time.But now I’m divorced and back in Boston with a nine-year-old secret, I’ll do anything to protect. And as for Keane? Well, my ruthless ex is broken, bitter, and determined to punish me for walking away.
