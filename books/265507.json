  "description": "Nurse Shelly Westbrook has returned home to Marietta hoping to give her son and niece a Christmas holiday to reboot a disappointing year. Christmas is magic and Marietta is the perfect place for them all to start over.  Dr. Peter Davidson has never indulged in the Christmas spirt, but he thinks heâ€™s hallucinating when he reaches the city limits and sees a sleigh driven by a white bearded man in a red suit. The minor collision is inevitable, as is his slight concussion. His obsession with the beautiful angel of a nurse who stops to render aid is unexpected, but just what the doctor ordered.  Can two people nursing broken hearts find love in a quiet mountain town that has always promised new beginnings?",
