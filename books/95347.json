  "description": "Steven Dunbar gets the news that an old friend, Dr Simone Ricard of Medicins Sans Frontieres, has died in an accident while attending a scientific meeting in Prague. She and her team have been working to eradicate polio in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan and have discovered a possible reason for their failure to do so - fake teams put in by the CIA. She has gone to Prague to publicise this but the meeting organisers won't let her speak - they already know the reason and have accepted the CIA apology. They think it will only make matters worse if wider publicity is sought.",
