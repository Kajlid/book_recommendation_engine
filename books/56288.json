  "description": "The Little Soul and the Sun  is a simple and powerful story that brings children a profound there is no absolute good or bad, only love. The Little Soul and the Sun  gracefully explains spiritual concepts to children and shares a story that helps readers remember the angel within us all. Your child will discover a God that she or he can love, because God is love, as are all the Little Souls who are a part of God. And perhaps parents, too, will rediscover who they really are. A little soul discusses at length with God how he can learn to experience who he really is and which “part of special” he wants to be. The little soul decides he wants to be forgiving; thus another little soul soon obliges by offering to do something “not-so-nice”, so that the first little soul can experience forgiveness. Such messages as “everybody is special, each in their own way” and “it is special to be kind; it is special to be creative” are important for all children to hear, regardless of their faith.",
