  "title": "Inger's Promise",
  "description": "Travel north to the Arctic Circle, where reliability can be a matter of survival Inger may have the whitest fur and an impressive set of antlers, but his friends just can't depend on this young reindeer. First he disrupts a wedding. Next he forfeits the big sled race. Will Inger get another chance to prove he can be trusted? Inger's opportunity soon comes, against the backdrop of an unforgiving Arctic snowstorm, and at stake are the lives of three reindeer. Inger's story is set in Norway and features a fast-fading way of life among the Sami reindeer herders, who have lived in close interdependence with the reindeer for centuries. In glowing watercolors, illustrator Andra Chase depicts the rugged beauty of the Norwegian landscape and the richly colorful Sami people who live there.",
