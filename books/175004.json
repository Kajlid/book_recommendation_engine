  "description": "John Marchbanks and Lainie McGuire are two never-marrieds in their late thirties, both active in the LDS Church. He’s the attorney who incorporates her new reception-center business. A convert, talented artist, pianist, actor in community theater, and Primary teacher, John lives on the East Bench of Provo. Lainie, a life-long Church member and dedicated people person, volunteers for good causes and serves the elderly Single Adults in her west Provo ward. She’s a breast-cancer survivor who appreciates every day, even a bad one. Just as John realizes he loves Lainie, he is diagnosed with malignant melanoma. What they learn about themselves and each other through his treatment and recovery makes them see they’ve wasted too much time already. Life is really all about living it up, celebrating the joys and sweetness of life while they can—together.",
