  "description": "“A philosophical, witty, wonderful, and altogether magical love story.”—M.J. Rose, author of The Hypnotist “Amiably outrageous….Mandery is a worthy son of those great writers of the 1970s, Vonnegut, Barthelme, and Barth.”—Joseph Skibell, author of A Curable Romantic “I’ve never read anything like it and enjoyed every minute of it!”—Jessica Anya Blau, author of Drinking Closer to Home A (Timeless) Love Story is a smart, romantic, and funny novel about tender and requited love, a wonderfully original literary feat from Evan Mandery, a rapidly rising fiction star. Taking the classic love story and turning it on its head, Mandery brilliantly blends outrageous humor, existential philosophy, and heartbreaking angst while offering a wealth of satisfying surprises. Funny and wise, a magical tale of a man obsessed yet unable to allow himself the fulfillment of a perfect romance with the one true love of his life, A (Timeless) Love Story is a uniquely delightful work of fiction from one of the most exciting novelists currently on the literary scene.",
