  "title": "Mike Pence: A Clear & Present Danger",
  "description": "He stands in the shadows. When he speaks, he does so in slow, measured tones while endless repeating his talking points. Many people know very little about Vice President Mike Pence, but he might be the greatest threat to American democracy precisely because few people know his views.  Learn Pence's positions on such topics as evolution, women's health, fetal stem cell research, LGBT rights, global warming, and smoking. Learn why many women still send Pence reports on their monthly menstrual cycles.  This book explores Pence's key votes as one of the seven most conservative members of the House of Representatives as well as his time as Governor of Indiana. Included in addition to analysis are the texts of several Pence speeches including his speech about evolution that he gave on the floor of the House of Representatives.  Learn how conservatives could use the 25th amendment to make Mike Pence president and what that could mean for America.",
