  "title": "The Getaway",
  "description": "The story of a bank robbery and its aftermath, of cross and double-cross, told with the unflinching eye of America's greatest crime writer. When it comes to pulling off the perfect bank job, Doc McCoy wrote the book. But with a partner like Rudy Torrento, who is not only treacherous but insane, and a wife who is still an amateur, McCoy has forgotten something: when the crime is big and bloody enough, there is no such thing as a clean getaway. THE AUTHOR Jim Thompson (1906-1977) was born in Oklahoma. He wrote nearly thirty novels, including The Grifters and The Getaway, which has been filmed twice, and two screenplays for the Stanley Kubrick films The Killing and Paths of Glory.",
