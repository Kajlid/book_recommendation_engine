Certainly not the women of \"the circle\" - five kindred souls whose steadfast friendship is as entertaining as it is five women who are shaking things up in the idyllic New England town of Plymouth, Massachusetts. When they get together, anything can happen - and it usually does. For these bright, warm, adventurous women also seem to be a magnet for the strange, wild, and dangerous. Available only in Americana 5.",
