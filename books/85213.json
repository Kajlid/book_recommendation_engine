  "description": "The second-to-last thing Evan Lowry thought he’d be doing after graduation was auditioning to be the newest adult film star for Sonic Street Studios. The very last thing he thought he’d be doing was auditioning to sleep with other men. Wide-eyed and inexperienced, he isn’t ready for what he finds when he walks through the doors, but with college tuition bills looming, what other choice does he have? For Brandon Court, the shine has worn off regular scenes, but with a contract for a reality-show style shoot at a beach house in Oregon, what should be business-as-usual suddenly becomes a whole lot more. The instant he lays eyes on Evan, Bran can’t decide if he wants him to get lost or get naked. The chemistry is unexpected, instant, and terrifying. But after spending so long pretending, what would he give up for a shot at the real thing?",
