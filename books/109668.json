  "description": "CJ Mills is on the verge of a mental breakdown.After a miscarriage and a bar brawl resulting in a dishonorable discharge from the military, CJ wonders how things could get any worse. But when her well-meaning but naive husband volunteers both of them for a mission of goodwill to a distant planetary colony infamous for its debauchery and lawlessness, CJ finds out just how deep the darkness can be.Tragedy throws her into a nightmare beyond her wildest imagination and CJ is forced to summon every ounce of her skills as a soldier and as a woman. Stranded on a far-flung planet with little hope of survival, CJ makes her choice: she will not be a victim. She sets out to find answers and to punish those responsible, but what she discovers is too terrifying to even imagine.Yet as she blasts through blood and bone and steel, CJ finds herself inexorably drawn into the vortex that she came to confront, and she realizes the darkness she fights has been growing in her own soul the whole time. Blinded by rage and praying for a miracle, CJ comes face-to-face with a question that all of us fear to answer:HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO?",
