  "description": "Will there be sports in man's future? Science fiction says, \"Well, yes and no.\" Yes, there will be sports-- of a sort. No, they won't necessarily be the same sports we know today. Editor Terry Carr has collected the views of seven science-fiction veterans on this subject and presents them here in an anthology about the ways in which men may compete in centuries to come. - In \"Joy in Mudville,\"the bear-faced natives of Toka defend their baseball championship of the Interbeing League. - In \"Bullard Reflects,\" the Dazzle Dart champions turn their athletic gifts against a crew of murderous invaders. - In \"The Body Builders,\" a fighter exchanges his own heavyweight frame for the body of a jockey, and is promptly challenged to fight. - In \"The Great Kladnar Race,\" bored earthmen try to get up a morning line from among the low-slung, six-legged kladnars of Gornik VII. - In \"Mr. Meek Plays Polo,\" a visitor to Saturn finds his game of space polo being masterminded by a group of educated bugs. - In \"Sunjammer,\" space vehicles are powered only by their vast, mile-high plastic sails which are propelled by the sun. - In \"Run to Starlight,\" earthling footballers are faced with a team of squat, super-powerful Brish-diri. Sports fans or not, readers will enjoy this engaging compendium--- fantastic athletes, frantic coaches, and all.",
