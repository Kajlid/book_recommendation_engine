  "description": "Almost five years have passed, five long years since the one and only steamy night they spent together, five years without a single phone call or email.Not a day goes by that Brody Duncan doesn’t think about what might have been. His heart still aches for The One That Got Away and he can’t help but wonder why Avery never called him back.Having recently completed her Master’s Degree at Harvard University, Avery Carmichael is ready to move forward with the next chapter of her life, one that doesn’t include Brody, but a chance encounter at a local coffee house has left her mind reeling and her life in a complete tailspin. Whatever hope she’d secretly harboured for reconciliation—however unrealistic and misguided it may be—has vanished into thin air.Brody’s married!Hindsight is twenty-twenty, and as much as Avery wishes she could change the past, she can’t. Now she is forced to face the consequences of her actions and say goodbye to Brody forever. But when Brody shows up at her door unannounced and explains that he is in the middle of a divorce, that his wife is his soon-to-be ex wife, they are once again thrown into each other’s arms, and each other’s beds.Lured by passion and fueled by love, Avery and Brody are drawn to each other just as they were almost five years ago, but will secrets and a soon-to-be ex wife destroy their one and only chance at happiness?",
