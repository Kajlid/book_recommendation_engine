  "description": "As a blizzard bears down on Chicago's O'Hare airport, a critical air traffic control facility is shut down by a grisly accident. When the radar comes back up, two planes have collided. Wayfarer flight 880—half the roof ripped away—flies on. Seated amid dead and dying passengers is Donovan Nash, a pilot who fights decompression and oxygen deprivation to make it to the shattered cockpit. With the help of Audrey Parrish—a woman from his concealed past—and a handful of survivors, Donovan struggles to keep the 737 airborne. Dr. Lauren McKenna waits for Donovan, her fiancé, to arrive only to hear that something has gone awry with the flight. Lauren must convince Henry Parrish, an unlikely ally, to help her save the man she loves. Together, Lauren and Henry have to stay one step ahead of the airline, as well as heightened security, to execute a daring rescue to save Donovan and the others on flight 880.",
