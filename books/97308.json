  "description": "A spellbinding collection of short stories by the author of the Darkangel and Firebringer trilogies.Meredith Ann Pierce’s acclaimed novels are the proof of a remarkable imagination. Here is more proof—eight shorter works of fiction, each with a strong heroine, a tangibly imagined world, and unforgettable imagery. Included here are the text to her only picture book, \"Where the Wild Geese Go\"; the tale that showed a teenaged Meredith that she was, indeed, a writer (\"In Quest of the Icerose\"); and a powerful novella originally commissioned by SFWA Grandmaster Andre Norton (\"Rampion\").  Waters Luminous and Deep  encapsulates the evolution of one writer’s unmistakable style, and has all of the power of her longer work.\"A shimmering, stirring archipelago of tales.\"— Booklist",
