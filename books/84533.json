  "description": "Close your eyes and you could be in fifth-century Egypt - with his trademark ability to step into the shoes of his fifth-century protagonists, once again Christian Cameron plunges us headlong into the thick of the action. This time, the indomitable Arimnestos of Plataea finds himself caught up in the ill-fated Spartan expedition to the land of the Sphinx, while on the horizon, forces gather for the colossal naval battle of Artemesium. Whether it's in the unforgiving furnace of the Egyptian desert or the blood-frothed seas off the coast of Greece, Christian Cameron brings these momentous events to thrilling life as we watch the epic story unfold.",
