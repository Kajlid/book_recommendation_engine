  "description": "\"A chilling and beautiful novel that has left its indelible mark on me—I am simply in awe of Anca Szilagyi's prose.\"—Karen Russell, author of Swamplandia!, Finalist for the Pulitzer PrizeWhen Pluta’s father, a university professor, disappears amid the turmoil of Argentina’s Dirty War, her family’s idyllic life crumbles. Unsure where he’s been taken or whether he’s even alive, Pluta and her mother struggle to cope with the disappearance—and to voice their fears and pain to one another. Exiled to a boarding school in New York and churning with unresolved grief, Pluta runs away to Brooklyn in 1980. Her harrowing and surreal experiences on the dangerous streets soon threaten to destroy her completely—but may also at last break through the suffocating silence that has held her family captive.Magical realist imagery infuses the landscape of devastation wrought by political repression in Anca L. Szilagyi’s searing coming-of-age novel, which Shelf Awareness calls “a striking debut from a writer to watch.”",
