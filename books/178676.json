  "description": "** Top British book reviewer says Kingston Court has best love scenes in a contemporary novel.**  Sometimes you have to fall to learn you can fly. Samantha and Natalie are at a crossroads. Gorgeous, over-the-top Samantha, hides from her past by hanging her status and her happiness on her \"perfect\" husband. That is until she learns his secret. But she's not the only mother on the block struggling. Natalie, nurturing and careful, is thrust back into the workforce after her husband barely survives a near-fatal car accident. This fast-paced novel follows the lives of two dramatically different women who are faced with life-altering experiences. Death and misfortune in the span of a single year force these two women to either sink, or rediscover their inner strength and independence. Described as a modern day twist between Sex and the City and Desperate Housewives, Kingston Court is full of scandal, temptation, and all of life's juicy little secrets.*** When you finish, check out Kingtson Court's spin-off novels, Choosing Hope, and Lost Girl.",
