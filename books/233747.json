  "description": "Breaking Hollywood is a hot and hilarious standalone romance from New York Times bestselling author Samantha Towle...\n\nIt wasn't supposed to be like this...\n I wasn't supposed to be boyfriendless, homeless and jobless at twenty-eight. And I most definitely wasn't supposed to hit Hollywood's resident bad boy Gabriel Evans with my car and break his foot. Now I'm stuck in his apartment, taking care of him while he's incapacitated. Living with the hottest guy in Hollywood, who I've had a crush on forever, doesn't sound like a chore, right? Wrong. Gabriel Evans is rude, crude, drinks way too much and, as soon as his foot is healed, I'm out of here.  So, why do I keep forgetting to check the classifieds? And keep getting flustered when I see him shirtless? Breaking Hollywood wasn't part of the plan. But neither was falling in love with him.\n'Breaking Hollywood is romantic comedy at its best. It's laugh-out-loud funny, incredibly sexy, sweetly heartfelt and unadulterated fun... You'll be smitten with everything about this entertaining, steamy and feel-good romance' USA Today's Happy Ever After\n\nLoved Breaking Hollywood?
