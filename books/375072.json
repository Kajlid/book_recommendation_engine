  "description": "In his hard-hitting new book, The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Bible, author Robert J. Hutchinson reveals how the Bible triggered a revolution in human thought and later established Western civilization's moral and philosophical foundation. He demonstrates how the ideas embedded in the ancient Biblical texts (such as the notion of inanimate matter guided by fixed laws) provided the intellectual basis for the development of empirical science... and argues that much-maligned Biblical laws actually paved the way for the development of democracy, limited government and the recognition of universal human rights.Â The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Bible shows that the enemies of the Bible are all-too-often, despite their claims to the contrary, the enemies of reason and tolerance.",
