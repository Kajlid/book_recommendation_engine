  "title": "The Abortionist",
  "description": "In the not-too-distant future, where abortion is legal until the 18th year, the mentally-disabled daughter of a pro-life senator discovers an abortionist coming for her just days before achieving personhood—leading to a fast-paced chase through a dangerous city, where friends and foes are indiscernible.The aging abortionist, whose sagging career depends on the girl’s termination, must struggle not only to find her in time, but to survive himself when a mysterious stranger enters the hunt. But most of all, he must struggle with his own past.Colin Cohen’s The Abortionist is part thriller, part Swiftian satire. It is the story of the insatiable desire to live, and one man’s unsought chance for redemption.",
