  "description": "Summer school wasn't supposed to end with a bang-but when the Zero Avenue kids bring Bixby Elementary's water tower down during a class experiment gone wrong, they find their troubles are just beginning. Join Drew, Clementine, Grady, Newton, and Spider as they unravel the threads of an arcane conspiracy that blurs the line between science and magic, between friends and enemies, and draws them into an adventure that tests their character, and their loyalties to each other. Fight along side them as they defend their school, and their neighborhood, from the growing menace of the Crypto-Punks.",
