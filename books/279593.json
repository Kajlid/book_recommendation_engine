  "description": "It's never wise for a lady to run away in the middle of the night with a smooth-talking man with a questionable heritage—it's even worse to give that man your family's greatest treasure.After making a chain of bad decisions, Lady Anwen of Primewood finds herself in Lauramore, posing as a tambourine girl while she attempts to track down the man who wooed her, robbed her, and left her in the woods. Instead, she finds Galinor—a melancholy prince who's incapable of saying no to a damsel in distress.Together, they set out on a seemingly simple mission to fix Anwen's greatest mistake, but soon they encounter complications in the form of stolen horses, mischievous fairies, and a dark creature that stalks them through the forest.Despite all that, the unexpected and inconvenient affection growing between them might be the most troublesome obstacle of all…Full of charm and humor, Anwen of Primewood is a romantic fairy tale adventure set in a fantasy world you won't soon forget.",
