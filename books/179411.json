  "description": "All Beatrice wants is a normal family.When her unstable family falls apart, Beatrice is sent to Sandpoint, Texas to live with her uncle. Uncle Kyle is a mechanic who grunts and wears a cowboy hat. There are no neighbors, no friends. Just sand, a dog, and a garage full of greasy car guts.There’s also a barn. A big, creepy barn with strange noises and lights. Keep out of there, Uncle Kyle tells her. But Beatrice can’t keep out of the barn. She hears something moving inside, something she isn’t supposed to see. What she discovers is a strange and magical new world, a world where her cowboy uncle isn’t what he seems.Maybe a “normal” family isn’t what she needs, after all.",
