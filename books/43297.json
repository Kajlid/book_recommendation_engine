  "description": "\"I loved this story! Karen and Stanley's connection was so sweet and funny. Stanley just steals your heart and you can't help pulling for him and wanting him to realize his full potential.\" ~ Amazon Reviewer Kenda Stanley's a typical teenage boy in all ways except for he might be turning into a werewolf. When two girls show interest in him romantically, his life takes more than one unexpected turn. Up until now, Stan's has had his hands full with his ferocious appetite and the school bully, but he quickly learns a girl with secrets of her own can unlock a deadly new threat. This is a coming of age urban fantasy for fans of the Dresden Files, Supernatural and Teen Wolf. \"The plot is action packed but well paced so you can enjoy the fully developed, diversified cast of characters, and their adventures, but not get bored or overwhelmed. A must read for urban fantasy and mystery fans alike. A word of warning though, you WILL root for these characters and you WILL want the next installment but, as of yet it isn't finished so you will suffer impatience.\" ~Amazon Reviewer Nola \"If you took Harry Potter gave him a family who loved him, put him in an American public high school, then turned him into a werewolf you would have Stanley- and he's wicked hungry.\" ~Amazon Review \"The characters were well developed, the dialogue was realistic and I have never read anything like this before.\" ~Amazon Reader",
