  "description": "Monsters don’t need anyone. Or do they?That’s the question Tulak, the tracker of the Wolven Pact has been asking himself since he saw the beautiful silhouette of lush curves on the dark road he’d just scattered with human body parts. Since he was born, all humans have ever offered him was rejection and scorn.Law school never prepared Rayia Romanova to be a witness to a massacre. All that was left when it was over were two dead bodies and one monstrous beast with glowing eyes, snapping fangs and seven-feet of muscle and mystery that haunts her nightmares.And, her fantasies.These opposites are drawn together by forces neither of them understand. The fire that ignites between them will only be quenched with their binding. True fated mates will always find each other, no matter the obstacles. Only, as danger closes in, Rayia and Tulak must make a choice – to risk their hearts or lose each other forever.",
