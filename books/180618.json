  "description": "The Damned, one of many classic novels from crime writer John D. MacDonald, the beloved author of Cape Fear and the Travis McGee series, is now available as an eBook. At a ferry stop along the Rio Conchos, the line of cars waiting to cross stretches to the horizon. Because of a bureaucratic blunder, the boat has been stalled, with no relief in sight for the drivers—many of them American, many growing impatient to reach the border. That kind of tension can do funny things to a person’s head . . . to a trembling killer looking over his shoulder . . . to a married man escorting a beautiful stranger on an ill-advised sabbatical . . . to a honeymooner determined to have her love returned. Many others are waiting, too. Some are desperate for a second chance. And it’s only a matter of time until someone snaps—especially when they’ve all been pushed too far under the scorching Mexican sun. Features a new Introduction by Dean Koontz Praise for John D. MacDonald “ The great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller.”—Stephen King “My favorite novelist of all time.”—Dean Koontz “To diggers a thousand years from now, the works of John D. MacDonald would be a treasure on the order of the tomb of Tutankhamen.”—Kurt Vonnegut “A master storyteller, a masterful suspense writer . . . John D. MacDonald is a shining example for all of us in the field. Talk about the best .”—Mary Higgins Clark",
