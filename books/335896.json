  "description": "\"THOROUGHLY ENGROSSING ON MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS\" --Midwest Book ReviewCursed soldier Jhared Denaban escaped the killing winds and the deadly conspiracies in the city only to find himself caught between the desires of a ruthless priestess and the fury of a demon-haunted madman. Both hold the keys to understanding his identity, but for Jhared to accept the agonizing truths they offer, he must surrender his last hope of finding a place among his people.Lady Nemiah’s urgent search for the goddess’s power reveals heresy and treason among those she loves. To endure their betrayals, she must cling to the rules and rituals that she thought protected her, or reject them and claim her own perilous power. As they struggle to survive the machinations of the Council of Clans, Jhared and Nemiah each realize that destruction awaits Avelos unless they can free themselves from the brutal roles imposed on them.Readers who love the exploration of power and oppression in N. K. Jemisin’s work, the political intrigue of Guy Gavriel Kay’s worlds, and the depth of characters of Robin Hobb’s tales will lose themselves in the world of Avelos, where history is malleable, loyalties are tangled, and the truth conceals itself within a Web of possible realities that only the bravest—or the most desperate—can travel.",
