  "description": "In the style of Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to You comes J. Kenner’s erotic, riveting, and emotionally charged Stark Trilogy, which has quickly become a sensation among fans of steamy romance with a dangerous edge. Sparks fly and passion ignites in these heart-racing novels—with a bonus novella—of Damien Stark, a powerful man who always get his way, and Nikki Fairchild, a fiercely driven woman who only says “yes” on her own terms.  RELEASE MECLAIM MECOMPLETE METAKE ME (NOVELLA) He was the one man I couldn’t avoid. And the one man I couldn’t resist.   Damien Stark could have his way with any woman. He was sexy, confident, and commanding: Anything he wanted, he got. And what he wanted was me.  Our attraction was unmistakable, almost beyond control, but as much as I ached to be his, I feared the pressures of his demands. Submitting to Damien meant I had to bare the darkest truth about my past—and risk breaking us apart.  But Damien was haunted, too. And as our passion came to obsess us both, his secrets threatened to destroy him—and us. Forever. \nThe Stark Trilogy is an erotic romance intended for mature audiences.",
