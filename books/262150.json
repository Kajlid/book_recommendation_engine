  "description": "I needed an escape from everything. Why? Because my brother died. And now even the light in the sky looked different. A road trip to honor Tyler was the perfect plan. Leaving behind my depressed parents, a boy-crazy best friend and the place with all the happy/sad memories would be a relief.  I pitched it to Magnus, my brother's best friend because I didn't want to go alone. The guy needed a distraction from his creepy job and fresh break up. It didn't hurt that he had access to a hearse that would drive us there and back because neither of us had a car.  The feelings that sparked between us were something I never could have imagined. I couldn't help but wonder if hope and happiness might be a part of my life again.  ***Fans of Young Adult books and lovers of John Green novels will enjoy this coming of age romance.",
