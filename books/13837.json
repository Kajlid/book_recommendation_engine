The Five Sisters have wreaked havoc across the world, leaving the scarred earth of the Eastern lands in the hands of their cruelest servant, the Warlock. The Warlock sends his army to enslave the fairy nymph race called the Naglings.Where the sun rises from the south and the night is dotted with three moons, a young Nagling escapes her enslavers with the help of her people.

They become fast friends and share an innocent zeal for life and curious interest in the unique world. On the journey, her presence invokes awe and hope from citizens believing she is the sign that the end of the Warlock's reign is close at hand. While being stalked by an enigmatic and dangerous spirit, Ka enlists the help from a wanderer, a conjuror, two thieves, and a mercenary. The thieves are driven to follow her because of their persistent greed, despite the horrors that she awakens. The mercenary pursues her out of his own cruel ambitions above that greed.

Ka's ambition to save her people may change the course of the East for all races in this alien world. But at what cost to herself and those around her?A hope lingers that these are the end of Dry Days.The first volume of the Fires Trilogy and start of the Kadic Series",
