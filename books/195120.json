  "description": "From betrayal and pain, can two very different worlds be saved?  A naïve beauty…  Olivia has never questioned the teachings of the Witches Guild, never questioned the Elders; it’s the only life she’s ever known. An uncontrollable hunger…   Ristan has spent centuries trying to contain his true nature, restraining his Demon and its voracious hunger for souls. A situation neither of them were prepared for.   They say the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, and Olivia can’t escape from her actions. What she’s done, she knows must be paid for in blood. Her own.   A monstrous need for revenge against the girl who wronged him; Ristan wants to keep her, humiliate and torment her, but his inability to truly harm her may just be his undoing.   A dangerous need to explore the man who holds her captive and captivated; Olivia knows she should run, or resist him, but the magnetic pull he has on her is undeniable.",
