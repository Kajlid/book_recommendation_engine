  "title": "Favourite Flower Poems",
  "description": "Beautifully illustrated with nostalgic illustrations of a range of beautiful blooms, this book includes a diverse range of poems, from verses celebrating the beginning of spring with the emergence of the snowdrops, daffodils, and bluebells to poems that honor the summer color of asters, the heady scent of jasmine, and the brazen sunflower. The classic poets are featured including Shakespeare, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Thomas Hardy, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson and Seamus Heaney. There's also a range of rich poetry from less-famous names which have stood the test of time and which evoke natureâ€™s beauty.",
