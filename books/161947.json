  "description": "Having come of age, Lucy Wilberfors is sent to the capital to work for a professor who develops intricate clockwork devices. Soon she realises that the professor's inventions have a very special purpose: to give frustrated women sexual relief. Torn between her awakening sexuality and the strict moral values of her society, Lucy must decide, in which direction to steer her life. But in a world that leaves women very few opportunities to pursue an independent lifestyle, she has to learn whom she can trust and find people who can help her find her own purpose. Set to escape the constraints of the world she knows, Lucy embarks on a voyage that will change her life.",
