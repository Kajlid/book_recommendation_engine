  "description": "What would life be like if you had feet like a duck, or horns like a deer, a whale spout on your head, or a long, long nose? In this crazy tale a small boy imagines all these things, only to decide in the end that perhaps it's better to be \"ME\" after all. With his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, Dr. Seuss has been delighting young children and helping them learn to read for over fifty years. Creator of the wonderfully anarchic Cat in the Hat, and ranking among the UK's top ten favourite children's authors, Seuss is firmly established as a global best-seller, with nearly half a million books sold worldwide. This delightful book forms part of the third stage in HarperCollins' major Dr. Seuss rebrand programme. With the relaunch of six more titles in January 2004, such all-time favourites as The Lorax, The Foot Book and Yertle the Turtle boast bright new covers that incorporate much needed guidance on reading Blue Back Books are for parents to share with young children, Green Back Books are for budding readers to tackle on their own, and Yellow Back Books are for older, more fluent readers to enjoy. I Wish That I Had Duck Feet belongs to the Green Back Book range.",
