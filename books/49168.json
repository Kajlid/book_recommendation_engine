On one side, Melanie Johnston - a grieving single mother - is convinced her son will be forgotten. On the other is Andie Phelps, a reserved woman who retreats even further into herself with grief.These two sympathetic characters fight her own way through grief and pain - sometimes wisely and sometimes with choices that have the power to divide family, church, and even their small, seaside town.",
