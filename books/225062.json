  "description": "Mo Collins is a reluctant hero, trapped at the end of the world on board his replica pirate ship, surrounded by hordes of blue naked zombies. What else could go wrong? On his ship, the Viva Ancora he has traveled along the rivers and lakes of America for the past few years. But now he finds himself only miles from his childhood home, and the world has gone to hell. These zombies have flooded the now dead Alabama lake town where he is docked. Mo and his only surviving shipmate, Crow, are doing one thing, surviving. They fish and watch the monsters roam the night; seeking untainted flesh and leaving a disgusting mess in their wake. However, when \"out of the blue\" a lone survivor stumbles upon Mo and Crow, they gain a new crew member but also find much-needed direction. The newcomer, Smokes, will change Mo’s view of this zombie-infested world forever. As reality mimics fiction, an ever-growing cast of crazy characters plays out their role carving out an island sanctuary in a plague-ridden world. The Expert, The Tech, The Oracle, The Sacrifice, The Old Friend, plus many more ….. Join us on this wild ride where the fish bite, the Zombies bite…and sometimes life bites.
