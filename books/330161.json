But then he discovered why she’d come in the first place.Gabe Kasper, heartthrob of Buckhorn County, could have had any woman he wanted if he'd had a mind to settle down. Which he didn't.

Yet he didn't use that power often. His brothers kidded that he was holding out for a paragon of virtue... and not many in Buckhorn qualified. But then he met Georgia, and broke all his own rules.",
