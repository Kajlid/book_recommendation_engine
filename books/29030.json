  "description": "High above the heavy air, the March People and the winged Drak met where the two suns crossed: locked in a battle as old as the ritual of life itself. For Amarson and his fierce lady Ameera, to live was to kill Drak; to die was nothing. That was the Law—until the long-winged Flier came, riding the crest of the thermocline….In this masterful science fantasy adventure, S. Kye Boult has created a world that is both grippingly intense and luminously strange.",
