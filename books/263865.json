  "description": "For the first 7 years of her life, Elodie Fontaine was part of an ultra-secret psychology experiment in China. Now, at 17, she is trying to put that behind her and simply be a normal Florida teenager. She plays on her high school tennis team, is a nerd-in-good-standing in the Math and Science Club, and has come to terms with the fact that she is interested in girls rather than boys. She is even thinking of asking a certain someone on a date when she begins getting disturbing email messages from one of the other subjects of the Chinese experiment. Then someone tries to break into her house to steal her late mother's papers about the project; but why? What value could they have? Elodie realizes she can no longer bury the past. She must act before someone gets hurt. Together with her friends Margo and Kelli, Elodie reluctantly begins searching for answers. But to do this, she must polish off her programming skills and revisit her years in Shanghai with five Chinese girls, an unfinished experiment, and a mother she never really knew.",
