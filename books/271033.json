  "description": "One female criminal genius. Three brilliant, passionate detectives who stand in her way. Let the seduction begin...  My family expected me to play sacrificial lamb for their supernatural cult. Through a desperate bargain with a demonic fiend, I escaped—into a criminal underworld that saw me as easy prey.  I’ve proven them wrong a thousand times over. These days, what I want, I get, by whatever means necessary.  Now my fiendish friend is coming to collect its fee: my soul. I don't intend to pay. Unfortunately, the key to my freedom lies just beyond my reach. To steal it before my time runs out, I’ll need to con the finest investigative minds in London into executing a perilous heist.  Sherlock Holmes. John Watson. Garrett Lestrade. Each at the top of their game; each with a weakness I can exploit. Each so passionate both in the field and between the sheets. I answer to no one and I left my conscience behind years ago, but the more time I spend with them, the more the edges of my steeled heart soften.  We could rule the world if we worked together. But these men will never see the real me as anything but a villain. When the chips are down, I have to betray them—or I’ll lose myself to a greater horror than they could believe exists.  *What if the infamous Professor Moriarty was a woman—and she met Sherlock Holmes and his colleagues as young men? Wits clash and sparks fly in Moriarty’s Men, a modern paranormal spin on the classic characters. This reverse harem series comes with fast-burn steam, a slow-burn romance where the main character doesn’t have to choose, and M/M themes.*   Warning: Heroine of extremely questionable morality.",
