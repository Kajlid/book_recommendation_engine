  "description": "Dear Or How I Beat Cancer and Learned to Love Daytime TV is the story of one woman's battle with an unusual cancer, rectal cancer. Wendy Thornton discovered that she had cancer just as her career was taking off, her son was in his last year of college, and her daughter was planning a wedding. Trapped at home for the first time in her life, she began to appreciate the humor in daytime TV, and learned to slow down and enjoy life. There's never a good time to get cancer but Wendy had a hard time finding any information about this particularly debilitating disease. She wrote this book to explore all areas of the cancer experience, including how to survive, how to get over the depression it can cause, and how caregivers and friends can support their loved ones. By telling her story and providing practical advice, mixed with humor and pathos, she hopes to help her fellow cancer patients survive and thrive in spite of their diagnosis. She tried to provide all the information she wished she had known but couldn't find when she was diagnosed. This book contains adult content and snarky humor. If you like shows like The Big C and 50/50, you’ll appreciate this book. In Wendy’s opinion, life is laughter and cancer can be beaten.",
