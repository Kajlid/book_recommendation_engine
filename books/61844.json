And when they won't take no for an answer, she denies her internal logic and follows her heart.Balmy nights on Sanibel Island have taken an erotic turn. A heated seduction begins between two Irish Werewolves and the single woman they claim many times and many ways. They would do anything to protect and keep her as their own - for an eternity. Because, that' what she's going to have to give them. Everything. Or else.And as any heated, naughty fairy-tale progresses, there's a very big, very bad wolf. One that lays claim to Tatum. One that refuses to share. And if Jayce Jordan and Bren Walker were human, they couldn't win. Thankfully, they're insatiable beasts. The black claws, the ever sharp canines, the feral appetites, the blood lust, and the hot, wicked bodies come out to play. After a viscous fight to the finish, it's Tatum's turn to be hunted. This time, she's not complaining.Contains mild bondage, mild exhibitionism, sex toys, vampirism, m/f/m menage amour and suspense. Includes sneak peek for Sanibel Burn and excerpt for the upcoming Captiva Captive.",
