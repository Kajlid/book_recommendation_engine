Now he's come back home armed with nothing but a set of nunchuks, a hell-bent-for leather attitude and one dark secret, to find nothing much has changed on \"the Rez\" â€” short of a glimmering new casino run by a corrupt leader named Red Crow, and a once-proud people overcome by drugs and organized crime.In this volume, war breaks out on the reservation as Red Crow loses his grip on the reins and Dash Bad Horse faces his toughest and fiercest foe yet.Collects: Scalped #50-55.",
