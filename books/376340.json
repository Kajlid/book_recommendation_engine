  "description": "Tasha's a chatty, flirty 30-something who loves music, food, sex, clothes (not necessarily in that order) and her boss. This is not a romantic comedy, though: she's in love with the wrong man at the wrong time, leading her into a minefield of moral dilemmas and social taboos. You may laugh with her at times, but you may also cry with and for her as she tries to make the best of what life throws her way.",
