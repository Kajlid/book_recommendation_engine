  "description": "As a pregnant teenager, Avery Pritchett found refuge in Colorado, but now, ten years later, her brother's wedding--and some burning questions--bring her back home to her small Southern town. But will introducing her mixed-race daughter to her independent-minded grandmother bring solace or sorrow? Will confronting her class-conscious mother allow for new beginnings or confirm old resentments? And how can she ask forgiveness of her youthful lover who has been denied his child all these years? As the summer progresses, Avery's return provokes shocking discoveries--of choices made, and secrets kept--and of deceptions that lie closer than she suspects.",
