  "description": "In a world of technology, her ability to remotely control anything electronic or digital at will makes her a formidable superhero. However, she’s about to face her most dangerous enemy yet – an enemy of mere flesh and blood whom she can’t control. A Ch-khana gunship has just arrived at the outer reaches of the Eta Cassiopeia System and due to the significant damage throughout the entire ship, it’s quite obvious that it had been in a recent battle. Ani Maxima is prepared to finish it off when she learns that there are no living Ch-khana inside that ship. As a matter of fact, that ship is being flown by some human refugees who claim that there are several underground factions of survivors back home. They’ve come from Earth to seek out advice from the woman who destroyed a whole Ch-khana armada and upset the Ch-khana enough that they had issued a galaxy-wide bounty on her head.Seems like a simple and honorable request. However, things aren’t always as they appear. When Ani discovers that no one is home at the house of Reini Knight when they most certainly should be, she begins to question what’s really going on. Those visitors from Earth are headed for the Cepheus Colony and they’re not really interested in just talking. Unfortunately, Ani has no way to fight them because their weapons are mechanical in nature and they’re quite simply flesh and blood.The Ani Maxima Files:Ptolemy’s Child SuperVirusVeiled SkyEnigmaFlying in the RainSilent LucidityFlesh and BloodSoul SisterSocial Animal",
