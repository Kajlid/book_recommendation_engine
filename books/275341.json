  "description": "A tomboy tames the cocky cowboy next door in Wall Street Journal and Washington Post bestselling author Lauren Landish’s forbidden romance.Luke is damn near invisible, or at least that’s how he usually feels. He takes care of things around the ranch before his boss-brother even knows there’s a problem, and no one even notices when he's done. But when he finds Shayanne sitting in a tree on his property, that all changes. She sees him and doesn’t seem to mind his gruff cowboy ways and dirty jokes that tease and test them both.Shayanne is a tomboy cowgirl down to her boots, and a damn adult, regardless of whether her father and brothers agree. She escapes their smothering love and expectations to the furthest pasture and finds . . . Luke. And though their families have a rivalry worthy of the Hatfields & McCoys, she wants him. She wants him to take her and make her his woman, because in her heart, she already is.Can Luke mediate the long-standing anger between the two families to get his girl, and can Shayanne finally be an adult in her family’s eyes, able to choose a future with a man they don’t want her to have?",
