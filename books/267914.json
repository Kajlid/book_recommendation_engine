  "description": "Werepanthers, dragons, and demon sorcerers. What's a normal red-blooded woman to do? Have sex with them, of course. Even though Lisa is mostly human, her life is anything but normal. Spending more time with the supernatural side of society than with humans might account for that. Then again, it might have to do with all the people who want to kill her for sport, since she doesn't stay dead. Whatever the reason, she's come to the painful realization that something important is missing from her life. Sex. And if she doesn't get some soon, she might just lose her mind. Her best friend Ashur decides to help her out. He starts the ball rolling by introducing her to a werepanther who's known to have a way with women. The shifter is so good that he leaves Lisa craving more. Wherever she can find it. With whoever she desires. Though she's no longer in danger of going insane, her life becomes stranger yet, as she acquires and loses lovers, and lives and dies . and lives. Where will it all end? Only God knows. And he's not talking.",
