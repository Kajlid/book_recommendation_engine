  "description": "I know who I really am. But if my coven finds out, they’ll hunt me down until I’m erased from history. Seth, the arrogant demon hunter, is dangerously close to knowing too much. If that prick gets anywhere near one of my demons, there will be Hell to pay. Unfortunately, he’s also the one teaching me shadow magic. Secrets hide in the shadows. And some secrets should never be known. But I won’t stop looking for who killed my birth mother. If I must face trauma from my previous lives, so be it. I have my lovers. I have my coven. But I still need answers.",
