  "description": "A heart-wrenching story from the bestselling author of The Throwaway Children. Thirteen-year-old Lisa has escaped from Nazi Germany on the Kindertransport. She arrives in London unable to speak a word of English, her few belongings crammed into a small suitcase. Among them is one precious photograph of the family she has left behind. Lonely and homesick, Lisa is adopted by a childless couple. But when the Blitz blows her new home apart, she wakes up in hospital with no memory of who she is or where she came from. The authorities give her a new name and despatch her to a children's home. With the war raging around her, what will become of Lisa now? Can't wait for the sequel? The Married Girls is out now! What readers are saying about The Girl With No Name: 'Diney Costeloe has perfectly captured the traumatic atmosphere of the war years both in London and the countryside... Highly recommended' 'The characters leap from the pages. The Blitz scenes were palpable, imagining what Londoners endured during WW2. Love all Diney's books' 'The author writes with good pace, and excellent descriptions of place and characters, but her main skill is in conveying the personal dilemmas faced by her characters. I shall definitely seek out more books by this author'.",
