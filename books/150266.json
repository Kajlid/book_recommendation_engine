  "description": "“Ban this man from eBay. A stupidly funny book” - Alex Zane \"Very, very funny and perversely touching. It's quite hard to read when you're covering your eyes in disbelief. There's a fine line between insanity and comic genius; here the line is drawn in thick felt tip\" - Kevin Day “In the best tradition of Henry Root - one man's tireless campaign against common sense” - The Poke “Comment box botherer and nit picker extraordinaire, Fredrick Facedass stalks eBay, asking the questions that no one else has thought to ask. Because no one else is as mad as he is” - Charlie Skelton Join Fredrick Facedass on a bizarre journey, through this collection of stupidly funny and completely genuine email exchanges with the online sellers of eBay.

Fredrick, however, is far from lonely… Whether he’s hunting down the perfect conker, demanding his wife sit in vinegar or commissioning witches to cast spells, no one is safe from this loon. Fredrick is a kind and considerate man and he never means to irritate the innocent sellers, but his peculiar and persistent line of questioning often does… ABOUT THE AUTHOR Who is Fredrick Facedass?
