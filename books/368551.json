  "description": "Wolfgang Jager has found himself on the wrong side of a world war. Esther Lange is trapped inside a war of her own. Can loving their enemies set them both free? Wolfgang Jager grew up in Mason City, Iowa. So, what's he doing fighting for the Germans? If only his parents hadn't moved back to their native Germany when they believed Hitler to be a hero. It's almost a relief when he is captured by the Americans and sent to a Wisconsin POW camp. When the darkness turns to nightmare and Wolfgang is accused of murder, can he stand firm in his faith - and snatch the woman he loves out of the mouths of lions?",
