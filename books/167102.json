  "description": "G.K. Chesterton's quiet and unassuming little priest has long since joined the pantheon of great literary detectives. Combining the shrewdness of Miss Marple, the insight of Sherlock Holmes and the punctiliousness of Hercule Poirot with the deep and intuitive knowledge of the dark secrets of human nature gained in the confessional, Father Brown is perhaps better equipped than any of them to uncover the startling truth whenever murder, mayhem and mystery stalk society.",
