Sophie's new adult world turns upside down when she awakens in the shadow of the Gothic cathedral Notre Dame of medieval Paris. Finding eternal love hasn't worked out for Sophie, too many men breaking too many promises. She's resigned herself to a life without the trust and lasting love of the right man.  Edouard's aristocratic, new adult playboy ways came to a crashing halt when cursed with mysterious and powerful magic. Now he searches through time, desperate to find the only way to free him from the curse-his one true love.  But keeping his past from Sophie may just keep him from his freedom.
