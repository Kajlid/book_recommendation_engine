  "description": "“I’m afraid we’ve offended the spirits. It would not be safe to continue.”When Rebecca, Scott, and Ryan go to a remote mountain village in New Mexico, they are not quite sure what to expect. Their mysterious friend Z simply asked that they help a young American Indian who was in trouble.What they find in the small village is an evil so powerful that it attacks them with wind, thunder, lightning—even the very ground they walk on. Even more frightening, though, is the evil that is quietly invading the heart and mind of one of their own.",
