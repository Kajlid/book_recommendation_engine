  "description": "Side Effects, a novel by Harvey Jacobs, the award-winning author of “American Goliath,” recounts the medical misadventures of Simon Apple, whose life has been one long battle with Miracle Cures, each of which requires yet another Miracle Cure to curb an increasingly bizarre series of unintended consequences. Now, Simon awaits the lethal stroke of midnight on Death Row when he will make the supreme sacrifice―giving his life for the sake of the pharmaceutical industry. A steady parade of visitors―family, friends, enemies and lovers come to wish him bon voyage on the day of his final exit―while Simon’s nemesis, Regis Van Clay, celebrates. Side Effects is a rollicking ride through a life that ranges from horrendous to hilarious, a resonant contemporary reading adventure where RX marks the spot.",
