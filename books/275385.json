But that serenity comes to an abrupt end when twenty-year-old Rosemary Allen pleads for Savannah's help after running away from her dangerously controlling father. But her father isn't just anyone -- he's Mario Ferrante, the criminal mastermind who oversaw Caroline's kidnapping. Rosemary and her husband had planned to escape from Ferrante's house together, but the plan was foiled, and Rosemary had to escape alone. Now she is begging Savannah to help keep her safe and to rescue her husband.",
