  "title": "Breaking Away",
  "description": "Features another Xena couple, tall, dark and brooding and small, blonde and talkative, but the story is told so well, that it's not as distracting as in some of the books. Lacey is the right hand \"man\" to a Mafia type boss and meets Rachel, who has a dark past herself. The two books tell how they try to build a life together, solve mysteries and separate themselves from Lacey's criminal background. The second book is actually the better one as far as plot and story development. Unfortunately, I remember reading that the author died from cancer, so this is her only work.",
