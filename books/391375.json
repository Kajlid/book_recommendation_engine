There's more to this longhaired soldier of fortune who calls himself the Tin Man, but she's not sure she wants to stick around to find out what. Then he stashes her in his secret lair--an underground techno-fantasy complete with security monitors and an arsenal--and Marnie realizes the guy is military, top secret military. He's also got the most beautiful mouth she's ever seen.He could get her killed.",
