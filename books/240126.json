  "description": "This is the season for the Buffalo Bedlam to win the Cup. All the pieces are in place. Getting sidelined by multiple concussions wasn’t part of Dylan Fraser's plan. Yet, the team captain is starting off the playoffs on the injured list and hating every minute of it. He knows the detrimental effects concussions can have on the brain but if this is his last shot at earning his place on the most hallowed trophy in hockey history — like his dad, like his brother — he’ll do whatever it takes to get back in the game.Assistant athletic trainer Blair Proch knows all too well how concussions sustained during a player’s career can still affect them decades later. Her own father is living proof. After months of her and Dylan dancing around, their friendship has finally turned into more but she won’t allow their fledgling romance to detract from making sure the stubborn hockey player is taking care of his health. She’ll take on the league, the team, even Dylan himself to keep him safe.When Dylan returns to the ice, Blair faces her worst fears with every hit he receives or dishes out. Dylan is falling hard for Blair, but with the Cup so close, he can’t turn his back on his dream, despite his concerns about his health and his future. Can love survive with these friends-to-lovers facing off on opposite sides?",
