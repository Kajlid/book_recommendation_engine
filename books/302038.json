  "description": "Surely there has never been a woman more sensual, more irresistable than svelte dancer Chloe Dubois. She is a heady combination of innocence and sultry seduction, and Japanese-American businessman David Imakita will risk everything he has to keep his career, his friends, even his integrityâ€”such is her power over him. But who is this temptress and what does she want? Is it just love? David's ex-Sumo bodyguard, Sato, believes Chloe will cause havoc in their ordered lives and turns up information on her that is far from pretty. The warning signs are there, but it is already too late for David, who is under her spell and besotted. Will this unrepentant temptress overturn her wild ways and accept the opportunity to change her life for the better, or will the dark family secrets of her past resurface and destroy them both?",
