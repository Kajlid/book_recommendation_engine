  "title": "Acetone Enema: A Morbid Collection of Short Stories & Poetry",
  "description": "\"(T)he subject matter featured inside these pages is morbid but not in the Poe sense. The morbidity goes much deeper into the human psyche and questions the concept of right and wrong, morality and immorality. There are stories that will shock you and at times disgust you; however, there is no doubt as to his writing skill and ability to pull the reader into each of his tales, as one would be drawn through a door into separate interesting worlds.\"-Sandra Scholes (SF Site)This unhinged collection contains controversial classics originally published at The House of Pain and in the Chimeraworld anthologies. Read \"Baby Hunter\", a story about a man who literally hunts babies. Read about his self-described adventures in graphic detail. Then, see for yourself how maybe hunting babies is not such a bad idea after all. Or read the self titled \"Acetone Enema\", where the narrator hails his passion for his headless lover. Is it a dream come true? Maybe not. Read these stories and six other shocking, uncensored tales...plus six morbid poems.There are two never before published stories, one written in collaboration with U.K. surrealist author Mike Philbin.WARNING: This book is not intended for readers under the age of 18. There are scenes of extreme violence and sadism, including scenes of necrophilia, rape and erotic dismemberment and destruction. There is a misogynistic vibe through many of the stories. If you're okay with any or all of that, this book is probably exactly what you're looking for.",
