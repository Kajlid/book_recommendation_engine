  "title": "Love Letters: The Love Letters of Kahlil Gibran to May Ziadah",
  "description": "Kahlil Gibran and May Ziadah knew one another solely from the letters they exchanged and from a deep admiration for each other's work. Yet their correspondence endured a lifetime, as did their love. This collection of letters, the first ever to appear in English, reveals the eloquence and beauty of Gibran's writing in a form and style that is both profoundly personal and emotionally evocative. Illustrated throughout with Gibran's ink sketches and fascinating photographs of his original letters, this exquisite gift edition presents a moving insight into the writer behind The Prophet, the bestselling book of the twentieth century. Kahlil Gibran (1883 – 1931) was one of the 20th century’s most inspirational poets, authors, and artists. Suheil Bushrui is the director of the University of Maryland Kahlil Gibran Research and Studies Project, U.S. He is the author of the definitive biography of Gibran entitled Kahlil Gibran: Man and Poet. (2nd edition, Oneworld 2007) Salma Haffar al-Kuzbari is the foremost woman novelist in Lebanon.",
