  "title": "Honeymoon in Purdah: An Iranian Journey",
  "description": "The beautifully written travel memoir of a Western woman's journey in Iran.With a love of travel, Alison Wearing invites us to journey with her to Iran--a country that few Westerners have a chance to see. Traveling with a male friend, in the guise of a couple on their honeymoon, Wearing set out on her own at every available opportunity. She went looking for what lay beneath the media's representation of Iran and found a country made up of welcoming, curious, warmhearted, ambitious men and women.With humor and compassion, Wearing gives Iranians the chance to wander beyond headlines and stereotypes, and in doing so, reveals the poetry of their lives--those whose lives extend beyond Western news stories of kidnapping, terrorism, veiled women, and Islamic fundamentalism.\"With this engrossing account, Wearing casts a sympathetic eye on the real people of Iran, so often invisible to the West.\"-- Publishers Weekly",
