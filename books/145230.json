  "description": "Dumped by her boyfriend and down on her luck, Annabelle accepts her best friend’s gift and goes to the Ecstasy Spa for an afternoon of erotic escape. She expects the sex to be mechanical and the staff to be more brawn than brains. She couldn't be more mistaken. Instead of cold and clinical, Seth is everything she has ever wanted in a man. Smart and sexy, it’s easy to see why he is the most requested staff member at the spa. Together they embark on a mind-blowing sexual journey of self-discovery that takes them both to heights neither thought possible. As physical attraction turns into something deeper, Annabelle wonders if she should risk going against spa policy to see if the “quick fix” she ordered can be changed into something more permanent.
