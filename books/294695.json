  "description": "Then from out of that shapeless mass there came towards us a long tentacle. In colour it was the same as the monster's body. In dimensions it conformed to its vast measurements. It must have been a hundred feet in diameter. I soon had reason to know that its length was at least three miles. And it was like a single tentacle from a giant octopus except that at its extreme end was a large, circular... but I am at a loss for a word to describe it. It was neither hand, nor paw, nor webbed foot; it was a horrible combination of all three.\"Christ!\" I shouted blasphemously. \"For God's sake shift target, Number One, shoot at that damned thing, and hit it, man - HIT IT!\"This is the story of Commander Thomas Delaney who chanced to bring his ship, H.M.S. Lyme Bay, home from the Mediterranean at the most crucial moment in England's history... when the British people were suddenly confronted with something which was so monstrous, so horrible, so overwhelming in its destructive power, that there were some who imagined that the Prince of Darkness had usurped the Throne of God.",
