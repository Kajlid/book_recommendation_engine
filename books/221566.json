  "description": "Arjun Basu's fiction collection is a wry and consistently provocative book which exposes the realities beneath social conventions. Squishy Do you still love me? Do you want fries with that? Do I look fat? Life is full of small moments that define us, tangents that lead us to unexpected places, bad decisions and no decisions with repercussions you couldn't possibly predict. This is the world of Squishy , where subtle truths emerge from just beneath our seeming contentment and happiness, our layered social obligations. An aspiring actress fast approaching her best before date, a world weary travel writer, a disgraced ballplayer suffering the lingering effects of a wardrobe malfunction -- all characters aware of life's promise and impossibility, all tempted by something just beyond, something surely delicious. Full of sharp urbane dialogue and characters that always manage to act in a way that celebrates their humanity, this is a confident, stunning debut collection from a powerful and original voice.",
