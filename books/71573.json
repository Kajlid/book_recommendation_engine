  "description": "Four hundred years ago, my life was destroyed. Everything I knew and loved was obliterated as my powers surged for the first time. My family, my home and my life were taken from me, in flames. I was transformed against my will into an abomination, a dizzien of hell to forever walk the night, a vampire. For four hundred years I've walked this earth, the painful screams of my family a constant reminder of the monster I am. I've never known love, or the gentle touch of a man. The only respite from the agony of my existence was the three hundred years spent with Stephan. Although, once She came, I was again tossed aside, shunned and ignored. Never again!I'm done with being condemned, suffering for the consequences of something I didn't know I was capable of. It's time I lived.My name is Victoria, and this is my story.",
