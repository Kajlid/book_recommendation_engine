  "description": "Join Nelson, a French Labrador-cross, roguish and bon vivant, on his incredible journey: from puppy love in the Alps, to abandonment in Normandy, to new beginnings and friendships en Angleterre. A dog's life it is but, told from just below knee height, it's a delightful and uplifting take on the canine world.Here's the actual cover blurb from my book:Trapped in a house fire, Nelson is dying.If only he could open the door …Nelson whimpers his final goodbye to Rascal, his canine soulmate, their paws almost touching through the heavy glass that separates them. Succumbing to the smoke, his life drifts slowly before him …Nelson was born deep in the French Alps, where his only worries were how snow could be both soft and hard and why it made the house sink. And whose turn it was to fetch the baguettes from the boulangerie.So how could puppy love be so cruel? And how ever did he find himself lost and lonely in England?His dogged wanderings eventually led him to David and his son Timothy, a young boy with autism. Life was once again full of joy.Until now, trapped in the fire, Nelson’s luck has surely deserted him. But he can’t die yet! He has an amazing tale to tell – and an amazing tail to tell it with. And with Rascal there to help, Nelson has no choice but to survive.",
