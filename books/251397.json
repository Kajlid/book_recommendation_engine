  "description": "“If your powers aren’t harnessed and controlled properly, they could consume you and take command. Or, something far worse…”When Princess Ariella learns she’s to be tutored for ten hours a day, she believes her father is punishing her. That is, until she meets her tutor Austin, and discovers she is gifted with an incredible power, and Austin was sent to her castle to train her.Darkness looms on the horizon when Austin discovers a malevolent group called the Black Magic Sorcerers plan to capture Ariella and harness her powers to help them take over the Eastern Realm. It's all due to her connection to King Jasteroth, which Austin realizes runs deeper than the identical powers Ariella and Jasteroth both possess.A strange force dwells within the castle, which overturns Ariella’s once quiet and simple life. It threatens to destroy all Ariella holds dear, but only if she and Austin cannot find and destroy it first.",
