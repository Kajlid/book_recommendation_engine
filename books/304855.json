  "description": "The folks who populate The Appendage Formerly Known as Your Left Arm are a motley crew--as colourful and sundry a cast of characters as ever turned up between two covers. You will meet Selenium man, the Half-Girl, Perky One and Perky Two, the Broken Man, Frederick Nietzsche (not his real name), The Frog, the psychiatrist-with-the-hyphenated-name, and Eno, the aging dragon who has an annoying habit of eating Evelyn Burtleby's novels before she can finish them.",
