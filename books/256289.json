  "description": "HER SECRET COULD BE HER UNDOING…The American Civil War. 1865.A woman well-versed with facades, Justice Hudson is hiding in plain sight. No one questions a smooth-faced deadeye known for bringing down countless Confederates in battle. She’s an asset the Union army cannot turn away, though most soldiers peg her for an underage boy—she keeps to herself in camp and serves the army with deadly precision in the field. \tJustice has guarded the secret of her identity for years, but she’s hiding another secret, and she knows her cover can be maintained for only so long. She’s going to be found out, and dishonourably discharged from the army—or worse. Intimately acquainted with love and loss, Union Captain Eamon Gallagher is trying to keep his head down—and keep the past from following him into the present. While his doctoring days are over, his keen attention to detail is not—and when he meets a young private who looks years too young to be fighting a war, he wonders what secrets young Hudson is hiding.\tBut as the war draws to an end and one of Justice’s fellow soldiers is gunned down in the street, a more personal war is begun, with consequences farther-reaching than Justice or Eamon could ever have imagined. They must find the killer and bring them to justice, before Justice becomes their next target.",
