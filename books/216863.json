  "description": "The second three volumes of James White's Sector General SF saga, in a single omnibus edition.Sector General: A vast hospital complex in the depths of outer space. The thousands who work there, human and alien both, have a single mission: To care for all patients, of all species. At Sector General, anything can happen-and frequently does.James White's tales of Sector General are lively, humorous, and humane, at times shot through with a healer's anger at violence and destruction. These are endlessly inventive dramas of civility and spirituality, tempered with White's gently wicked wit and his keen eye for the remarkable in the everyday.Now, in a single omnibus, the second three volumes of the series-Ambulance Ship, Sector General, and Star Healer-return to print in complete and corrected editions, including a sequence (\"Spacebird\") omitted from previous American editions of Ambulance Ship. The volume is introduced by Hugo-winning SF writer and critic David Langford.",
