  "description": "Part memoir, part treatise on enlightened entrepreneurship, and all about overcoming some of life’s seemingly insurmountable challenges, The Mindset of a Dyslexic Entrepreneur reveals a remarkable personal route to success through Scott L. Holman’s fascinating life story.In the course of my career, I’ve had the privilege of meeting, working with, and befriending top-level performers in music, sports, and business. This includes having the honor of playing music together with the likes of Willie Nelson and Tammy Wynette. What I’ve learned over my eighty-two years is that the same talent, determination, and moxie that make the famous successful can be found in people who lead more ordinary lives — whose no less miraculous achievements aren’t obscured by the white-hot spotlight of fame.This book is about just such a a man who led an extraordinary life, but who is only known to his loving family and those whose lives he touched personally or through his philanthropy.—Dr. Don Steele",
