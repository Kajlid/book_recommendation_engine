  "description": "Being the Anthological Edition of the inceptive trilogy of PILLARS occult periodical journal. Be it: Issue.1 \"Psychopompos\", Issue.2 \"The Golden Eitr\" and Issue.3 \"The Ebon Kteis\". It has been decided that there shall be but only one official iteration of this Anthology, for the sole logical reason that the customary \"Standard\" editions of PILLARS were the ones published (which are now sold-out), and that \"Perichoresis\" in itself, is the \"Deluxe\" edition of those three journals combined.¶ CONTENTS (Texts & Visuals) by:Shani Oates, Yoann Lossel , Sarah Anne Lawless, Nicholaj de Mattos Frisvold, Asenath Mason, Ash Nostro Morg, Vaenus Obscura, José Gabriel Alegría Sabogal, Kyle Fite, Xonia Abyssos, Stewart Clelland, Angela Edwards, Matthew Venus, Mitchell Nolte, Lukasz Grochocki, Pierre Perichaud, Glyn Smyth, Leon Ka, Alexander L.
