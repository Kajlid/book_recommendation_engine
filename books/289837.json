  "description": "She thought her enemy was dead… He bled for her...and now he’ll claim her as his own… Famous deejay Anton Trask stays the hell out of other people’s business. He paid for that lesson in blood. But when Fiona Garrett shows up at one of his nightclubs needing his help, it shakes him to the core. Fiona was only fifteen when he helped her escape GodsAcre, the hellhole where they were raised, but she’s all grown up now, and her bright, fierce gray eyes, sexy red lips and gorgeous body make his heart race and his temperature rise... Hunted by a phantom… Fiona Garrett is being pursued by killers, and she has no idea why—just that it must be linked to the disaster at GodsAcre years ago. She owes Anton her life already, and hates to ask him or anyone for help, but Anton Trask is the only person alive who might actually believe her. But the controlled power he exudes ignites a hunger inside her that she cannot deny... Anton wants to leave all the horrible memories of the GodsAcre fire in the past, but the only way to save Fiona from the deadly danger stalking her is to face the past head on… And the closer Anton gets to Fiona, the less he can imagine letting go… Author's Hellbent, Book Three of The Hellbound Brotherhood, is part of a connected series, but with its own couple and its own HEA.",
