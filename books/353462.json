  "description": "\"You're so serious all the time. You don't laugh much. You don't see anyone. Face it, Mom, you need a genie.\"No, thought Zoe Calderone, a genie was exactly what a hard-working, pragmatic, single mother like herself didn't need. But when she went along with a hokey conjuring ceremony to humor her nine-year-old daughter, the impossible happened: A tall, dark, sinfully sexy djinni appeared...stark naked.\"What are your wishes, summoner? I can do anything but bring the dead to life or foretell the future.\"And so Zoe found herself facing a dilemma. The haughty stranger refused to leave until she'd made her three wishes, but there was no way she was going to risk more magic going awry. Yet the longer he stuck around, teasing her with his gorgeous body, soothing her with his gentle consideration, the more she was tempted to let him grant her every desire.",
