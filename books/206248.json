  "description": "Logan: I know she’s scared, but my own nightmares make it hard to assure her. I will guard her from her past as well as my own, but can I guard her from her future? Facing obstacles that stand in our way, we work that much harder to heal one another. Failing her is NOT an option.  Haley: He has been my anchor these past few months, without him I would fail. He doesn’t think I can bear the weight of his burdens too, but he’s wrong, for him I would carry it all. When an unseen problem threatens all we hold dear, will he be fast enough to save me again? Or will I lose the only family I’ve ever had?  Logan: Can I get past my own insecurities to be the hero she needs? Or will I lose her as soon as I’ve got her?  Haley: I’ve got a surprise for us both, something neither one of us can control. Something that will defiantly change our life’s forever.",
