  "description": "Mishon and Ryan, two players engaged in an erotic battle of wills, find themselves beaten by love. Mishon Lewis has always enjoyed having men fall at her designer shoe-clad feet. And none more so than her attractive but geeky college bud Ryan Anders. But now, Ryan has transformed himself into a hot womanizer by taking a How To Be A Player course. As he turns his newly acquired skills on her, she wonders if he's using her as his final exam. Well, if so, he's in for one helluva battle. She'll crack his newfound and oh so sexy confidence and have him panting for her once more. Ryan has lusted after the sexy siren since they met. But watching her skim through, and reject, men other women would do anything to keep, had convinced him she was out of his league. That was before the course. With a re-imaging and new skills has come a confidence he's always wanted. And even better, the ability to go head to head with Mishon. What neither of them realizes is that there is a third player in their game. Love.",
