Irina is a hard-working and serious young woman while Jinne, being a freelance artist, has always had her head full of weird ideas. One night Jinne decides to disappear, and wants Irina to find her. Unwillingly Irina begins the search, and gets deeper and deeper into Jinne's private life... But actually, is it really her friend that she is trying to find? Or maybe this is nothing but the path to her own self.",
