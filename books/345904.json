  "description": "Book three in the Perfect Timing Series The words 'have sex with a man' can change everything, especially when they're written on a straight man's to do list. Rigby and Brennan have been best friends forever. Growing up and going away to university didn't alter that. Brennan coming out of the closet to his straight best friend didn't change anything either. But when Brennan finds an old to do list mixed in with his friend's possessions, and sees 'have sex with a man' written right there at the top, it alters everything. When Brennan realises the man he's in love with isn't as straight as he'd always thought he was, their friendship changes beyond all recognition. When the friends decide it's time to start ticking off all the items on Rigby's gay to do list, they soon realise nothing will ever be the same - for either of them. Reader Advisory: This book stands alone and does not have to be read as part of the series.",
