  "description": "June Bellamy had gone for a walk in a park—and came back with memories missing. She didn't know, but her partner could, because she'd told her answering machine about strange people in the park. Now June and Paul are on the run from insidious superhumans who can edit their memories and track them down no matter where or how well they hide. They are desperate—but not nearly as desperate as their pursuers.",
