  "description": "Before he was an officer aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise...Cadet Worf arrived at Starfleet Academy as the first Klingon to gain entrance since the Federation-Klingon Peace Treaty. Raised on Earth by human parents, Worf wonders if he is still a Klingon, the proud member of an honorable warrior race, or is he more... human? Where does he fit in? Command-level classes fill his schedule, but nothing prepares him for his fellow cadets, among them his human foster brother. Intelligent, ambitious, and confident, the Academy cadets make life difficult for the young warrior. How can he win over his classmates -- including the always logical Vulcans and the fierce Brikar -- if they are still trained to think of him as the enemy?When a routine trip to a training satellite turns into an unexpected disaster, Worf must unite the cadets and risk his life before a terrible accident destroys the entire mission.",
