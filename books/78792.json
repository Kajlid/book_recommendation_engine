  "description": "Dreaming of her wonderful castle, she imagined that it contained a handsome, brave knight—Suddenly, her eyes flew open. She scrambled over her chair, looking with alarm at what was quivering in front of her, only an inch away from where her toes had dangled off the edge…It was a sword.“I’ll not miss my mark a second time.” A deep voice grated from behind her.She whirled around.It was her knight.It was also her ghost.Genevieve Buchanan inherited a castle—and a ghost to go along with it. But Kendrick de Piaget was no typical ghost. He was a handsome and infuriatingly arrogant thirteenth-century knight. At first he wanted to frighten Genevieve, though she was more charmed than scared by his ghostly tricks. But when his thoughts turned to wooing her instead, Genevieve had to face her greatest fear: falling in love.",
