  "description": "Everything is going wrong at the Buttercup Inn. Following the fire, the accident, and the theft, Winnie's confidence as an innkeeper is at an all-time low. If it weren't for Matthew Lister's steadying presence and help, she'd sell the inn and move away from St. Augustine. What's more, the chemistry between Matt and herself is more than she can handle, especially since he answered her all-important question the wrong way. He didn't have a camel.",
