  "description": "A blind date gone wrong may be the best thing that happened to these two lonely hearts. Welcome to The Cove With heavy iron gates, two security stations, and a groundskeeper's cottage, The Cove has everything a billionaire could ask for in a home. Dubbed Billionaire Bachelor Cove because of the resident's single status and income portfolios, The Cove is the perfect place to hide away from the world. But, as the residents soon find out, they can't hide from love. Her Awkward Blind Date with the Billionaire Billionaire Benjamin Walker Wilaby only agreed to go on the blind date to help out a friend. Circumstances beyond his control make him late and an allergic reaction causes him to embarrass himself even further. It’s a good thing he’ll never have to see the woman again because there’s no coming back from what he’s done. Avery Croft is mortified to find out that the worst date of her life is the father of the new girl at school. As the secretary for the Royal Belfast Academy, she helps with everything from the carnival to field trips, making it impossible to avoid Ben. When Ben goes out of his way to help Avery’s son, she can’t help but see him in a new light. And, Ben’s daughter turns to Avery for motherly advice making her wish she could take on the role full-time. Ben didn’t think he’d fall in love again, but Avery’s kind heart and sense of adventure have him falling fast. Can they find a way to blend their families; or, will the two of them be forced to go their separate ways?",
