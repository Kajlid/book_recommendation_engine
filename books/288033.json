  "description": "To become a witch or not to become a witch? That is the question. At least that’s the question Kara, Heather, and Stella, three of the gypsy healers, are facing. The high fae ambassador, Perizada, the new gypsy healers, and a host of wolves are in a race against time to create the witch army the dark fae, Volcan, desires. And they must somehow figure out a way to keep the healers, beings of pure goodness and light, from turning evil under Volcan's influence. Should be a piece of cake. Meanwhile, the werewolf males are fighting their innate hunger to mark their mates and finish the Blood Rites, thereby keeping their own darkness at bay. If they remain unbound, a chink forms in the packs’ armor, one that Volcan won’t hesitate to exploit when he finds it.",
