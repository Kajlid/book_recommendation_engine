  "description": "One by one, the moons and habitats of the Outer Planets have gone Neptune, Uranus and Saturn. After the cyborg assault against the Jupiter System, the reasons seem obvious. Those of the Inner Planets desperately scan the void for sign of a cyborg invasion fleet. Finally, one man discovers a blip. The blip becomes something asteroids hurtling toward Earth. The asteroids bristle with laser turrets and missiles, and their velocity and heading can only mean one thing. The rocky objects are meant to crash into Earth to annihilate the beleaguered Homo Sapiens and their Highborn tormenters. Into this grim situation arrives Marten Kluge, envoy from the Jovians and Force-Leader of a meteor-ship. He has elite patrol-boat pilots and his troop-pods are full of veteran space marines. Before this is through, heâ€™s going to need them all. PLANET WRECKER is the story of genocidal cyborgs, arrogant Highborn and desperate men and women with their backs to the wall.",
