  "description": "They’d finally caught the madman who had been kidnapping, torturing and murdering submissives. Damon had sat in that warehouse, clutching Oliver, the boy barely alive, and somehow in the weeks that followed Damon never seemed to be able to let him go.  Oliver was broken, in body, mind, and spirit. And for the first time since he had brought him home from the hospital, Damon started questioning himself. Was he going to be enough for Oliver? If he could even find all the pieces of Oliver’s broken soul, could he mend them? Had the horrors that had ripped through Oliver left too many holes for Damon to repair? And finally, if he was going to be able to put Oliver back together, could he stop his own heart shattering in the process?",
