  "description": "Stubborn, sixteen-year-old Princess Venus of Kelari wants one thing, to become a kelvieri, that is, until someone exiles her to Earth, kills her irrihunter and takes her family.Now she wants revenge.First she’s got to get home. But before she can return to Kelari, the Gods have commanded her to help an arrogant boy named Justus find his soul mate.Only she doesn't know the first thing about love.Rather quickly, her inexperience with human emotion is obscured by other matters—alien-controlled psychotic teens that are out to kill her, and a government group that is set on capturing and dissecting her.Worst of all, Venus will suffer a painful death-by-poisoning, thanks to Earth’s atmosphere, if she remains on the planet longer than one week.Still, Venus is a Princess and she's got a plan. Surely, with her help, Justus will fall in love with a human.But time is running out and Justus is falling for the wrong girl—her.Cover design by Steven Novak.",
