On my second attempt two years later, I followed everything Victor Cheng suggested and took advantage of every resource he provided and received an offer from McKinsey Daniel Suo, Business Analyst (Offer Recipient), McKinsey, Stamford Without Victor 's help, I never would have gotten an offer from BCG. What he teaches really makes the difference between getting an offer and not. Puttipath Tasnavites, Boston Consulting Group, Thailand After following Victor 's guidance, I had a complete breakthrough in my case interview performance and got an offer from Monitor.
