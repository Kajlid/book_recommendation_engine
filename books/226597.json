  "title": "Slow Cooker Recipes Cookbook: Easy, Healthy and Delicious Recipes",
  "description": "My name is Clark Weber. I am chef and I am a Chef in New York. These are the Slow Cooker recipes that I like most. I learned some of the recipes in this cookbook from different friends and relatives. I tried all of them myself and the results were fabulous. I would also like to mention that I included in this cookbook only those recipes which are fairly easy to cook, even though I have to admit that most of them will be ready in more than a couple of hours. This because slow cooked meals need more cooking time compared to classic meals. The advantage comes from the fact that the slow cooking process is healthier and adds a great flavor. Furthermore, I selected only the healthiest Slow Cooker recipes that will provide you with a balanced diet. The number of calories rarely goes beyond 500/ serving (2000-2500 calories/ day intake is recommended for a sedentary adult that needs to maintain his/ her current weight), therefore these are some recipes that will help you maintain or even lose some weight. I also tried to collect here only the low carb recipes, because low carbs meals are great for dieting.",
