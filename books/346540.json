  "description": "When it comes to relationships, talk show host Grace Fisher won’t stand for cheating—especially not from her fiancé, star hockey goalie Zack Hoolihan. Her weekly knitting group backs her up when she calls it off, but it doesn’t entirely ease the sting of betrayal. She won’t listen to Zack’s indignant explanations of innocence—she just wants to tie up loose ends and move on. Until he winds up injured, that is, and she finds herself playing nursemaid … Zack doesn’t know how that woman got into his hotel room, but he does know losing Grace has put him so far off his game, he ended up with a busted knee and a broken heart. If things aren’t mended fast, he’ll miss the playoffs, miss his girl, and lose everything. But if Grace is willing to push him into physical therapy, maybe he can pull her back into his arms—before their truce unravels. This time, he’ll do everything it takes to knit their relationship back together…",
