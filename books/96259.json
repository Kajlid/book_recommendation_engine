  "description": "The image of the strong female has been a pervasive one in literature through time. From Medea to Lisbeth Salander to Katniss Everdeen-we are eternally enthralled with what it takes to fight like a girl. More than just weapons in hand, we wanted to explore just what a girl’s got to do to make her way in the world and through some hairy situations. This short story anthology explores the strong female protagonist in a genre where the female is typically the “damsel in distress.”",
