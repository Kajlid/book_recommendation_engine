  "description": "An ancient evil has awakened in Earth Realm. The dead are rising, the oracles haven fallen silent, and foul creatures are devastating the baselands. When the dark sorcerer, Rathnakar, escapes his tomb, the First Mother chooses three champions to become the saviors of their time. The hopeful adherent, Eydis, wants nothing more than to lead a life of solitary devotion within the sheltered walls of a seclusionary. But when her pilgrimage to a sacred grove ends in a vision of the end of the world, she realizes the Mother requires a more dangerous service from her. Seeking the catalysts prophecy says can overcome chaos, she aligns herself with a notorious traitor, Orrick of Kroad, and Geveral, a dryad mage who has yet to tame his powers. Together, can the three unlikely heroes thwart Rathnakar and the wave of darkness threatening to devour their world?",
