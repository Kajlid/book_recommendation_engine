  "description": "Lily was born and raised in her parents’ general store in a village in north-eastern Thailand near the Mekong River and the border with Laos. Her early childhood was a happy one although her Chinese parents did not show their emotions much as befitted their age and culture. Lily was a happy little girl. Happy that is until a man she called uncle, a friend of the family, who used to help out in the shop, started abusing her at just eleven years of age. She didn’t feel that she could tell her family and it took two years before a chance happening in the school playground gave her an idea how to put an end to her torment. The solution was radical, but it worked. The man never bothered her again, but it also had the effect of making all the other villagers wary of her. Lily grew more and more lonely until at eighteen, she was perfectly ready to move the nearly 1,000 km to Bangkok to study medicine, although she knew no-one there and had never left the province before. However, life in the capital was not all roses either as she was short of money to pay for her course and living expenses. The only solution she could think of was to have several ‘boyfriends’ and she invented different personas for each one. It wasn’t long before the strain of her lifestyle became too much for her with disastrous consequences for people around her. However, would any of it have happened at all if she had not been abused as a child? The good people of Bangkok will never know, but you might. Tiger Lily of Bangkok is the thrilling story of a young woman’s quest for revenge.",
