Finn O’Malley and Lucy Butler had to figure out how to do just that as Finn left his home in Clarkstown, New York for Two Roads School of Music in California. Being a young talented musician, Finn thought it best for his future but wasn’t sure about leaving Lucy behind. Now, just one semester short of graduation and a promising future at UCLA, he throws it all away to return home. This leaves his family and friends questioning why. The Finn that has returned home is not the same boy who left. He’s broken and withdrawn. Lucy and his sister Rylan want nothing more than to bring back the Finn they know and love. From the moment Finn reconnects with Lucy, he feels the one thing he hasn’t felt in years—hope. As Lucy starts to bring him out of his shell, Finn begins to realize what real love really is. When his past collides with his future, how will Finn deal with the love he needs and the love he despises? Can Lucy help heal what lies inside?",
