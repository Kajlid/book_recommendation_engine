  "description": "Search engines have undergone a remarkable evolution since their inception during the early days of the internet. From basic keyword searches to complex algorithms capable of predicting user queries, search engines have become an essential aspect of our daily lives.As a search engine programmer, optimizer, and SEO expert, I have been fascinated by search engine algorithms since childhood. My goal in writing this book is to assist and inspire scientists, search engine enthusiasts, and research experts in finding solutions to search engine algorithms to simplify users' lives by answering their queries.In 2017, I published a groundbreaking book titled ‚ÄùThe Future of Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing - The next big technological break.\". This book became study material for postgraduate students across the globe, where I discussed AI search engines. I wrote this book to increase awareness about the latest technology in digital marketing. After publication, some professors at universities in Canada and the United States purchased copies and began teaching it in various courses, such as artificial intelligence, digital marketing, media arts, informatics, mathematics, and business management.So why did I write this book? I created a video on YouTube about my time-traveling through search engines, which received a lot of positive feedback from my social media followers, newsletter subscribers, colleagues, and friends. A mathematician friend of mine from London University suggested that I write a book about my ideas, and here I am, presenting it to you.This book contains my extensive research, personal reflections, concerns, and innovative ideas concerning search engines. Embark on a journey akin to a time machine, traversing from the early days of search engines to the present day and beyond. Throughout the book, I delve into the evolution of search engines since the early days of the internet, as well as my predictions for the future of search engines. Additionally, I provide detailed algorithms, documentations, and case studies on utilizing the new generation of AI search engines and my new type of search engine. Intended for research, PhD students, and academics, this book serves as a continuation of my earlier work, \"Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing - A New Technological \" which was published in 2017.",
