  "description": "A pioneer in gluten-free cooking, Roben Ryberg has worked with gluten-free flours for over 15 years. Now, in You Won't Believe It's Gluten-Free! , she vastly simplifies the challenges of this special diet--while perfecting the flavor of everyone's favorite foods. Completely comprehensive, You Won't Believe It's Gluten-Free! offers 500 recipes for all kinds of breads and baked goods, plus easy appetizers, soups, entrees, and salads to win over any crowd. It also features desserts for special occasions--even wedding cakes! Unlike the standard use of three or more flour blends, these recipes often call for just one flour, and many recipes include corn, potato, rice, and oat flour variations. This is an essential cooking bible for anyone with celiac disease, wheat allergy, IBS, or other gluten sensitivities.",
