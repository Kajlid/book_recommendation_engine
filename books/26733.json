The little voice buzzed in my head, and just when I was about to turn away and run out of the clinic, my name was called.Sixteen-year-old, Maya Rockwell, has it all: a new set of wheels, straight-A grades, and Alex, a hotter than Hades boyfriend with the personality of an angel.When her best friend kicks off the biggest party of the school season, Maya and Alex jump at the invite for some innocent fun, certainly not the drugs and predatory older crowd they confront.Maya barely escapes with her life: hers and another new one. She thought she had the answers, but in one terrifying moment, she can no longer pretend to be ignorant.",
