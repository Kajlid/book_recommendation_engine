  "title": "Keeping Quinn",
  "description": "He liked fast and loose—she was sweet and innocent.  Firefighter Brice Lancaster lived his life by a set of rules: No commitments, no attachments, no promises. Three rules that were easy to follow—rules that kept his heart safe, rules that should’ve kept his best friend’s cousin out of his bed. So what was it about Quinn that made him lose his mind? Maybe it was her shiny midnight hair that made him forget he hated attachments. Or her emerald eyes that made him want to promise her the world. Or her sexy smile that made him insane with lust and the need to claim her innocence and keep her.  Quinn Walker didn’t believe in boundaries—never had. She’d spent her life bouncing from one thing to the next—the wild child of the group. So when Quinn moves in next door to the man she’s crushed on for years, she knew she was in trouble. Big, strong, tatted, sexy firefighter trouble. Or maybe it was Brice that was in trouble because Quinn wasn’t going to let this golden opportunity slip through her fingers. No wasn't an option.  It was supposed to be just fun. They’d agreed on no strings. Blinded by lust, they both gave in. Brice broke his rules. Quinn let herself fall in love.  Then, in a cruel twist of fate, everything went up in smoke. Will one of them be strong enough to be honest—or was it all just a game?",
