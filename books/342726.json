  "description": "What does hardworking single father Matthew Warren want in a wife? Responsibility, practicality and a good rapport with his child. So why isn't he interested in the responsible, practical daughter of his matchmaking mother's best friend? Could it be that another Scott sister has gotten through to his guarded heart? He can't possibly be falling for Haley Scott, his daughter's new nanny, the very woman he almost fired for her free-spirited ways! Granted, his little girl is a lot happier lately. And so is he. Sometimes the best matches are the most unexpected.",
