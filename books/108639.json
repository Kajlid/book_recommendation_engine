She's tried to block him from her mind for good, but nothing can really erase the feeling she had when she was with him.And now he's got the nerve to return—leaner, meaner, and strong enough to pull her into his arms and kiss her senseless.

But Kasper knows she's the one woman for him … and now he's got to prove it to her all over again.",
