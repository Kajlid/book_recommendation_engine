  "title": "Because the Stars Shine Through It",
  "description": "In these fifty-four poems, Munsterman binds together a rough vision of degraded swampland with the decay of American life during disasters: personal, natural, ecological, and political. His words elegize the quaint attributes of love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice, paying respect to those lost loved ones who once stood as guardians for these slipping virtues. With verse unafraid to aim for the throat, gut, or heart, these sometimes rowdy poems command the reader take note of those voices whom history offers no time to honor. Elegy gives way to songâ€”sometimes moody blues and sometimes folk-bluegrass stomp. Despite the losses, these poems are about survival in the face of death, redemption in the face of defeat, about home; leaving it haunted by the men and women who raised you and returning changed by the experiences met along the way.",
