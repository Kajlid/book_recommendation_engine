  "description": "With poems that are \"as entertaining as they are compelling\" (Greg Pape) The Gravity Soundtrack will please both veteran readers of poetry and those who've never before picked up a book of poems. In this debut collection Erin Keane explores subjects ranging from classic myth, philosophy and religion to rock 'n roll, pop culture and children's book characters. The poems are finely crafted, with a \"confident and alert use of language\" (Greg Pape), and each one shows keen insight into the nature of what it means to be human. In The Gravity Soundtrack, the poet is not a voice from above passing truths down to the reader, but rather is right there with us in the muck and mire of human experience--and, all along, shows great compassion for our questioning, our losses, our uncertainty. In the end, Keane has few answers for this questioning, but, still, the book leaves us with a feeling of redemption and hope. Is it our very stories, she says, that finally redeem \"I couldn't give you/anything to hold, so take this wakeful night/know it can't make sense. What's left? At least/make it a good story. An offering, one last\" (\"Grievous Angel\").",
