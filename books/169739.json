  "description": "“A high-octane, electric look at Madison Avenue craziness from a pair who’ve been there and done that.”—Publishers Weekly One woman attempts to beat the boys club at their own game in this wickedly funny novel that is both a takedown of the advertising industry and an inspiring story about breaking through the glass ceiling. Twenty-something copywriter Kay Carlson has landed her dream job at the top ad agency in New York City, but it turns out life at the edgiest shop in town is less “Lean in” and more #MeToo. Talent and hard work don’t count as much as winning the approval of her hotshot creative director, Elliott, whose idea of team-building is bullying his boy tribe to tag along to the strip club. Meanwhile, Kay is stuck at the office penning puns for the cat food account none of the cool kids will touch. When the agency's biggest client threatens to fire them, Kay realizes her job will be first on the chopping block if she doesn't find a way to outshine the old regime. Winning another account will require all her creativity and strength, but can Kay find the confidence to risk it all so she can rewrite the rules from the corner office? Or will she be on the first bus back to Jersey, too washed up to write copy for the phone book?",
