  "description": "Foul-mouthed and short-tempered fifteen year-old Lucy Knight hates just about everything. She especially despises the fantasy books adored by her only friend Amber. And Lucy is certainly nothing like the attractive, thin, plucky teenagers that star in those tales. However, Lucy is revealed to be the Mythic, a human chosen to stand guard over The Dark, a powerful evil sent here from another world. But someone wants to set The Dark free and only Lucy Knight can save us all from total annihilation. We are totally skegged!The Mythic combines action and humor in a journey through two very different worlds. Fiction and reality will collide and neither will be the same again!The Mythic is the first book in The Mythic series. The second installment is The Mythic and the Horses of Doom. The third book, The Mythic and the City of Sweet Sorrow, is coming in 2013.",
