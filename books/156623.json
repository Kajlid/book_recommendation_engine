It’s not a place where people go to live out their deepest, darkest sexual desires—there are no handcuffs or blindfolds.The 27 Club only admits those who die young and tragically. My brother was recently bestowed membership and joined many of our ancestors before him. I know I’m next. This is my destiny, and I was ready to yield.But then I met Nate. He awakened a sensuality in me that had never been explored, never satisfied. I knew then I could no longer accept my destiny. Nate’s presence controls me.

And if there’s a way to cheat it—I must.",
