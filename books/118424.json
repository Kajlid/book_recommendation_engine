  "description": "A damaged fighter ... A hunted hustler ... A love neither expected or thought they deserved ... Layla and Taylor are finally where they want to be. But Taylor wonders if he can be the man Layla needs. If he can leave the fight behind and step up. If she deserves more than he can give. Layla is ready to move forward and settle down, but will Taylor be able to put the underground fighting ring behind him? And will he resent her forever for making him choose? No one said their love would be easy. To keep it, they're going to have to fight. And this is one fight where losing everything just might be worth it.",
