  "title": "Evangelicals on the Canterbury Trail: Why Evangelicals Are Attracted to the Liturgical Church - Revised Edition",
  "description": "Why do so many evangelicals find themselves attracted to liturgical traditions today? Robert E. Webber suggests some answers by describing his own migration from an evangelical denomination to the Episcopal Church. Webber found that the Anglican tradition met six important needs: a sense of mystery in religious experience, a Christ-centered worship experience, a sacramental reality, a historical identity, a feeling of being part of Christ's entire church, and a holistic spirituality. Six other evangelicals who made similar pilgrimages join Webber in sharing their stories and their dreams for new openness in which God's people, both liturgical and free church, will find increased value in each other's heritage.",
