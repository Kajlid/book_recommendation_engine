  "description": "Megan Milks, a true gem in the Chicago literary scene, marks a new kind of daring with her chapbook, \"Kill Marguerite.\" The story runs with its variations on a theme and bends them with a retro life in an old school video game. The result is a fresh, entertaining story with a heroine the reader lives and dies with, again and again, while continually forgetting that she is nothing but a pixelated image on a screen, whose volition is tied to the trivial push of an A or B button.\"Megan Milks...explores the older, let’s say more “pure,” video-game age in her new chapbook, entitled “Kill Marguerite,” in which her lead character exists inside a video game and the reader takes in her trials and experiences in that setting. The experimentation works; the book, which comes via Another New Calligraphy, has a throwback feeling that in some ways feels like an approaching future and in others helps the reader long for an abandoned, 8-bit past.\" --Tom Lynch, New City Magazine",
