  "description": "The most candid account of the Sex Pistols you will ever read, this new updated edition marks the 30th anniversary of the band's first recordings. Glen Matlock, original bassist for the Sex Pistols, was also one of the band's founding members. Those were the days before punk, when the group (known as The Strand) was more influenced by glam rock than by the New York Dolls. Then things changed—with Malcolm McLaren as their new manager and Johnny Rotten as their new lead singer, the Sex Pistols became ultimate punk band. Matlock's account of the Pistols' rise to global infamy is a frank and insightful account of a group of intelligent malcontents, determined to change the music industry and attack the stale conventions of society. His story vividly captures the flavor of 1970s Britain, a society seething with creativity and social discontent. For this updated edition, he's added new material on the reunion tours of 1996 and 2002—and speculates on what may be next step for the group.",
