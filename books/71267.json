  "description": "The survivors of the end of the world finally face off with the zombies, the rebellious army trying to control what remains of the United States, and a hybrid experiment that has left some people half human/half zombie. With both sides using ancient good and evil, a little bit of forgotten magic, and a handful of C4, the showdown explodes with action. One side is forcing people into slavery and crucifying all who stand against them while the other side is balancing justice with vengeance and mercy.

Will the zombies inherit the world or will someone worse win the battle? No are holds barred as the survivors fight back with pure rage...",
