  "description": "⭐️ From Best-Selling, Award-Winning Author Cassandra Ormand.⭐️  What's a woman to do when she finds a drop-dead gorgeous man stranded on a deserted stretch of road in the middle of the Wyoming wilderness?  It's amazing just how much trouble a man can get into because of a flat tire. Liam and Isa both discover just how powerful destiny can be when their two worlds collide in a twist of fate that leaves them both questioning their current life path. Will love win the day, or will Liam inevitably go back to his globe wandering ways?  When Isa Navo sees a handsome stranger on the side of the road behind a car with a very obvious mechanical problem, she can't believe her eyes. What part of heaven had lost the godlike creature in front of her? The stranger wears nothing but tight blue jeans and a pair of cross-training shoes, leaving his sexy torso all too visible to her gaze. And her gaze takes in everything from his black hair, taut six-pack, muscled arms, shoulders to-die-for, and tight backside. She struggles to decide if she should help the gorgeous god that has fallen into her territory, or be smart and paranoid and keep driving. Can she really leave him out there alone, stuck on the nearly deserted road that winds through the mountains she calls home? Or will she allow him into her heart and her bed?",
