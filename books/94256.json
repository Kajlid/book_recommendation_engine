  "title": "Voyager: The Art of Pure Awareness",
  "description": "Inspired by the Upanishads sacred writings and the poetry of Zen and Taoism, Voyager is an inspirational and transformational work that conveys the ineffable truth of existence -- we are pure awareness at our centre, human in appearance. There is a light that shines beyond all things on earth, beyond the highest, the very highest heavens. This is the light that shines in your heart.  --Chandogya UpanishadWe are voyagers, set on a course to find our own unique purpose in life. Each of the twenty-five chapters is a journey toward our inner self. By exploring the shores of our human-beingness ever more deeply, we realise our soul is the lighthouse -- the light that guides us safely home. By simply experiencing ourselves without distraction of mind, we see beyond personal drama to our one true inner nature. We realise we are all connected in the still ocean of pure awareness.It is only the mind which appears as the world and as bondage; there is no world other than the mind. On inquiry, this mind turns out to be nothing more than ripples (thoughts) in the still ocean of pure Awareness . --The Ribhu GitaPure awareness is an art that requires practice to quiet the surface of mind and still the moving waters of our emotional seas. Awakening is recognising all world appearances are illuminated from the light that shines in our heart.We stand at the bow of our ship. The sky is clear, the sea is calm. ...Now voyager sail thou forth to seek and find . --Walt Whitman",
