  "description": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewElise Primavera returns with an adventurous companion to her beloved holiday book, Auntie Claus. This time, Santa's big sister is back with a lesson for her grand-nephew Christopher Kringle.When Christopher hears from the Spam twins that Santa Claus is bogus, he informs his family that he's beginning to doubt Christmas. Thrown into a tizzy, the Kringles sends him straightaway to Auntie Claus, who tells him that \"all the best things are invisible...sometimes you need to believe to see.\" Christopher, however, wants proof and decides to investigate by getting on the the B-B-and-G (bad-boys-and-girls) List. With his aunt's magical key, he travels to the North Pole, where he meets a group of nasty PRUNES (Parade Rainers United National Elite Society) who try to make him a permanent member. But thinking like a true Kringle, Christopher realizes that believing in Christmas is much better, unlocking the door to a pretty spectacular family.With all the magic and grandness of Auntie Claus, Primavera's follow-up proves to be another winning adventure. The lush artwork and whirlwind story line lend just the right air of majesty and mystery, combining the wonderful strangeness of Willie Wonka, the extravagance of Auntie Mame, and the Christmas flavor of A Miracle on 34th Street. Another modern-day classic for your holiday bookshelves. Matt Warner",
