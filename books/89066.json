  "description": "\"When the fate of one is changed, everything changes. One person changes everything.\"Mercy Singer died five months ago, but the doctor’s managed to bring her back. And she was told by her new therapist that it was normal to think there was danger around every corner, and that seeing things was part of the healing process. What Mercy hasn’t told anyone is how vivid her dreams are, how it’s not actually her dying in them, and she also hasn’t mentioned the conversations she’s had with people that vanish.And when the new boy in town, Tristan Holmes, finds her freaking out in the street, claiming to see a man that isn’t there, she thinks her return to school might have been too soon. Until his sister approaches her, claiming to know what’s going on, and that she wants to help Mercy.Now numbers keep floating around Mercy’s head, and she knows it’s a countdown to something big. There’s a darkness coming to Balefire Bay High, and she thinks she’s the only one that can stop it.",
