  "title": "Stretch: Unlock the Power of Less -  and Achieve More Than You Ever Imagined",
  "description": "We often think the key to success and satisfaction is to get more: more money, time and possessions; bigger budgets, job titles and teams; and additional resources for our professional and personal goals. It turns out we’re wrong.Using captivating stories to illustrate research in psychology and management, Rice University professor Scott Sonenshein examines why some people and organizations succeed with so little while others fail with so much.People and organizations approach resources in two different ways: “chasing” and “stretching.” When chasing, we exhaust ourselves in the pursuit of more. When stretching, we embrace the resources we already have. This frees us to find creative and productive ways to solve problems, innovate, and engage our work and lives more fully.STRETCH shows why everyone from executives to entrepreneurs, professionals to parents, and athletes to artists perform better with constraints; why seeking too many resources undermines our work and well-being; and why even those with a lot benefit from making the most out of a little.Drawing from examples in business, education, sports, medicine, and history, Sonenshein teaches a powerful framework of resourcefulness that allows anybody to work and live better.",
