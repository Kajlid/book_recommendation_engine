  "description": "This trip to Paris is Ford’s last chance, or Charley going to cut her losses and move on.    Texan mud hen Charley Parkhurst has been dating moneyed, gorgeous Ford Dalio for five wonderful years, but everyone is getting antsy because he hasn’t proposed. Charley loves him and wants to marry him, but Ford has never committed to anything beyond the next few months with her. When Ford whisks Charley away for a weekend in Paris to crash a royal wedding, just like when they used to sneak backstage at rock concerts in college, will Paris be the perfect place for Ford to finally propose, or will Charley dump him and move on with her life?  This is a stand-alone short story with a happy ending. The characters are connected to Blair Babylon’s bestselling Billionaires in Disguise: Rae series, but you don’t need to have read it to enjoy this story.",
