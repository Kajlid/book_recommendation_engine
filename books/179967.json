It isn't until she sees him in person with another girl that their relationship and her sanity reaches its breaking point as she comes to question her own existence, and his. Suddenly, she is receiving murderous text messages from a girl who doesn't seem to actually exist; a girl who claims to be her.Has she lost her mind? Is she sending herself these messages? Or perhaps social mediums have gone haywire and the virtual is becoming the live. Autumn is beginning to lose her senses, and perhaps, her life, as she struggles to justify her own existence. This is Book One of The Renegades Trilogy which explores the fantastical, humorous, and sometimes deadly possibilities of today's \"plugged-in,\" mediated society.",
