  "description": "THIEVES IN THE FAMILY appear by day and night in gardens, dreams, encounters with the dead whose spirits transcend the web and weft of time. These poetic vignettes are captured with a cinematographer's eye, laced with a love of dialogue, and an endless fascination with stories heard on subways, planes, in kitchens, and in foreign countries. Corridors of arrivals and departures bring together a seemingly disparate cast of colorful and rich characters who have more in common than one would think - a collection of postcards from working-class Queens to the Global Village.",
