  "description": "Once a whip-smart detective and a powerful Shadow, Brooke Chandler has been stripped of both her memories and identity. She now spends her days scrubbing floors, reduced to nothing more than a servant girl. But even with no memory of her previous life or how she ended up a slave, Brooke won't remain trapped for long-not with friends and enemies alike vying to find her. Her escape attempt lands her in the deadly, beautiful land of Faerie, where nothing is as it seems-possibly including her father, the Winter King. Here, she rediscovers her past life, full of allies and foes all waiting for her return. Faced with the opportunity to flee, Brooke must decide which fate terrifies her more: staying where her enemies wants her dead, or returning to confront the ones who want her jailed for murder.",
