  "title": "Social History of Economic Decline: Business, Politics, and Work in Trenton",
  "description": "Nineteenth-century Trenton, New Jersey, was a booming commercial and manufacturing center for iron, rubber, steel cables, machine tools, and pottery. Trenton's golden age lasted until the 1920s, when many local industries were bought out by national companies. The story of the subsequent social, political, and economic decline of Trenton is also the story of twentieth-century urban America. John Cumbler analyzes the decline of Trenton in terms of the transition from civic capitalism to national capitalism.",
