  "description": "Zora Walker believed she had a great life. She dreamed of being an artist and had been accepted to a performing arts high school. She celebrated her acceptance with her parents, not realizing that would be one of their last happy memories as a family. Less than three years later, her world has turned upside down. Her father has been dead for years, and now her mother, Winnie, has been murdered by a dirty Philadelphia cop.  As Zora grieves for Winnie, she becomes angry because Winnie’s death—her murder—has seemingly been swept under the rug. Zora doesn’t want her mother’s legacy to be erased, and she doesn’t want Winnie to be another black woman who is invisible to the community, media, and elected officials. She promises herself that her mother won’t be forgotten, but at what cost? Is Zora ready to take on an entire city? Will she be able to find justice for her mother, or will Winnie become just another hashtag?",
