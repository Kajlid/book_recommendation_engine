  "title": "Young Woodley",
  "description": "Roger Woodley, a prefect at Mallowhurst Public School, is bewildered by love. Laura Simmons, wife of housemaster Frank Simmons, dislikes her husband as much as she dislikes being a housemaster's wife.Initially this play was denied a licence for public performance. Accordingly its first London production was at the Arts Theatre, a members-only theatre club. It opened on 13 February 1928 and generated such public discussion that the Lord Chamberlain's Office reversed its decision. The play's first public run opened at the Savoy Theatre London on 5 March 1928, with the same cast.Subsequently the play was adapted as a novel by the author.",
