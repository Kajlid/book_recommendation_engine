  "description": "Levi Benkert was playing with his children in the park when he received an urgent phone call from a friend asking him to drop everything and fly to Ethiopia to help organize an orphanage for children destined to be murdered as part of a tribal superstition known as \"mingi killings.\" Moved by his friend's story, Levi packed his bags and left for what he thought would be a two-week trip. But upon meeting the children, Levi knew there was no turning back. Six weeks later, Levi, his wife, Jessie, and their three young children sold their home and all their belongings and relocated to Ethiopia indefinitely. No Greater Love documents Levi's journey-from the challenges he faced establishing and running the orphanage and finding adoptive homes for the children.",
