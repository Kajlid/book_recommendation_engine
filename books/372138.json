  "title": "Walter Potter and His Museum of Curious Taxidermy",
  "description": "Walter Potter was a self-taught Victorian county taxidermist of no great expertise who delighted generations with quirky tableaux peopled by tea-drinking kittens, arithmetic-doing rabbits, cigar smoking squirrels and gambling rats. His collection was on view for nearly 150 years before, tragically, being divided at auction ten years ago this month.The new book Walter Potter's Curious World of Taxidermy, by Dr. Pat Morris with Morbid Anatomy's Joanna Ebenstein, brings this collection back together--if virtually--with informative text, dozens of new photos of the best loved tableaux, and a new introduction by legendary pop artist (and Potter collector!) Sir Peter Blake.",
