  "description": "My name is Sora and I'm a sin-eater.I take your sin, wash your soul clean and send you on your merry way. Or at least, I did.I've spent my entire life doing the right thing, being a nice person. I suffer in your place because itâ€™s my job, and most people don't even thank me for it.For the last ten years, I've even loved the same man.Until today.Today, my world fell around me in pieces, and I realized that I'm done doing for others. It's time to do for my damn self.It's time for you to deal with your own sins, your own pain, and your own consequences. You see, not only will I no longer suffer your sins...I'm going to give them all back to you.",
