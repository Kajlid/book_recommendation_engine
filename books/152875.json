  "description": "Damian Cass died when he was a teenager at the hands of his own father. A hateful soul afterwards, and lost in between realms, his only solace was to find someone to torment, someone else to blame for his father’s evil ways. Until Damian is sent back unwillingly for another chance at life, a life he can’t fully remember.  Aurora McKay has lost everything important to her. Living on grief and hope, she hangs on by a thread each day. When she ends up in the very same place Damian lands, the last thing she expects is to feel anything for him—a boy who has as many secrets as she does.  In this sequel to The Sharing Moon, the most difficult paths lead two people on a journey they never imagined. One where both fear and belief bring forgiveness to a heart that was never supposed to feel love.",
