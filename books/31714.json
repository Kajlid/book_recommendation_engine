  "description": "How would you create a superhuman? That the key to this startling new novel by the master original thinker of science-fiction, A.E. van Vogt. For The Silkie was a being that could move through space, water, or on land with equal ease, could think like a computer, communicate etherically, and change form to suit changing circumstances.But were the Silkies all that was claimed for them? Were they truly man's own creations as heirs and helpers or were they \"ringers\" from some unknown outer-space world of some anti-humanity conspiracy?The Silkies themselves did not know. . . and that's what makes this action-packed utterly unusual novel great. It's van Vogt's first new novel in many years.",
