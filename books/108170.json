Not anymore though! For some bizarre reason, the young princess could not explain nor understand, the book was writing itself!”A young princess decides to run away from the dullness of the palace in search of an adventure, like the ones she used to read when she was a child. However her plans soon change as she finds herself facing an ancient curse that threatens to destroy the entire kingdom. Now Amelia, with the assistance of an eccentric young woman called Marcella and the brave Golden Knight, must find a way to stop a flock of bloodthirsty dragons from burning down the whole world and turning it to a wasteland.",
