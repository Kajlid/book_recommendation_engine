  "description": "The Seaside ChronicleJuly 12, 2022\nBuzz Bait\nSeasiders,News on the docks is Adelaide Bradley is back in Seaside, and rumor has it she’s here to stay! (No ring was spotted on her finger, I might add!) After eight long years of living in the big city and working for Massachusetts General, she has decided to return to the shores. One can only imagine how thrilled Barbara and Keegan are to have their oldest daughter back.But it makes you wonder if Adelaide will continue to peruse her nursing career or is she here to help at her family’s restaurant, The Seaside Grill.A little seagull has planted in my ear that Gannon Wilson is taking the news rather well, considering Adelaide broke his heart all those years ago. I did notice Gannon has been working more than usual, piloting that precious cargo through our ship channel. Maybe he is picking up extra hours to purchase a piece of jewelry, considering he was seen in Reef Jewelers only days ago.We’re rooting for the two of them to reunite at least as friends. Everyone knows the former homecoming king and queen had a bright future ahead of them until…well…that’s another story for another issue, Seasiders!Fair winds and following seas!",
