  "description": "When a reality show comes knocking, you take their offer. That’s exactly what we did, and now our cattle ranch has become a dude ranch. But the producers want more from me than to teach these city slickers how to saddle up. They want me to play the part of Romeo in an on-screen romance. Until I tell them I’m engaged.Too bad that’s a bold-faced lie.Now I have to find a willing participant in my charade for the next twelve weeks and my friend has the perfect solution. She’s gorgeous, smart, and sexy as sin—and she’s agreed to fake our engagement, for a price.If making it look real is as fun as I think it’ll be, I’m in trouble. Because this woman might be the one who tames my wild side.",
