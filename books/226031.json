  "description": "I want him to be my first. I want him to be the one. I want him to be my everything.  I didn’t expect to spend my eighteenth birthday stranded in the pouring rain with no way to make it home. I didn’t expect to be rescued from the worst night of my life by the most amazing man I’d ever seen.  His name is Nick, and he says he wants to take care of me, says he’ll look after me, says I don’t need to be alone anymore.  He treats me like a princess, like the fragile little girl he saved from the cold.  But I like him… I like him like that. I’ve never liked anyone like that before…  And it’s weird, this thing we have… It’s like I can’t decide how we’re supposed to be… what we are… Until he says the words…  Call me Daddy.",
