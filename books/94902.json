  "description": "SEVEN DWARF STORIES is a twisted collection of adult short story fairy tales detailing the life of each of the seven dwarfs before knowing each other. Dark fiction sets the stage to explain how each dwarf developed the personality they are known by. The authors of this collaboration are some of the top notch newer or indie authors worthy of reader attention. Although these authors may generally write paranormal, science fiction, crime, steampunk, erotica, fantasy and beyond, together, they tell you the untold tales of the seven dwarfs that will chill your bones and leave you never looking at the storybook dwarf in the same sweet manner again.",
