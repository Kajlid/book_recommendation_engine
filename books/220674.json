  "title": "Incredible You",
  "description": "From the USA Today Bestselling author of Magnificent Bastard comes a sexy, flirty, dirty standalone…on ice.  They say Jake “The Dragon” Falcone earned his nickname by setting fire to the ice his first season in the NHL. But just between us ladies, I’m pretty sure he earned it for the dragon in his pants.  From my first hug as his fake girlfriend, it’s clear he’s packing below the belt. After a few fake dates I realize he’s packing…everywhere. Heart, brains, sex-vibe, a killer sense of humor—Jake is everything I’ve ever wanted in a man.  He’s also my client and OFF LIMITS. Oh, and he has a crazy ex who's out for my blood.  I should steer clear, and I would, if my dragon weren’t so completely incredible…  ***  The name sounded like a joke. Who in his right mind wants a “Miraculous Mess” running damage control on his f*cked up love life?  But by the time I leave her apartment on day one, I’m hooked on this sexy blonde. I want all of her, from the smart mouth that makes me smile to the wounded heart I know I can heal.  But can a Madison Avenue princess and a man from the wrong side of the tracks live happily ever after?  Warning: Incredible You is a standalone romantic comedy told from both the hero and heroine's point of view.",
