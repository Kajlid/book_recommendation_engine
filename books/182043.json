  "description": "You'd think Rocket could get a break and rest on her laurels for a bit, but no. In Book Two of the series, Rocket's secret is revealed before she's ready - before almost anyone in her whole world is ready - and though her three closest friends are behind her all the way, she's shunned by rest of the omicrons, who are shocked and just don't know how to deal with the sense of betrayal they feel, having been kept in the dark for so long by a group they've always been unconsciously suspicious of anyway. And on the heels of being battered by the broadcast of her secret, Rocket and her friends are engulfed in a whirlwind of perilous plots by enemies both new and old, and they have to rise to defend their world and the people they love even as their own world is changing around them and omicron phases out in favor of even more faraway dreams... Roan Reedling writes the Rocket McGee Series from the suburbs of Orlando, mainly with middle graders in mind, but they're sci-fi adventures that kids of any age may enjoy. You be the judge.
