  "description": "Garden City, Kansas, 1888. Unlucky in love, sisters Allison and Rebecca Spencer have resigned themselves to a spinster lifestyle, replacing their thwarted romances with work, family and friends. Love, however, is not done with the sisters, and a second chance awaits each of them, in the most unexpected place. But danger also stalks Allison and Becky. A band of robbers threatens deadly vengeance on the town, and a more personal threat lies in wait, intent on destruction. When promises fail and danger looms, can love save the sisters from harm? This steamy western romance contains explicit sex scenes. This is the large print edition of High Plains Promise, with a larger font / typeface for easier reading.",
