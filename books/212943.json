  "description": "From the authors of The Chap Manifesto comes a yearbook for the sleek of trouser and loose of moral. Sartorius, Epicurus, Libido ... these are the signs of the Chap zodiac. If the manifesto was a call to arms - gentlemen of the world unite, you have exquisite manners to maintain! - then the almanac is a practical guide on how to uphold these standards through the year.",
