  "description": "Anytime, anyplace, Ethan Crane’s your man. An agent’s agent, he’s tough, smart, and fearless. Exactly the guy you want when the stuff hits the fan–and the kind Beth Whitney avoids like the plague. It took a fiancé in the business to teach her, but she’s learned her lesson: Don’t. Date. Agents. It’s this rule that’s kept her employed at the agency, doing her part for world security from behind a desk. So when a case throws the two together, Beth’s determined to keep it strictly professional. So far, so good–except for the steamy kisses, the red-hot phone sex, and. . .What was that rule again?To Ethan, Beth couldn’t be less his type if her father ran the agency, which, oh yeah, he does. Still he can’t help but find her work in the field a total turn on. Off the field it’s even better. But hot pursuit of a notorious information broker is what they should focus on–not each other. That can wait until they’ve accomplished a job well done. Or can it?",
