  "description": "This boxset contains:Book #4 Seize me From DarknessBook #5 YieldThis is a dark erotic fiction series and may disturb some readers. There comes a time when good men go bad. Seize me From Darkness: In this dirty, bloody world we live in, the answers to prayers aren’t always pretty angels. Retaken by human traffickers, Jazmine’s one hope is ex-cop, ex-mercenary, Pieter, a man with a glower that stops lesser men in their tracks. She prays he can save her, but this savior is far from perfect and his flaws may prove as devastating to Jazmine as the torture of her captors. The fire of dominance never dies. Yield: Wren, the rich girl with a tainted past, is on a crusade to track down her father’s murderer only to find not one, but two, bad men. Moghul is a sadist and businessman, with a finger in every kinky enterprise he can get his hands on and a jaded view on life. When his eye turns to Wren, he realises how dull life has been. He hasn’t tried everything after all. When they can’t say no, things might be more…interesting. Glass is the dominating ex-SAS soldier. Each man is determined to keep Wren for himself using methods that may be illegal, immoral, or likely to make somebody feel the pain for a long, long time. If you lie down with bad men, be prepared to get up on your knees. The ending will be the reader’s decision. Give Wren to the dark or to the light, then read the other ending if you wish to. Warning: BDSM themes, graphic violence.",
