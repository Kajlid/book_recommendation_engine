  "description": "One evening, a frightened and bedraggled golden eagle is brought to the London Zoo, his young life constrained to a bleak cage far from his native Scotland. It is tempting for Creggan to forget: to bury memories of the mountain and seas and, above all, the glorious skies of his homeland. But there is an eagle who won't let him forget, an eagle for Callanish who encourages him to remember every vivid detail - only by remembering can the caged creatures keep themselves truly alive. Creggan owes his survival to Minch. It is she who makes it possible for him to seize his chance of escape when the moment comes, and it is her memory that eventually draws him back to the zoo. For Creggan has made a vow that he will never leave Minch to face a slow death in her cage.",
