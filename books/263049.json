  "description": "\"How far would you go to get the one man you've been dreaming about all your life?\"\n\nI am such a cliché.I have the hots for my boss.Well, he’s not really my boss since that job title belongs to my best friend in the whole wide world and as much as I love her to death, I don’t exactly spend countless hours imagining licking her hard abs with whip cream like I do her business partner.Too much?Sorry.My bad.Unfortunately, when my head is on the magnetic, breathtakingly gorgeous Dean Knox, I get carried away.I can’t promise that outbursts like this one won’t happen again, so fair warning.I’ve been working at Royal Magazine for two years now, and although I love it, watching the man I’m crushing on, surrounded by gorgeous beauties, twenty-four seven, is kind of a bummer.But lo and behold, I think I might have just found a way to get what I want.I might have to lie, steal, cheat and basically lose all my morals in the process, but if it gets me the man of my dreams, then it will be worth it.Right?I guess there’s only one way to find out.Wish me luck. I think I’m going to need it.\n\n\n\n*The King is the first book in the After Hours Series where you will be introduced to sizzling characters such as the perceptive smug Duke, a wild arrogant Prince and their swoon worthy King. You’ll also meet laugh out loud heroines with just enough sass and grit to give these Royal men a run for their money.\n\n*Some scenes may be too hot to handle so don’t say I didn’t warn you. *wink wink*\n\n*Due to mature language and adult situations, this book is recommended for readers over +18 - Reader discretion is advised",
