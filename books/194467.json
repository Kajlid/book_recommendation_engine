  "description": "Two Strapping Alpha Billionaires. One Girl Looking For A Fresh Start. A Heck of A Wild Ride.  \n***POV from all 3 main characters.***\n  Allison’s first day at her new job in Colorado turns out to be far more exciting than she could have ever possibly imagined.  Not only has she been able to land her dream job working side-by-side with one of her idols, but she'll also be working in very close proximity to two dangerously hot, incredibly rugged and outrageously seductive men.  From her experience, she could be running down the street of Madison Avenue butt naked and she wouldn't solicit the attention of any man.  Other than the police, no Manhattanite would even bother looking twice.  But out here in Colorado she's caught the attention of two insanely handsome and strapping men who can't seem to keep their hands off of her.  A recent bad break-up and years of shitty boyfriends have eaten away at Allison’s willingness to ward off the advances of her boss’ older brother.  After a night of toe-curling debauchery, she never imagined she'd be caught red-handed and guilty as sin.  With nowhere to hide, she finds herself pedaling hard to save her job.  She acted on impulse and loved every single sinful second of it, but could she now be paying the price?  ***Part 2 of this sexy ménage romance / alpha male billionaire romance series by bestselling author Scarlett Avery’s is a must-read seductive roller coaster. ***   Billionaires' Indulgence is a series of 5 books. The entire series has a HEA ending.",
