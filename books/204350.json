  "description": "College football’s most notorious tight end wants to show her that everything’s bigger in Texas.    Cassie   I can’t stand jocks. And I don’t know the first thing about football.   So it’s just my luck that the tutoring job I take to get me through graduate school involves making sure a dumb jock passes his classes.   Now, I’m babysitting Colton King, a spoiled arrogant player who’s as famous for his bedroom antics as he is for his football skills.   The tight end with the filthy mouth tells me he’ll show me that everything’s bigger in Texas.   And heaven help me, I just might be considering it.   * * *   Colton   My life is one big party, and that’s never going to change.   Not even if my coach finds me a nerdy tutor he thinks will keep me in line.  Miss Goody Two Shoes is uptight, high-strung, and unimpressed by the fact that I’m a campus legend.   Even worse, the hot little tutor is as pure as the driven snow.   Debauching her and making her mine is the ultimate challenge. And I always rise to the occasion.  *This is not a football-heavy story, so if you're not into sports, don't worry! It's light on the sports and heavy on the steam!*",
