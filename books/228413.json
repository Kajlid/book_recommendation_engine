  "description": "Lady Isabella Montgomery is an adventurer at heart. While other young ladies are looking forward to the London season, she longs to set out on a Grand Tour. Despite her vehement objections, Lady Isabella is about to embark on her second season. As the only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Linwood, she’s expected to marry a titled gentleman and give birth to his heir. When fate intervenes on the road to London, she discovers love and adventure are not mutually exclusive. Lieutenant John Armitage wasn’t trying to be anyone’s knight in shining armor. He certainly never intended to open his heart to a duke’s daughter. In a society where matches between aristocrats and the lower classes are frowned upon, his heart wants only Lady Isabella. Will he be able to woo and win her before another gentleman captures her heart forever?",
