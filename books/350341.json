  "description": "What was it like being \"different\" in 1959? For some it was hiding one's self from the puritanical world, but for some in the sophisticated artistic scenes of the major cities, it was more complicated. Lonnie Coleman was breaking a lot of taboos in 1959 by writing with any sympathy at all about homosexuality, but in SAM he goes even farther and gives his characters a full dimension of virtues and flaws, showing how difficult it was, even for the enlightened, to live a rational life in the midst of nation-wide ignorance.",
