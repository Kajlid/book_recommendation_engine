  "title": "Lady of Horses",
  "description": "Journey back into the deep mists of time, enter the lives of a savage people whose rituals include human sacrifice and ritual cannibalism; a superstitious people who fear the magic of the Shamans who live among them; a patriarchal people who forbid women to be hunters, or go among the horse herds, or become shamans.Enter the frightening, powerful life of Sparrow, the daughter of the tribe's Shaman and a captive woman. She is destined to do all those things, for the Horse Goddess herself has come among the herds of the tribe in the form of a proud mare, and she has chosen Sparrow to be her servant and priestess.Lady of Horses is a passionately romantic book, a historically accurate book, and a wildly adventurous book. It is a love song to the ancient, mysterious bond between women and horses, and, like Marion Zimmer Bradley's Mists of Avalon , takes the reader back to a time of goddess worship and women's power.",
