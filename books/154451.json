  "description": "This book was written for those diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. It can be difficult to navigate the complexities of this condition, and I hope this book will help to prepare you to take on the challenge of living life after the diagnosis. We are born with EDS, yet finally receiving a diagnosis is devastating to many of us. This book includes some personal stories, so that you will be able to see how others have dealt with the diagnosis and learned to live their lives as they have faced the challenge of EDS and overcame the obstacle of self-pity, to move forward into a new life. Faith is the backbone of this book and I hope that through faith you will also learn to cope with EDS.",
