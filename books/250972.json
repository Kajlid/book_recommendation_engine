Her only escape from reality was her dreams; dreams of a castle she thought only existed in her mind...until she woke up within its walls in the Thirteenth Century. Eric Bartholomew Hadley had found no time for love, unless it became necessary to lure the opposite sex into his bedchamber. As future lord of his castle, Eric will honor his father's last request and marry a shrew. Knowing the loveless union will provide his castle with a lady and hopefully an heir he reluctantly agrees to the upcoming marriage...until he discovers Tessa in his courtyard. Can true love overcome all the odds and bridge the gap of eight centuries?",
