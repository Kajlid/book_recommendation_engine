I’m playing Juliet’s understudy, a role that comes with no glory, and yet Mr Moser can’t seem to keep his eyes off me.When I walk in a room, he stares. When I leave, he follows. And when I’m cold, he drapes me in his sweater.Is this seriously happening? Is the gorgeous older director falling for the curvy college student? Or am I caught up in my own daydreams?Under Study is a short and steamy instalove story, starring a smitten older man and the sweet college student he can’t get enough of.",
