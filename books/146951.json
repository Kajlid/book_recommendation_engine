  "title": "Forced Autonomy, Phase 4",
  "description": "Book 4  The United States has collapsed. Those citizens who are left are in one of two classes. One: Citizens who have undergone forced lobotomies, as mandated by the United Nations. Two: Those who fight against their tyranny.  Petra Kingsley falls under both classes. She falls in line with the drones, pretending her procedure worked. Four years she's existed among their ranks, hiding in plain sight, being worked to the bone and starved almost to death.  Lawson is a bounty hunter of sorts. His target isn't the guilty, it's those who are lost in the folds of a broken society.  When he spots Petra working in the masses, he stops at nothing to help her escape.  But he has no idea who exactly he's helping--and who will now be hunting them both?",
