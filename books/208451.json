  "title": "The Borrowed",
  "description": "A propulsive crime drama featuring a legendary Hong Kong detective on a decades-long quest to expose the city’s dark underbelly. Covering six cases that span Kwan Chun-dok’s impressive fifty-year career, The Borrowed takes readers on a tour of Hong Kong history from the Leftist Riot in 1967; the conflict between the HK Police and ICAC (Independent Commission Against Corruption) in 1977; the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989; the Handover in 1997; to the present day of 2013, when Kwan is called on to solve his final case, the murder of a local billionaire, while Hong Kong increasingly resembles a police state. Along the way we meet Communist rioters, ultraviolent gangsters, stallholders at the city’s many covered markets, pop singers enmeshed in the high-stakes machinery of star-making, and a people always caught in the shifting balance of political power, whether in London or Beijing. A gripping and brilliantly constructed novel from a talented new voice in crime fiction, The Borrowed paints a dynamic portrait of Hong Kong and reveals just how closely the past and present are connected in this fascinating city.",
