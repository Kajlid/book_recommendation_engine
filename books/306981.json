  "description": "I’ve been living under storm clouds since my honorable discharge, but Julian’s the sun.I’ve tried everything to deal with my PTSD from yoga to sunning my butthole, but nothing seemed to help.So when my brother suggests a therapy dog, I figure I don’t have anything to lose. The last thing I expect is for the dog to come with a cheerful, quirky trainer I can’t get out of my head…I’m too screwed up for love, but a chance to explore a side of myself I didn’t realize existed until recently is too good to pass up.But the more I get to know Julian, the more I start to think I might not be beyond saving after all...Ranger is a low angst standalone MM romance featuring a slightly grumpy veteran, a sunshiney animal trainer, an ornery goat, a deaf donkey, and some seriously hot encounters, resulting in a very happy ending. While Ranger was a side character in Heart (Ballsy Boys 3), his book is a stand alone and can be read on its own.",
