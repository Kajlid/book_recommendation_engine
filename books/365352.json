  "title": "Tunes: A Comic Book History of Rock and Roll",
  "description": "Engaging as well as informative, Tunes traces the rise of rock and roll through the format of comics. Capitalizing on the immense popularity of the graphic novel, Vincent Brunner has assembled illustrators and cartoonists to visually depict the history of rock music through comics. This unique approach will not only appeal to those who grew up with the bands, but also to an entirely new generation of budding fans. Full of colorful personalities from larger-than-life divas to modest men who made it big, the story of rock is compelling and diverse. From Elvis and Little Richard to the British Invasion in the 1960s and onward through the eras of punk, heavy metal, new wave, and grunge, this series of black-and-white graphic depictions ranges from hilariously personal to absolutely wild. Each strip is accompanied by humorous yet informative text recounting the early struggles, successes, and challenges of each band. Also included is a selective discography for each band or artist, highlighting their biggest hits or most memorable songs.",
