Kathleen being the centre of the conflict and the heiress to the throne is propelled into a terrifying world of power and responsibility by a king as harsh as the land he was born to rule.

And if he can't have her, no one will. Sweeping from household to household, a secret of death and murder causes each life to hang in balance in a war of kill or be killed. Tragedy and betrayal, vengeance and forgiveness, disgrace and terror, and the fate of the Kingdom rely on the secret of the deadly mark.",
