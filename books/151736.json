  "description": "David Bruno, an atheist philosopher and Harvard professor who offended modern Muslims by publishing a book comparing their religious fervor to that of medieval Christians, gets a mind blowing shock from a bolt of lightning on Mount Subasio when he comes to Italy, hoping to escape the media spotlight. A strange woman rescues him, heals a deep burn on his chest overnight, heightens his sense of smell and gives him the Francis-power of communing with nature. Nola is a wild supernatural being who lies about being a teacher and calls him a badass philosopher. She's fallen out of favor for being too human, lost her wings and seeks to change him to redeem herself in the eyes of the forces above. Besieged by the paparazzi, aware that he's under the spell of a mischievous angel, David struggles to deal with a new and unusual way of life.",
