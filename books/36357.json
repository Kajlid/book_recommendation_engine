  "description": "Colin Reyes is tired of the matchmaking attempts by family and friends. He knows they mean well, but if he can't celebrate the holidays with the one person he loves most, he's decided to spend this Christmas alone. Fatima Leone is out searching for the perfect Christmas tree when her car skids off the road near Colin's mountain hideaway. At first angry at the interruption, then concerned, he goes to lend a hand and finds Fatima unconscious. Has fate intervened on his behalf by bringing them together? Or will she walk out again?",
