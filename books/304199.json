Euliano is off to a good, no, a brilliant start.” — Kathy Reichs, New York Times best-selling authorEnd-of-life care— or assisted deathWhen her elderly patients start dying at home days after minor surgery, anesthesiologist Dr. Kate Downey wants to know why. The surgeon, not so much. “Old people die, that's what they do,”is his response. When Kate presses, surgeon Charles Ricken places the blame squarely on her shoulders. Kate is currently on probation, and the chief of staff sides with the surgeon, leaving Kate to prove her innocence and save her own career. With her husband in a prolonged coma, it's all she has left.Aided by her eccentric Great Aunt Irm, a precocious medical student, and the lawyer son of a victim, Kate launches her own unorthodox investigation of these unexpected deaths. As she comes closer to exposing the culprit's identity, she faces professional intimidation, threats to her life, a home invasion, and, tragically, the suspicious death of someone close to her. The stakes escalate to the breaking point when Kate, under violent duress, is forced to choose which of her loved ones to save— and which must be sacrificed.Perfect for fans of Kathy Reichs and Tess GerritsenWhile the books in the Kate Downey Medical Mystery Series stand on their own and can be read in any order, the publication sequence IntentMisfire (coming January 2023)",
