  "description": "A beautiful Cajun woman struggles with paying penance for her children’s death by helping a bum. Jewel puts ten years of therapy to good use by playing good Samaritan one day. Overhearing the town boys talk about pulling a prank on the bum who pushes his shopping cart around town painting murals on the tired country stores, she decides to warn him.At the rundown building where the bum seems to stay, she’s shocked to be greeted by a clean shaven hunk wearing only jeans, a compelling smile, and endless sex appeal. When Johnny meets Jewel, he sees right away that her beauty is far more than skin deep and can’t help but answer the need so plain in her eyes, despite his own past hurts.  But surrendering to Johnny’s fiery love will require Jewel to release past sins that refuse to die, and accept redemption so that she can live.",
