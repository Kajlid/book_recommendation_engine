  "description": "THE YEAR MRS. COOPER GOT OUT MORE won a 2015 Royal Palm Literary Award (Florida Writers Association) as an unpublished manuscript (now published) in women's fiction, also first-place Chick Lit winner for the 2016 FAPA President's Award. Living in a small town in Maine … doesn’t keep you safe. The coastal tourist town of Great Wharf, Maine, boasts a crime rate so low you might suspect someone’s lying. Nursing long-simmering secrets, agoraphobic empty nester Mallory Cooper fears most everything. Careful to keep the red wine handy and loath to leave the house, Mallory misses her happier self—and so does her husband. To please him as well as deflect a nosy neighbor who’s curious about a New Age gift shop, Mallory steps out to explore. A chance comment to the vampy store owner seals the proprietor’s and others’ fates while Mallory chases her own demons for an overdue showdown. With the courage to change, Mallory learns that forgiveness, love, and friendships will help her overcome fears and scars.",
