  "description": "If Nero Wolfe and his sidekick, Archie, would ever admit to an Achilles' heel—which they wouldn't—it would be a weakness for damsels in distress. In these three charming chillers the duo answer the call of helpless heroines with nothing to lose-except their lives. First a beautiful young Aphrodite comes to Nero looking for a hero-and the answer to the mystery of her father's death.... Then an old flame of Archie's reignites with a plan that may corner him into a lifetime commitment-behind bars.... And finally a detective's work is never done, as a hot tip leads the team into the sizzling center of a sexy scandal that could leave them cold-dead cold.",
