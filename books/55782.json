  "description": "\"Unless things have changed since the beginning of time, it's not even remotely possible for two guys to make a baby. A family of two, yes, but not three.\" Being a straight, single man wanting to adopt in today's society is hard enough. Not being straight? Whole new level. Red tape, classes, interviews, not to mention the expense, drive so many away with shattered dreams. Steven comes from money, has a degree in business management, even though he's chosen to work as a bar tender, he believes making a family can be done. He's determined to do it, with or without long time lover Jorge. At thirty-four, it's time. Fate, of course, has other plans. His haunting past, and the brutal grind of daily life all have the power to destroy both the life he has with Jorge and the family he's trying to build. Determination might not be enough to keep his dream of a family alive. XBar is about a man finding the truth in lies, lies in truths, and learning how to be stronger than he ever thought possible.",
