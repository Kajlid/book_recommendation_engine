  "title": "Fantasy Romance: Poems of Myth & Magick",
  "description": "Fantasy Romance is a collection of poems conjured from the ether, peopled with mythological characters and fantastical creatures, and designed to transport you to other times and otherworlds. Here, gods and goddesses, mages and monsters, witches and warlocks, sprites, wights and nixies hold sway, and sometimes ordinary people can become embroiled in extraordinary circumstances.Here are poems and songs of love and longing, in strangely familiar language, and in a cadence meant to resonate with the magic that is already within you. So sit back and relax, and allow it to seep into your very heart and soul. Included in this collection are original songs written to accompany the Lake Traveler series of fantasy novels.",
