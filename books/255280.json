  "title": "The Bears in the Bed and the Great Big Storm",
  "description": "How the wind blew! How the thunder crashed! How the lightening flashed! Terrified of the wild storm blowing outside, Baby Bear, Little Bear, and Young Bear crawl, one by one, into bed with their parents. \"There?s no such thing as monsters,\" their dad tells each of them. \"What a scaredy-bear you are.\" But when there?s a rat-tat-tat at the door and the lights go out, Daddy Bear suddenly isn?t quite as brave as he thoughtâ€¦ Bestselling illustrator, Jane Chapman, vibrantly captures the joy of snuggling into a warm bed, as well as the strange shadows that can appear in the middle of the night. A wonderful story to read aloud, this is the perfect book for anyone, big or small, who might be afraid of the dark.",
