  "description": "Jade is singularly focused on his soul-snatching mission on earth, but the clock is ticking.  Jade must prove that he’s the right demon for the job or else he’ll find himself back in Hell much sooner than anticipated. His pseudo “second chance” at life—though only a temporary relief from eternal damnation—is all the motivation he needs to do the Devil’s bidding. However, his entire mission is threatened by a chance-encounter with Sarah Michel.  This opportunistic and uncaring business woman—seemingly an easy target for Jade—just happens to also be the spiritual assignment of Steven, a soon-to-be angel sent by God to save her soul.  When Sarah learns that a company projected to make her a millionaire has a sinister agenda, she must decide to reveal the truth—which may cost her life—or look the other way, which will cost her soul.  While she is completely unaware her soul is the subject of a spiritual tug-of-war, the decision she ultimately makes will bind her to one realm forever.",
