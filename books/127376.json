She’s also the sweet little girl my human family will die to protect. After a deadly kidnapping attempt, I’m left responsible for getting what’s left of my family to safety.And I’m not sure I’ll live to see them again.I turned myself into bait, and I got caught. Actually, a feral Royal shifter bit me. And apparently, I’m now married to this untamed beast who’s determined to make me crave his touch.I’m falling under Devin’s spell too. How can I resist, especially when he vows to be my hero?Because my sacrifice didn’t save my remaining family. They’re in the hands of the enemy, but Devin promises to rescue them and protect them as if they were his family. It would be a perfect ending to our crazy story… if we survive long enough to make it happen.⚠️ This book contains scenes that will make you blush (and re-read) but don’t expect a sweet fairy-tale romance. In the Shifter World, only the strong survive. Contains dark fantasy aspects.✓ A closed-door (clean) version of this book is available as Devin by Dana Archer",
