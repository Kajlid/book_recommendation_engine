  "description": "In the 1980s Gene Roddenberry and Robert H. Justman gave Marc Cushman permission to write the definitive history of the first Star TrekÂ®. they backed their stamp of approval by providing documentation never before shared with the public. These Are The Voyages, published in three volumes -- one designated for each season of TOS (The Original Series) -- will take you back in time and put you into the producers' offices, the writers' room, onto the sound stages, and in front of your TV sets for the first historic broadcasts. Included are hundreds of memos between Roddenberry and his staff, production schedules, budgets, fan letters, behind-the-scenes images, and the TV ratings. Buckle your seat belts; the trek of a lifetime continues with Season Two.",
