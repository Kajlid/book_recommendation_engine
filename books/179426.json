  "description": "Have you ever read stories in which the characters felt so real that it seemed like you were part of their stories too?   A young Indian engineer and his Bangladeshi colleague befriend a sprightly child waiter; when their friendship grows, the two of them realise that the boy was different - the boy was gifted beyond their  imagination…  When the most skilled thief in a little village in South India disappears from public view after a failed heist, everybody forgets him… till he returns a decade later… a completely different man.  A group of college students, after a series of failed attempts to find a cook, are ecstatic when they find the most talented cook they could hope for… until they discover that cooking wasn’t his only talent…  A young man at an airport catches a glimpse of the most sought after movie star in town and stops to recollect the time he knew her once… long before she had become a star…  A college graduate moves into a house which he shares with a 53 year old student, and realises that there was more to the eccentric man than what meets the eye…  Author Roji Abraham brings alive a strikingly simple, yet memorable collection of eleven short stories exploring the various facets of the lives of ordinary people. This ensemble collection is bound to take you on one emotional roller-coaster ride - a ride that will make you laugh, smile, introspect or even cry.",
