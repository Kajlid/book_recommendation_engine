  "title": "The Quill Pen Killer",
  "description": "At the end of a long, winding avenue at the crest of a rather steep hill, sits an extraordinary, old house of immense proportions. This house has all the scary stuff of a house in a really good ghost story, like turrets and gothic iron work, old doors that creek and little windows that poke out of attic bedrooms. It is 'home' to the family DeAngeliuson, a vampire as blood thirsty and beguiling as any known throughout history, at least he was up until he 'settled' here, from his blood thirsty days, curtailing his lifestyle (as many a father does when he settles in to raise a family). His daughter, Jessica, loves books and clothes. She wears yellow, not black, and she likes school. \"It's like you hate blood!\" her father moans wishing her to be more celebrity evil than straight A student. Does her father get his wish? And all too chaotic for him to control? Read it and find out!",
