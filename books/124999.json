  "description": "A. J. “Jesse” Prieo had lost everything. He was a broken man, and after five long years of survival in a world filled with genetically engineered creatures terrifyingly similar to velociraptors, he was finally ready for it to be over. But a chance encounter with a young girl changed everything. Sebastian Cyrus was born to lead. After conquering one of America’s most secure military bases, he has begun to reshape the world around his own twisted vision. Along with other survivors of the apocalypse, Cory Melkin, a sword-wielding radical on a quest to destroy the raptors; Evelyn Phelps, a woman who would do anything to survive; Andrea, an alcoholic doctor; and Kate, a lost child full of surprises, Jesse runs headlong into Cyrus and must find a detour if he is to race to discover the awful truth behind The Raptor Apocalypse. The Red Asphalt is the second book in The Raptor Apocalypse series and contains mature themes and violence.",
