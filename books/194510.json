  "description": "* * RECIPE for Bobbi's Tomato Bruschetta included * * Business owners feeling taxed to death, a killer on the loose, and a mechanical cat who catches two-legged rats... Betty Hitchens has successfully opened her bakery, Betty's Cakes. Sales are good, there's been no recent drama in her life, and even her allergies are less severe than the year before. But nothing good lasts forever. When an appraiser from the local appraisal district is found dead in her car, the list of possible suspects grows by the minute. Others soon become victims of terrible outbursts seemingly connected to her death. The police begin investigating, and a local business owner with anger management issues becomes a prime suspect. Betty's convinced of his innocence, but will the small town baker figure out who the killer is before disaster strikes again? Before it's all over, Betty will need help from close friend and ex-reporter Martin Lane and the mysterious Ojudh. All of whom eventually discover the old adage is true â€“ that laws are like sausages, and it's better not to see how they're made. Or watch how they're enforced.",
