  "description": "This is an alternate cover edition for B00Y9MUABY Melanie Stanwood is a brilliant girl, nearly a genius. She can take isolated facts and bits of data and make connections. But she can’t seem to make a connection with her mother, because Melanie was born as a boy named Michael. Her mother can’t quite grasp what it means to have a transgender child, and they live in an awkward, uneasy truce.  Things can’t continue that way, so Melanie goes to live with her mother’s only friend Marilyn, a glamorous divorcée and widow who turns out to be a bit of a genius herself at making connections. Together with her daughter Carol, Marilyn connects Melanie to the world of girls, a world that rightfully should have been hers from birth.  A companion to the book Salvations.",
