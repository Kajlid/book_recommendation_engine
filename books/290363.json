  "description": "In a future where corporations and nanotech implants run the world, Mace Armstrong is in the wrong place at the wrong time... Literally.The mission is simple: find a way into CommTECH’s state-of-the-art compound, bug the lead scientist of their bio-engineering team before they release an implant that will kill millions, get out without anyone knowing he’s there. For an ex-army ranger, even one out of his element by a century, it should be a walk in the park. Right?Wrong.Because Mace isn’t the only one who breaks into the secure facility. With the building overrun with terrorists, he has to find a way out before he compromises himself and the entire Red Zone team to the enemy.But there’s no leaving without the woman who inadvertently helped him get into the building in the first place: Keiko Sato, CommTECH’s press secretary. She’s brilliant, beautiful, and knows how to hold a grudge. Against him. She has no idea what secrets he and his team are harboring, or that she’s calling to the animal that’s been locked inside of him for a century.Even as she argues with him about everything, Mace is determined to protect her. He got her into this mess, and he owes it to her to get her out of it.Whether she wants him to or not.Each book in the Red Zone series is a STANDALONE.",
