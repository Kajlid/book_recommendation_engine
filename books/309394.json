  "description": "The plan was to move away and never look back. Get away from him, out from under my father’s disapproving stare, and start a new life in Willow Bay. It was supposed to be my fresh start, but instead my past followed me. The one thing I desired and couldn’t have. Weston Jackson. I hated how he made me feel things that I couldn’t give into without turning my world upside down.I wanted to make him pay. For the way my father now looked at me. For the way I saw myself. But most of all… for wanting him the way I did.This is a full-length high school and college enemies-to-lovers and new adult romance with high angst, suspense, and gutting emotion. It's book one in the Willow Bay series that will have interlinking storylines. Away Game can be read as a standalone and starts off a three-book planned series. This is the only MM story. The others are MF.",
