As the anniversary of the wreck approaches, Michael's grief grows more suffocating.

The instant sparks between her and Michael, who arrives to help her during a power outage, come as a complete surprise and so does her uncanny bond with his daughter.For the first time, all three feel compelled to examine their inner and outer scars in the light of love.
