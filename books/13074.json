  "description": "In 2159, the dictator of the United States is slain. The country breathes easier again, welcoming the first presidential election in over seven hard years. But, although the people rejoice the death of the “Red Queen” and the oppressions of her reign, they refuse to forego one legacy she left The right to commit one free murder a year. Now, in a country in limbo, we meet the pawns and players in the genocidal Brad - A victim, consumed with fear; Simon - A registrant, determined to prove himself; Frank - A candidate, caught between what is right and what is correct; and America, itself. Will the upcoming election be the end of the ultimate freedom…or is there still too much at stake?",
