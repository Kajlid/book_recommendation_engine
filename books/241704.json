  "description": "What do you do when you’re told to run or risk everyone you’ve ever loved being killed? Well, you run like your life depends on it, because in reality, it does.  Lone wolf shifter Ava Pearce is trying to find her normal. Between working, fighting and eating she really doesn’t need much more to keep her occupied and her mind off a past that just won’t leave her the hell alone.  A quick glance from across a room was the only thing needed to kickstart a chain of events that forever alters Ava’s once solitary existence. You can’t run from your past, and when Ava’s catches up to her, it wrecks destruction on not only her, but her Mates lives as well.  New friends are made, old enemies resurface, and Ava has to figure out how to protect not only her Mates but more people than she ever could have imagined.  Warning: This book is an Reverse-Harem romance book and does contain violence, sex and swearing.",
