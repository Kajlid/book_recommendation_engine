Pale, slender, with a shock of angel-blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, his delicate ways always seemed peculiar to the village folk. And one morning, Benjamin's life takes an eventful turn - the day he meets Lord William Harrington, that brooding dark-eyed stranger who takes a shine to him at market.  Soon Benjamin finds himself dressed in fine clothes, tucked away in Lord Harrington's beautiful manor house. But as Benjamin is soon to discover, things are not quite so simple and innocent as they first appeared. For it turns out, Benjamin is to become Lord's Harrington's little secret.  This m/m victorian romance contains sexually explicit content and not suitable for anyone under the age of 18. It is is approximately 30,000 words, has a happy ending and does not end in a cliffhanger.",
