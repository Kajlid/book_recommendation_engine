  "description": "If I ever find my way to redemption,I can only hope the path there was worth it.I want to believe it'll be worth my weary body and tortured mind.A place filled with peace and forgiveness.But if it's not...I hope I find my way right back to where I am,Because I may be weary, my mind tortured, and my soul black...But my heart is full and I am surrounded by those who love me.This life may be hell,But you can be damn sure it's a hell of my own making.",
