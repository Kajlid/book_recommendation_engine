  "description": "An autobiography of a fat, Jewish girl brought up in Salt Lake City. The author relates stories of her childhood and how, after being run down by a car, she goes crazy and ends up in an asylum for a year. There she learns that people are mad because they have actually seen the truth about what the world is really like, a truth not easily available in Salt Lake City. Then she runs away, drops out, discovers sexual and emotional fulfilment and becomes deeply involved in feminism. She finally discovers, through the alternative comedy circuit, a comic talent which is taking her rapidly towards stardom.",
