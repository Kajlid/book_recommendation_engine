  "title": "The Perception of Space... and its Measurement",
  "description": "This e-book corresponds to Chapter 3 of the printed book entitled \"Galloping with Light - Einstein, Relativity, and Folklore\", and is the third of the e-Series entitled \"Relativity free of Folklore\".Because you deserve more than just folklore, in this e-book you will find the surprising answers to the following intriguing questions:1) Do we really know what Space is? How is it perceived and how is it measured?2) What do we mean when we say that an object is rigid?3) If all the objects in our Universe contracted or expanded overnight in the same proportion, could we know they did?4) What do we mean by the length of an object?5) Are the measurements of length and time completely independent? 6) What in the world did Einstein mean when he said that the space where we live is curved?The fact that the reader may not have a scientific education does not mean that s/he does not have the intelligence to understand profound concepts -- as long as they are presented with semantic and epistemological clarity. After all, Einstein said that Science is simply the refinement of our intuition and everyday experiences.",
