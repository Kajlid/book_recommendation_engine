  "description": "In this second novel by Carrie Hannah, a young woman uncovers secrets from her past and tantalizing connections to her present when she discovers a portal that allows her to travel back in time. When Justine was 6, her mother disappeared. Her only family is Ducky Fitzroy, the eccentric antique dealer who rescued and raised her. Now, at 28, Justine is searching for a purpose in her life. One night, in the alley alongside her apartment in a Brooklyn brownstone, she accidentally discovers a portal that takes her back in time to 1905. There, she meets a young Irish housekeeper named Maggie, living in the same brownstone. Above the fireplace, Justine finds a painting of a woman who strangely resembles her mother. The painter turns out to be the dangerously handsome, James Grey with whom Justine experiences an irresistible electricity whose currents ripple through time. James won't reveal the story behind his portrait, so together with Maggie, Justine sets out to unlock the secrets of the woman in the painting. Along the way, she uncovers clues that reveal her own mysterious connection to the past and the past's inexorable connection to the present. The longer Justine remains in the past, the more intriguing and dangerous her journey becomes. Will she learn the truth about her extraordinary lineage before her time in the early 20th Century runs out?",
