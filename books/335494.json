  "description": "Stacey Gordon tried to tell herself this couldn't be happening to her. Suddenly she was no longer contented wife of a brilliant architect. Instead she had been spirited away to the nineteenth-century American frontier - and into the arms of a handsome, virile man whom she could not tell the truth about herself, and who made her forget who she really was and what she should not do.",
