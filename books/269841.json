  "description": "\"After 39 years of digging for paydirt in Squamskootnocket, New York's famously feeble real estate market, Ginger Kanadoo has again struck...dirt. Her newest listing? A \"starter\" outhouse with water views of weed-choked Squamskootnocket Lake. With no closings in a year and the wolf at the door, Ginger will stop at nothing to seal a deal - she'll even team up with her 93-year-old aunt Maxie Kanadoo, \"The World's Oldest Living Realtor!\" Meanwhile, Ginger's own badass, newly Wiccan daughter Harvest is eager to pitch in with a naked rite or two. Then there's Tandy Brickenhausen, the cleavage-wielding rival out to poach every listing in the greater Squamskootnocket Valley. Will the outhouse find a buyer? Will Harvest's potions conjure a sale, or wake the dead? Will Maxie retain her coveted title? Will somebody let the air out of Tandy's bra? Cracks in the Foundation is a hilarious, dead-on send-up of the wild wild world of real estate, small towns, white zinfandel, black magic, outhouses and the American Dream.\"",
