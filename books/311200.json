Soon, I'm spending almost every single day with the guy.He’s growing on me too. We’ve always had this unspoken chemistry brewing between us. When we finally give in to it, it’s just as spectacular as I secretly predicted. The sex, and everything else, keeps getting better and better between us too.But can I really take this guy seriously? Or am I only setting myself up to fail?",
