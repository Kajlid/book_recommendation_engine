  "description": "Regina has everything a woman in the ton could possibly want. A beautiful manor. A generous allowance. A handsome duke. But the one thing she secretly yearns for she fears she will never have…her husband’s love.  Forced to marry Regina after they were discovered in a passionate embrace, the Duke of Glenmoore has hardly spoken a word to his wife since their wedding night. Instead he’s spent the past three months drinking, gambling, and trying to forget he ever said, ‘I Do’.  But when the duke falls from his horse and is confined to bedrest, Regina suddenly becomes much more difficult to ignore. Especially after an impulsive kiss rekindles the fires of their desire. She may not be the wife he wants…but is she the woman he needs?   Find out in the third novella in the best-selling A Duke for All Seasons series!",
