  "title": "A Maverick Inuit Way and the Vikings: How to connect with the peoples of the North",
  "description": "In her Maverick way, never planning anything more than two weeks ahead, Mary Jane travels through Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Finland and the Orkneys, Shetlands and Inner Hebrides.She learns that the Vikings were the first Europeans to land in the Americas (not Columbus); ate seal meat dished up by her Inuit hosts in Ilulissat; and went dogsledding overnight. She discovered why Greenland got called green and went up the coast by ship. And was accused by some other visitors of being a colonist.In Iceland she hired a car and drove around the whole island. She nearly got the windows blown out by strong winds and discovered an unexpected Celtic link to the Icelanders. In Norway she took the train to Stockholm and mistook tourists waiting to view the palace in Stockholm for cleaners. Mary Jane was surprised to discover that the Orkneys had been settled in an organised way for thousands of years and that the Shetlands were more Norse than Scottish and that a king of England had been a Viking raider.With 480 maps, photos and other imagesBY THE AUTHOR OF A MAVERICK NEW ZEALAND WAY, FINALIST IN THE TRAVEL CATEGORY, INTERNATIONAL BOOK AWARDS, 2018.",
