  "title": "A Mere Christian",
  "description": "Christians are not buckets to be filled, but fires to be kindled. What they believe and do is more important than what happens to them. My purpose in writing A Mere Christian is of course to share what I’ve gleaned from Lewis, Chamblin, and others. The closer we get to the ever-certain return of Christ for his Church, the more God makes his followers to understand what has previously been mystery. Our view of that return is closer than was Jack’s and more of God’s mystery is revealed. We need to know what we believe and why we believe it. Above all we need to understand just how great is our God! I am extremely indebted to C. S. Lewis and Mere Christianity. His incomparable work originated as a series of three broadcast radio talks in Great Britain during World War II. I owe many thanks also to Knox Chamblin, Ph.D., professor at Reformed Theological Seminary. His iTunes U course on C. S. Lewis taught me a great deal. Walter Hooper, Lewis' personal secretary near the end of his life, called him the most thoroughly converted man he ever knew.",
