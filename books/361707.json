  "description": "My Dearest Reader,When you hear my story, perhaps you will think me a man unable to control his own hungers…his own temptations. But I warn you that I am no such thing. I am simply a man who knows what he wants, and what he can't live without.It is only fair to tell you that my clan is one descended from magic. I have learned these powers are both a blessing and a curse--for the magic that flows through my blood controls my fate utterly and completely.When I first saw the beautiful Loris, I knew she was my unoliaeth, my oneness, the woman I am destined to unite with for all eternity. At that moment, I allowed my passion to lead me to do the I employed a forbidden magic to win Loris's heart.How did I know that my error would lead to a black curse that still haunts me today? How could I have known that the curse would irrevocably cast Loris' affection for me to another man?Now I am left to ponder how I might win Loris back--black curse be damned. I believe there must be a way. For while it is the darkest realms of magic that keeps Loris from becoming mine, there is another power at the undying, unending love of one man for one woman. And I pray that in the end, that will be enough…Your obedient servant,Kian Seymour , Castle Tylluan, London",
