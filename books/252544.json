When he was a younger man, Thulric Lostborn stood against a monster that hunted his people. He barely survived and lost those closest to him. In his older years he becomes the village blacksmith and his victory has faded from memory. A mist rolls across the land, one that heralds death and terror, a mist Thulric has endured before. Joined by Ragnhild, a hunter of beast and men, the Viking must succeed or the world that he knows will come to an end.
