  "description": "I’ve met the greatest guy ever.  Noah Walsh is handsome as sin. He’s sweet and smart and successful and sexy—all the best adjectives beginning with “S.” My six-year-old daughter worships the ground he walks on ever since he fashioned her smiley face pancakes out of bananas and blueberries. Oh yeah, and he can cook.  The only problem?  I dumped this great guy a decade ago, right after I wrecked his life.  And boy, this man holds a grudge.This is Book 1 of the Perfect Guy series, but can be read as a stand alone book.",
