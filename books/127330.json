  "description": "“I would give up my life for her, brother.”Leo Tucker is tall, dark and dangerous all the things Avery Delany doesn't need in her simple life. When he pushes his way into her life and turns it upside down, she has no choice but to go with him on the wild ride. He pulls her out of her comfort zone testing her ability to be patient. The more time she spends with him, the more she sees that under the bad ass biker facade is a kind and caring person, she could fall in love with. It all depends on his ability to keep her safe from the skeletons, resurfacing from his past, hell bent on using her to get to him.",
