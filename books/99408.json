  "description": "When the demon, Ophidian, killed Jode's wife and son, he made the mistake of not killing Jode too. Through sheer willpower, Jode survived the attack. He didn't come out unscathed, though. Turned away at the pearly gates, because of the demon blood coursing through his veins, Jode began a trek to avenge his family. Several hundred years later, he's tracking a team of demons through the desert. He finds his prey, and in the process stumbles across a plot so sinister, he has no choice but to gather a group of misfits from the small ranching town of Viejo. Together, they are humanity's first and only line of defense against the coming apocalypse.",
