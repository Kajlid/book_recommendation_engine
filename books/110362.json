  "description": "\"Lauren Weedman is irresistible\" says The New Yorker of her performance in The Five-Year Engagement. From The Daily Show to Horny Patty in HBO's Hung, Weedman is a girl gone wild, a performer who tells true, hilarious, and embarassing stories she actually lived through. In A Woman Trapped in A Woman's Body, Weedman riffs about comical and cringe-worthy experiences like her time at The Daily Show, where she developed an entirely one-sided infaturation with Jon Stewart, or the time when she stomped on the sacred agreement between couples and read her boyfriend’s with disastrous results. Weedman's stories are excessive, dangerously self-deprecating, and darkly funny. Like when she confesses to having lied about being raped when she was in college and the havoc that comes from one itty bitty moment of feeling too too sorry for herself. With \"relentlessly candid introspection and ferocious wit\" (Los Angeles Times), Lauren Weedman serves up hilarious of essays about what NOT to do as a fully realized, functional adult. The writer and performer of one-woman show like Bust, Wreckage, and If Ornaments Had Lips, Lauren Weedman is one of the brightest comedic actresses at work today.",
