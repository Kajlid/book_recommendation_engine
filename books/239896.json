  "description": "When Leo Brennan is traded to the Buffalo Bedlam two weeks after knocking their captain out of the line up on a badly timed hit, the enforcer’s dream life becomes a nightmare. He should be happy about going to a Cup contender, but the fans hate him, his teammates are lukewarm, and everything that could go wrong with the transition, does. He vows to play through the next few months to fulfill his contract, hopefully win the Cup, and then get as far from Buffalo as possible.​ No way will he stick around. Kelsey Fraser pulls double duty working for player services and the Bedlam’s fan outreach team. When the organization tasks her with leading a series of media events designed to change the fans’ negative opinion of Leo, she wants no part of him — after all, he gave her brother a concussion. But the opportunity would take her career in the right direction. She can’t turn it down. Professionalism will have to surpass her desire to hit him with a hockey stick. Spending hours together, Kelsey and Leo learn they are far more alike than different. Both are fiercely protective of and devoted to their families, and their chemistry is strong enough to make them reconsider everything they thought they wanted. The question of what will happen after the playoffs looms like an impending blizzard. Pulled in different directions by offers and obligations, they must decide what matters most… and if they can give it to each other.",
