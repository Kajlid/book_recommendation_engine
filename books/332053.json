  "title": "Presence: Stories",
  "description": "A moving, final collection of stories by Arthur Miller  Throughout his career as one of the foremost playwrights of the twentieth century, Arthur Miller wrote a remarkable series of highly regarded short stories, pieces that reveal the same profound insight, humanism, and empathy that are the hallmarks of his great dramatic works. Presence is a posthumous gathering of Miller’s last published fiction, a group of stories that appeared in The New Yorker, Harper’s, Esquire, and elsewhere. “Bulldog” describes a young teenager’s surprising first sexual experience while “Presence” relates a man’s encounter with a woman he has just seen making love on a beach. “Beavers” tells a haunting tale of nature, creation, and destruction. In “The Performance,” a Jewish tap dancer enthralls Hitler. “The Bare Manuscript” reveals a writer’s unusual methods to revive his muse, and, finally, “The Turpentine Still” presents a portrait of a man examining his legacy. Displaying the sureness of an artist in his autumnal prime, Presence is a gift that all fans of Miller’s work, as well as readers of contemporary fiction, will welcome.",
