  "description": "The semi-autobiographical, riotous account of stage-struck young David Kolowitz, originated on Broadway by Alan Arkin, working as a delivery boy in a sewing machine factory. Denying his parent's wishes for a druggist in the family, he leaves their dreams and his devoted girlfriend Wanda behind and is soon enlisted (and paying for) a slot as the \"leading man\" in a third-rate theatrical company while being vamped by the resident less-than leading lady, the daughter of the hammy \"artistic director.",
