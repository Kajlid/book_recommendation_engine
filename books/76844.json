  "description": "This book can be read as a standalone novel or part of the series.What do a private detective, a hacker and an assassin have in common? The desire to help when justice needs a hand.C'est La Vie is a rollicking detective mystery thriller featuring Raja Williams and his partner Vinny Moore. Neither the dark, tragic anti-hero nor the James Bond super-hero type, Raja Williams is a wealthy Oxford-educated PI of mixed Caribbean descent who possesses a strong empathic power and a sixth sense for evil that gives him headaches and steers him straight into trouble. His partner Vinny Moore is a gorgeous hipster geek who prefers hacking computers to haute couture.Raja and Vinny go to Paris when the wife of a visiting British professor disappears and three policemen are executed. The investigation leads straight into the world of club drugs, white slavery and an international criminal known only as the Scorpion. The writing style is lean and fast paced, with a hint of hard-boiled and plenty of humorous banter between the two protagonists, a la Dashiell Hammett's The Thin Man.A colorful cast of characters, great dialogue and a suspenseful, twisting plot make C'est La Vie an entertaining tale.",
