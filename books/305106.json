  "title": "The Naxalite Movement in India",
  "description": "The Naxilite movement is one of the important components in the political spectrum in India. At one stage, the 'spring thunder' caused tremors in practically all the states of the Union and posed a serious challenge even to the democratic structure. The Idealists saw in it the beginning of a new world, a new socio-economic order. But soon sordid politics took over. The movement, however continues to have a large support base because of the intellectual appeal of its ideology. It has survived more than a quarter century of onslaught by the security forces - without any external support, unlike the Punjab terrorism and Kashmir militancy. The Movement has developed an inherent strength. The present book is the only one of its kind. It covers all the important developments from the inception of the Movement in 1967 to the present day in historical sweep.",
