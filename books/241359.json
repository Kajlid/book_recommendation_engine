  "title": "My Sweet Captive",
  "description": "There’s nothing remarkable about the woman tied to the chair before me. At least, that’s what I tell myself. I have to keep an emotional distance if I’m going to watch my sadistic brother torture my captive.  There are so many other ways I’d like to break her, none of which involve carving her up. Her pale skin would mark up nicely under my darker forms of discipline.  When my brother decides to spare her and give her to me instead, I know I’m lost to those sky blue eyes. Samantha will be mine.  Note: My Sweet Captive is the beginning of Samantha and Andrés’ dark romance told from Andrés’ point of view. It can be read before Sweet Captivity as a prequel, or after Sweet Captivity as bonus material.My Sweet Captive is no longer available. This content is now included in Andrés' novel, Claiming My Sweet Captive.",
