The only thing missing is his childhood best friend Delaney, and the ability to tell her that he’s loved her ever since she ran into him on the playground nearly twenty years ago.When Delaney shows up on Chance’s door, telling him they need to pretend to be engaged, Chance agrees without thinking. He’d do anything for her. Anything to be her man. But is this the assist they need? Or will it be what ends them?Assist was originally featured on the Read Me Romance podcast.
