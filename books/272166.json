  "description": "– Laren Stover and Paul Himmelein’s “playful anthropology” of bohemianism (Publishers Weekly) has been expanded, 15 years after its first publication, with new descriptions of bohemian life. Bohemian Manifesto serves as an insider’s guide to this vibrant family of status quo-defying subcultures. The first edition, which the New York Times called a “dreamy field guide” and the Baltimore Sun “a self-help book in reverse,” identified five types of Bohemian past and present. To these the authors have added several new types and subtypes and enlarged their discussion of environmentalist threads within bohemian culture. Parisian-born fashion illustrator Izak has also contributed new watercolors.",
