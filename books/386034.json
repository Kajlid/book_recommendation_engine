  "title": "The Eagles: An American Band",
  "description": "“Take It Easy.” “Lyin' Eyes.” “One of These Nights.” “Hotel California.” These songs are among the most memorable ever written, and they all came from one amazing band: the Eagles. This gorgeous volume traces the history of the group from the late 1960s through to the present. Capturing the albums, the tours, the fights, the triumphs, the awards, and the remarkable freezing over of hell (otherwise known as their 1994 reunion tour), The Eagles offers a truly unique look at how the group exported the Southern California lifestyle to every corner of the world.",
