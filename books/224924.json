  "description": "Marina Wyatt, popular novelist and beautiful Countess of Gorham, is irresistible fodder for gossip columns, in which her ribald private life is the stuff of public scandal. Of course, Marina's too sharp and resourceful not to realize that the publicity helps sell her romances. In fact, the release of her latest novel happens to coincide with the rebuff of her current lover, the handsome and frivolous gadabout, Sir Anthony Hedges, opening the door to an unexpected and totally consuming new affair.Anthony's uncle, the noted scholar and antiquarian, Jasper James Hedges, has arrived in London to appraise the art of a wealthy collector. In Marina he sees a priceless work of art of another kind. And for all of Marina's passionate inventions, nothing can compare to what Jasper deliversâ€”an erotic adventure of intrigue and betrayal...a dangerous voyage to the edge of impropriety and beyond.",
