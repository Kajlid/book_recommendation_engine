  "title": "The Inferno Collection",
  "description": "Kim Reynolds, a college reference librarian, suddenly finds herself embroiled in mystery when her friend Lorette dies unexpectedly. The police dismiss Lorette's demise as a suicide because of the drugs found in her blood, but she's been clean a long time. Then there are the literary-based death threats. â€” Kim's own psychic powers are matched by those of police detective Mike Gardner, and together they try to discover the circumstances behind Lorette's death. Interesting characters abound, including Wendell Firbin, Kim's creepy, callous library supervisor, who gets just a little too defensive every time she asks him about the Inferno Collection, the Victorian term for a set of library materials locked away from general use. Since the Inferno Collection is one of the last things Lorette asked Kim about, it just might hold the key to her death.",
