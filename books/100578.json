  "title": "Braving the Brontes",
  "description": "Spunky young Alaskan Carly Keene has never met a book she didn't like. But she's never been in a book before. A chance nap in a magical bookstore sends Carly spiraling back in time. When she wakes up, it's 1846, and a young woman named Charlotte Bronte is trying to compose one of the greatest books ever written... Jane Eyre. With literary history on the line, Carly Keene will battle foggy moors, ghostly apparitions, cholera epidemics, and the horror that is nineteenth-century needlework. It's as much as a spunky 21st-century girl can handle, but if anyone can brave the Brontes, it's Carly Keene.",
