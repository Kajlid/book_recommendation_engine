  "description": "A lot has been written about Bangladesh and the liberation war, but not the whole truth. It was easy for those opposed ‘The grand design’ and Sheik Mujibur Rahman from the very beginning to believe the worst, but it was difficult for those who had faith in him to face.Sheik Mujib was not a simple man, nor was the office he held. Equally our liberation war was also a complex phenomena. Therefore, each issue which has cropped up in this book merits separate analysis.During the independence movement Sheik Mujibur Rahman once was the undisputed leader but in independent Bangladesh he became the most hated dictator. Between these two facts, lies a lost connections.Attempt has been made to relate them to one driving passion of Sheik Mujib that binds them to gather. Politics? Ideology? Fear? Complex? Ego? Ambition? What it is depends on where the reader looks.The book is based on the lives and the factual materials derived from those who were not mere by- stander or silent spectator but active participant in the liberation war and subsequent political flow of events. They are the only one who could speak with authority.Various viewpoints of the respected and noted personalities had been projected to remove the cobwebs that still exist in the minds of some fellow countrymen. The aim of this book is not to impose anything on the readers but to provide some food for thought and some hard facts to seek the truth.",
