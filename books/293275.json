  "description": "The game under the tree looked like a hundred others Peters and Judy had at home...But they were bored, restless and looking for something interesting to do... so they thought they'd give Jumanji a try. Little did they know when they unfolded its ordinary-looking playing board that they were about to be plunged into the most exciting and bizarre adventure of their lives.In his second book for children, Chris Van Allsburg again explores the ever-shifting line between fantasy and reality with this story about a game that comes startlingly to life. His marvelous drawings beautifully convey a mix of the everyday and the extraordinary, as a quiet house is taken over by an exotic jungle.\nChris Van Allsburg\n (1949-) is an American illustrator & author born in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He has won two Caldecott Medals for U.S. picture book illustration, among other awards, for \n'Jumanji' (1981)\n and 'The Polar Express' (1985), both of which he also wrote. These two books were later adapted as successful motion pictures.",
