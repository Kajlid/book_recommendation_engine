  "description": "Does love stand a chance between two men from different worlds, when they’re both being pulled in opposite directions?  Sawyer MacNeil is looking for answers. His time in the Army didn’t go as planned, and he’s still reeling from the end of a relationship that never should have happened in the first place. Now he’s trying to get his life together, while struggling to come to terms with a side of himself he’s always kept hidden.  Sparks fly when Sawyer meets Alastair, an upper-class British graduate student whose future has been mapped out since birth. Alastair can’t promise anything more than a hook-up. He doesn’t have much time left in the States, and a mountain of responsibility and a disapproving family are waiting for him back in the UK. And yet, whatever’s happening between them feels like so much more than a fling.  When tragedy strikes and the two are separated just days after meeting, will Sawyer risk everything to follow his heart?  Worlds Away is the thirteenth novel in Alexa Land's Firsts and Forever Series, but each book is written to stand alone, so jump in anywhere. This gay romance is approximately 98,000 words. Please note: contains adult language and graphic sex and is intended for adults only.",
