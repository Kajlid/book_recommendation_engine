  "description": "\"Are you trying to seduce me, Miss Winter?\" I lowered my voice to a whisper. \"So, what if I am?\" \"Because you're playing with fire, sweet girl. You have no idea how dangerous I am.\" Strong willed, curious, and feisty Winter isn't happy with the news that her father has hired a group of Security Guards to protect her, and he immediately requests her to move back home. This doesn't sit well with the incredibly independent twenty-five-year-old woman. The secrets her family have kept from Winter her entire life begin to unravel, as the threats against her life are imminent. Danger soon follows, in more ways than one, when she starts an intense sexual and emotional relationship with one of her guards who is almost twice her age. ***Warning***This story contains mature scenes that are intended for adults only (Language, Sex and Violence.)
