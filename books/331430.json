  "description": "Deprived beings bonded by the Eternal flame make the trickiest captives. Divided. Disconnected. Yet stronger than ever. I don’t need to see my men to feel them; the hum of their raw power simmering beneath the cuffs clamped around my wrists. Christopher may have us trapped once more, his mocking laughter echoing around the walls of the asylum, but he’s overlooked one simple fact. With my harem, I am fierce. Without them, I’m feral.Dying is no longer an option. Hiding in Hell is a distant memory. A war has been waged upon the Mutes, and it’s not just Christopher in my sights now. It’s the entire human race. Whatever it takes, whatever I have to do, I will be free of these stone walls and the world of poverty beyond. If an uprising is needed to gain the Mutes equal rights, then I’m prepared to fight. For love has found me in the most unlikely of places, and Hell hath no fury like a mutant scorned.Trigger warning: This novel is the third and final in a dark paranormal RH trilogy. Certain themes such as sex, self-harm, death and controversial beliefs are featured. However, those who always fall for the twisted, deranged villain and never question their own sanity about it, then come on in. The Afterlife Asylum is the place for you.",
