  "description": "Everyone knows Sara Cunningham is a good girl. She goes to church every Sunday, volunteers in her community, and works hard. So why is her life suddenly such a mess? When Sara's boyfriend cleans out her savings account and disappears, things are bad enough. But when she realizes he's also left her without a date to her sister's wedding, she's desperate for help.  James Drake has a problem. He's no where near as bad as people think. He loves his family, is loyal to his friends. He's even started going to church with his parents most Sundays. But the media loves to tarnish a hero and as one of the heads of Drake Enterprises, he's a constant target. When scandal threatens his position with his company, he needs to find the right woman to save his reputation. One look at Sara and he thinks he's found his answer.  When Sara and James agree to work together, Sara isn't sure she can do it. What would a good looking billionaire see in a shy, somewhat overweight girl like herself? And while they might be helping each other out, giving the impression they're in love feels an awful lot like a lie. But what if his love isn't a lie? What if it's the truth? Does Sara have the courage to find out? Or will she risk her faith and lose her heart in the process?",
