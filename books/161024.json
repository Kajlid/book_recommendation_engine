  "title": "Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs",
  "description": "From medieval conqueror to Renaissance  autocrat to Victorian Empress to modern melodrama, Royal Panoply  is the story of some of the most fascinating people in world history.With her trademark blend of probing scholarship, lively prose, and psychological insight, Carolly Erickson focuses on each monarch’s entire life---from the puny, socially awkward Charles I, to the choleric, violent William the Conqueror, to the well-meaning, deeply affectionate Queen Anne, who was so heavy she had to be carried to her coronation. Royal Panoply recaptures the event-filled, often dangerous, always engaging lives of England’s kings and queens, set against the backdrop of a thousand years of Britain’s past.",
