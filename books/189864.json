  "title": "Hey Cowboy, Wanna Get Lucky?",
  "description": "The bestselling novel from America’s premier cowboy poet. Cowboys Lick and Cody are on a quest to qualify for the rodeo national finals—and their widely entertaining, often hilarious adventure includes a smattering of sex, violence, intrigue, and the occasional philosophical rumination. These modern-day cowpokes—two chivalrous knights of the rope and range with a hankering for bucking broncos and for the female of the two-legged species—find much more than they bargained for in Oklahoma City. Against the colorful, flamboyant backdrop of the hard-ridin’, hard-playin’ rodeo circuit, they encounter a city woman named Lilac, with whom Cody falls in love; a bull named Kamikaze; and two corrupt Texas billionaires who bet against Lick. In the vein of a latter-day Will Rogers, Baxter Black combines a colorful yarn with occasional bits of his unique cowboy philosophy and poetry. “It could make a dead man sit up and laugh”— The Washington Post Book World",
