The explosion happened when she was twelve.Madeline isn't sure what to believe. The brothers insist her memories must be of a dream life she created while in her coma. But when she returns to the reality she knows, they insist this war-torn world must be the dream. She doesn't know if she's truly caught in the middle of a brewing rebellion or teetering on the brink of insanity.As she finds herself flipping between the two lives, her heart becomes torn between two versions of the same boy and the lines between her realities begin to blur.",
