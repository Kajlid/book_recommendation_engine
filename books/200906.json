  "description": "Where do you think magic really lives? Do you think it lurks in isolated and ancient areas away from our sprawling cities? If so, you'd be wrong. Magic exists, is aware of us, and connects to our world by the last thing you would consider but no doubt own. Join Steve as he finds out the truth to a question he certainly didn't ask to have answered, and as his life undergoes a complete upheaval in New City; an unoriginal name for a more than unique metropolis.",
