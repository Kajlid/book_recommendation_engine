  "description": "Walking in on my best friend mid-hookup isn’t supposed to turn me on, but it’s only sex, right? Finding intimacy is a bit discouraging with a neurological disorder that affects my legs. But Elliot gets it—gets me. He’s my ride or die and always supportive. Always protective too. Not because he thinks I’m incapable, but because he cares.When I invite him to my brother’s wedding, he becomes the ultimate date. And when we decide to blow off a little steam with each other, I’m trusting it won’t ruin our friendship.Except it becomes more than jerking off after late-night study sessions…more than innocent touches, kisses, and sleeping in each other’s arms.Falling for my best friend is scary, but Elliot checks all my boxes, the perfect score that was right in front of me all along.**Perfect Score is a low-angst, best-friends-to-lovers romance and a complete standalone in the Easton U Pirates Universe.Note: This 36K novella was once part of a promotional giveaway.
