  "description": "After trying to figure out how Jade’s power works and what else she’s been hiding, they find a release valve in the KRC left by one of the Jaded. They accidentally set it off, releasing a suspected poison into the center. After everyone evacuates, they notice that Aiden is missing. They find him in the clutches of Jade. Before they disappear, Aiden tries to tell Kaid of the massive attack that’s on the horizon...With help from physicists, psychologists, molecular biologists, MDs, chemists, a retired FBI agent, and a former Special Forces member, this series is as scientifically sound as a science fiction graphic novel can be. Information about the science used can be found in the back of the book.",
