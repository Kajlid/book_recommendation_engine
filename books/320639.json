The first time I saw her was through the lens of my rifle.I was sent all the way from Russia to kill Vera Reznikova, the Bratva princess.She was my exquisite target.But I knew when I saw her beautiful tormented eyes that I’d end up breaking all of my rules for her.All I’ve ever been is a businessman and a killer.And she’s a breath of fresh air. Something wild in this predictable world.Something about her makes me turn my back on the men who sent me and forget about the consequences.Her lush body fits right in my hands. Her soft mouth yields to my touch. Her icy eyes sparkle just for me.I claim her as mine.I vow to protect her at all costs.She doesn’t know who I really am, but it goes both ways.And as I uncover her family’s secrets, I learn that there’s a kernel of truth in every rumor.Even ones about curses.",
