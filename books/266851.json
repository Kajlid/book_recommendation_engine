  "description": "Arun, a budding historical scholar, and his belligerent best friend, Baran, are preparing to graduate from The Academy in The Dawn’s capital of Hilae. As they set off to go on their Graduate Field Task, they are accompanied by the recently disgraced Warden Athaz as their chaperone. What starts as a simple historical excavation quickly becomes more than any bargained for when a massive army of Orcs and Goblins attack their dig site. But unexpected help arrives from the Bewildered, a nomadic people who resist The Dawn and its Emperor, the Son of Bälech. At first unwilling to say anything, eventually the Bewildered explain the plans they have in mind for the three of them – and the world. Surrounded by ancient peoples with knowledge and magic Arun never learned in his history books, he and his friends now find themselves just trying to keep their heads above water as their previous lives are swept in away in a flash. Caught in a struggle they did not ask to be involved in, and beyond their abilities, all of them must try to navigate a new world of wonder and danger while saving the lives of those they love most – as well as their own.",
