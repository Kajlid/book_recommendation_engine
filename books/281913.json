  "title": "Finding God: Moving Through Your Problems in Pursuit of God",
  "description": "In today's psychological culture, we have become a people more concerned with solving our problems than finding God. Suffer low self–esteem? Get counseling. Unfulfilled in life? Join a recovery group. But solving problems is not the point, argues Dr. Larry Crabb. In fact, whenever we place a higher priority on solving our problems than on pursuing God, we are being immoral! Dr. Crabb demonstrates that our deepest problem and worst sin is doubting God. When we doubt God's goodness, when we think that god cannot be trusted with the things that matter most, we will quietly, but with tight–lipped resolve, take over responsibility for our own well-being--with disastrous results. In his most compelling book since Inside Out , Dr. Crabb upsets the cozy Christianity of the modern believer. He reveals anew God's top not our comfort and gratification, but His glory.",
