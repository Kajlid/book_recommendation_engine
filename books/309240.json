  "description": "Find another world for the deep-freeze people. In the year 2080 every crisis of a couple of centuries had come to maturity. It was an election year. Jim Briskin, candidate for President, was trying to solve the unsovlable & appease the unappeasable. There were tens of millions of people in deep-freeze waiting for better times. The pressure was on to wake them up or throw them away. The jiffi-scuttlers which bypassed space to speed travel were breaking down & someone had to find out why fast. The racial problem had reached the point where a colored man now seemed likely to be the next chief executive. Add to that a breakthrough into another sort of space & contact with long-forgotten ancestral race & you have a complex, taut & tremendously exciting sf novel as only Philip K. Dick can write. Winner of both Hugo & John W. Campbell awards for best novel, widely regarded as the premiere sf writer of his day, the object of cult-like adoration from his legions of fans, Philip K. Dick has come to be seen in a literary light that defies classification in much the same way as Borges & Calvino. With breathtaking insight, he utilizes unfamiliar worlds to evoke the hauntingly & hilariously familiar in society & ourselves.",
