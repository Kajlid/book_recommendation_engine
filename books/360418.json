  "title": "The Moonlight Chronicles: A Wandering Artist's Journal",
  "description": "Our favorite freewheelin' scribe Dan Price's inaugural collection of vagabond musings, HOW TO MAKE A JOURNAL OF YOUR LIFE, was such a hit that we could hardly wait to bring out THE MOONLIGHT CHRONICLES. Dan's Moonlight Chronicles zines have long been a cult favorite of art, travel writing, and outdoor enthusiasts. This full-color book version picks up where the zines left off, following Dan as he ambles through the cafes, alleyways, and skyscrapers of New York City; hits the trail for a five-day hike in Hell's Canyon; and wanders through the Sierras, in the footsteps of kindred soul John Muir. Dan's spirited language and charming pictures remind you of the small joys of life and the fact that happiness abounds, just waiting to be discovered along the highways and byways of America.",
