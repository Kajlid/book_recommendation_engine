Every year Alexander and his mother walk the long distance to Noel to watch the lighting of the village Christmas tree. This year Alexander learns that the Keeper of the Flame will choose the person who has given the truest gift of Christmas to light the flame. On his way to Noel, Alexander helps a poor old man he finds lying in the snow. His act of charity is rewarded when he is chosen to light the Christmas flame. Alexander learns that it isn't what you have to give, but how you give of yourself that matters most.  Master storyteller Richard Paul Evans weaves a heartwarming tale of the true meaning of Christmas spirit.",
