  "description": "Are you out there? If these words mean something to you, I've succeeded in reaching at least a single mind, and that's already more than I had any right to hope for. You might be the first one, even the only one, but that doesn’t matter. A miracle only has to happen once for it to be a miracle. You might already have some idea of what I'm about to tell you. I'm sure you've had the conversation at some time or other, most likely in a bar, the air hazy with alcohol and unrealised hopes and your own intoxication. Maybe it was getting close to that time of the night when conversation becomes unashamedly introspective, and in the dimness, one of your friends said something like, “Have you ever thought that maybe you might be the only conscious one? I mean, how would you ever know?” Let me put this another way. I’m sure there must have been times in your life when you've been surrounded by people and yet found yourself feeling terrifyingly, senselessly lonely. Probably you thought there must be something wrong with you for feeling that way – but the truth is, you were right all along. You felt alone because you truly were alone.",
