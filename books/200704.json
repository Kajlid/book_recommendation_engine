From the historic tales of King Arthur comes a raw, riveting and passionate series of novels by author L.A. Wilson, who breathes fresh new life into this spell-binding story. Told in first-person by Bedwyr...the person closest to Arthur's heart...this story is an amazing journey into the past, where social order was kept by the sword, loyalty and the desire to be free. Free to survive, free to live, and free to love without restraint. Through Wilson's powerful story-telling...a whole dramatic world of love, hatred, war, betrayal and loss is created and viewed through the exotic and passionate eyes of â€˜The Fox.' From the first book 'The Silurian: The Fox and the Bear,\" to the tenth installment, \"Last Man to Avalon,\" this work is destined to become a literary classic, defining a new age of reading and establishing a new genre.",
