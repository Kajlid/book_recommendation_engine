  "title": "Letters from the Earth",
  "description": "This is the COMPLETE EDITION of the original Letters From the Earth!  Mark Twain considered this story was too controversial for publication and would never be published. He wrote that observation to a friend in 1909. This gem of a story has been freed from the murky shadows of censorship and restored to it's rightful place in American literature. All of it is vintage Twain, sharp, witty, imaginative, and sometimes wildly funny. This edition includes Mark Twain's 3 footnotes  If you purchased this book prior to March 8th 2009 please re-download to your Kindle to get the this COMPLETE EDITION.",
