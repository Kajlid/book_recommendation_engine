But not anywhere near Chase McCormick when he's on duty.Too bad nobody mentioned that to gorgeous Elena de la Vega. She's been sent to Chase's remote outpost in northern Afghanistan.\"After\" they'd shared a sizzling one-night stand!Elena can handle herself. It's Chase who needs a directive on how to deal with his own wildly undisciplined sexual attraction to the woman! Because her presence is making short work of his hardened soldier training...and putting more than their hearts at risk.",
