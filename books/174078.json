  "title": "The Story: Part 1",
  "description": "A story best summed up with the word “Suddenly”, The Story is a narrative co-written by five young American authors in an attempt to emulate the British sense of humor. In it, you will encounter a meek minnow, a purple porpoise, a celestial voice, a friendly wood chuck, a group of well-mannered cannibals, as well as one long flow of preposterous events that can only be explained by a Crystal of Broken Physics. Follow the adventures of Robin, Simon, Felix Dragonhammer, Roger the Shrubber, and eventually Bradford the Parrotless in their distracted, occasionally successful efforts to vanquish evil they encounter as they traverse the Universe.",
