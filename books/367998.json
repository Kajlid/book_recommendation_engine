  "description": "Ben knew there would never be a mate for him. No one in his or her right mind would want to be shackled with a man with no tenderness, no gentleness, and certainly no kindness. He didn't even know what those emotions were anymore. They were stripped from him, along with a good portion of his sanity. Ben has nothing to offer a mate, and he knows it. When huge sky blue eyes peek out at him from under strawberry blond hair at a Wolf Mating party, Ben can't deny his fascination, or his need to claim Stefan as his mate. But Stefan comes with a lot of baggage. According to vampire law, he's been given away by his brother to Dane, the brother of Stefan's best friend, Audley. In exchange, Audley has been given to Stefan's brother. The problem? Audley and Stefan are both Ben's mates. When Stefan and Audley are kidnapped, Ben and their friends race to save them. Can Ben survive long enough to save his mates, or will his worst nightmare come true? Can Stefan and Audley overcome their fears long enough to save their mate, or will they lose him forever?",
