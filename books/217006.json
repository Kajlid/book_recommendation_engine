  "title": "Imperial Plato: Albinus, Maximus, Apuleius: Text and Translation, with an Introduction and Commentary",
  "description": "Imperial Plato  presents new translations of three introductions to Plato’s thought from the second half of the second century  the  Introduction to Plato  by Albinus of Smyrna,  Dissertation  11 of Maximus of Tyre, and  On Plato and his Teaching  by Apuleius of Madaurus. These three presentations of Plato’s ideas—one a Greek dialectic introduction with a suggested reading order for Plato's dialogues, another a Greek speech in the sophistic style of the time, and one a lengthy doxological study in Latin—are examples by three distinct authors using divergent methods of the assorted ways in which Plato and Platonism were understood and discussed during the revival of Hellenism and Greek Philosophy, and the period of the Roman Empire often referred to as the Second Sophistic.",
