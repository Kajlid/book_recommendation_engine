  "description": "“Unusual, fascinating examination of human intersection and the myriad, imperceptible ways we relate to one another.” —  Kirkus Reviews  (starred review)When Natalie was eleven, her mother walked out mid-sentence and never came back. Now Natalie is almost sixteen and struggling with a toxic relationship, so she sets out on a bus trip to find her mother and figure out love. To her surprise, she meets people with stories like her own, stories about giving love and getting lost in the desire to be wanted. Acclaimed middle-grade novelist Nora Raleigh Baskin makes her young adult debut with a deeply resonant novel about secrets held and secrets shared, about having the courage to uncover all we know — and don’t know — of love.",
