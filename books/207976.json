  "description": "Listening Length: 54 minutes.Audio DownloadCialdini provides fascinating insight into how people avoid the work of making decisions and why they comply with requests in business settings. He has identified six principles which are so powerful that they generate desirable change in the widest range of circumstances: reciprocation, social validation, commitment/consistency, friendship/liking, scarcity, and authority. He emphasizes the non-manipulative use of these principles so that those who are influenced feel personally committed to the change and to their relationship with the change agent. This results in an effective, ethical and enduring partnership.",
