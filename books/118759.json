  "description": "Vivian Hale doesn’t cope. She runs.Spending the summer in small town Pennsylvania, working for minimum wage in the old trailer-turned-video-store, Vivian longs to move on after her world came crashing down around her. She’s given up on her acting dream and is willing to do whatever it takes to make enough money to get a place of her own and start over- anything, of course, but sacrifice her pride.Oscar winning, LA director Keaton Thorne is back home for the first time in seven years, determined to survive one weekend with his family. As best man in his little brother’s wedding, he has one job- show up with his gorgeous wife and prove to everyone in the small town that he’s better than his father had ever been. When Keaton makes her a clichéd offer that she just can’t refuse, Vivian tries to protect her heart. She knows the difference between right and wrong. Between moral and immoral…Between acting… and reality. One weekend. One man.One yes.",
