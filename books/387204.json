But with the homeowner desperate to keep Mitzy away from his property and Alonzo, the dangerously hot rival investor trying to snatch it out from under her, Mitzy knows she has to work fast, or the economy won’t be the only thing dead… If you love quirky mysteries with humor and sass, you'll love Hilton's Mitzy Neuhaus!",
