  "description": "Anna Marshall wishes she could be anywhere byt Ames, Iowa, and anything but a singer and music instructor at Iowa State University. She makes her wish at exactly the wrong time, though, because on Erde a travel sorceress has called for a powerful sorceress - and gets Anna, angry, confused, and thinking that this is not what she had in mind.On Erde, Anna is no longer just a professional singer, she is a sorceress, potentially the strongest on the whole world. On Erde, song is magic, and a wrong note can mean death to a sorcerer. Because Anna has trained a lifetime to reach the level where she won't miss a note under the worst conditions, she can sing more powerfully and precisely than anyone else on Erde.But Anna's power does not go unnoticed. The moment she arrives she becomes a target: both the political entities, who fear the unknown power she represents, and the sexist men of Erde, will try to kill her. Merely to survive, Anna must learn enough magic to use her musical skills and enough about Erde to protect herself and, maybe, just maybe, create a new life for herself.",
