  "description": "The author of Ghostland continues her tale of a postapocalyptic world where supernatural beings have emerged from hiding. Held prisoner by humans, his angelic memory and power lost because of the sigil-inscribed collar around his neck, Tir dreams of freedom and hungers for vengeance. He's sworn he'll never lie with a mortal, but when Ara√±a removes his shackles and helps him escape his captivity, she melts his icy control and leaves him burning with desire. She's a temptation he can't resist-an unknowing enemy who might well enslave him more thoroughly than the chains he's worn for centuries. Powerful forces have brought them together to serve a greater purpose, but learning the truth of what they are will destroy them-unless their love is strong enough to overcome the dark legacy of a battle that began with the birth of mankind.",
