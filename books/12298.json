  "title": "Carter's Tryck",
  "description": "Tryck Santiago is a wolf shifter who loves riding his motorcycle, hanging with his brothers, and giving Alpha Maverick Brac a hard time. His motto has always been \"if you can't fix it, burn it down.\" But what will happen when his toughness can't fix his mate's problems? And what's with all the tears? Carter Santharian is a tall, slim Wood Elf. He's also graceful and quick-witted, so what was fate thinking when mating him to Biker Bob? The man's choice of clothes was blue or black, and the yellow bandana on his head reminds Carter only that two opposites may not attract. Carter has to fight to make his own way in a world of shifters, and he now finds himself in love with a mate who refuses to show any affection in public. Can he get Tryck to show his more tender side, or will Carter tire of the struggle and shimmer away?  Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
