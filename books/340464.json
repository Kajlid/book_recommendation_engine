  "description": "Noah's watched the dragons for a long, long time now, and he's not sure what he thinks about them. Are they monsters getting ready to plunder the Earth? Are they planning to help? Are they curious? He doesn't ever think he'll get a chance to find out……but he's wrong.When one of Noah's fellow soldiers trades him to the dragons, Noah finds himself in the care and keeping of Zacharei, a dragon who's most definitely only interested in finding out as much as he can about humans.Specifically, Zacharei wants to know what sex between humans is all about. It'll be a lesson neither of them ever forgets.",
