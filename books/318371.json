  "description": "At thirty-five and single, I’m tired of the dating game. Tired of men who look at me and say, “You’d be prettier if you shed a few pounds.”There’s only one man I want a future with — my grouchy friends with benefits, Nolan. But he’s adamant about keeping things casual.All that changes when one night we get careless, and those pink lines show up on the pregnancy test months later.Nolan wants to do right by me. He wants to give me what I’ve been searching for, but I’m pretty sure he’s only doing it out of obligation. It’s not like the bearded brewmaster loves me like I love him.Accidentally in Love is a small-town accidental pregnant holiday romance featuring a burly bearded brewmaster and an hopeless romantic high school english teacher.",
