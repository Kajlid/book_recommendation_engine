  "description": "Michael Evans had grown up in a Christian home with God-fearing parents and grandparents who were constantly preaching at him, but he would have none of it. He was smarter than that. He was the only one in his family that had gone past the twelfth grade. He had finished high school and gone to the state university and was certain that he understood the world. He couldn't see how anyone could believe in a loving God with all the violence, hatred, disease, cruelty, and crime in the world. He believed in facing reality, but several things were about to rock his world and challenge his beliefs and his understanding of the world.",
