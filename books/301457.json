  "description": "She’s gone… good riddance to tormenting, cold nightmares that come in the form of sweet but devious kisses.⠀Thing is, without her here, there’s a fiery riot in my heart I can't control.⠀She left a bloody feud brewing in my house.⠀That Little Minx caused chaos and hell to break loose between my brother and me as only she can.⠀She kissed me and imprinted her broken soul to my darkness.⠀Now, I want her back with a kind of obsessive desperation that will drive us both to hell.⠀Hate or not, she’s still going to kiss me with everything she is, because she knows who she belongs to.⠀I’m going to own every inch of her pathetic, cold, dark, shallow, and meaningless soul that mirrors mine.⠀Is that cruel of me? I don't give a damn.⠀She’s the architect of this ruinous chapter we just entered, because what’s coming is more than devious.⠀We’re going to lose more than the cruel kisses we bargained for…⠀",
