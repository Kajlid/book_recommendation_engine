  "description": "“Where the gypsies go, there the witches go we know” , the Roma say. In Angelica’s case, she never wanted the distinction of being a shuvani-witch , but…then so goes the ways of the Fates.In 1914, nine-year-old Angelica is living a life vibrant with adventure and song, roaming the European countryside with her family in a small caravan of vardos adorned to dazzle any eyes not used to Roma opulence. Angelica is the premier daredevil of the klan , a hard-won title among the hordes of half-wild children. She knows exactly how her life should feel by jumping into raging gorges from heart-stopping heights – more than anything she knows she loves to fly.One day her Grandmother Lena interrupts one of Angelica’s favorite games with her spirit mirror to illuminate the crescent moon birthmark that portends Angelica’s destiny to become her successor as shuvani-witch . Angelica could not disagree more – neither the Tarot nor the lessons address why the Roma are so despised. More than ever, since ‘The Great War’ started, whenever the caravan stops to camp in a meadow, they are ordered out by gadje peasants backed up by police with guns. After each hasty retreat, the klan cheerfully resumes their foraging, to remind themselves of nature’s true intent – everything exists for the pleasure and delight of the whole of humankind.But for Angelica, the gadje’s hatred for the Roma terrifies her. And why, why do the Roma never stand up and fight? To Angelica, Grandmother Lena’s explanation that shuvanis must leave hatred to those who are not strong enough to love is just utter nonsense and another reason not to trust her destiny.",
