In love, blindly seeking sight, enticed by the challenge of each other, Sara and Andre travel from the hills of San Francisco, under the dream cliffs inside themselves, across an ever-evolving Europe, to a radioactive ledge in the Southwest, to leave us guessing at their fate, knowingly...a smart romance, seductively funny, politically intriguing.",
