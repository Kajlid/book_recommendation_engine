  "title": "What Matters: Lessons Learned from Life",
  "description": "What Matters is a book about the lessons learned from life, and experiences we all share. But it s more than just a book. It represents the connectedness that we seek. It reflects our desire to share parts of our lives with those we love. What Matters allows us to look within ourselves in quiet, self-reflection... inspiring us to be the best we can. To evolve, to share, to learn, to love, and to parent are all ingredients in What Matters. What Matters starts the conversation between parents and kids, grandparents and grandkids, and everyone in between. The experiences reflected in the book touch on many topics and stages of personal growth. They are a personal journey about situations, behavior, and decisions that really mattered along the way. These experiences are written as a series of quotes with each quote illustrated with a child s work of art. What better way to underscore the lessons we learn from life, than with artwork from one of our greatest teachers; namely children. It s their innocent, unexpected, and wide-eyed visions of all things possible that add to What Matters.",
