  "title": "More Than a Kiss",
  "description": "One minute Jordan March was falling out a window and the next she was falling in love - with the emergency room doctor! It looked as if nothing could stand in the way of Jordan and Dr. Amy Stewart finding true love together... except a banana peel, a psycho stalker, a lesbian poetess, an extreme chef, a KGB spy, and a sex toy inventor. Join Saxon Bennett and Layce Gardner as they combine their creative *genius to bring you the romantic comedy of the century. ** Guaranteed money back if you don't laugh out loud. * Geniuses in their own mind. ** This is a lie. The authors are broke.",
