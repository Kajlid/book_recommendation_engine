  "description": "Cynthia Lewis was living a predictable life in suburbia. Big house, daughter in college, son in his last year of high school, career as a nurse at the local hospital, and a successful husband. Life was good. She and her husband Philip were so close ... she knew him so well ... or did she? After many years of marriage, Cynthia is encountering a doubt all women may have considered unthinkable. Unexpectedly, she is forced down a path to confront that doubt and more, as a secret is exposed and her world unravels in a way she never imagined. This was not the life she dreamed of or planned. Cynthiaâ€™s new life evolves into a mundane safe existence until the good intention of her best friend Purvell stirs things up. In a panic, she runs away to the only place she could go, a destination removed from interference, where she searches for the answers to move on.",
