  "description": "To the god of old thingsTo the gods of the riverbankTo the god of huntersAssyria, 7th century BC. For Aurya and her daydreaming brother, every day is a struggle till their fates become inextricably bound to that of King Ashurbanipal, and they find themselves bound for the beautiful, near-mythical city of Nineveh.Twenty-six centuries later, British-Iraqi archaeologist Katya joins a dig in Mosul to protect the ancient ruins of Nineveh from organised looters. When a rare carving is discovered, they know their find will attract the world's attention. But everything changes when ISIL lays siege on Mosul.All Our Broken Idols is hauntingly evocative, a novel in which past and present lives intertwine and stories travel across the ages. It is a story about the importance of art and the threat it poses to those in power, and a story about what we are willing to do for the ones we love.",
