  "description": "Kingdom's Edge is an action/adventure allegory of the life of Christ where swords, knights and battles are biblically symbolic. It is told by Cedric, a young peasant who is doomed to a life of hopelessness and despair, until he meets the \"stranger.\" The stranger takes Cedric under his tutelage and trains him in the art of the sword, for this man is a true \"Master of the Sword.\" When Cedric learns that hope and compassion are as great a weapon as the sword, he is propelled into a desperate battle against evil. Cedric must rely on the Masters training if he is going to survive his new life of non-stop, action-filled adventure. But the ultimate battle is yet to come. The Dark Knight is quickly implementing his plan to take over the kingdom. Will Cedric and his fellow brothers-in-arms be ready? Kingdom's Edge is the first book of a future Kingdom Series trilogy.",
