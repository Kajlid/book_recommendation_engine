  "description": "Undercover agent Gideon Yarbro is renowned for stopping outlaws almost before they commit a crime. But now he must stop a wedding --- despite the bride's resistance. Lydia Fairmont will lose everything if she doesn't honor her betrothal to a heartless banker. Unless she marries someone else instead ... whether it's a love match or not.Determined to honor his own decade-old promise to help Lydia, Gideon carries her off to Stone Creek and makes her his reluctant wife. Forget a honeymoon for \"show\" --- not with a vengeful ex-fiance on their trail and a hired gun on the loose. But there just might be hope for the marriage ... and two hearts meant for each other.",
