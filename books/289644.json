  "description": "Singular tastes. That's what the Wilders are known for. I’m no exception. The world sees me as nothing more than a hedonistic pretty boy. But not everything is as it appears. One thing is certain. I'm a man who knows no boundaries. With no soul and no conscience, I'm free to take what I want. Including a deadly covert agent with a sassy mouth and an angelic smile. She doesn't know it yet, but when Delilah shed her web of lies, she waltzed right into mine. Now I’m free to enjoy her as I please.",
