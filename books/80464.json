  "description": "Susan Voight needs a vacation. A workaholic lawyer from Baltimore whose career just took a step in the right direction, Susan discovers there is an entire online world devoted to her favorite diversion: lesbian romance novels, otherwise known as lesfic. Throwing caution to the wind, she buys a ticket to the annual lesfic conference in Orlando. All she wants is to eat, drink and sleep books. But somewhere in the back of her mind she has a tiny hope that she just might meet someone.Nic Green has been writing lesfic romances for a decade. She has used writing to combat her (mostly invented) neuroses and avoid real life. She decides it is high time she met some of her readers. But at her first lesfic conference, she might not be as ready for the life of the public author as she thinks she is. But then she meets Susanâ€¦In Midnight In Orlando, a 35,000 word novella, Amy Dawson Robertson, known for The Rennie Vogel Intrigue series, offers up a summery confection to warm the heartstrings.If you have the time and inclination, please review the book at Amazon or Goodreads. Nothing is more helpful to the writer than hearing the opinions of veteran readers.",
