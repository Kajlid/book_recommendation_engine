  "description": "Rohl shows that a readjustment of Egyptian chronology puts the findings of archaeology in a new light and leads directly to the living world of biblical narratives. Pharaohs and Kings unveils the historical reality of such biblical personalities as Moses, David, and Solomon, and such archaeological wonders as the desecrated statue of Joseph in his coat of many colors. Basis of a series on The Learning Channel in January 1996. Photos.",
