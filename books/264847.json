  "description": "An original take on the classic fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood, this account follows the adventures of Lucy Jones and the wolf. When Lucy in her red anorak meets the wolf in the forest, she has a hard time convincing him that she is not Red Riding Hood. The hilarious story that follows turns stereotypes on their heads. This modernized classic helps to educate children by introducing such wide-ranging topics as war, friendship, community, and the ethics of zoos.",
