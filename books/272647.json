  "description": "Wallowing in grief for too long can be hazardous. It’s why I allowed my brother to talk me into accepting a new client.Our security firm needed the money, and the endorsement from a famous director could steer our company to new heights.Then his daughter walked in, the woman I’d be assigned to, and I knew I’d made a huge mistake.
