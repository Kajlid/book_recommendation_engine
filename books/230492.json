  "description": "I have made my decision. I’m having an abortion. Every child is a blessing. Every baby is a gift. But sometimes, it doesn’t seem like it at all. Ally Storm didn’t know it would end this way. His whirlwind romance with his millionaire boyfriend has just ended, and she is left with a broken heart and an unexpected little one growing in her young body. Everyone warned her, and she should have read the signs. Now she’s on the run, feeling betrayed and utterly lost. Alexander Cross, sexy, confident, and impeccable, has it a name worth billions, a business empire, and a string of women to warm his bed. But there is one thing he wishes he a normal upbringing. Let down by his own blood at a young age, he had learned never to trust others—especially women. He thought Ally was different, but she turned to be just the same, just like the others before her. But things are never what they seem, and when the hard truth starts cropping out, Xander is left wondering what he just let walk out his front door. Will Ally go through her decision? Will Xander finally realise what he has before he completely loses everything? Profound, touching, and deep, His Mistress’ Baby is a billionaire romance read that will show you that great things can come out of the big bumps that come your way.",
