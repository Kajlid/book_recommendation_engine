  "description": "Winner of the Australian Sony Young Movellist of the Year Award!Jen's just finished year twelve and she's dreading what's coming next. She needs to escape her mum's too-high expectations for a while – and decide whether her boyfriend, Dylan, is someone she needs in her life. There's only one solution. Road trip! Jen, her best friend Elliot, the ladies' man (in his dreams) Theodore C. Block and the lovely Sophie pile into Elliot's beat-up old car, Vincent, and head up the coast to reunite Elliot with his girlfriend. If Jen can't be happy, at least Elliot should have a chance. But things don't quite go to plan. Snarky and irreverent, Coasting will make you laugh and bring tears to your eyes as Jen tries to work out who she really is – and what's important to her.‘Witty, clever and heartfelt . . . I really enjoyed this book and its distinctive voice. It speaks directly to the experiences of young Australians.' Skye Melki-Wegner, author of the Chasing The Valley trilogy and Australian Sony Young Movellist of the Year Judge",
