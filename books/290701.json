  "description": "She'll do anything to save her sister. Even if it means submitting to a Raknari Storm Lord.   When Imara's village is plunged into endless winter, her father invokes the old ways, pacting with the Storm Lord of the Frozen Peak--a fearsome brute of a man who's as cold as he is savage. But the Storm Lord demands more than tribute for his powers. He wants flesh--the tender, untouched flesh of a human woman to fulfill his every desire.  To spare her sister such a fate, Imara goads him into taking her instead. At first, he's everything she expected. Fierce, possessive, and impossible to resist. But the more she learns about Rheor and his people, the more the frigid mask he wears begins to crack, revealing the proud but wounded warrior beneath.  What Rheor needs isn't a subservient woman to warm his bed, though. He needs a mate--one who can share in his powers.  Being able to control the winds of winter isn't what Imara signed up for, but Rheor's power is slowly killing him. And the more he uses it to protect her and his people, the weaker he gets. As enemies close in, drawn to the bond they share, can Imara and Rheor overcome their own obstacles and complete the Rite of the Raknari in time?",
