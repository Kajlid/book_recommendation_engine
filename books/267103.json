  "title": "My Cuckold Hubby: Training Period",
  "description": "A rich tale of, lust, chastity, cuckold slavery, and acceptance.  Alan has a fantasy of being a cuckold husband to his wife. He revels in the degradation and humiliation found in his online websites and is jealous of the men who are lucky enough to live this lifestyle. He doesn’t have the balls to tell his wife that it’s what he truly wants, mostly because he isn’t sure it’s more than just a dream.  Traci dreams of being with other men, more sexually satisfying men than her husband can ever be. She remains with her husband, dreaming of a real orgasm that is not derived from just oral sex, but from a big, hard dick instead.  Both Traci and Alan never speak of their desires for the first six years of their marriage, afraid of what the other might think. But their marriage has grown stale. Alan thinks he is to blame–he can’t satisfy his wife in bed. He finds his relief in cuckold fantasies online while his wife sleeps. She finds hers in the arms of her affairs, but hates the dishonestly required in going behind her husband’s back.  One fateful night, when Traci finds Alan’s stash of fetish porn in the history on their computer, she begins a process that will change both of their lives forever; or so she hopes. Traci isn’t content to let her or Alan’s fantasy remain just that and begins to train her husband to be her “cuckold hubby”.  WARNING: This book contains explicit sexual content including: femdom, oral sex, anal sex, cuckold, BDSM, ass worship and rimming, cunnilingus, orgasm control and male chastity, domination, submission, spanking, domestic discipline, humiliation, and more.",
