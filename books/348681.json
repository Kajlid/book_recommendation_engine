  "description": "Meister Eckhart’s complete mystical teachings together in one volume, for the first time! With a foreword by leading Eckhart scholar Bernard McGinn, and the elegant translation of Maurice O'C Walshe, this comprehensive and authoritative work is a treasure for every serious spiritual seeker, and the finest volume on Eckhart ever to appear in English.In contrast to the Latin works that convey his thought in precise and analytic detail, Eckhart's German works ponder the relationship with the divine intuitively. The sermons spoken in vernacular and transcribed and translated here, express the personal, mystical aspects of Eckart's beliefs. The treatises and other works elaborate on the same themes and are drawn from both his spoken and written work.This treasury is the authoritative volume of Eckhart’s enduring legacy to Christianity.Reviews and endorsements\"Meister Eckhart is an encouragement to believers and unbelievers alike.\"—Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, London",
