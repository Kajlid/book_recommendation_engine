  "description": "We want someone we can call our own, someone that will be our Brat.Sharing is caring they say, or at least that’s what the Wright Twins say. Three's never a crowd when it comes to these brothers and when Stephanie Sander’s answers their AD on a dating website, they know they’ve hit the jackpot.Twin Alpha’s set on making every girl's fantasy my reality. Selling my virginity was never an option until it became the only thing I had left. In order to stay in school, I needed to come up with money, and a lot of it. One date with the Wright twins and I would be set for awhile, until I met them, and let them bring me back to their mansion for some drinks.One drink led to another and before I realized it they had me in their bed, whispering dirty words in my ear. They wanted to own me and make me theirs and the worst part was I wanted to let them. I wanted to be their spoiled Brat, who did all the dirty things they desired.There was only one pesky little problem, one thing that I failed to tell either of I was a virgin, and I wasn’t sure that either of them would still want me once they found out.-This is a STEAMY, I mean HOT, HOT, HOT M/F/M romance that ends in a HEA. This is SMUT all the way through. Pour yourself a drink, and shuck the panties to the floor because it's time to get dirty with the Wright brothers.-",
