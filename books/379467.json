When Ike LaRue is \"imprisoned\" at the Igor Brotweiler Canine Academy, he tries everything to get sent home -- from weepy letters to his owner to illness. In reality, Brotweiler is more like camp than prison, but still, Ike's not cut out for life without Mrs. LaRue. Finally, he runs away only to find himself back in Snort City -- just in time to save Mrs. LaRue's life. A classic picture book written and illustrated by How Do Dinosaurs...? artist Mark Teague.",
