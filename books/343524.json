  "description": "Opening with Professor Tomlinson's superbly clear and helpful introduction this selection reflects the most up-to-date Williams scholarship. In addition to including many more pieces, Tomlinson has organized the whole in chronological order.It isn't what he [the poet] says that counts as a work of art,\" Williams maintained, \"it's what he makes, with such intensity of purpose that it lives with an intrinsic movement of its own to verify its authenticity.",
