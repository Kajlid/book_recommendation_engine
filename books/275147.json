  "description": "A “beautifully written and deeply affecting” novel (USA Today) about a Vietnam veteran—from the National Book Award-winning author of Europe CentralFrom the acclaimed author of Europe Central comes this fever dream of a novel about a Vietnam veteran, Jimmy, who struggles with alcoholism and devotes his government check and his waking hours to the search for a beautiful and majestic sex worker, Gloria—a woman who may or may not exist save in Jimmy's rambling dreams. Gloria's image seems distilled from memory and fantasy and the fragments of whatever Jimmy can buy from the other sex workers: their sex, their stories—all the unavailing dreams of love and salvation among the drinkers and addicts who haunt San Francisco's Tenderloin District.",
