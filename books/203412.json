She has more than one form––human girl and magical cat––and once inhabited two worlds. And it is her destiny to return to a mystic realm of wonder and terror, to do battle for her people's liberation and the crown that is rightfully hers.A man beset by tragedy, painter Braden West is intrigued by the calico cat who has charmed her way into his studio.
