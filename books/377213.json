  "description": "When Willa Ree emerges from the boxcar, he is broke and ready for a fresh start. And Breton looks to be a town full of fresh suckers. Ben Halliday is not one of those suckers, or so he thinks. One of the town leaders, he needs a new cop with adjustable morals. Ree is the perfect fit. Unfortunately, Ree is even less subtle than Halliday had hoped. Because Ree has plans of his own. Now that he’s a cop, he intends to steal every dollar he can lay his hands on, and seduce any woman he wants. This Texas oil town is ripe for the picking on all accounts. It’s Willa Ree’s town now, and nothing that Halliday—or anyone—can do will stop him.",
