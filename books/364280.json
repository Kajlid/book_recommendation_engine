But the truth is that Connie is overwhelmingly sane, heroically sane, and tuned into the future.Connie is able to communicate with the year 2137. Two totally different ways of life are competing. One is beautiful—communal, nonsexist, environmentally pure, open to ritual and magic. The other is a horror—totalitarian, exploitative, rigidly technological.In Connie's struggle to keep the institution's doctors from forcing her into a brain control operation, we find the timeless struggle between beauty and terror, between good and evil…with an astonishing outcome.",
