  "description": "A werewolf pack is only as strong as its weakest link and ours … ours is a traitor. The only people I can trust now are my mates, the seven alpha males I call my own.  Allies and enemies wear the same skins: witches, demons, faeries, vampires … werewolves. It's impossible to tell what's hiding beneath the carefully crafted facades, the sinful slashes of smiling lips.  Magic died in our people long ago; today, it blinks sleepy eyes and wakes up. Ancient gods raise their heads, spirits once thought to be whispers of myth, urge us to fight. They give us the power to defend ourselves from those who would take our magic as their own.  This war we're fighting, it started with a seed of hate centuries ago. Now, it's here, and the fates are unwavering in their predictions—the White Wolf heralds the start of a new era for my people … or the violent thrash of their downfall. My men and I, we'll defend ourselves with love and magic … or die trying.  ***PACK OBSIDIAN GOLD is a 400+ page full-length reverse harem/menage, urban fantasy/paranormal romance novel for mature teens and adults 18+ with a happily ever after waiting at the end of the series.
