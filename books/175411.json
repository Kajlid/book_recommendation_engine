The Legacy of the Fourth King is a legacy of hope, dedication, faith, and forgiveness. While there is no historical basis for a real fourth wise man, this story supplements and enhances the pain of Christ's human death; and the power of the Resurrection. who came late and missed out on the Nativity, only to give his gifts on Good Friday.",
