  "title": "Joey Green's Magic Health Remedies: 1,363 Quick-and-Easy Cures Using Brand-Name Products",
  "description": "Home remedies remain an appealing alternative to costly doctor visits—they're effective, inexpensive, and ideal for everyday illnesses and injuries that don't require hands-on medical care.When brand-name product guru Joey Green tackles a subject like home remedies, readers can be found reaching into their closets, cupboards, and pantries for their favorite products to cure what ails them. From relieving a migraine with Dole© Pineapple Chunks, treating stinky feet with Clearasil®, and soothing an insect bite with Colgate® Toothpaste, Joey Green's Magic Health Remedies is packed with reliable, user-friendly cures for everything from acne and calluses to morning sickness and toothaches—121 conditions in all. Joey divulges that many products have special, never-before-revealed qualities not found on the label and, with a little ingenuity, can be used to treat minor health issues and conditions.There's compelling evidence for experimenting with off-label uses—like when hay fever strikes, a little McCormick® Ground Turmeric in a glass of water brings relief in 15 minutes; the bioflavonoids in the spice are antioxidants that suppress histamine production. Who knew? Well, Joey knows and now he's bringing fast relief (and lots of fun) to health care at home!",
