To keep from being separated by state authorities, Kerra flees to the only relative she remembers from her childhood -- an LDS aunt and uncle who live near a wondrous place in the woods where parallel realities collide and where an ancient people called Nephites cross paths with the residents of a sleepy Utah town. Join Chris Heimerdinger, best-selling author of the Tennis Shoes Adventure series, and embark on an adventure of breathtaking suspense and experience a love story that transcends time and space.",
