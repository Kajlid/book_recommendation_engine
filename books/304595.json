  "description": "In my defense, he was wet—and shirtless—and had this really cute birthmark that looked like someone had kissed his ridiculously-defined hip bone. I got sidetracked, okay? It was an accident. Especially when I kissed him so hard my wig shifted sideways, and he realized I was someone else—someone like his enemy. Awkward, right? So imagine my surprise when Sebastian shows up at my door months later with clenched fists, demanding I pretend to be his girlfriend so he can win a million dollars. He’s delicious and all, but I trust him about as much as I trust that super-hot dimple he flashes around campus. But then he goes and says the magic words: we’ll split the money fifty-fifty. So here I am nestled in Sebastian’s arms while two million viewers watch as he leans in, his heart racing under my palm and whispers, “This changes nothing. We’re still at war.” _ Subscriber Wars is a standalone romantic comedy about two internet rivals with a meet-prank and the worst habit of turning fake kisses into real ones.",
