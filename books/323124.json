  "description": "She was the means to an end, a debt to be repaid. She was never meant to tempt me…Melody Sterling’s the daughter of a dead socialite and a power hungry business man turned mob boss. And not a very good one. If he was he wouldn’t have owed me in the first place, would he?Using her was supposed to be simple.She was a beautiful face to wear on my arm and make me look more normal, human even. Someone to dazzle and distract the unsuspecting, while I hunt for the mole in our organization before all of the carefully laid plans are blown to smithereens. If I fail then I won’t be the only one facing a firing squad. Melody will too, and that’s something I can’t allow.My hands are stained with enough blood that I have no right to touch someone like her. Yet I can’t seem to stay away. With eyes the color of the ocean and curves like seaside waves I can’t decide if she’s going to save me or watch me drown as the enemy closes in.If you love the suspense of L.J. Shen and the steam of Sophie Lark, then you'll love Sinners' Secrets",
