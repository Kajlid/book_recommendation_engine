  "title": "Eleanor McGraw, a Pony Named Mouse and a Boy Called Fire",
  "description": "Eleanor McGraw, vertically challenged, empathic and sharp daughter of folk musician Isabel Payne and a world famous rock guitarist, wakes up a few days shy of her 14th birthday to a life more ordinary. After years of vagabonding around the world alongside a series of chaotic father figures, they are settling down with quiet Kjell, a Swedish dentist, on the outskirts of a small town on the South coast of England. While exploring her new home’s surroundings, Eleanor discovers a solitary pony in a deserted plot of grazing land. As she befriends the animal and meets scar-faced, foul-mouthed, 16-year-old Pike she is slowly drawn into another family’s tragic past and finds herself at the centre of a decision between life or death, past or future, beginning or end. Eleanor McGraw is a contemporary book about people, ponies, patchwork families, friendship and love, suitable for anyone - horse rider or not - between 14 and 104. Contains some strong language.",
