  "description": "“As far as I know, there are only two people in the entire world who can translate this journal. One of them is dead now,” I said “And the other?” Narson asked. “Is me.”  To seventeen-year-old Norah Lukens, the Cobbogothians were just a myth. But after her uncle’s brutal murder, she begins a journey to discover the truth for herself.  While translating her uncle’s old archaeology journal, Norah learns that his death was a cover-up for something far more sinister. If she hopes to save others—including the peculiarly magnetic James Riley—she must figure out the clues to uncover where the city of Cobbogoth lies.  If she succeeds, she’ll gain the one thing she’s always longed for. But if she fails, not even the Cobbogothian gods can help her . . .",
