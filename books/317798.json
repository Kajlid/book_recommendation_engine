  "description": "I met Jonas at the gym. We both loved to work out and eat right, causing us to become fast friends. That’s the lie we tell everyone anyway. How we really met would raise a few eyebrows, and it wasn’t the kind of thing you bring up in casual conversations on the golf course. We were the type of friends who barbequed at each other’s homes on the weekends, and I was going to be the best man at his wedding. What we did on Wednesdays is what may make people cringe when they look at us and would definitely cause Jonas to have to see a divorce lawyer. It all started out with a bet, a drunken dare that I couldn’t back down from.This book contains: M/M & M/F/MTainted is a book in my Quick and Dirty Series.
