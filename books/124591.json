  "description": "Swapped for his brother as the freshly claimed mate of the ruthless alpha Constantine, nerdy bookworm Devon is in way over his head. Constantine is an ice storm in human--and beast--form, and Devon has only ever had book boyfriends. Yet every time he's sure he's drowning, he finds himself safe in Constantine's strong embrace.But Constantine is certain it's dangerous to believe their bond means anything other than a peace treaty between the Grayridge and Stone Hollow wolves. Not just to his pack, but to the innocent, vulnerable omega himself. Devon wants--needs--Constantine to love him, but love is not something a beast like him is capable of.Then again, neither is fear.And for the first time in his life, Constantine is afraid.Author's Note: This is the seventh serial installment of The Wolf's Mate series, and part two of Villain and the Geek, which is Devon and Constantine's story. Prepare for one irresistibly redeemable (?) villain, a lovable nerd who's convinced he's a defective omega, intrusive family members, and omegaverse shenanigans.",
