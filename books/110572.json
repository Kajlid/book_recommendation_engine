  "title": "Where Eagles Dare",
  "description": "One winter night, seven men and a woman, part of a team of British special forces, are parachuted onto a mountainside in wartime Germany. Their objective: an apparently inaccessible Alpine castle named Castle of the Eagle, and headquarters of the German Secret Service. Their mission: to rescue a crashed American general before the Nazi interrogators can force him to reveal secret D-Day plans. But such a daring mission was never going to be straightforward, and pretty soon the tension escalates as team members perish and the real mission turns out to be infinitely more complicated than first thought.",
