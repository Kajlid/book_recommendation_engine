  "title": "The Revolutionary Youth",
  "description": "Individual lives and history collide. For some the start of Northern Ireland's 'Troubles' is the beginning of a revolution, for others it is the beginning of a descent into hell. Some choose to get involved, others have no choice - but whatever the action there is always a reaction. When politics and violence are so closely entwined, is it possible to do one without the other?This is the story of what might have been. The story of those who witnessed the promise of the 'Sixties and then saw it evaporate in the heat of a sectarian war.",
