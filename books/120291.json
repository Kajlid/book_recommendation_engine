  "description": "With the worlds of the Deep Sky declaring their independence and the super-carrier battle groups assigned to quell the Colonial War by any means, Neil Travers and Curtis Marin find themselves in an explosive situation. On the one hand, the London and the Avenger are poised to move against Jagreth and Borushek ... on the other, the Zunshu continue to strike out of the massive Hellgate storms ... and caught between them are the most powerful ships on either side of the frontier. Richard Vaurien’s Wastrel -- a salvage tug designed to work the fragmented space on the edge of Hellgate. And Mark Sherratt’s Lai’a -- with the body of a warship and the mind of a Resalq super-AI. A Freespacer crew pledged to fight for the freedom of the Deep Sky ... a unique artificial intelligence bred and born for the region beyond Hellgate -- the realm that has become known to a handful of pilots as transspace. From a searing battle fought in the shadow of Oberon to the depths of Zunshu space beyond The Blood Gate ... from the cool, green forests of Jagreth to the most alien worlds Marin and Travers could never imagine, and a first contact that will change the future ... this is Event Horizon.",
