  "description": "Survival Here Means Cheating Death  **The First book of the fantasy series** Bai Feng lived the life of a business graduate. He toiled his way up the corporate ladder, only to be cast aside by those with connections. Broken and demoted to a company branch in the country, he made an oath one night to live an average life--and then he woke up. In a fantasy world where the rich prey on the poor, capitulation leads to death, and creatures and demons of legends become real, Bai Feng must navigate through dangers from man and beast alike. But first he must come to terms with his new identity-- A starving twelve year old boy, residing in the village slums. Now called Chu, Bai Feng finds himself living alone in a rickety shack on the frontiers of an infant Empire. Malnourished and without a copper coin to his name, he realises he has transmigrated to face a torturous demise. Stifling his hunger, Bai Feng must climb out of poverty, while treating each step as his last. \nJoin the young Chu as he strives to survive before he can explore this strange new world, and one day hope to earn the right to a surname.\n \n**A gripping tale of a boy rising literally from the ashes to stamp his mark in a fantasy world.**",
