  "description": "Nixon -   I used to think stalkers came in one of two categories- Creepy guys who wonâ€™t take no for an answer, and Women scorned. That was until I met Reagan. A woman with secrets. Secrets I planned to get out of her one way or another. Among other things.    Reagan -  No sane person decides to be a stalker. And no smart woman gets the hots for the very man who was supposed to thwart her mission. I guess that made me both less-than-sane and stupid. Somehow, I was okay with that. I knew why it was important to do what I did. And, maybe, in Nixon, I would find someone who would understand, who would help me. Even if he grumbled the entire time.  * Possible trigger warnings listed on author's website under the \"books\" tab.",
