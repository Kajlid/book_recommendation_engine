  "description": "Glen Duncan now gives us a stunning follow-up to The Last Werewolf, which has been hailed as \"a brilliantly original thriller, a love story, a witty treatise on male (and female) urges, even an existential musing on what it is to be human\" (James Medd, The Word).Talulla, pregnant, grieving, and on the run, must face her werewolf future without Jake. Premature labor under a full moon leaves her near death, but with her newborn son in her arms, she believes the worst is over.Until the door opens--and a new nightmare begins.What follows tests her sanity, her motherhood, and her will to survive, in a race against time to recover her lost child, an epic struggle that sees her crossing paths with a psychotic new WOCOP leader, an unlikely human lover, blood-drinking religious fanatics, a pack of London werewolves, and (rumor has it) the oldest living vampire on earth...Talulla Rising pushes the werewolf myth further into new territory to give us a novel rich in action and ideas, delivering in the process the definitive twenty-first-century female of the species.",
