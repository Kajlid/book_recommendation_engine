  "description": "Colorado rancher and tribal investigator Charlie Moon is taking a night off to play some poker with his best friend, Scott Parris, Granite Creek’s chief of police, when Scott’s dispatcher cuts in with an emergency call. It seems a man was on the phone with his wife when their call was interrupted by a bloodcurdling scream and the most gruesome noises he’d ever heard. Would they mind checking it out? Arriving on scene, they discover that the man’s wife, one of three daughters of a wealthy and powerful rancher, has been mauled beyond recognition.  Even after her two sisters---one of whom is a popular TV psychic who on that very night’s show reported “seeing” the real-time murder of one of her fans---turn up at the DA’s office, demanding answers, the smart money and forensic experts are still laying blame on a hungry bear. But once the wheels of justice are turning and the ratings for Cassandra Sees are going through the roof, the surviving sisters are awfully quick to move on in all kinds of ways. With eyebrows and suspicions raised, Charlie and his irascible aunt Daisy, a Ute shaman whose investigative talents rely heavily on help from the spirit world, set out to track down a killer. A tight plot, quick wit, and clever crimes make Three Sisters, the twelfth installment in the popular Charlie Moon series, the newest must-have from James D. Doss.",
