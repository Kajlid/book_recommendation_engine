  "description": "What if fictional characters were alive in another dimension, and one came through to this one? When young aspiring model Natalie Nicholson meets best selling writer Alex Sager, he falls for her instantly. Still, he has a few problems, not the least being that he is haunted by his own character.The jaded rake Ivan Ostrowski emerges from his own reality, seeking revenge on the so-called creator who has imposed a series of unhappy love affairs on him. Besides, Ostrowski has seen Natalie from afar, and now wildly infatuated with her, schemes to draw her back with him into his own world. Natalie is unwillingly drawn into a nightmare situation which few can credit. Alex himself cannot believe - as his closest friend insists - that he has brought this situation about through insulting a sinister being known as 'The Magus' at an Ouija board session many years ago. He refuses to credit the increasing parallels between his own life and that of his idol Pushkin, the great poet of Tsarist Russia, whose life was tragically cut short through a duel over his wife. But even Alex has to admit, Natalie strongly resembles Pushkin's Natalya, and Ivan Ostrowski certainly wants a battle to the death. Natalie enlists the help of two New Age gurus, only to realise that the handsome and unscrupulous Ivan Ostrowski is enticing the woman into becoming his dupe. Meanwhile, she senses that Alex is hurtling towards destruction, and dreads that Ostrowski will draw her into his own world.",
