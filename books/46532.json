  "title": "Inspiration Meditation: A Guide For Writers Artists & Everyone",
  "description": "This ebook introduces a meditation method devised by a writer to foster your innate creative intelligence. When we take silent time to meditate, a shift happens within. Our consciousness expands, our awareness deepens, we come into the presence of what Albert Einstein described as \"the most beautiful emotion we can experience...the [underlying] power of all true art and science.\" This creative power is already within us. We don't acquire it by trying, any more than we try to acquire our fingers or our feet. It's more about dissolving the internal barriers that come between us and our innate creative potential, so we can align with it and allow it to flow more freely. Practice Inspiration Meditation regularly and you will enjoy:Increased creativity, Deeper awarenessPresent moment mindfulnessMore enjoyment of lifeConnection with all you are creating, consciously and unconsciously.Includes:A Q & A section answering questions about meditation for beginners and advanced practitioners. And a guided creative visualisation. Also available (from author's website): Accompanying 'Inspiration Meditation' Audio.",
