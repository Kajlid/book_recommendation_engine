  "description": "'How Didi Menendez got Francis Bacon and Woody Allen into a book about a quasi-celestial being strangely called by Armadillo is this: Didi Menendez is a fearless writer, no more shy for the surrealist imagery of a shelled creature lodging in a woman's chest, than for the calm and simpler ruminations, such as knitting or what sitcoms to watch on TV. Matched with equally beautifully shapeshifting imagery by Jeremy Baum, 'For the Love of Armadillo' is a book that calms me in knowing it exists.' - Blake Butler",
