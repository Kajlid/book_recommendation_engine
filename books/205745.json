  "description": "Bouncing Back Up tells the story of two people who found an everlasting love and struggle to find happiness in their separate lives in spite of their lasting affection for each other.After more than a decade of not seeing or communicating with each other, two old friends came together in a joyful reunion. It was unexpected after so many years, but when Norman and Gail saw each other again they realized that they still had strong feelings for each other. They decided that it was incumbent upon them to move cautiously and insure that the path forward for them was clear before they ventured into forbidden territory. After years of abusive neglect and mistreatment of her husband, Nancy's (Norman's wife) abrupt turnaround was just in time to stop the runaway feelings between the two star-crossed lovers. She made a dramatic apology to her husband just before he was about to reunite with his old love. Having filed for divorce from her, Norman had begun to feel free to move on with his life. It seems certain the couple would have learned that the pain of loving someone you can't have is just as bad as losing someone that you've had all your life.This gripping story began in another book, which was the prequel to Bouncing Back Up . That book, The Second Time Around , set the stage for this heart-wrenching story. It outlines the background for each of these characters and records their path to this point in their separate lives.",
