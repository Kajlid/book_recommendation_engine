What good is a junkman without a truck?Then when he got his barefooted ass home, his barfly, karaoke killing girlfriend informed him she’d had him zombiefied, and she was running off to Nashville with the local crackhead to be a star.…So he ate her.And now he had to figure out how to sweet-talk a creepy, tobacco chewing, old crone into making him not dead before his favorite parts started rotting off.",
