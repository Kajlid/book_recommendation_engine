  "description": "Small wonder Destiny felt mutinousRafe Janeiro turned even a summer in Digby Head, Maine, into sheer misery. No colas, no spicy foods, no late hours and no work. Worst of all, when Destiny protested, Rafe retorted with \"doctor's orders.\" Life would have been easier with Captain Bligh. Was it any wonder she'd jumped ship last time, ending their married life?Equality wasn't the issue--it never had been. But years at sea had taught Rafe that you never tried to outrace a storm. You headed into it--even when one heck of a summer squall was headed your way.",
