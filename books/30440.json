  "description": "I giggled, my fingers were no longer attached to my hands, they were typing all on their own. Sometimes writing a short story takes up all your time and before you know it hours have passed and you haven't even eaten yet. You never know what could happen if you wrote a novel. It just might be deadly! I'm guessing you'll be guessing the ending, but getting to it is the best part! Let me know if I'm right (: (SO I CAN LIVE LONGER, THIS IS A SHORT STORY!)I noticed when writing how all else disappears and the only thing I'm engrossed in is the story I'm writing about. You look up and it's hours later and you haven't even stopped to eat. This gave me the idea for the short story.",
