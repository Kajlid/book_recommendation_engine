  "description": "Snobbles the snake is different from his friends. While they like to gobble meat stolen from the fearsome mongoose, Snobbles is shy--and prefers fruit and to befriend the rodents the other snakes like to devour. When the snakes' habit of stealing puts all of them in danger, Snobbles--accompanied by his best friend, Scoot the scorpion--must set out on a journey to save his friends and show them a better way to live. Each page is illustrated with a photograph of a handcrafted, mixed-media scene that incorporates characters meticulously sculpted from clay. Snobbles the Great is bold, innovative, and utterly original, a treat for parents and kids alike.",
