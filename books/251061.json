  "description": "#1  New York Times   bestselling author of Women Food and GodRoth speaks of issues that, chauvinism aside, only women can truly understand and identify with. In the past, her books were about food, weight, dieting, and the almost universal obsession that women have with their bodies and self-esteem. Now her canvas of introspection and discussion has eight chapters examine the nature of women's friendships, the craving to be famous, the longing for safety, and the search for a parallel life (or the perfect fantasy), among other topics. Based on intensely personal experiences, written with intensely emotional and intellectually probing prose, Roth's book pushes far beyond the issue of weight to ask what will make women happy. Her not-so-easy answers, divined from decades of therapy, of experiential beingness, of Buddhist practice, will speak to many.\"Roth tells of her own experiences with a non-blink frankness cushioned by the gracefulness of her prose.\"— Chicago Tribune\"Just the right mix of confession, sass, and style.\"— Publishers Weekly",
