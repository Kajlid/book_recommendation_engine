  "description": "IN A PLACE OF PEACE, DURING A TIME OF WAR, THE UNFORGIVEN WILL NOT GO FORGOTTEN. Edenville, 1940. In a rural hamlet where the majority of men are overseas to fight Hitler's Nazi war machine, someone is killing veterans of the first world war. Wartime Special Constable 'Lame' Eddie Sommers, a crippled rich boy and the butt of derision, is doing his best to fill a uniform he believes in, yet wears too large. Inexperienced and out of his depth, he turns to a former detective and veteran of the western front for assistance. Involving Marshall Geary might be his biggest mistake. Marshall wears a copper mask, as much to hide behind as to conceal his disfigurements. He struggles against howling flashbacks and the lingering stench of his own concealed crimes. In a town meant for sanctuary, repressed horrors awaken like worms in a collapsing coffin. The closer they get to the truth, the nearer everyone is dragged to their limits, their failings and their buried pasts. \"If you love thrillers, don't miss this action packed read.\"",
