  "description": "I was born and raised to tend to the dead. Growing up as the daughter of a gravedigger I always knew I would carry on his legacy. It was a peaceful life, though, admittedly lonely at times. That all changed when Raphael walked into my cemetery. I’d finally found the person I wanted to share my life with. Then…I died. Now I’m learning the ways of this underworld city and getting to know some of the local vampires. I even have a new job as a reaper. Instead of putting people in the ground, now, I’m digging them up so that their souls can move along to their next journey. People tell you life has a lot of unexpected twists but so does death.CW- dark and adult themes that might be disturbing to some readers",
