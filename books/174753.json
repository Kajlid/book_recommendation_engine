  "description": "Can love really conquer all? Or is it like a promising 70% off poster with a small asterisk at the bottom saying on selected items only? In short, bullshit?Love without sex.........forever?For Rellik, an English and Literature teacher, who likes estimating things in a not so appropriate situation even not a number expert and possesses (self-acclaimed) a good acting skill, it doesn't matter as long as love is the foundation. For Graig, who still likes banging women, probably will have nothing to say.One sexless being, one love, one secret, one chance...Rellik is chosen or forced to (doesn't know which is which) assist Graig, a modern Viking with professionally made up civility (as per Rellik) in his one month stay in a place where no building is higher than third floor and make sure he won't change his mind donating 0.875% of his wealth to Benigno Aquino National High School.One man, one beating heart, one arrogant dick, one happiness.Graig is given one month to get all the permissions of all the members of Tapat's Family from the parents, nine siblings and two pets--cat and dog. He has his only chance to get something he never realized he needed for his life--Rellik, his unfuckable happiness. Will he follow his mate down there between his hips or his almost unreliable, inefficient heart?Can love overcome lust for eternity? Even the lust only reserved for his loved one? Or not?",
