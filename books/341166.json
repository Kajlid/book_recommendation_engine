  "title": "The Napoleon Connection",
  "description": "The Napoleon Connection is an art history adventure-mystery set in the French Quarter of present-day New Orleans. Hired by one of that city's prominent citizens, young, accomplished art historian Michael Bennington must discover the whereabouts of a priceless artifact--believed to be a rare jewel--curiously missing from the city's famed Cabildo historical museum. Bennington dives into the assignment with an uncanny passion--his specialty is 19th century jewels--and he ends up taking a virtual roller coaster ride through the city's fascinating historical past, uncovers both real and purported--if not positively bizarre--local legends, descends into the city's eclectic gay undergrounds and even encounters a quasi-religious homoerotic Roman Catholic cult. The first installment in The Jewel Trilogy, The Napoleon Connection is an introduction into the entertaining exploits of the likable Bennington character. The other books in the series are: Carlota's Legacy and The Brotherhood Wars. Paperbacks available at http://claudebrick.wix.com/bricbooks",
