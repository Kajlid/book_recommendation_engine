  "description": "Sugar Man was the king who supplied the poison that the frustrated and needy pumped into their veins. And when a smart DA came after him he did the (to his mind) logical thing: he sent two little kids out to kill him.Amateur gangsters Turtle and Tracy assassinate an assistant D.A. and go on the run. They're hunted by the cops, gangster Sugar Man, and reporter Spider. There is a running commentary on everyone's mental and emotional state throughout.",
