When four female angels were created for the four archangels, Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Azrael, a chaos spurred by jealousy erupted, and the archesses were secreted away to Earth. The four favored archangels followed, prompting a search that has lasted millennia…For hundreds of years, Gabriel has passed himself off as a common Scottish villager.

Now, he’s shocked to discover the object of his desire in his own backyard.

And he claims her with a searing kiss on the spot.Every instinct tells her to run. But when a dark force rises, and the truth of her identity is revealed, she must put her faith in the mysterious man who enflames her.",
