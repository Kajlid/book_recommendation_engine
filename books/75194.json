  "description": "Do You Need Healing, or Want to Help Others Get Healed? It’s tough to confidently believe God for healing--if we’re not absolutely convinced it’s ALWAYS His will. Maybe you believe God wants to heal, but you can’t escape these nagging • Doesn’t God ‘allow’ suffering? • What about Job? • Didn’t miracles stop a long time ago? • What about Paul’s ‘thorn in the flesh?’ • Doesn’t God teach us through sickness? • If God’s Will is Always Healing, why am I sick? In this 400-page (but super user-friendly) book we use over 600 Scriptures to answer all of these questions—and many more. Perhaps more importantly than crushing these specific objections, we’ll establish some larger, more central truths as foundations in our lives… • The New Covenant is Better Than the Old One • God’s Truth Often Contradicts Visible Facts • God is Good, and the Devil is Bad • God is Sovereign but Gives Man Authority • Physical Healing is Included in the Atonement • Jesus is the Only Clear Picture of God • We Are ONE with the Exalted Christ Once these Bible basics become the lenses through which we view God’s will and nature, we can confidently step into Healing for ourselves and others. WHAT ARE LEADERS SAYING? “…As I read this book, I thought about F.F. Bosworth's book, Christ The Healer, which is a classic. This takes that book to the next level. I will recommend this book to my staff as a must read…” --Cal Pierce Director of Healing Rooms Ministries Spokane, Washington \"…Thankfully, leaders like Joshua Greeson are paving the way for others to understand this missing truth. Enjoy as you read this groundbreaking book and discover the truth for yourself!\" --Dr. Jonathan Welton Best-Selling Author Director of the Welton Academy “…If you desire to walk in a life of power, demonstrated by miracles and healing… God’s Will is Always Healing will help equip, empower and renew your mind, to help prepare you to walk in a supernatural life, so that you will see impossibilities bow the knee to Jesus.” --Chris Gore Director of Healing Ministries Bethel Church, Redding, California Book includes a Study Guide containing “Questions for Discussion, Study and Review” from each chapter, so it’s ideal for personal study or group discussion. Let’s obliterate the man-made traditions and objections that have held us back from growing up in Christ.
