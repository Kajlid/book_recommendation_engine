  "title": "Hard Aground with Eddie Jones: An Incomplete Idiot's Guide to Doing Stupid Stuff With Boats",
  "description": "Hard Aground with Eddie Jones is a collection of cruising and boating stories, offering a \"stuck up\" look at the underside of cruising and the frustrations we “land-cuffed” sailors experience when our plans for coastal exploration and tropical destinations run aground on the shoals of family, finances and failing health. These columns first appeared in Carolina Cruising and Coastal Cruising Magazine. “If there is a better nautical writer when it comes to relationships and family interactions on the water than Eddie Jones, we don't know about them.” –Claiborne Young, author of Cruising Guide to North Carolina “Thanks for your latest Hard Aground column, Eddie. Mel was wondering why I was laughing so early in the morning.” –Tom Neale, Cruising Coast and Islands \"Eddie has an excellent ear for words and is one of North Carolina’s nautical treasures.\"–Dave Martin, Cruising World Magazine",
