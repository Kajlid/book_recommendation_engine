  "description": "Winner of the National Book Award in 1940 and the basis for the Academy Award Best Picture film of the same name, How Green Was My Valley is full of memorable characters, richly crafted language, and surprising humor.Huw Morgan remembers the days when his home valley was prosperous, verdant, and beautiful—before the mines came to town. The youngest son of a respectable mining family in South Wales, he is now the only one left in the valley, and his reminiscences tell the story of a family and a town both defined and ruined by the mines.Huw's story is both joyful and heartrending—a portrait of a place and a people existing now only in memory.ABOUT THE AUTHORRichard Llewellyn (1906-1983) was an award-winning British novelist and the child of Welsh parents. He worked as a coal miner, a journalist, and a screenwriter for MGM studios. He served as a Captain in the Welsh Guards during World War II, and after the war covered the Nuremberg Trials as a reporter.He is best known, however, for his novels—particularly those that celebrated coal mining communities in rural Wales. The best known of these, How Green Was My Valley, was published in 1939 to international renown, and was later memorably adapted to Hollywood by Director John Ford, starring Walter Pidgeon and Maureen O'Hara.",
