  "title": "Lauren's Manifesto",
  "description": "Young data analyst Lauren Nunez rarely thought in depth about worsening conditions in the U.S. until she gets fired by her boss, a sexual predator. Then she loses everything, her status-seeking girlfriend included. Lauren moves in with her sister, Tee, in Austin where at first she dismisses Tee's progressive group. But when Lauren gets tangled up in a police action, and then discovers the government is spying on her sister's party, she's not ready to back down anymore. This near-future tale of intrigue also finds Lauren torn between blue-collar Kenna and charismatic Tori, a trans woman shaking up national politics. And when Lauren discovers what the government spies are really up to, she may have to pay a deadly price for defending both love and liberty.",
