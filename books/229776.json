  "description": "Previously published  Keeping an eye on his charge isn't easy. Keeping his hands off? Impossible...  It took attending his own funeral to force Logan to accept a new life as an undercover MI6 agent. That doesn't make his latest assignment any less aggravating. Babysitting a Russian pop star with delusions that someone's trying to kill him. Other than an inexplicable attraction Logan ruthlessly suppresses, he couldn't have less in common with the irritating, arrogant rich kid. He's even prepared to walk away-until very real bullets start flying.  After his mother's death, Zak Kochenkov's life unravels in an impenetrable haze of grief, drugs and alcohol-until one bodyguard candidate stands out. Except his hopes of having some fun with that guard's body evaporate when he realizes Logan is buttoned up tighter than a clam. The first thing Logan learns is that his charge won't do as he's told. And there's some secret behind his haunted eyes that shakes Logan's resolve to keep him at arm's length. Because he knows if he lets passion close his eyes, that's when danger will find them both...  Warning: Contains a sexy bodyguard with a tortured past, and a spoiled rock star with a tortured conscience. Stir (don't shake), and prepare for spontaneous combustion",
