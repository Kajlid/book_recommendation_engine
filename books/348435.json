  "description": "\"Richard Hugo's free-swinging, go-for-it remarks on poetry and the teaching of poetry are exactly what are needed in classrooms and in the world.\"―James Dickey Richard Hugo was that rare phenomenon of American letters―a distinguished poet who was also an inspiring teacher. The Triggering Town is Hugo's now-classic collection of lectures, essays, and reflections, all \"directed toward helping with that silly, absurd, maddening, futile, enormously rewarding activity: writing poems.\" Anyone, from the beginning poet to the mature writer to the lover of literature, will benefit greatly from Hugo's sayd, playful, profound insights and advice concerning the mysteries of literary creation.",
