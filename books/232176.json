  "description": "AROKHI broke the rules and stole an auction item from her buyers.Because somehow, they’d managed to abduct a Gryfala princess.Though… she doesn’t look, or act, or sound quite like I thought one of her kind would.But I’m merely a Rakhii gladiator; this is the closest I’ve actually ever been to a princess.I’d be considered lucky indeed if she chose me to guard her.Instead, I want more.I need her to claim me.Because she doesn’t know it, but now I can’t let her go.ANGIEWoke up in a freaking auction pen.With no coffee.But there were aliens. And they didn’t bid on me out of the goodness of their hearts.FML.Then this nice alien showed up in the nick of time, but he keeps referring to me as “Princess” and I’m starting to worry what he’ll do when he finds out that there’s been a little case of mistaken identity, that I’m not royalty - see, I’m not even whatever alien he mistook me for…I’m just a human.",
