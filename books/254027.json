  "description": "Xander Penn has been around the block more times than he cares to count, always searching for an elusive something he’s never admitted to wanting, not even to himself. Until now… Then again, realizing what he craves doesn’t mean he accepts it. It’s one thing to dabble at the open-door policy club he belongs to, but quite another to declare it to others in the real world. After a harsh rejection pushes away the one person Xander wishes he could pull closer, he spirals down a dark path, using meaningless sex more as a punishment than a pleasure. When an unexpected ally makes him see he’s missing out on the best parts of life, Xander finally decides to open himself up to the possibility… But by then, it may be too late. Xander is an erotic romance novella intended for audiences 18+. This novella is just over 30,000 words, and it contains a variety of M/M and M/F encounters.*All Open-Door Policy novellas can be read as standalones.*",
