A girl is driven away from the family farm into the dark woods where her inner demons literally sprout from her ribcage. Lost with horrors at her side, the girl begins to lose hope as the arms mislead and poison her. However, she is not completely alone and help arrives in the form of a guiding wolf. Only through sacrifice, trust, and perseverance can the girl escape from the woods and her demons. Will she find her way out of the forest and free herself, body and mind?",
