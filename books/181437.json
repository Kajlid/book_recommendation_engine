  "title": "Captain Patty and the Nameless Navigator",
  "description": "After being lost at sea, British naval officer Charles Wellington and his daughter, Samantha, are rescued by a mysterious pirate captain who is anything but your typical swashbuckler. Clever, loyal, extravagant...and maybe a little odd. Not much is known about Captain \"Patty\" Peterson except a name, an obsession, and that he is the most wanted pirate in North American waters. Except he's not wanted by the navy. He's wanted by other pirates. Life with Captain Patty promises much in return. Chases on the high seas, battles with a vengeful sea monster, and the vow of a rival pirate to find the man who escaped him. Charles and Samantha hoped for a rescue, but they may get an adventure instead.",
