As the FBI closes in and her former associates seek revenge, Sara tries to escape but finds all avenues blocked. Trapped, she sees only one road out—Derry must take the fall and pay for her crimes.

Or will Sara make the ultimate sacrifice to save those she cares about?Written for the General Market (G) (I) : Contains little or no; sexual dialogue or situations or strong language.
