  "description": "The discovery of a young boy's body, brutally murdered and preserved for thousands of years in a Scottish peat bog, brings with it more than a find of a lifetime for archaeologist Mirin Hassan. After the death of her husband, Mirin wants life to get back to normal for her and her young son. But media attention and professional rivalries become the least of her worries. Something other than cameras followed the corpse back to the university. A malevolent force grows unseen. The weather turns biblical. Violence and death spread beyond the university. Could it be connected with the strange discovery? The city grasps for a rational explanation, but time is up. Chaos has arrived, as Mirin realises some things should stay buried.Book 1 in the FRIGHT NIGHT series of bone chillers, Neolithica is the breakout novel from horror author Dan Soule. A mix of Dean Koontz and James Herbert, with a dash of Lovecraft. Buy it now if you're a fan of bestsellers like Phantoms, Darkfall and The Rats.",
