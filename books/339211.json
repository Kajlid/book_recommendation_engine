Her solution? Seduce him — just for one night. And since she has the handcuffs anyway, she figures she may as well put them to good, kinky use to make sure he doesn't get away.But Erin's made a very big mistake. She rocks Carter's world, but he doesn't like giving up his control either, or feeling used. Lucky for him, she isn't the only one who can come up with creative uses for a pair of handcuffs.

Carter's Cuffs features a brief scene of f/f/m interaction. You have been warned…",
