  "description": "Estela Ramos knows she will die a lonely virgin spinster with donut glaze on her face. She’s resigned herself to this fate, but the women in her life have other plans. Soon, there are two men standing before the first is a desperate gynecologist with personal space issues, and the second is a handsome high-fashion photographer who claims that they’ve known each other for years. Estela becomes easily lost in the steady gaze of the photographer’s jade-green eyes, but knows she won’t get anywhere if she can’t forget the pains from her past and truly believe that someone would be eager to love her just as she is. 9/6/2015",
