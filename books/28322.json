  "description": "Finally, the story of the Great War of the Ban is told! Two young wanderers are given a small copper coin by a dying human, who tells them to deliver it \"East to Agron\" and \"warn all, \" but dies before explaining who they are to deliver it to, and what they are to warn them of. Making matters worse, in order to deliver the message, the pair must pass through a war in the East between the Black Mage Modru and the alliance of free folk opposing him, and end up being drawn into events which threaten to overwhelm them, save for the coin which has much more significance than anyone could imagine!",
