The gentle lass who roamed the hills of Ireland knew only that she must help creatures in need. But her sweet, sheltered world was about to be shaken by an alarming discovery among the mysterious standing stones above the ruins of Ballyaroon. Lying at her feet was wounded Captain Lionel Redmayne, a steely British officer as feared by his own men as by his enemies. Their worlds could not be more different, but something lured these two solitary hearts to find solace in each other's mysterious ways.With healing herbs and a soothing touch, Rhiannon set out to save Captain Redmayne.

Yet here, too, was the hero promised to her by destiny, whose love was locked in a past of secrets and pain, and in a heart to which she alone held the key....",
