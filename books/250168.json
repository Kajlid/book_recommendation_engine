  "description": "With his life now thrust into Peril, Caravaggio must abandon the life which he so amorously sought since childhood. A fugitive with adversaries nipping at his heels, Caravaggio must find the strength to overcome the demons plaguing his life and learn to trust once more those who betrayed. Against the backdrop of a new Inquisition, a blood thirsty cardinal determined to become pope, and conspiracies meeting him at every turn, Caravaggio finds himself estranged from his friends and separated from his love. Caught between two worlds, secrets unravel revealing a world where the Church murders innocents, fathers conspire against sons, and condottieri plague the streets from gloaming until dayspring. Secrets Caravaggio learns men had waged wars over for centuries, secrets he feared would wind him dead, and secrets finally unearthed that explain exactly what happened on the beach in 1610, July.",
