  "description": "VanThis is the only way I can make sure she’s safe. And she has to be safe.My feet are quieter than a whisper as they trudge along the asphalt. She doesn’t look at me until we’re nearly toe-to-toe, because she walks her with her beautiful head tipped down.That’s something I’m going to change.I grab her quickly, so fast that she doesn’t even have the chance to make a sound. I’ve got her cuffed and gagged in just moments, and in the back seat of my SUV just as quick.It’s true how it’s always recounted; it always happens so fast.She struggles against my hands and I hold her shoulders until she’s out of fight, which only takes a minute. I’m scaring her right now. But I’ll make it right.And this is for her own good.She will see.Violet with the emerald eyes.Where Violets Bloom is Book 1 in the Men of Paradise series.Author's Note: Please visit the reading guide on the author's website for all content warnings and other information.
