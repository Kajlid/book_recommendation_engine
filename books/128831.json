  "description": "Star Berkley had never seen the likes of Sir Edward. He was so deuced arrogant. He was so dashingly fashionable and just as insolent. Added to this, was the fact that he was the most handsome man she had ever come across in all her twenty years of life! Sir Edward, for his part, could do without the pert country airs of a chit like Miss Berkley. She was impish, plain-spoken and went about clothed in virtual rags, and obviously not his sort, which, was just as well for it seemed she had stolen the heart of his closest friend. And thenâ€”Sir Edward stumbled onto a most sordid secret: the Berkley's estate teetered on ruination, and brother and sister were being brutally blackmailed by a vile den of thieves. Sir Edward meant to save them if only Star would allow him to do so. She was determined to keep him and his help at arm's length, but he was just as determined to do otherwise. A clash of wills ensued and a web of passion flourished. **note: this is an updated version of an earlier novel, Regency Star written as Claudette Williams. The updated versions of Claudy's Claudette Williams titles are more sexually explicit than the original versions.",
