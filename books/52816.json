  "description": "(back cover) At last available to the public in handy book form is this pint-sized cartoon guide to the typical modern state of bewilderment that Europeans call Problemos d'amour a l'Inferno -- literally, hellish love problems. Written and illustrated by Matt Groening, the guy responsible for the strangely popular \"Life in Hell\" comic strip, published weekly in newspapers from coast to coast. See and read about the boulder-strewn rocky road of love by means of dozens of exclusive, authentic cartoon-like pictographs, plus detailed instructions written frankly yet simply. This complete, HEFTY BOOK (9 inches by 9 inches, the size of a large waffle) includes important new information and secrets you can't be without. LOVE IS HELL is a frank, straightforward presentation of FACTS, THEORIES, and WISHFUL THINKING that will satisfy mature interest in the love behavior of the human male and female, not to mention rabbits. Gives the most helpful expert advice on love problems of every kind -- both normal as well as those that plague you. Practically every kind of urge is individually treated. Many men and women have reconciled themselves to their hellish doom after reading the frankly illustrated and profusely written LOVE IS HELL. So can YOU.",
