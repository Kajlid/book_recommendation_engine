  "title": "Religion: An Obstacle to Human Progress",
  "description": "In Religion, An Obstacle to Human Progress, Joseph R. Simonetta, author of Seven Words That Can Change The World and other works, pens a bold indictment of the world of religion. In a commonsense and uniquely refreshing approach, he lays bare the inconsistencies and incredibilities of traditional religion. Not only does he demonstrate that our major world belief systems are antiquated and dysfunctional, he ties them masterfully into seemingly unsolvable political, economic and environmental problems. In the end, he points to the direction that some of humanity is heading and that all of humanity must go. Throughout the book, described as “a browser’s delight”, Simonetta’s thoughts are reinforced by quotes from some of the world’s best thinkers. Interspersed are personal narratives from his time as a student at both Yale and Harvard Divinity schools, short pithy lines that punctuate truths sharply, striking anecdotes from the world of religion, touches of humor, and ongoing critical analysis.",
