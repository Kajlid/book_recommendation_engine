  "description": "Charlie Bronson has taken his 24 years of experience of prison dwelling and condensed it into one handy and comprehensive volume. Moved regularly around the prisons of the British Isles, he has sampled all that prison life has to offer, taking in both the historic and pre-historic buildings that comprise Britain's infamous prison system. It's all in here, from the correct way to brew vintage prison \"hooch\" and how to keep the screws from finding it, to the indispensable culinary methods required to make prison food edible. Readers can learn about Charlie's special taming techniques for prison wildlife such as spiders, rats, and cockroaches, creatures that may be prisoners' only friends in long stretches on solitary. Charlie also shows how to plan and prepare for marriage inside what can be seen as a less than romantic setting.",
