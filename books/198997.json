  "description": "Denise Hughes can't stand the way her husband chews. Or the way he sits with his belly fat oozing over his belt. Or the air whistling past his nostril hair.John Hughes can't believe his wife has turned from a sweet, happy young woman, to a scathing, foul mouthed, khaki wearing PTA mom.The only thing they still have in common is planning their divorce. During a shopping spree that was meant to ruin Johnâ€™s credit, Denise acquires a most unusual love seat that has the potential to show them both that the love they once had is still there. Fifty percent of marriages fail. It's a depressing fact about our society. Love doesn't last. Love stinks. It slices and dices you to pieces, leaving you in the rotting compost pile of life. What if changing one tiny piece of people's perspectives could make it possible to salvage thousands of marriages? What if the original love, lust and excitement was actually still there? Buried beneath the banana peels, apple cores and coffee grounds? Eventually John and Denise realize that while they are seated on this love seat, they feel that initial love they once knew. The suddenly in love again couple must learn how to conduct their day to day life on this small love seat. Managing work, kids and in-laws from the love seat creates some interesting, awkward, and highly comical situations for them. Could this slightly magical love seat be the catalyst to changing their perspective about each other? About love? Perhaps.. except the Love Seat doesn't remain in their lives long enough for them to find out. What will happen to the couple who regained their love only to lose it all again?",
