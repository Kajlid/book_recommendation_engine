  "title": "The Chalk Cliffs",
  "description": "\"The beginning and end of everything happened a few months before I was five years old and it is as vivid to me, today, as the childrenâ€™s picture books I now write and illustrate. The vibrant colours, the whiteness of the pages against the bold black shiny ink, the smell of the paper and print; all these startle and excite me, but the story, the story....that weighs so heavily upon me, filling me with dread. I have spent twenty six years trying to exorcise it, hunting down the words that might make the child I once was understand the facts and fiction of it. Yet if I ever succeeded, I know I would lose everyone whom I believed loved me back then. The insane thing is, they died anyway - died of that trauma, I think; died far too young. I lost my sister, suddenly, only this year, but it is my mother, her high heels click-clacking across the floor, her perfume drifting towards me, on every breeze, who haunts me still. \"To quote from one of the reviews: \"There are no easy outs and there is nothing predictable about this book. Don't miss it.\" And another (Canada): \"Deeply moving and mesmerising. I was captivated....the story inexorably moves ahead catching the reader in its suspenseful wake .\" And a third: \"It is probably one of the most powerfully emotional books I've read recently.\"",
