  "description": "The long idyllic summer of Jan Ruff-O'Herne's childhood in Dutch colonial Indonesia, ended in 1942 with the Japanese invasion of Java. She was interned in Ambarawa Prison Camp, along with her mother and two younger sisters.In February 1944, when Jan was 21, her life was torn apart. Along with nine other young women, all of them virgins, she was plucked from the camp and her family, and enslaved into prostitution by the Japanese Imperial Army.Her searing account of her time in 'The House of the Seven Seas', the Japanese Officers' Club and brother in Semarang, uncovers one of the worst human rights abuses to come out of the war--abuse that affected thousands of young women who were forcibly removed from their families to provide sexual services as 'comfort women' for the Japanese army between 1929 and 1945.50 Years of Silence is Jan's story. As the first European 'comfort woman' to speak out, it is a story of tremendous courage, that unfolds with the deeper meaning of a fable.Shining over all, is the radiance of Jan Ruff-O'Herne's faith and love, illuminating one of the darkest and best kept secrets of World War II.",
