  "description": "Sitting between the saint and the sinner at church, Kamaria Powell began asking life’s most thought provoking questions and to her surprise, she started receiving answers. What The F#@k Is Enlightenment? takes you on her unconventional journey past self-judgment into an awareness of the Divine within. Let’s face it, life is messy and there are often many detours but the message is clear: You are not forgotten and no matter how many times you’ve messed up, God is not mad at you. Kamaria encourages you to embrace your own spiritual identity no matter how unorthodox it may seem. It is by transforming ourselves that we in turn transform our world.",
