  "title": "The Counterfeit Mistress",
  "description": "A refugee from the war in France, Marielle Lyon has established herself at the fringes of London society and welcomes the gossip that she is a s py. The more eyes watching her, the better protected she is -- and the better her chances are at saving her father's life. A warrior at heart, Gavin Norwood, Viscount Kendale, would still be in uniform if not for his older brother's untimely death. Kenale doesn't trust the French, or their femmes fatales. He's ready to do what it takes to unmask her -- even if it means playing a game of seduction.",
