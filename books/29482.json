  "description": "Christine Beatty’s memoir chronicles her odyssey from collegiate husband to transsexual prostitute, recovery from addiction, and the achievement of her most improbable dreams. Set mostly in the purgatory of San Francisco’s Tenderloin district, her story guides readers on an intimate journey through worlds of hippies, strippers, soldiers, urban transsexuals, prostitutes, addicts, jail, skid row and finally recovery. Ascending against all odds in her career, she is also a pioneering rock musician, a controversial journalist and a survivor of the worst pandemic of the 1980s. Told with the unflinching honesty of someone with nothing left to hide, the humor of a survivor who discovers silver linings in the darkest clouds, and the spirit of a rebel who refuses to be broken, Beatty’s is a tale of sublime pathos and the triumph of the human spirit. She proves you can’t keep a good woman down.",
