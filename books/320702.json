  "description": "Only one word can describe Chef Jameson Fury… SHAMELESS. He parades around with that sexy smirk and those fabulous abs like he’s the king of the kitchen. Of all the places he could choose to open his new restaurant, why does it have to be right next door to mine? It’s hard enough trying to get my place up and running without having him hovering around and disrupting my business. Not to mention the way my body betrays me every time he’s close. I should despise him. But with every prank, every act of sabotage we take against each other… The tension growing between us inches closer to personal and away from professional. Things are heating up, and not just in our kitchens… All because of this shameless chef.",
