  "description": "Violet has to face many trials during her mission to stop the apocalypse from wiping out mankind, but her personal life is almost as complicated. The rivalry between her and Candice Weller is increasing in intensity. She won’t be able to resist taking revenge on the girl who is trying to steal Zach away from her. Detective Reynolds seems to be the only cop in Manhattan who doesn’t have a vendetta against Violet. She has told him that a war is raging between angels and demons, but he won’t believe her until he sees the irrefutable proof for himself. The angels who started out as Violet’s allies are planning something and whatever it is isn’t going to be pleasant. Hagith and Orifiel are determined to bend her to their will and they don’t care about the cost that comes with their interference. The end result will strain Nathan’s trust in her and she might not be able to regain it again.",
