  "description": "Casey Wells is the daughter of the best baseball pitcher who ever played the “Wild” Billy Wells. When Billy dies, she is forced to reexamine his legacy and its effects on her own stalled life. She must face her family and acknowledge her regrets as she returns home for the funeral. Her childhood crush, Ben McDunnough, is attempting to hold onto his coaching job after Billy’s death. Twenty years before, a terrible injury cost Ben his major league career. Now he risks losing his last connection to the game he loves. While Ben and Casey rediscover dreams they have smothered for nearly twenty years, they find solace in their shared history. Using baseball as a metaphor for glory never quite attained, Casey’s Home delves into the moment when these two wounded people choose to greet the future with hope, even as they see the past with new clarity.",
