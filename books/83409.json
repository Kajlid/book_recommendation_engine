  "description": "The two #1-selling novels that have captivated millions are now available together in one volume. This Present Darkness takes place in the typical small town of Ashton where nothing much ever seems to happen. Until... a skeptical reporter and a prayerful pastor begin to compare notes. They suddenly find themselves fighting a hideous New Age plot to subjugate the townspeople, and eventually the entire human race. The battle against evil continues in Piercing the Darkness , where a young loner fleeing for her life while trying to recall her dark past takes refuge in the tiny farming community of Bacon's Corner. There she finds herself caught up in the middle of bizarre eventsâ€”from an attempted murder to a ruthless lawsuit against a struggling Christian school. Across a vast panorama of heart-stopping action, these stories are a penetrating portrayal of our world, a reflection of its spiritual wanderings, and a vivid reminder of the redemptive power of the Cross.",
