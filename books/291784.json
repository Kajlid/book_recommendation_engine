  "description": "An unanswered phone call. An empty bed. And a loud clock ticking down the seconds before Daniel Nieto’s heart—the one he recently discovered he still possessed—gets broken again. His lover is gone. Taken by an unknown enemy, one who hasn’t yet realized that Daniel would willingly stride into hell to get his Diablo back. The pain of losing another person he loved would bring any other man to his knees, but Daniel only accepts carpet burns from one special Greek. Too busy being in love, Stavros Konstantinou never even noticed the betrayal coming until it was too late. When the life he’s fought so hard to build is thrown into chaos, he finds himself scrambling to unmask his enemies. Now, with Daniel at his side, he’s out for revenge. The hunt is on. Bodies are piling up. And they’re sending out a warning. Before you even think to go up against us… Dig Your Grave.  This is book two in Daniel and Stavros’ love story. It is strongly advised that you read book one, Call the Coroner, first.",
