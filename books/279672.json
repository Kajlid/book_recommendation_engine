  "description": "From bestselling romance author Xavier Neal comes an all-new, rom-com sports romance featuring a gorgeous goalie who can block any shot — except Cupid's...    Once upon a time, the Vlasta Vipers hockey team was so incredible — on and off the ice — they were almost mythical.  Every other university wanted their team to be them.  Every chick who crossed their paths wanted to bang them.  Now?  Their clout on the ice is questionable.  Their competition cutthroat.  Their beds...  Well, there will always be puck bunnies ready to keep them warm. After all, no matter how well they do or don't do, they are the university's most important athletes.  However, when Remington Ronald Rutledge the 3rd, lands himself on the new head coach's bad side, which threatens his chances of playing for the season, he finds himself striking an unusual deal with a blast from his past he can barely remember.  Did she always wear these glasses?  Was her hair always this curly?  Has she always had a smile that makes him wanna smile?  What happens when the bad boy who makes all the rules is forced to play by someone else's?  Can this good-looking goalie let love score, or will blocking it be the biggest mistake of his life?",
