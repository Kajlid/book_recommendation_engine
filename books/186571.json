  "description": "There’s nothing like finding out you have breast cancer to make you take a second look at your life. Along with the diagnosis, Ariana finds a new reason to live when she meets tattoo artist Blaine Bennett. But Blaine’s reaction when she informs him of the pending double mastectomy isn’t what she expected. Can two people who so obviously belong together deal with the outside forces keeping them apart? Each book in the ‘Forever’ series focuses on a woman at a crossroads in her life. These romances contain no graphic sex, but instead focus on the woman’s story, and how her journey leads to love. Novella-length at between 32,00-40,000 words, they are complete stories, and may be read in any order. Enjoy!",
