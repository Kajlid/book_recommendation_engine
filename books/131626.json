  "description": "\"Coleman keeps the characters and the somber atmosphere but makes the book his own stylistically.\" BooklistPolice Chief Jesse Stone is back in this remarkable installment of the 'New York Times' bestselling series. It’s been a long time since Jesse left L.A., and still longer since the injury that ruined his chances of a MLB career. When Jesse is invited to a reunion of his old Triple-A baseball team at a hip New York city hotel, he is forced to grapple with memories and regrets over what might have been.Jesse left more behind him than unresolved feelings about the end of his baseball career. The darkly sensuous Kayla, his former girlfriend and current wife of an old teammate, is in New York too. As is Kayla’s friend, Dee, an otherworldly beauty with secrets of her own. But Jesse’s time at the reunion is cut short when, back in Paradise, a young woman is found murdered and her boyfriend, son of one of the town’s most prominent families, is missing.There seems to be a connection between the reunion and the crimes in Paradise. It could be coincidental but, as Jesse, Molly, and Suit hunt for the killer and for the missing son, it becomes more and more clear that one of Jesse’s old teammates may be intimately involved in the crimes. Deadly forces seem to be working below the surface. Sometimes, that’s where the danger comes from and where real evil lurks. Not out in the light—but in your blind spot.",
