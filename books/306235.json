  "description": "Once upon a time, in a little Texas town in the middle of nowhere, there lived a boy who everyone called ugly…When half your face is covered in a big, blotchy birthmark, you get used to the staring and the whispers. You get used to feeling unwanted.Until he walks into my bar…Tall, gorgeous, and all kinds of out of place. And the way he looks at me ain’t like no way I ever seen before.Does he mean it when he says he wants to take me away from here? Nobody’s ever wanted me around for long. Can I believe Barrett when he says that’s what he wants?Something about the word Daddy on my lips makes it all seem possible. Even if I don’t really believe anyone would want to keep an ugly boy like me forever…*** Pretty Boy is a low-ish angst, steamy, sweet Daddy story with NO age play.",
