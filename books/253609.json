  "description": "Regret can last a life time.  For Pandora, it’s lasted an eternity.  The gods offer her a chance at freedom for the first time since she opened her little box. All she has to do is collect three of the greatest sins of the world and she will be forgiven.  She didn’t expect the world to have changed so much without her.  She didn’t expect the sins to be three sinfully sexy men either.  She certainly didn’t expect it to be so hard to steal away their life.  But perhaps that is the price she has to pay for forgiveness.",
