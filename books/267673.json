  "description": "This is a story about life in the United States of America in the year 2100. Eighty percent of the population is being controlled by a corrupt government that dictates how people live their daily lives. The other 20 percent live in ghettos or hide underground in a thriving community where they still live a life based on the principles of our founding fathers. The government calls them the illegals, and it is constantly trying to capture them to reform them into what it deems normal citizens. The government has never been able to find the illegalsâ€™ caves. A romance develops when one day, an IT programmer finds herself in a life-and-death situation and is rescued by an illegal. That is the start of a conspiracy by people on both sides to change life in the United States back to what it had been before.",
