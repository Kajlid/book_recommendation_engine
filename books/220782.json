  "description": "Alison Conner is your average Minneapolis-based twenty something: she likes beer, indie bands, and wine nights with her best friend Linnea. Oh, and she’s a witch. But not, you know, a useful witch—she can cool the air with her mind, but only if there’s a ghost around. It’s not exactly a power they make movies about. She’s a party-trick-only witch, and that’s fine.Also fine? Linnea’s brother Erik. Which is a problem, because Linnea has made it clear she’s not okay with that. But when Erik is around, Alison can’t exactly help herself.",
