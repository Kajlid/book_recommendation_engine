Dancing was her dream and her destiny - until nature betrayed her body, destroying all hope that she could ever dance again . . . She had one last chance: The Starseed Foundation. As a volunteer, she trained for the ultimate step in human evolution - joining with a symbiotic lifeform that provided all food, water and air . . . that allowed humans to live in the vacuum of space . . . and could turn a mortal like Rain into a Stardancer beyond the laws of gravity.But every miracle has its price",
