  "description": "In the wonderfully erotic bestseller, Too Much Temptation, readers fell in love with two brothers -- dark, sexy Noah, and his roguish, younger brother, Ben -- as Noah followed his heart's desire. Now, acclaimed author Lori Foster returns to their world, this time exploring the sensual longings, secret wounds, and hidden needs of irresistible Ben Badwin, a man for whom there is never too much of a good thing...He Wanted Her CompletelyA confirmed bachelor, Ben Badwin has had his share of women, and he likes them as sexy, wild, and uninhibited as his desires. Nothing at all like the brash, dirt-covered, wholesomely cute woman who just strutted into his diner for a cold drink. But something about Sierra Murphy's independent attitude makes Ben fantasies run wild. He'd love nothing more than to dazzle her with his prized sensual skills...to make her want him as badly as he suddenly wants her...Sierra has her own plans -- and they don't include getting involved with a notorious Romeo. Fiercely independent, with her own landscaping business to run, she makes it perfectly clear that she doesn't need a man to help her, not even one as sinfully tempting as Ben. But the more Sierra keeps her distance, the more Ben wants her. And the more Ben wants her, the harder it is for Sierra to steer clear of his teasing touches and enticing eyes. To get him into her bed -- and out of her system -- Sierra makes him a proposition: she'll sleep with him, but for one night only. Now, it's up to Ben to turn one night of pure ecstasy into a lifetime of passion...",
