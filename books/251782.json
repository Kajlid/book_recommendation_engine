  "description": "When the semi-retired Chairman of the Grizzlies returns to town after a summer away, Rowansville’s newest resident sparks a fire in him that he hasn’t felt in years. She’s perfect for him, if only she would realize it. Flint I’ve done my time with the MC and this town. I step back, handing the Grizzlies over to Jasper and hit the road for a while. Coming home, I find one of my side-businesses has a new partner. One look at her and I want her as my partner, alright. Lifetime partner, that is. I’m old enough to enjoy the chase, it’s the wait that’s pissing me off. Bree I waited decades to find my husband then lost him too soon. I won’t go through that again, but a woman has needs. The only man around here who does it for me, wants a commitment. I think I can outrun Flint, it’s the skeleton in my closet that may catch me though. What’s that old saying, “If it’s not one thing, it’s another?” His skeletons come for me also… Insta-love, HEA, no cheating, panty melting sexiness. 18 and older only.",
