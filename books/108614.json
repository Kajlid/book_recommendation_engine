Desperate for help, she reluctantly turns to Jefferson Hicks, an ex-lawman who has fallen from grace-a man who unexpectetly awakens her to desire...and to dreams she believes she can never have. Jeff Hicks has fallen as low as a man can. But here at Allie's farm, his silent, numb heart suddenly begins to beat again.
