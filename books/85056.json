A rector?s daughter, in despair over being ruined and impoverished, allows herself to be sold at a slave auction for one week of sexual servitude to an aristocratic master with unorthodox tastes.... A woman with ancient ties to the castle is forced to confront her destiny?and a passion as consuming as it is forbidden.?Irresistible and deliciously dangerous, Bound in Moonlight propels you into a world of intoxicating sensuality you?ll want to return to again and again.",
