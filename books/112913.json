  "description": "With charm, humor, and deep understanding, Monica Sone tells what it was like to grow up Japanese American on Seattle's waterfront in the 1930s and to be subjected to \"relocation\" during World War II. Along with over one hundred thousand other persons of Japanese ancestry--most of whom were U.S. citizens--Sone and her family were uprooted from their home and imprisoned in a camp. Her unique and personal account is a true classic of Asian American literature.\"Monica Sone's account of life in the relocation camps is both fair and unsparing. It is also deeply touching, and occasionally hilarious.\" \"\"New York Herald Tribune\"\"The deepest impression that this unaffected, honest little story made on me was of smiling courage.\" \"-San Francisco Chronicle \"",
