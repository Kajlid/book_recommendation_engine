  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B01COCPKLKFive friends. Five stories. Welcome to the LOVER show. Let's begin with L:Have you ever tried not liking a guy when your best friends decide you should like him? How about if that guy had the sexiest ass on the planet, and was your birthday-cake one-night-stand with icing on top? London Reeves agrees that three years is a long time to live without sex, but one steamy hot night could never last longer than the morning after. Yet, her four lunatic best friends disagree on that last one. The voices in her head disagree, too, and even her mother seems to think she's crazy. And sexyass will not take a goddamn no for an answer. Now what exactly is a girl to do against that?",
