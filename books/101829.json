  "description": "Blinded and scarred in an accident a year ago, Teresa has finally found love, and a new career with the help of her companion dog, Red. Red appears to be a typical German shepherd, but he shares a mental communication link with his owner that is anything but ordinary. He’s articulate, sassy and opinionated - he’s also scary-smart, and has a talent for tracking. Teresa and Red, have partnered with David, and Bastian, to form Team Red. This unique Team helps the local police department sift through evidence to find forensic clues that only Red's sensitive nose, and Teresa's ability to ask the right questions can uncover. A twist of fate brings Team Red to the attention of the Military, and the Team gets ready for their first undercover mission (we can only divulge at this point that Red looks adorable in his tux).WARNING: This book is a Laugh-Out-Loud paranormal extra spicy romance (Yes, I’ve boldly meshed humor and sex *gasp!*). This Team Red book contains a feisty blind woman with a sassy attitude; a snarky German shepherd who stalks low flying objects (and the occasional cat); two sexy retired Navy men with a talent for tactical planning; a man-cave with secret tunnels and classified military toys; a formal invitation to a black and white ball; Marilyn Monroe; and a herd of Mustangs (okay, maybe ‘herd’ is a slight exaggeration). This book is INTENDED FOR MATURE ADULTS OVER 18. Sexual situations and adult language were used (and abused) in the making of this novel.",
