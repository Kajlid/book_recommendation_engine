The humachine citizens welcome the order provided by their ruler, the baleful Regent.  However, when one of their own rescues a human boy, Hector, from ravenous ferals on the Outside, their careful systems are turned upside down.  As Hector grows more and more human-strange, the citizens of the Pale grow uneasy.  What will happen when the Outside tries to get in?",
