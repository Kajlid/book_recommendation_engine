  "title": "Eclipse: The Girl Who Saved the World",
  "description": "Meet Eclipse.  She's twelve. She’s hardworking, bright, self-reliant, good with tools, vigorously physically fit, tough as nails, still young enough to disguise herself as a boy. She’s also a persona: She flies, reads minds, and is not afraid of necessary violence.  She had a bit of a problem with her mom. Her mom threw her out of the house. Then Mom blew up the house and disappeared.  Now she’s procured the Holy Namestone, the Key to Paradise. And everyone in the world will be happy to kill her to get their hands on it.  Meet Trisha.  She’s not quite a year older than Eclipse. She’s friendly, considerate, really good in school, athletic, does more than her share around the house. She’s also a persona. She has superspeed…an hour of housework in a minute. She flies, including from here to the next galaxy in an hour.  She also has a bit of a problem with her parents. They always treat her with complete contempt, totally grounded her, and won’t say why.  Her brother and sister are personas, too. Year-younger sister Janie is a budding world chess and go champion. She also reads minds, sees distant events, and can kill with a glance. Her twin brother Brian is incredibly good with tools, builds fantastic models from scratch, has a nearly unbreakable force field, and summons plasma beams that cut battleships in half.  Eclipse is Volume 1 of the This Shining Sea series. Volume 2, Airy Castles All Ablaze, will be a major rewrite of my much older novel This Shining Sea. There will be a Volume 3, Of Breaking Waves, because Eclipse still needs to save Spindrift from having died.",
