  "title": "Wrong Rooms : A Memoir",
  "description": "A beautifully written, moving and controversial memoir that examines just how high a price one can pay for love. In 1992 Mark Sanderson met the love of his life. A Lonely Hearts ad in TIME OUT may not have promised much, but a long and detailed letter from an Australian called Drew marked the beginning of a relationship Mark is still struggling to come to terms with. They moved in together in May 1993; in April 1994 Drew was diagnosed with skin cancer. He was told it would be a miracle if he were still alive in two years; three months later he was dead. WRONG ROOMS is their story -- a love story, a ghost story, a confession and a lament. Alternately heartbreaking and funny, the book is never less than searingly honest in the face of the most rigorous emotional trauma. In the process it forces us to consider our own values and actions, and how high a price we would pay for those we love.",
