Watch your back, witch.To find the killer, Charlie must fix her broken link to the dead.For Charlie, learning to read the signs from the dead is like learning to walk again, and harder than she ever imagined. But failure is not an option. Especially when she finds herself embroiled in a dangerous game of cat and mouse. The truth will out but it might just kill her to find it.",
