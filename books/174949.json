Discerning readers’ craving for emotionally and intellectually satisfying erotica will be fed by a spectrum of popular authors and new favorites as diverse as the smart, smutty stories they’ve written for this anthology. Sweet, kinky, romantic, magical, even heartbreaking, one thing they all have in common is a groundbreaking vision of what erotic writing can be.Featuring characters who are queer and straight, cis and trans, from mature couples celebrating fresh firsts to new adults playing familiar games, these stories reveal and revel in how people tick when it comes to sex, what they take to bed—their desires, hopes, dreams, and fears, their pasts, their passions, and their power—and what they bring away.A book of literary erotica celebrating sex as only these characters can have it.",
