The illustrations are colorful and bright and will definitely hold the attention of the little ones in your family. I absolutely loved the drawing of her in the hammock!Unfortunately for Polka-Dot, the other pigs were all afraid of her. For you see, she had spots of different colors all over her. Try as she might, the other pigs did not like her spots. Being afraid of her also meant that no one would play with her so Polka-Dot was sad, as well.As we know, sometimes a disaster in life pulls us together and this is exactly what happens in this cute book. Rain starts to fall and her poor silo cabin is taking the brunt of the storm. It turns out that Polka-Dot has the answer for the other pigs in distress. If I write anymore it would be a spoiler so will stop there.Suffice it to say, that all is end that ends well and finally Polka-Dot is the one that manages to get them all together.An excellent story for the little ones to learn one of life's many lessons.
