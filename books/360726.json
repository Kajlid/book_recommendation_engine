  "description": "Zane Winston is used to fielding women’s not-so-subtle advances. But he’s still shocked when an exotic gypsy whispers some very suggestive words in his ear—and surprised to find that he’s aroused by her words rather than amused. After all, she’s not exactly his type…But he soon discovers that Tamara Tremayne’s not really all that exotic. Her so-called psychic powers are (mostly) made up. Her waist-length black mane is a wig. And underneath the witchy makeup is a very stubborn, seductive woman—who may be in very serious danger…Tamara refuses to accept Zane’s help—but he’s still sure she’s the woman for him. She may not be supernatural. But she’s sassy. Sexy. And totally wild…",
