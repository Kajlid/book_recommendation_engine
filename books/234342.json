Now the streets of Bastion have nothing left for her, and the neighbouring country of Baron has more to answer for than just attacking her home. When King Forthis Mianne of Baron dies, Minerva sees an opportunity in an old story her mother told her - wishful thinking might just mean Minerva is heir to the throne. She sets out with her friends on a wing and a prayer - and finds herself pursued by others who have their own ideas about her suspicious lineage.A Queer Road Trip Modern-Inspired Fantasy Novella, first in the Under These Crowns - The Island series.DRM-free EPUB and PDF copies are available for free at https://www.jondarthur.work/crossing-...",
