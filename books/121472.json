  "description": "LARGE PRINT EDITION How do you handle a crazy jackass? Eddie knows. If you ask Eddie, he'll tell you pigs can fly and show you where to find real mammoth bones. Take his word for it when he tells you always to bet on the bear. These are things he learned while dreaming of becoming a cowboy in West Texas during the Depression. Through Eddie, the hero of \"Tales of a Texas Boy,\" we find that growing up is less about maturity and more about roping your dreams. Hold on tight. It's a bumpy ride. A wonderful read for anyone who enjoys books like \"Little House on the Prairie\" or \"Tom Sawyer.\" A great bit of nostalgia for seniors, too.",
