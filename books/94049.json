  "description": "George SÃ­ofra -- writer, detective, all-around charming and witty fellow -- is rocked to his socks when he meets Deborah Bolting-Macpherson, who is also witty and charming, and overwhelmingly beautiful and attractive. And, as George learns later, a witch. With a wand, even. Some bad people want to hurt Deborah. And a sociopathic, talented wizard really does hurt her. Also, there is the matter of The Globe, which George's genius friend, Sebastian, uses to transport George hundreds of miles in a second. Then strand him, in the desert. And the nasty cat that can burst into flame without hurting itself. Others, yes. Itself, no. A busy time for George, his boss, Richard Millan, and some other clever people in Palo Alto, California, city of green trees and ripe geniuses. Modern technology and ancient magic will have to learn to play well together, if disaster is to be averted.",
