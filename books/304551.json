  "title": "Linking Theory and Research on Vitamin E and Lung Cancer",
  "description": "Lung cancer is a worldwide public health problem that continues to be the leading cause of death in both males and females. While quitting smoking is a crucial component of a healthier lifestyle, other factors like diet and supplements may play a role in the onset of lung cancer. This research text aims to briefly trace the historical development of the theory connecting lung cancer risk and intakes of dietary and supplemental vitamin E. Reader-friendly and motivating, it identifies the variables that may confound the association of interest and proposes a theoretical model to guide specific research hypotheses and interventions on public health nutrition and lung cancer risk reduction. In conclusion, the author recommends that Integrated Behavior Model can be readily applied to look into the determinants of dietary modification and to investigate nutrition-related lung cancer prevention attitudes and beliefs.",
