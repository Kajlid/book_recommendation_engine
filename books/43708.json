  "description": "Quinn Robbins was prepared for her mother to be angry. After all, she'd disappeared for two days without warning; to visit the world on the other side of the Dusk Gate that nobody else knows exists.What she wasn't prepared for was seeing her mother calmly sitting there, waiting for her return, as if Megan Robbins somehow knew the secret, too.And she really wasn't prepared to have her mother not speaking to her, not sharing whatever she knows.Now, with her mother not talking, her best friend mad at her for disappearing, and her boyfriend, Zander, suspicious and confused, Quinn is left with only one person to turn to.William Rose had told Quinn she was making a mistake; that lying to her family and friends and risking everything to visit his family in a world where she didn't belong was only going to lead to heartache.But that was before - before she'd dropped everything to be there for him when he needed her. Before her strange dreams and her special brand of persistence had helped rescue his brother. Before the kiss that Quinn and William aren't talking about.And before he discovered that everything he ever thought he knew was wrong.Now, they're on the verge of discovering a secret about their pasts that may just change everything about their futures, and Quinn and William are both about to find themselves deciding between who they always thought they were, and who they're meant to be.And they just might be making some of those decisions together.",
