  "description": "Snowed in on Christmas Eve in her remote Maine cottage, Lisette Quentin was grateful for the peaceful and quiet break from her hectic life. It was just what she needed, but what she wanted was another matter. There was only thing on her Christmas wish list, a sexy hunk with a heart of gold who was crazy about her and knew how to satisfy her. Too much to hope for, she knew. But on Christmas, magic can happen and anything is possible. When Thane Saxton, who fills the job description to a tee, walks for miles through the drifting snow and shows up on her doorstep, wet and cold after a snowmobile accident, first Lisette gets him out of those wet clothes. And after the power goes out, he gives her what she wants and much more, more than she ever dreamed. Snowbound in Maine is an erotic Christmas romance about one man and one woman wrapped up in each other. This story has sexually explicit content.",
