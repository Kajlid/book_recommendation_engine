But Kir has been abused by the agency that wants him back and he-ll do anything to escape. \nFirst book in the Minders series.\n Josh Mackay-s job is to lure Kiran Brunner to a safe house. That part-s easy. The boy-Minder or no-is beautiful and surprisingly naive. Hunted by those who want to harm him, Kir doesn-t recognize Josh-s trap until it is almost too late. But Kir gets his hooks in Josh. When his job is done, Josh cannot walk away. Not only because of what Kir is, but because of why the agency wants Kir back. Josh wants above all to protect Kir. But Josh doesn-t know if that-s the right thing to do, or if he-s unknowingly succumbed to the Minder-s control. Warning, this title contains the violence and hot nekkid man-love.",
