  "description": "It was supposed to be a quick trip to the grocery store, but it turned into an Unspeakable Journey. On the eve of her thirtieth birthday, Isabella is abducted in the parking lot of her local grocery store. Hasam, a sinister human trafficker, arranges for her to marry his longtime friend and Saudi Arabian prince, Latif. Latif has everything--political prowess, success, and wealth--until he meets Isabella. She is beautiful, alluring, and all that he has dreamed of in a wife, and Isabella's defiant refusal makes her even more desirable. Far from home, in a land where women are oppressed, Isabella struggles with the loss of her husband and two daughters, imprisonment, and isolation. Will God rescue her from this nightmare? Will she give in to hopeless despair? Join author Rinda Hahn in this story of passion and obsession, faith and bravery, and find out what happens on an Unspeakable Journey.",
