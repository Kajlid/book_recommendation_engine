  "description": "Thirty-two and single, Presley wants to start over. She’s only going through the motions--just breathing, not living. It isn’t the life she’s always imagined.  She should be married, with a little house and a few children, maybe even a labrador to greet her after a long day of teaching third graders.  Treasurer for the Savage Beast MC, Silver lived life hard. At forty-five he’s seen and done it all--twice.  A single father in need of someone who could love him, and his boy. He’s given up on ever finding a woman who fit him--fit them.  Two people breathing. Two people wanting to be loved. One an outlaw. One an innocent. Two people who could not be more opposite, yet when their worlds collide, so does their chemistry.",
