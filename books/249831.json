  "description": "All of her life, Christabella Brimble has been close to her brother, Gabriel ( whom she calls Eli ) and they have practically been inseparable. Because they are two years apart in age, Eli has always been her protector. Their mother has always been distant in every conceivable way, by burying herself in her work as a lawyer, and leaving them to fend for themselves sometimes not coming home until well into the evening. Recently however, despite how close they once were, Christabella can't seem to get him to open up to her. He spends long periods where he doesn't talk to her at all, and even longer periods out of the house. All she wants is to understand why he is distancing himself, but the more she tries to pry it out of him the more he pulls away. Until one night she pushes him a little too far, and everything breaks. Will she lose her brother after all these years?",
