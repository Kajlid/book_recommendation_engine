  "description": "Wall Street Journal bestselling author Terri Osburn brings you the third installment in the Shooting Stars Series, featuring the dreamers and hopefuls who pass through the doors of the hottest new label in town, Shooting Stars Records. Jesse Gold is teetering on the edge. Her duet partner defected to go solo. Her long-term boyfriend is on tour and quite possibly partaking in extra-curricular activities with the opposite sex. And though she’s landed a deal with Shooting Stars Records, no producer in town is willing to take on the reputedly-difficult new artist. Enter Ash Shepherd—a successful songwriter coming off a career-topping collaboration with one of the biggest stars in town. Ash is anxious to shift from writing to producing and working with Jesse is the perfect opportunity. But after ten years apart, these high school sweethearts struggle not only to find common ground, but to deal with the powerful sparks reigniting between them. Can Ash and Jesse let go of the past and take a shot at a future that neither imagined? Or will they cling to old wounds and lose out on a love they might never find again?",
