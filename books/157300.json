So when the normally cheerful Toad despairs at the arrival of Mrs. Ffleshe, an impossibly rude houseguest who every year sets out to protect Toad from overindulgence, Mole must do something about it. But the plan he hatches with Ratty, Badger, and Otter goes horribly wrong. With the prospect of spending Christmas in jail, Mole will have to work hard if he is to salvage some Christmas spirit for his friends.The Willows at Christmas is the crowning achievement of William Horwood's enchanting sequels to Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows . The new story is set just after the original, but before Horwood's critically acclaimed The Willows in Winter . It will give pleasure to the countless readers around the world who have reveled in each new work. Merry Christmas!",
