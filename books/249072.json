  "description": "A book with real letters inside!The Jolly Postman has delivered the mail... What could possibly be in the letter from Goldilocks to the Three Bears? There is a message for the Wicked Witch... but who would write to her?Open this book, take out the letters, each from its own envelope, and you-ll discover what well-known fairy-tale characters have written to each other.As the postage stamp says, this is \"first class\" fun for children everywhere.Fifteen years ago, long before anyone else thought of tucking actual letters and notes inside a book, Little Brown published The Jolly Postman by Allan and Janet Ahlberg. This wonderful book gave children a chance to read letters sent from one fairy tale or Mother Goose character to another. Among the funny notes was one from Jack, who lolled on a sun-drenched island, thanking the Giant for the gold that let him afford such a nifty vacation. All this amusing correspondence was deftly illustrated and the book attracted hordes of eager readers.Edition MSRP: $12⁹⁵ (ISBN 0-316-02036-2)",
