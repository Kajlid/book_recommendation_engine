  "title": "Essential Tibetan Buddhism",
  "description": "An accessible introduction to this rich spiritual tradition through its own vibrant literature, much of it only recently available in the West. Here are teachings about the Buddha, subsequent Buddhas, and our Buddhist nature; prayer texts and meditation techniques; the stories of hermits and yogis; the lessons of ancient monks and modern nunsâ€”all centered around profoundly practical instructions for training the mind on the path to enlightenment. Clarifying but never simplifying the complexity of Tibetan Buddhism, this collection is the essential companion to anyone exploring the diamond path.",
