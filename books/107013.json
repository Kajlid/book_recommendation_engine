  "title": "To Forestall the Darkness: A Novel of Ancient Rome",
  "description": "The plague had depopulated Italy in the Sixth Century. Decades of war had destroyed it. Industry, agriculture, commerce and city life had stopped.The Romans cowered in fear under their Germanic overlords until the brutality they endured propels one of them to the shrine of his household gods.For hours he stands before the old, pre-Christian, forbidden gods, his arms raised in supplication, his head covered with the old-fashioned toga. It is stained with blood.Dozens of his household slaves gather to gawk at him just standing there. Hours pass. Finally he turns to state in measured voice, “It shall not stand.”One of his household asks him to clarify and he shouts, “Our subjugation shall not stand!”—To Forestall the Darkness is historical fiction. But while it teems with violence, mystery and betrayal, it is neither a romp through decadence, nor detective story nor a military saga. It is a serious novel of Ancient Rome like Steven Saylor’s Roman Blood, or Gary Jennings’s Raptor.Its setting is the twilight of Antiquity—the Sixth Century—when the traditions of Rome collided with the customs of the Germanic invaders. The Sixth Century was the pivotal century.Things could have gone either way and there was still a chance that the accumulated culture of the Roman people—the skills, the technologies, the optimistic world-view—would continue. Titus Tribonius tries to make it so.588 pages, 158,000 words. Third Edition, Nov 11, 2017",
