  "description": "He was my best friend. My first love. Tragedy tore us apart. Fate brought us back together.  My night in Vegas was supposed to be a way for me to unwind and be in the present, not to relive the mistakes of my past. I didn't expect to wake up in my former best friend and first love's bed, married.  He was a man I could never forget...and a man I promised myself I would never love again. This spur-of-the-moment, sham-of-a-wedding was a mistake. But he thinks it's forever, and he's determined to prove it to me.  I want to give in, but the secrets of the past still haunt me. I can't fall in love with him a second time. And he can never know why.",
