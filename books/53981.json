  "description": "The Moon of Innocence is a taut story of love, passion and death among the rural peasants of Catalonia in 1963. Generalissimo Francisco Franco, the last Fascist standing after World War II, was at the height of his power. Among his other acts of tyranny, he tried to abolish the Catalan language. It is against this backdrop that the young poet Cesar and Maria, the farm girl that he loves, try to find freedom in each other. Like The Sorrows of Young Werther or Romeo and Juliet, societal conventions pave the way for tragedy. The effects on romance of wheels powered by petroleum, the homogenization of culture, and desperation born of loneliness all play a part as this riveting and surprising story unfolds. A powerful tale of love, intrigue, and loss, The Moon of Innocence will stay with you long after you put it down.",
