  "description": "Arianna Dubray is nothing like the girl she left in Baltimore. Once a Prada shoe wearing, Michael Kors bag carrying, on top of the world seventeen-year-old girl, Arianna knew that her life would never be the same when she got out of the car in middle-of-nowhere Montana. Canyon Michaels is the keeper of his own dark secrets. Plagued by his family name, he's forced to prove the town wrong and make it on his own. The last thing Arianna needs is a reason to stay, but with every passing day the decision to leave becomes harder. Once their paths cross nothing can tear them apart, other than the secrets that start to surface and the nightmares that soon become their reality.",
