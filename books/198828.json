  "description": "Naughty cats, quirky family members, and experiences as a large gay woman in the heartland of Cheryl Peck has a potpourri of poignant -- and laugh-out-loud hilarious -- stories to tell about growing up, love, and loss.With self-deprecating humor and compassionate insight, she remembers the time she hit her baby sister in the head with a rock, how her father taught her to swim by throwing her into deep water, and the day when -- while weighing in at 300 pounds -- she became an inspirational goddess at her local gym.Filled with universal stories about a daughter's love for her parents and the eternal quest for finding meaning in it all, this book reveals many seemingly unremarkable moments that make up a life -- the weighty events that, like fat girls sitting on lawn chairs, just won't let go.",
