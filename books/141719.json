  "description": "A warm-spirited Christmas story about friendship and generosity, with a touch of adventure.Snowflakes like dandelion fluff floated in the air.Christmas carols rang through the streets, and thesleigh bells on Blue Bird's door chimed merrily aspeople went in and out.It's Christmas Eve day, and Mary, her young helper Hannah, and the bookmobile Blue Bird, won't let a little snow prevent them from making all the regular stops on their route. However, if the snow keeps falling, trusty Blue Bird may not be able to push through the drifts to Hannah's hard-to-reach home by nightfall. But with good books at hand and plenty of treats to tide them over, who's to say a bookmobile can't also make a cozy Christmas Eve haven in the snow?",
