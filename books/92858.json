  "description": "Kirra Hayward has many questions. What is the Estate? Will she be safe from Latham there? Will her code cracking skills be used for good or evil? Will she ever make it home? As she reluctantly joins the ranks of criminals, Kirra begins to realise the Estate isn't quite the place of refuge she hoped it would be. There's a bully to avoid, rumours of a second code cracker on the run, and the feeling that someone at the Estate wants Kirra gone. For good.",
