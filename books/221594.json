  "description": "Ten thousand years ago, two teenage lovers set out to save their clan. But what they didn't expect is to end up in the 21st century...Along with two loyal friends, Ty and Sita embark on a daring vision quest, searching a deadly prehistoric forest for a tribe to save their cave-dwelling clan. But when the blood of a beast and Sita's shamanic potions combine to scramble their psyches, the dark-skinned seekers find themselves thrust from their familiar cave-land world into the technology-driven modern-day city of Los Angeles.Darren, a young filmmaker shooting a carpet commercial on a mountaintop, mistakes the Stone Age kids for a rap group and brings them to his home, where the teens discover the wonders of Star Wars, pizza, sunglasses, and skateboarding. Ty's courage and Sita's shamanic wisdom eventually force the pompous filmmaker to face his destiny, and disbelief slowly becomes trust. Still, Ty must find a way to travel back ten millennia with a miracle that will save his starving clan. But how? Or will Sita's potions hurl them into another, unrecognizable, even malevolent future?The Sun Jumpers is a witty yet moving tale of teenage love, the power of friendship, and how bravery and a willing heart can save an entire people.\"Luber has constructed a lighthearted romp that's permeated by humor regarding adolescent antics, 20-something angst, and a wealth of inevitable culture-clash misunderstandings. But it also deals with some serious issues, including modern-day bigotry (the Kishoki are a dark-skinned people), the sometimes-troubled relationships between parents and offspring, and the need to find and follow one's own truth...\" -Kirkus Reviews",
