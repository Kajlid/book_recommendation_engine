  "description": "\"To be honest, my friends were getting on my nerves. Here I was, trying to get my mind off a woman, and they bring me to a lesbian bar where they talk about nothing but lesbians and sex. It was like they were forcing me to think about the one thing I didn't want to think about. As though I'd said, 'Look, the only thing I don't want to think about is hippopotamuses, ' and so to distract me, they took me to the zoo\". -- from the bookOkay, you're a lesbian. Now what? That's the question that newly-out Kentucky graduate student Jess Hamlin tries to answer in this charming and hilarious account of her southern days and nights. From making and losing acquaintances to finding and keeping real friends. Through bars and coffeehouses, school and work. Surviving family drama and ex-lover trauma. Dealing with well-intentioned matchmakers and dates from hell. Having crushes and getting crashed. Coping and, sometimes, not coping. Falling in lust and slowly, exquisitely surrendering to love. In other words, all the stuff that dreams and real lesbian lives are made of.",
