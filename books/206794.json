  "description": "'Of Blood and Ink' is a compilation of ten exciting, and diverse short stories of people and places bound together by the spills of destiny. The anthology speaks of the mind-numbing pathos of fictional characters who have drowned deep in the valleys of blood and ink. Each story in the book speaks of the journey of a life (or lives) in the most distinctly amazing ways possible. Each story is a short novel in itself. Each story is distinct, spell-bounding and page-turning in its own sweet way. And each story is connected to another by the integral obsessive elements - Blood and Ink. From Magical realism to cyber crime, the prolific writers of Write club, Hyderabad are set to entice you with their tales. All the authors of the book are bound to each other not just in the conundrum of friendship but also as a group that writes and says 'Let's write now, shall we?'. And this book is a clear demonstration of how simple things can turn into great accomplishments, if only creative minds can pair up together!",
