  "description": "She's the match, he's the fuse...an explosive combinationOne year ago Willow Gregory entered the Miss Firecracker contest on a dare-and ended up with the crown. As a working carpenter, she's not exactly the tears-and-tiara type, and after a year of walking the straight and narrow she's ready to cut loose. Waking up in a sexy stranger's bed with no memory of the havoc she wreaked the night before wasn't quite what she had in mind. Nor was agreeing to his mandate-work for him at the tavern until she repays the damage. Or go to jail.Blake West thinks he could possibly be the only man alive who could say no to a drunken, horny, naked beauty queen. There's something about the former Miss Firecracker that makes him want to blow his Mr. Nice Guy persona all to hell. It helps that Willow is ready to dive headfirst into a no-heartstrings-attached affair. Which fits in perfectly with Blake's temporary gig managing his friend's bar.Every grinding kiss, every stolen touch leads to another...until a harmless little white lie becomes the detonator that could explode their chances at a happily ever after.",
