  "description": "Samantha Rialto learned everything she knows about surveillance photography from Skipper Turnbuckle, a private eye with a bum reputation. Since last month’s job they haven’t spoken. But a bomb, a shooting and a voice-mail have her seeking the old investigator out…and wishing she hadn't.Samantha is on leave from her job as a music teacher and trying very hard not to let motivating, positive suggestions from her mother and best friend, Maxie, cheer her up. She hasn’t spoken to her almost boyfriend, Detective Ben Parker, in two weeks and the only good news she’s had is that January is finally over. But when her neighbor’s house is blown to bits, Sam is forced to bunk with Maxie. And when, later that night, a man is shot in Maxie’s front yard, and a disturbing voice-mail implicates Sam’s old mentor, the past dances its way into Sam’s present again. Ben and Sam, once again, find themselves in a race against time, facing off against a suspicious FBI agent and tracking down a host of possible suspects, including a high profile senator, an angry giant, and a scientist who may or may not be dead.",
