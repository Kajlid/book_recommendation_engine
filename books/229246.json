  "description": "Secrets … dirty ones.He was mine … there was a time … Or so I thought.Instead, I was simply his dirty little secret.He couldn’t, no wouldn’t risk telling his best friend – my brother – about us. So, I kept quiet. Blinded by love and bound by my own desires, I allowed it all.I didn’t tell a single soul about my time with Sawyer, not my brother, not my closest friends.Not then, and especially not now.How can I? My best friend is his ex-wife.The past is the past.I’m over him.I refuse to still love him.He will never own me again.I repeat the lies over and over again to myself every single day.Only, deep down, no matter how hard I try to deny it, I’ve always been his.I want more between us than a dirty little secret.**Standalone***",
