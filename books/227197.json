My rock. My second chance at forever.And he’s committed to annihilating the competition.The battle that ensues wrenches me back and forth between them.Fighting and fucking.Resisting and submitting.Together, they entangle me in a web of lies, rivalry, and desire that weaves as deeply as their devotion to me.I love two men, and if I can only have one, I choose none.The TANGLED LIES series must be read in order.One is a PromiseTwo is a LieThree is a War",
