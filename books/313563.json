  "description": "Nuclear fallout wrapped the planet in a blanket of soot, blocking the sun’s rays, wreaking havoc on the atmosphere.The planet was plunged into a deep chill that would last for years.Plants withered. Animals died.Famine exacted its toll on the human population.From the initial firestorm and the spread of smoke to the destruction of the Earth’s ecosystem.Nuclear winter took no prisoners.This is how the world ends. Not with a bang, but with many nuclear bombs detonated around the planet. It was no longer a topic of conversation around the dinner table as in years past. Nobody was prepared, including the world's governments. Yet the threat was always real and the devastation was predictable.The damage was incalcuable. Millions died at the points of impact. Nuclear Winter spread across the globe. A rapidly cooling climate shocked humanity and all living things ... to their death.Akart's new Nuclear Winter series depicts a world on the edge of nuclear Armageddon. Nuclear Armageddon became reality and ordinary Americans are paying the price.This is more than the story of nuclear conflict. It's about the devastating effects wrought by Nuclear Winter. Our possible future is seen through the eyes of the Albright family whose roots stretch back to the early settlement of the Florida Keys.While they fight for survival, they trek across a rapidly deteriorating landscape wrought with danger from both the elements and their fellow man.It was not our fight, but it became our problem.",
