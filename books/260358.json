  "description": "I’m Barbara Gold. Age: 70. Height: 5’5”. Eyes: blue. Hair: gray. Weight: none of your business. Specialties: Undercover surveillance, small arms, chemical weapons, Middle Eastern and Latin American politics. Current status: Retired widow and grandmother.\n  Ex-CIA agent Barbara Gold witnesses a woman being struck down by a car in broad daylight. It was no hit and run but plain, cold-blooded murder.  After some sleuthing, Barbara discovers the strangest fact yet about sleepy Cheerville, New England: there’s a nudist colony on the edge of town, and the victim was an active member. Barbara must go on the hardest mission of her career—bare her 70-year-old body for all to see—in order to solve another bizarre murder mystery.  Read the hilarious 4th book (30,000 words) in the Secret Agent Granny mystery series.",
