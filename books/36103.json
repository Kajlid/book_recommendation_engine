  "description": "After calling off her wedding, Coral Sinclair, a beautiful but naive young photographer, learns that she has also lost her father. Leaving the life she's known in England, she sails to Kenya to take ownership of her inheritance - Mpingo, the plantation that was her childhood home. On the voyage, Coral meets a charismatic stranger and their mystifying attraction shakes her to the core. When she encounters him again days later near Mpingo, she is warned that the man is not to be trusted. Rafe de Monfort, owner of a nightclub and the neighbouring plantation, is not only a notorious womanizer but also entangled with Coral's stepmother, which may have contributed to her father's death - or so the rumours go.\"",
