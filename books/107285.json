  "title": "A Roast on Sunday",
  "description": "When Jack Cartwright moves to the small town of Spring Lake he soon realises that there's something a little different about the town. Children swim in raincoats, old ladies play guitar while getting drunk in caves (and, on the odd occasion, skinny dip) and the most beautiful woman he's ever met pulls a shotgun on him at their first meeting. Maggie Tanner, the woman behind the trigger, finds Jack to be infuriatingly arrogant and obnoxious. So why can't she stop thinking about him? Jack on the other hand finds Maggie to be delightfully charming, if a touch stroppy. He sets about trying to charm her, with the help of her eccentric parents, Dot and Ray. Will he succeed? Will Maggieâ€™s daughter Willow ever find out the truth about her father? And will anyone ever lift the damn chair? Filled to the brim with characters you can't help but fall in love with, A Roast on Sunday is a story about the lengths families will go to in order to protect each other, and the healing power of love.",
