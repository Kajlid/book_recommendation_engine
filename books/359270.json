  "description": "In Pendragon: An Historical Novel, Douglas Carmichael gives us the story of Arthur, the warrior-king, during the first five years of his reign, as he brings the inchoate minor kingdoms of Britain under central rule from his seat at Camelot.... weaving the legendary and historical sources into a fresh telling that is at once mythic, romantic, and intensely realistic, Carmichael has given... a marvelous account of wizardry, of battles with their tactics, rush and stench, of love and love's betrayal, but above all a striking portrait of a hero-king who becomes increasingly human and increasingly legendary as the tale progresses.",
