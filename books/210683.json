  "description": "I know what it feels like to hate your body. I’ve cried over my reflection too many times to count. I’m tired of watching my self-esteem sink whenever the number on the scale starts to rise. I’ve spent the majority of my life battling my weight and it’s time for me to win this war!Developing a body that didn’t make me cry was the intention behind writing this story, although it blossomed into something greater than I ever imagined. Instead of figuring out how to create and maintain a body that resembles the flawless images I so desperately wanted to imitate, I taught myself how to love my existing body, flaws and all.This story dissects society’s views on what constitutes a beautiful body, as well as the pressures women face to look and behave a certain way. Too much emphasis is placed on our appearance rather than our attitude, abilities and accomplishments. Investigating my insecurities gave me a chance to separate my self-esteem from the scale and realize my true value in this world. I’ve never felt more confident and capable. I pray it does the same for you.",
