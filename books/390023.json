  "title": "Velvet Ball and The Broken Fairy",
  "description": "Velvet Ball can’t believe the kids at her new school call her a pixie just because she’s bald, and when Rory O’Leary pulls her hat off and calls her baldy in front of her classmates, Velvet’s had enough. She stamps on his foot and escapes into the forest.While picking wildflowers, Velvet stumbles upon a fairy caught in the bow of a tree. The fairy promises to grant Velvet a wish if she saves her and proclaims to be Roseberry — Fairy of Crabtree Forest. Velvet doesn’t believe in magic, but she rescues the so-called fairy anyway. And just like she thought, her wish of getting her hair back doesn’t work. Unable to explain why she has no magic, the fairy tries to fly away, but instead she crashes to the ground. Velvet feels sorry for the helpless little sprite and decides to hide her in her bedroom. But the fairy isn’t at all endearing—she’s rude, demanding, bad-mannered and spoilt, and she acts like a princess and expects to be waited on.Velvet figures Roseberry doesn’t know how to use her powers because she didn’t pay attention in Magic School. But Rosebery’s not interested in learning ‒ she prefers dancing around the bedroom and getting up to mischief. When the fairy goes too far, Velvet threatens to take her back to the woods, though she doesn’t mean it, and when Roseberry gets kidnapped by Rory O'Leary and his gang, Velvet has to find a way to save her before the bullies discover that she's a fairy and not a doll.",
