That's what it's like to be Logan, an utterly frank, slightly awkward, and extremely loveable outcast enmeshed in a mysterious psychological drama. This story allows readers to piece together the sequence of events that has changed his life and changed his perspective on what it means to be a good friend and what it means to be a good person.This is What I is a powerful read with clever touches, such as palindrome notes, strewn throughout the story and incorporated into the unique design of the book.",
