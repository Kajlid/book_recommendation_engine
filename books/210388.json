  "description": "In this chilling thriller from bestselling author R WK Clark, the raptor is coming to town—and it's like nothing you've ever seen.Sam and Kate brave the wilds of the Amazon on a quest, unaware they are being stalked by both man and bird.Could there be any better place to set a horror story than in the middle of the Amazon? Don’t miss this bizarre creature that defies the imagination in this gripping Science Fiction Fantasy.Author CommentaryOf all the books I have penned, ‘Blood Feather Awakens’ was fun for me to write. The bottom line is that it’s a killer. It lives on flesh and blood, and it gets pleasure from the hunt and chase. It is meant to confuse and terrify, which is precisely what I designed it for. To be honest, this was the most fun for me: Writing about presumptuous humans who are scrambling around out of their element, trying to get the best of nature’s perfect killing machine.I wanted to make the time in the jungle both horrifying, thanks to the evasive bird. Also romantic, due to the blossoming romance between the characters. I also wanted it to be bloody, because let’s face it: If a massive prehistoric bird were to attack, well, it would be nothing but bloody.I sincerely hope readers are as entertained by this story as I was by writing it. I tried to keep it light and simple without compromising fear or blood. I also wanted to tell a story that would keep the reader turning pages. I think that those who read this fun and frightening story will appreciate it in the end, for what I intended it to be.",
