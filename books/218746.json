She’s found her mate, along with family she had long thought dead, a place to call home. Everything is going well until Ornias comes to her in dream and kills Sarah. If she doesn’t leave the Cusasleon realm, he threatens to make her dream a reality, and then kill everyone she knows in the small town of Sanstone.   Mikal is hunting in the Human realm and Ambriel worries about what to do. Not wanting Sarah or her friends to meet certain death, she calls on her power of premonition and decides to quickly warn Sarah to leave town. Everything is going according to plan until Ornias shows up and drags her against her will to the Santiarn realm. She made a huge mistake!  Mikal has lost his mate, and it’s all his fault! He has no idea how to get Ambriel back from the Santiarn realm. It doesn’t help when the Elder Risya informs him that she only revealed part of the prophecy before, and all is as it should be. Ambriel is on a quest to find a key that will win the war. It’s a dangerous path that only Ambriel can take, for the key will only reveal itself to her.",
