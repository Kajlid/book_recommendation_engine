It is a further development from their other books, Through the Mists of Faerie, the Elven Way, and Liber Aelph and opens the adept elfin enchanter to new understandings of the Unfolding of Faerie and its magic into the world and our part, as elfin beings, in its expression. The Silver Elves illuminate this with a new way of understanding traditional lore and mythology, as well as modern stories of our faerie peoples.",
