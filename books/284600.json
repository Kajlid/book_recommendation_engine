  "description": "Making a second attempt at her senior year in high school, Raine Rassaby is now enrolled in St. Ursula’s Academy for Girls, where she has been made the special charge of guidance counselor Al Klepatar. But Raine, more concerned about the world’s problems than going to college, spends her time rescuing wounded birds, befriending street people, and organizing protest groups such as St. Ursula’s Girls Against the Atomic Bomb. And so Al finds himself balancing Raine on the one hand and his personal life on the other: he suspects his wife is in love with another man.  It is no surprise that Raine tries to charge her way into Al’s life, but it is surprising that he lets her in. Drawing on each other’s dreams and fears, these two lost souls form an unlikely friendship – one that will teach them things they never knew about themselves, the people they love, and the world around them.",
