  "description": "Lola is strong. She has always been strong, and always will be strong. On the outside, she seems like she has it all, and has it all together. But on the inside, she’s lonely, and she’s vulnerable. Lola has learned that people are never what they seem. She does not fear people, nor does she fear being hurt, but what she does fear is being weak. Those deeply buried feelings are brought to the surface when she falls for Drake Thomas.Drake is strong. He has always been strong and always will be strong. On the outside, he seems calm and in control. But what no one ever see’s is that on the inside, he’s afraid. The one thing Drake fears more than anything is himself. Because what is lurking just beneath the surface is a man just like his father. He’s spent his life keeping anyone who could mean anything to him at a distance, for their own good. But that all changes when Lola sneaks past his defenses.Together they make perfect sense and it seems fate has thrown them into each other’s lives to be together, but is that enough? Will they put aside their fears and embrace the love they have for each other? Or will the things they can’t control be too much for them to handle? Only the Universe knows.",
