  "description": "I crashed my shitty yellow VW Beetle into Calix’s Aston Martin. To be fair, he deserved it. But Calix and his friends, Barron and Raz, they don’t see it that way.  Not that it matters. They’ve bullied me for years, and I’ve never known why. At least today, they have something real to be pissed about. All of which would be fine, if today was a normal day. But it’s not. It’s far from normal. My mantra has always been: this too, shall pass.  But not today. Not the worst day of my life. Hot bullies, busted cars, and pain.  Somebody kill me now.",
