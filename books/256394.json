A sweet but boring love interest, a persistent, stuffy ex... and an intriguing, European coworker who might as well have red warning flags stamped all over him. It’s Minneapolis in the late ’90s. Recently graduated from art school and now out in the real world of roommates, rent, and career choices, Alex must juggle her increasingly confusing love life. Can she find her own way, or is she destined to remain 'Lost in Guyville?'",
