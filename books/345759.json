  "title": "The Brick Testament: Stories from the Book of Genesis",
  "description": "Two years ago, Brendan Powell Smith embarked on a crusade to illustrate the entire Bible - all 66 books of the Old and New Testament - using only Lego bricks. Here, for the first time in print, are the earliest fruits of his labors.With more than 175 photographs in all, The Brick Stories from the Book of Genesis features ten classic tales as you've never seen them Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's Ark, Sodom and Gomorrah, the Tower of Babel, and more. Every story is accompanied by original verses from scripture - and photographs of intricately detailed models composed out of thousands of Lego bricks. Whether you're a Christian fundamentalist, a devout atheist, or somewhere in between, you're bound to be dazzled by Smith's thoroughly original artistic vision.",
