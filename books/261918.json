  "description": "by JasonThis George A. Romero-esque zombie comedy is the middle installment of Jason's \"horror trilogy,\" begun with the Frankenstein monster love triangle of \"You Can't Get There From Here.\" Jason's elegant deadpan style somehow manages to make the gruesome gore and splatter effects almost... charming - and yes, it is a sweet love story at heart. If you read only one book in which a zombie devours a baby this year, read this one!",
