Dening details how to use and read the I Ching's hexagrams and gives insight on how to relate the ancient wisdom of the I Ching's hexagrams to the trials and tribulations of everyday modern life.The Everyday I Ching fills the long-standing need for a clear, focused rendering of the I Chingâ€•one which makes its timeless wisdom accessible to everyone.",
