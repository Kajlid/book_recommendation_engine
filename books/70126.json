His calm, controlled world was disrupted when he was suddenly thrown into a situation where a young woman's life was being threatened by attackers. He was programmed to empathise with humans and to intervene to keep them from harm, but he was also adaptive and constantly assimilating knowledge. How far should he go to save a person's life? He is surprised to find out how savage people can be.He tends to the injured young woman called Asiya and finds that, in his own way, his feelings for her grow the longer he is with her.

They intended to reprogramme him, but he is distracted en route.He flees from his pursuers who intend to destroy him and heads out with Asiya on an adventure which will take him to the icy surface of Callisto, the unruly bars of Vesta, the oppressive regime of the the mine on Hamalia run by the shadowy Starfire Corporation, and the prison world of Galtos.This is the debut novel from Stephen Sackleigh and runs to more than 60,000 words.",
