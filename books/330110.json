  "description": "When their darkest secrets are laid bare, can they work together or will they fall apart? Julien Doran is back home in California, reeling from the discovery that not only do werewolves exist, but also that Eli Smith, the elusive man he can’t get off his mind, is one. Neither man knows what comes next for them, but when Eli gets caught in a web of deadly thefts, Julien isn’t going to let him face the danger alone. It was only a matter of time before Eli’s past as a rebel wolf caught up with him, but he hardly imagined it would lead him to an Old Hollywood theater. Stumbling on a dead body while paying off one last debt wasn’t part of the plan, but if he’s going to have any chance of a future—with or without Julien—he needs to track down the killer. Together, the two dive into the world of horror movies, mediums, and monster hunters to find out exactly what secrets someone is willing to kill for. But when the line between on-screen and off begins to blur, Julien and Eli don’t have the luxury of dancing around each other anymore. Not if they want to avoid being the next victims.",
