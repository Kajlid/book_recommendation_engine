  "description": "They marked time by the moon and counted nights, not days. They measured their history in \"ages\" of thirty years, passing on all knowledge and lore by recitation. A mysterious and passionate people, the Celts in first-century Britain fought and loved with equal intensity, governed in their conduct by a stern code of honor and a fierce loyalty to their mother tribes and to their island world, Albion. Women accompanied men into battle, fought and hunted as warriors, and together observed the sacrificial rituals performed by the mystical Druidsâ€”the revered astronomers, diviners and priests.",
