  "description": "Here at last -- the perfect book for the hot(-ish) season. With his customary wit, charm and invention, Alex Quick walks the reader through 102 summery activities, ranging from the simple (Make a Sand Sculpture) to the more challenging (Build a Tree House); from the familiar (Go Cockling) to the exotic (Hold a Luau). Quick's lively style makes this book a joy to read as well as a brilliant source of ideas -- and it's gorgeously illustrated too.",
