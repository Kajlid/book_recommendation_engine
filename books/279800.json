  "description": "It has been eight long years since that explosion ended my military career, leaving me with scars and night terrors I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Taking over as head P.I at Conroy investigations after my father's untimely death has given me back purpose and pulled me out of the black hole I had sunk into. No infiltrating enemy lines, no more hearing the roar of machine guns. just cheating spouses and the occasional theft. A cell and a laptop as my weapons of choice. Life had become monotonous. Then she approached me looking for answers. Isla Sussex, five foot five of heaven, I see a similar pain reflected in her eyes, I am drawn to her. For the first time in my life I want something more and it scares me more than death. But, she needs my help, to find her missing fianc√©. Things aren't always as they seem I have a feeling neither of us are coming out of this unscathed.",
