  "title": "On Black Rock: Family, Passion, and West Virginia's Black Gold",
  "description": "As the Civil War ends and heroes are sent home, boys-turned-men like Buck Elsworth find themselves adrift and searching for solid ground. After those nightmarish years fighting Rebs, and a few more spent wandering the country, industry and coal are the buzz words Buck brings back home to family and friends in West Virginia. And, for a while, those buzz words make his small town sizzle. Sometimes money and hard work can buy happiness. But when the fanfare surrounding his return fades and old habits, temptations, and familiar faces rear their ugly heads, it looks like hopes and holes in the earth might not be enough for country-bred troublemakers and dreamers like Buck. Packing and selling coal out of his mine attracts unwanted attention, and before long Buck has railroad barons, bankers, outlaws, and everyone in between wanting a piece of his American dream.",
