  "description": "Who Was Johnny Cash? Rock star? Country boy? Folk hero? Preacher? Poet? Drug addict? Rebel? Sinner? Saint? In truth, the Man in Black lived long enough and hard enough to embody all of the above-and much, much more. He was a musical legend, a one-of-a-kind communicator, an American icon-but you could never pigeonhole him or pin him down. You never completely knew him...or what he was going to do next. Cash's faith in God was no different: \"I'm still a Christian, as I have been all my life,\" he once said. \"Beyond that I get complicated.\" Cash's faith wasn't smooth, slick, or sweet-it was grizzled, challenged, broken, and messy. Worlds away from perfect. But it was transparent ... and real. Always real. The Man Comes Around: The Spiritual Journey of Johnny Cash explores with vivid, narrative detail the wild ups and downs, the highs and lows, the ebbs and flows, that took place within this man's soul-from beginning to end. It's his spiritual chronicle. His sacred story-yet one that no doubt describes, in one way or another, where we've all been...and perhaps where we're all going. Foreword by Dan Haseltine, Lead Singer for Jars of Clay",
