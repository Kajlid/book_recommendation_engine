  "description": "As far as cops go, Trooper Fletcher Colson is one of the best. He looks after a community of about a hundred people, all living off the grid about ninety miles north of Fairbanks Alaska. The MC Exiles nicknamed him Troop while he was prospecting a few years ago. Unfortunately he doesn’t get to spend as much time with the club as he’d like due to his mailing address and profession. Then comes along a lost little brunette with a fake name and big sad eyes. She’s stranded on his mountain with nothing but the clothes on her back. Evidently she didn’t read up on the new law before trying to claim a homestead left to her by her birth mother. A storm is rolling in and now they’re stuck together for some seriously long winter months that will drag on slower than dirt, and be darker than the deepest well more than not. When it’s not dark and cold, it’s blinding white. The last Frontier is not for the meek. Jasmine Milford has had it up to here with the snow, and with her Ice King of Hate. The only good thing about this man is his K-9 partner Arrow, and his knowledge of the area that saves lives all year round. Otherwise he’s full of as much hate, as she is sadness. When Jasmine’s past catches up with her Trooper Colson is forced to ask his brothers and sisters of Exiles Arizona to help them out. Sometimes it takes a rallying of the unseen kind to help brothers and sisters in need.",
