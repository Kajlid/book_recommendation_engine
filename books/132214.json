  "description": "“We hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable; that all men are created equal and independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent and inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Thomas Jefferson turned over in his sleep. That document – they tore what I wrote apart. I must talk to Ben Franklin and John Adams. They have to persuade the Continental Congress to restore my original wording before the delegates sign it. And so the saga begins. The “Declaration of Independence” series brings to life the crafting and signing of the World famous document as told through the eyes of Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, and Francis Lewis. Best- Selling author Murray Pura also includes recipes for Corn Bread and Colonial Braised Rabbit with “Volume 1 – Thomas Jefferson”. Fast Fact- There is something written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. There is a simple message, written upside-down across the bottom of the signed document: “Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776.” No one knows who exactly wrote this or when, but during the Revolutionary War years the parchment was frequently rolled up for transport. It’s thought that the text was added as a label.",
