  "description": "In a volume that spans several eras of Crossed infection, we join three prolific writers each telling a tale set in the horrifying misery of the world during the plague. Series creator GARTH ENNIS returns to tell a story so big that it re-defines the way you will see the Crossed. In 'The Fatal Englishman' the last military unit in Britain faces the biggest question of them all - when do you risk eliminating all life to stop the Crossed! SIMON SPURRIER puts us in the mind of a unique Crossed relationship, one which sees lovers from two different worlds as they are driven apart by infection. DAVID LAPHAM continues fan-favorite Crossed Psychopath survivor, Amanda's tale as she fights with the rising insanity in her own mind and a group of lunatic scavengers in 'The Livers.' Go where other horror survival stories fear to tread and enter the grueling world of the Crossed! This volume collects issues #19-28 of the Crossed Badlands series.",
