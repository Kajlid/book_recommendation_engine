  "description": "There was a time when a breadmaker was a newfangled gadget - certainly not to be trusted. But we've come a long way since then! The Now You're Cookin' Bread Machine cookbook contains a selection of recipes for the innovative baker with a lot of taste, not much time and a standard breadmaking machine. From blueberry and buttermilk loaves to calzone, from the most basic dinner roll or simple white bread to a rich panettone, we offer the enterprising baker the opportunity to concoct baked goods fit for a king in his own home, with the help of a machine. Maybe some people prefer the fantasy of traditional, hand-kneaded breads, but the scrumptious savarin cake and hearty sourdough bread are definitely nothing to sneeze at!",
