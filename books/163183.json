  "title": "Sin City Assassin",
  "description": "A desperate need for a well-earned vacation, and wedding bells, have drawn Bill Dix and his partner, Steve Petersen, to Las Vegas aka “Sin City.” Their last two vacations were nightmares, and were more work than their daily jobs as narcotics officers for the Miami Dade Police Department. Their careers have survived, even flourished, but the stress is getting to both of them and it’s time to unwind.On their way to meet their wives, Dix and Petersen get caught up in a fire-fight in broad daylight in old town Las Vegas. One of them is seriously injured and it forces the other to do things he normally wouldn’t do, testing his character, and pulling him in a direction that even scares him. After a day or two of investigating the shooting, Dix learns an assassin, hired by an unknown criminal who’s clearly a psychopath, is hunting he and Petersen, as well as others, and she’s relentless. The local law enforcement community refers to her as “The Praying Mantis,” because she kills targets after she sleeps with them.This third novel in the Bill Dix Vacation series pushes the boundaries of friendship, what it means to wear a badge, and is rough and gritty- everything you’ve come to expect in a Bill Dix novel. And you know he wouldn’t have it any other way. Who survives this one? And more importantly, can the man playing the Praying Mantis like a fiddle survive long enough to get what he really wants…Bill Dix’s head on a platter.",
