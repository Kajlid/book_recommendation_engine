  "title": "The Poison Tree",
  "description": "In the wake of a failed marriage and a misguided love affair, feisty academic Terry Williams moves from London to Oxford to resume her abandoned doctorate in detective fiction.  But her visions of a peaceful life in a sleepy university town are shattered when she discovers that her new home was once the scene of a savage sexual murder, the horrific consequences of which continue to resound in the present.Soom Terry begins to uncover, hidden beneath the staid academic facade, dark secrets that suggest a mystery more brutal and elusive than any she has come across in her studies.And while the pieces slowly fall into place, a vicious killer walks the streets of Oxford protected by the night, bent on exacting bloody revenge for a crime of passion.Elegant yet chilling, assured yet profoundly disturbing, The Poison Tree is a breathtaking debut from a fresh new voice in suspense fiction.",
