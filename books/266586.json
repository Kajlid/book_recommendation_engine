  "description": "Love and jealousy in a time of war. A war that traverses cosmic epochs and decants people into soldiers, like new wine decanted into old skins. Skins that split and merge and bleed souls together until no one can tell where you end and another begins. You can't tell your own mind from the minds around you. Your enemy is your friend is your lover is yourself. Insinuate. Insincere. insouciance. Then there's the machines - ancient by now - AI with religion, artificial constructs that have almost lived forever. You need to factor their unfathomable plans into every scheme. They love you. They hate you. They're jealous of you. It's a time of war.No one’s heard from Genaro since Finley negotiated a tenuous truce 2,000 years ago. But the circumstances that facilitate contact are realigning and Genaro’s already dispatched an infiltration force to complete work on TheBrainForest. Coy, a junior infiltrator, is faced with the challenge of surviving behind enemy lines. Initially he’s relieved to team up with Nairi, a friend and superior, but suspicion and paranoia grow when Nairi develops strong feelings for an Earth boy. Coy 's ill-equipped for the nuanced heroism demanded by Nairi, but under some duress – he agrees to help her smuggle refugees to safety, away from the conflict zone. This is a short-term strategy, that relies more on hiding than on defending their sanctuary. There is no long-term plan for avoiding god’s wrath.",
