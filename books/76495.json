  "description": "No longer ahead of its time, Thinking and Destiny perhaps the most complete book on the whole man ever written in the English language - is a fresh, new approach, shedding a brilliant light on the deep questions that have even plagued humanity. It gives ‘vital information’ not made available until now. The reading of this magnificent work may well be the most exciting and rewarding experience of your life - a peace and joy in knowing, a feeling of harmony, security, love, non-aloneness; it puts the spotlight on many problems and mysteries otherwise inexplicable. By using this system to train yourself how to feel, what to desire and how to think - and so learning what to do and what not to do - your level of conscious awareness will be raised, and your body will be improved at the same time. Health and possessions will come, as well as progress in your ability to cope with yourself, others, the world. One who practices this system need not depend on any other person, and there is no limit to what one may attain! Here is your personal guide for the New Age, with its unparalleled challenges and opportunities. You will finally understand that, by your own thinking, you have made your destiny up to the present. You will learn how, by new thinking, you have the power to change your future; but more, you will help change the destiny of the world! The urgent need for change is now, and it begins with you. Never before has there been such a pearl of great price, such a treasure of pure wisdom available for such a modest, one-time investment. Take advantage of the opportunity. You owe it to your self.",
