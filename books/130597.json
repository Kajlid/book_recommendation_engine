  "description": "Gaius Artorius, ex-centurion and Roman slave trader, a venalicius, prepares to make an expedition to the Kingdom of Armenia at the very eastern extreme of the Roman Empire, where he would acquire more of the finest quality sex-slaves that were his stock-in-trade.But before he can depart from Rome, a powerful Senator \"requests\" that Gaius do him a favour. There is a gift for the Emperor Vespasian waiting in Armenia, and the Senator wants Gaius to collect it and bring it safely back to Rome.Such an important shipment would not normally be entrusted to a mere venalicius, and Gaius knows that something very dangerous lies behind the innocent request, but he cannot refuse.Soon Gaius and his faithful followers are up to their necks in gorgeous slaves and a deadly secret that would make them a target for bandits, enemy armies and even Rome itself.",
