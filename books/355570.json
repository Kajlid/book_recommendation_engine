  "description": "It was a 'routine' mission for the special ops squads that went terribly wrong. From the moment the parasites invaded them, they began to change into something frightening, fierce, and virtually unstoppable. The men knew they had only two options when they learned the order to terminate had come down from high command-stay and die, or run. Taking Sylvie wasn't part of the plan. They wanted her boat. Unfortunately, ditching her wasn't an option. And yet the last thing they needed was the complication of a woman to slow them down, give away their position, and distract them into thinking with their dicks when they were already having a hard enough time taming the beast within them. Rating: carnal/erotica-graphic violence and sexual encounters, multiple sexual partners, orgy-type situation.",
