  "description": "A * The following conversation took place after the book was written, after the editing was done, and all that was left was finalizing details of the format. So Greg, what made you decide you wanted to write a book? Well I sarcastically said let's write a book. What! I thought you were being serious! I was, but then this started to take too long. Iâ€™m not exactly a patient person. When did we start this? Three years ago? No, it was two. Are you sure? I thought it was three. I'm positive it was two. GM looks doubtful, but lets it go. \"I don't yell at people. I just shatter them emotionally and make them cry.\" Meet Tony Calamari. Freshman year at Mallard High does not begin well. For one thing, too many adults are telling him what to do, and there are too many annoying kids he has to spend four more years with. Like the last nine years weren't bad enough (yes, he's counting kindergarten). If only he could ignore as many people as possible, but no one will let him. Which is just typical.",
