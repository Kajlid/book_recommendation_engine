On the first night of moving into his new home with his lover, Angel, the men couldn’t be more in love. Until a chance discovery puts a damper on their bliss. In the middle of the night, Angel opens a drawer, intent on waking his lover with pleasure. What he finds instead throws his faith in Gabe off track and threatens the new life they’d hoped to create.Previously published as a free read on the author’s website. No new content has been added.Please note: The events in Always a Sinner take place after Angel appears in the Poconos and before the epilogue of Love the Sinner. As such, Always A Sinner is NOT a standalone. It is strongly advised that you read LTS first. You will be lost otherwise. Contains scenes of violence, some angst, and as always, more heat than you can handle. HEA guaranteed.",
