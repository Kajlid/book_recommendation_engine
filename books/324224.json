I never had to be patient with women or work on any kind of relationship. It was simply crazy sex and fun.Then, ﻿of all the women in all the world I had to fall for her. I couldn’t get her out of my mind or my heart. Many nights were spent dreaming of all the pleasurable things I could do to her if she were in my bed. Days were spent trying to get her to look at me as a man, not just a friend or even worse a brother.One birthday wish made her mine. Our future together finally looked bright.Little did I know life would soon spiral us toward a non-stop collision course. Betrayals, unleashed family secrets, and ultimatums are forcing me to choose between love or expected loyalties. I want to decide my own future. Yet Fate seems to want to have the final decision.",
