  "description": "Werewolves exist. Shocking, I know, but not as shocking as the way I want to jump the super hot wolfman that walks in to my office.Tall, Dark, and Furry has got a problem with authority. He's also batshit crazy. Pity, because nutjobs automatically make my do-not-date list.On that same list is Anthony, the too-hot-for-his-suits district attorney. Instead of dismantling my cases, why can't he destroy my bra?As if having the virile attention of a werewolf and a panty-creaming lawyer isn't enough, something is killing people. Witches, to be more exact. Rumor says it's a demon.I might need a bigger cross - and a king sized bed.Warning: This story has received a new look and title. Formerly known as Two's a Couple, Three's the Law. This story contains adult subject matter, menage situations and language that is not suitable for all audiences. Reader discretion is advised.",
