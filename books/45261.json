  "description": "Steven Erikson returns to the Malazan world with the first book in a dark and revelatory new epic fantasy that tells the tragic story of ruin of a realm. This is the story of the early years of Anomander Rake, and his brothers, Andarist and Silchas Ruin. It is a tale that begins within the Age of Darkness and the Birth of Light and involves the forging of a sword unlike any other, and tells of the tragedy that was the collapse of the realm of the Tiste Andii. It is the story of the devastating civil war that tore their world apart -- a story of bitter family rivalries, of jealousies and betrayals, of wild magic and unfettered power, of death and terriifying destruction. It is the story of a how the goddess of the Tiste, Mother Dark, abandoned her children and turned her back on her people.",
