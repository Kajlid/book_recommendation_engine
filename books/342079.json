  "title": "New Free Life",
  "description": "In a world of lost ways it is often difficult to find understanding. With all types of religions and philosophies saying the same thing in different ways, choosing a faith to believe in and follow can be as confusing as being lost. Being lost would lead me on the search for understanding, which would in turn lead to the discovery of personal belief and faith outside of self. \"New Free Life\" is the story of my path thru confusion to simple understanding. I was born and raised as an American boy whose dream of becoming a professional football player came true. As that dream became reality, I woke up to the reality that our world remained lost deeply in confusion and by using my life to play a game I would not be doing a thing to help free understanding. Now, my new dream is to share in the way of spiritual awakening to understand purpose, faith and belief.",
