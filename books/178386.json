  "description": "18+ for explicit language, violence, drug use, and sexual situations. Book 1 in a series. **NOT A STANDALONE** **Raven**The last thing I want is to get tangled in my sister’s way of life. We share blood but we couldn't be more different. I'm into books, art, and music while she's a stripper and motorcycle club whore. I've vowed to stay as far away from that life as I can, but Gage, the club's sexy President has set his sights on me. From our very first meeting he made his intention clear – he wants me in his bed. Well, he put it a little more crudely. He’s a foul-mouthed, arrogant, domineering, infuriating biker who just wants to use my body but I can’t help my attraction to him. Even if I wanted to give in to him, I can’t. He's off limits. No matter how much I want him, I can never have him. He's forbidden.**Gage**I'm the President of the Death Dealers MC. My road name is Reaper. Wanna guess how I got it? Yeah, no one messes with me. I live for my club, my family, and getting chicks. I don’t do relationships. Women throw themselves at me, and if they're lucky, I'll give them a couple orgasms and a life-long memory. It’s easy. That is, until I met Raven. I wanted her the moment I saw her but I can’t have her – at least not yet. She’s different from the women I’m used to and I’m caught between wanting her and not wanting to corrupt her. I should stay away from her but how can I? They say forbidden fruit is the sweetest and I’m dying for a taste.",
