  "description": "Come home for Christmas in Darling, VT…and the magic of the holiday season!  Hannah Gallagher is a woman who knows how to get things done – and the annual literacy benefit is no exception. There’s just one problem: her headlining author has canclled. Where can she find a celebrity to fill in, this close to Christmas? It’s just her luck that her brother’s best friend and hockey superstar, Cam Collier, is in town for the holidays. It doesn’t take long for Hannah to imagine him reading to kids at the local library – and all that money pouring in.  Sidelined with his second concussion, Cam takes the opportunity to spend Christmas with his family. He’s barely in town twenty-four hours when Hannah Gallagher hits him up to do a charity event, and Cam knows he must decline. Of course Hannah doesn’t understand his reasons…because he’s holding onto a secret that he’s never shared with anyone. He’ll make it up to her, though, by donating an amazing item for the silent auction. And the fact that he gets to spend time with his best friend’s hot older sister is a definite perk.  Things are heating up between them, and it looks like this is destined to be a sizzling holiday fling. Especially as Cam’s health is improving and he’s counting the days until he can rejoin his team. But then feelings get in the way…and fears, too. Can they move past their insecurities to change this Christmas to remember to a Christmas that lasts forever?",
