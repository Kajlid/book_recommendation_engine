  "description": "Perfectly preserved in black peat, the Man in the Moss is one of the most fascinating finds of the century. But for the isolated community of Bridelow, his removal is a sinister signâ€”a danger to the ancient spiritual tradition. In the weeks approaching the Celtic feast of the dead, tragedy strikes again and again in Bridelow. And, as zealots challenge an older, gentler faith, the village faces a natural disaster unknown since the reign of Henry VII.",
