  "description": "Sairu is dainty, delicate, demure . . . and deadly. As one of the emperor’s Golden Daughters, her skills have been honed to knife-like sharpness in readiness for her eventual sale to some faceless bridegroom, whom she will serve and protect for the rest of her life.  But when the priests of Hulan seek special protection for one of their sacred Dream Walkers, Sairu eagerly forgoes marriage and takes on this unique role instead. Rather than a bride, she becomes a handmaiden to the mysterious and powerful Lady Hariawan, guarding her through a long journey across the empire to safety and seclusion in a remote mountain temple.  Little does Sairu guess the dangers stalking Lady Hariawan’s footsteps—shadows crouching at every corner, demons haunting beyond the edge of dreams. For the Dragon has seen the power of this Dream Walker . . . and he has plans for her.",
