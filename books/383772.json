Yet Dela has danced through the echo of his soul and knows this warrior will obey her every command.Hari has been used and abused for millennia. But he sees, upon his release from the riddle box, that this new mistress is different. There is a hidden power in Dela's eyes- and with her, he may regain all that was lost to him.
