  "title": "Outcast",
  "description": "This debut into the coming of age fantasy genre has made a definite splash. A wondrous mixture of the childlike main character and mature themes to quote one five star reviewer. Alador, a young man who cannot find a way to fit into the world about him, finds himself thrust into the limelight. With a brand new world, new customs and of course dragons, Outcast offers something for both epic fantasy and coming of age readers. Alador wants nothing more then to fit into the world that rejects him due to his mixed heritage. He does not fit into the world of his mother and he can't seem to bring to life the power of his father. And then of course, there is a girl. Renamaum, a great blue dragon, wants to restore the pact between man and dragon that time and greed have erased. He petitions the council to find one who will fight for the future of both dragon and mortal. Both come crashing together when Alador is caught in a geas so strong that neither could abandon it, even in death.",
