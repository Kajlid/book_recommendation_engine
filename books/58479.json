  "title": "Conversations With My Old Dog: For Anyone Who Has Ever Loved and Lost a Pet",
  "description": "A collection of poems as comforting as an old friend. \"Do you ever talk to your dogs? I confess. I do.\" Thus Robert Pasick welcomes you to listen in on his soulful chats with his devoted Yellow Lab, Lucy. Their \"conversations\" explore the stuff of everyday life - worry, forgiveness, friendship, loss, and old age - with the clarity and candor that accompany long walks in the woods with a trusted companion. Pasick's poems have a natural familiarity and ease, from the whimsical,\" What Breed is God?\" to the sentimental, \"Boys and Dogs,\" and the tender, \"Till We Meet Again.\" Celebrate life's joys, sorrows and wonders. Black and white photos and illustrations of \"faithful friends\" add to the warmth and gentle spirit of Conversations with My Old Dog .",
