  "description": "Sometimes love happens when you least expect it. With the right person it can also help you heal.It has been a year since Allen lost Adrian, his partner of twenty years, to Mesothelioma. Adrian had been his best friend in school growing up and then became the love of his life late in high school. Even with the encouragement of friends and family Allen has been unable to move forward, and only by a chance act of kindness does his life take a turn for the better. Steven is an introverted young man, fraught with low self-esteem courtesy of parents who never failed to remind him that he had been a “mistake” and had ruined their lives. His life changes dramatically when an act of kindness, offered by one whom he has admired from a distance, leads him to a world of self-discovery and growth he never imagined possible. Can one person damaged by loss, and another damaged by abuse and neglect learn to accept change and open themselves up to a new beginning? Join Allen and Steven as they embark upon a journey of discovery that leads to growth as individuals, and new opportunities for happiness while still honoring the past.",
