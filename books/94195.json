  "description": "A hardcore gangbang of epic proportions — not for the faint of heartKaterina Wells’ sensitivity about her size has left her isolated and angry. A sympathetic woman whispers to her about a secret men’s club that values BBW’s, arousing Katerina’s curiosity.The woman warns Katerina that if she seeks love, she’d best search elsewhere. But if Katerina just craves sex, the club’s members can indulge her.Foolishly believing she has nothing to lose, Katerina makes first contact. The very next evening, she meets the Inquisitor and his band of horny men.The Inquisitor tells her, “This isn’t a BDSM club. There are no safe words, no guarantees or protections of any kind, except for one. We promise to do our best not to permanently damage you, such as lasting scars, or broken bones, broken skin, that sort of thing. We like to keep our toys in good working order. Other than that, anything goes. And I do mean anything.”“We at the FMC,” he said, “don’t care about your feelings, your emotions, if you’re fulfilled or not. We don’t care if you don’t like being called nasty names, or if something hurts, or if we make you cry. We don’t care if you hate us or think we’re cruel. There’s only one thing we care about in regards to your person, and that’s your body, how we can use it to pleasure ourselves.”Katerina agrees to his outrageous demands and is initiated as a plaything for the depraved brethren of the FMC.It will be the longest night of her life.Warning -- Erotica: sexually explicit material for adults only. This filthy e-book includes scenes of dubious consent, extreme objectification, severe humiliation, hardcore gangbang (MMMMMMMM/f), anal play and numerous other down and dirty activities.Approximately 47,000 words long",
