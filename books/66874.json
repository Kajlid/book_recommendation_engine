  "description": "Do you long for depth and authenticity in your relationship with God? Do you want purpose and daily direction but can’t seem to find the “right” prayer to receive it? “If prayer has stopped ‘working’ for you or if you want to know the reality of God, I invite you now to explore contemplative prayer and the lifestyle that allows you to experience God’s presence,” says Jan Johnson, author of When the Soul Listens. When the Soul Listens will guide you away from formulas and step-by-step plans toward true contemplative prayer. Learn to find rest and guidance in God, opening yourself to God’s presence and direction through this practical approach. If you are disillusioned, searching for something that makes sense, or experiencing spiritual dryness, When the Soul Listens offers a clear path to a fulfilling connection with God and helps you allow God to work change in your life through prayer. Isn’t that what you want?",
