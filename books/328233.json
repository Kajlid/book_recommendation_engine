  "title": "Miles to Go",
  "description": "When British drug lord Gareth \"Hairy\" Carey stakes out territory in their jurisdiction, openly gay police officer Rick Miles is determined to use the opportunity to prove his worth to prejudiced colleagues. With no backup but his partner Graciela Cruz, Rick goes undercover without official sanction and wins a spot in Carey's gang using his good looks and sheer bravado. Now Rick is in the tank with the sharks, but this isn't his first cruise. He's prepared to deal with the vicious drug traffickers. What he isn't prepared for is Billy Rose, Carey's astonishingly handsome spoiled brat paramour. Billy is sexy and smart, and he delights in seducing dangerous men - men like the one Rick is pretending to be. Thrown together when Carey orders the new soldier to squire Billy around town, Rick finds himself fighting a strong attraction to the sharp-tongued toy boy. Juggling the dangerous distraction and maintaining a credible cover, Rick is thrown off-balance by a sequence of disastrous events, and as he scrambles to keep his footing, the havoc accelerates before he can call in backup. Marooned in a realm of sly deception, immediate reprisal, and sudden violence, he's forced to act against the dictates of his conscience to stay alive when a single misstep could mean death.",
