  "description": "Free vacation my a**A week in Alaska in the dead of winter is not exactly what I’d call a luxury getaway, even when it comes with two rivalling brothers vying for my attention. If anything, it makes this arctic tundra even more hellish.One is charismatic while the other broods. One has an underbelly of darkness while the other might just be my Knight in an oversized parka.But I’m only here for a week and I have no intention of falling for either of them.Until I wake up after a drunken New Year’s Eve, naked in someone else’s bed, with no recollection of the night before.Add one missed flight and pair it with an epic snowstorm and you’re left with me being stuck in this tiny town with both of them.All I wanted was a free vacation, an escape from my mundane life. I never imagined I’d find myself here and feel so at home. The problem is I’ve fallen in love with more than just this town.I just don’t know if he wants me for me or if I was merely a pawn in his game all along.",
