As Devlin is ready to take the witness stand, the trial is delayed another day due to unforeseen events, and Carl and Seth join forces to bring the two men in their lives together while Max and Horatio – oblivious to their lovers’ scheme – struggle to convince themselves that they can let go of the past and move forward, yet in their hearts continue to fall deeper and deeper in love with one another.
