  "description": "If kisses were colors you'd see every oneof the bands of a rainbow that shines in the sun.Perfect as a Mother's Day or baby shower gift, this tender book expresses the immeasurable love that parents have for their children-warmer than a wool blanket, sturdier than an oak tree, brighter than a rainbow. It's a sentiment that will soothe and delight the adults as well as their youngsters, and the lyrical verse is complemented by delicate, fanciful paintings that possess a timeless beauty and charm.Illustrated by Alison Jay.",
