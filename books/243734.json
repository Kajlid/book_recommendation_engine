  "title": "The Island",
  "description": "The Vale is a sleepy collection of city states best known for its petty rivalries and the bitter conflicts it pretends are further back in its history than any dare admit. When a single death sets off a chain reaction, four strangers find themselves on a collision course with something bigger than any of them could have ever dreamed of. A new Queen struggles to keep her throne. A lost child sets off in search of a birthright. A detective stumbles across an impossible conspiracy. A witch unravels herself in a sleepy tourist town. Beneath The Vale, something slumbers - and nations buckle under the weight of their crowns. A sprawling queer urban cellphones-and-sorcery tale of strangers whose lives intersect at a perilous climax. Contains two small segments previously serialised as 'Crossing Those Hills' and 'Eyes On Me'. Part One of a series.",
