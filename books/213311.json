Return a dead man's sword to his kin.  But as habitually happens in such matters, Zeru gets sucked in a desperate struggle for survival where getting maimed or worse walks aside falling in love and where saving one's skin lands you a fabled piece of divinity that takes -as much as it gives.   The story is set in the Living Sword Chronicles expanded universe. The titular character first appeared in the King of Blades series of novels.",
