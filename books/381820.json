  "description": "Journey to the land of the dead. All expenses paid!Not my idea of an ideal vacation, but this was work. After all, even an assassin has to earn a living. The trouble is, everyone knows that a living human cannot walk the Paths of the Dead, and return, alive, to the land of men. But being an Easterner is not exactly like being human, by Dragaeran standards anyway. Thus, the rule doesn't apply to me... I hope.",
