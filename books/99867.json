  "description": "\"“Dependent!!?”  Mythili has just moved to the Philippines to be with the love of her life and new husband, Siddharth. From being a hard-as-nails reporter who covered crime stories of the goriest kind, Mythili is now just a ‘dependent’. On top of that, unemployment, encounters with expat-wives and culture shock leave her feeling like she has fallen down a rabbit hole.  Mythili and Siddharth slowly come to realize that being newlywed in a foreign country is very different from being passionately in love, long-distance. Will this real life Alice find her way out of her own little Wonderland, or will the Red Queen take her head?\"",
