  "title": "Seven Daughters",
  "description": "The “Seven” are daughters of a country clergyman who is not greatly blessed with the good things of the world. The story is related by the eldest, who considers herself far from brilliant or witty, but who makes charming pictures of all who figure in the book. The good minister consents to receive a number of bright boys as pupil-boarders, and the two families make a suggestive counterpoise, with mutual advantage. Destiny came with the coming of the boys, and the story has naturally a happy end.Description taken from the back of the 1893 edition of Bethia Wray's New Name, published by Lee and Shepard.",
