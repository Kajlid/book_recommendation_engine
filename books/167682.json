  "description": "“ Twisted Creek will weave its way around the reader’s heart. Compelling and beautifully written, it is exactly the kind of heart wrenching, emotional story one has come to expect from Jodi Thomas.”—#1 New York Times bestselling author Debbie MacomberBad luck's been biting at Allie Daniel's heels all her life, so when she inherits a tiny café in a small Texas lake community she’s sure there has to be a catch. But Allie brings her grandmother along, and the cafe gives Nana a chance to do what she loves best—cook. As Allie settles in to try and make the best of what surely must be a mistake in an old man's will, the people of the lake drop by. Lonely folk discover there's always a “table for one” available, with downhome food to warm the soul. An old maid, a shy young man, a drifter who races the moon across the slowly, they become the family Allie never had. And when trouble comes, Allie finds she's not alone any more—and that sometimes, the only cure for bad luck is the courage to love.",
