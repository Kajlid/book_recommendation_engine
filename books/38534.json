  "title": "A Poet's Craft: A Comprehensive Guide to Making and Sharing Your Poetry",
  "description": "Praise for Annie Finch’s The Ghost of Meter “Finch offers fresh insights, particularly into the development of free verse in America, and injects into what is often a dry as dust topic a certain intellectual excitement.”—Choice A Poet's Craft transcends the limitations of current books, combining the best of three types of poetry-writing guides: textbooks for academic use, general guides to writing poetry, and guides to writing in form. Like textbooks, it includes poetry-writing exercises and discussion of classic and contemporary poems as examples, and is logically organized to provide a complete overview of the elements of poetry writing, from diction to trope to free verse. Like general poetry guides, it has a tone lively and mature enough for the nonundergraduate, and includes sections on journaling and inspiration, revision, publishing, and even how to assemble a poetry book. Like form guides, A Poet's Craft provides an introduction to meter and to writing formal poetry. Finch's book goes further than any form guide now available to give readers a thorough, eclectic, and exciting introduction to poetic form.",
