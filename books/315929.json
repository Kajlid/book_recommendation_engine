I fell in love with the wrong person and … I told him.Ryan’s always been with me ever since I can remember. It’s been the two of us—side by side. Through every new beginning, every new ‘family’, and every failure. Is it any wonder that the love I had for him turned into something different—something deeper? Something utterly rotten?And is it any wonder that he hates me for it now?RyanI’m a damaged soul, and she’s the only thing that’s ever held me together. But the one woman I want is the one woman I can never have.She thinks I hate her for her confession, and maybe a part of me does. What I hate more, though, is that I have to push her away to keep her safe. That I have to pretend like I don’t fucking want her when she’s all I’ve been able to think about for the last six years.We’re no fucking Romeo and Juliet. We’re much worse than that.A love like ours was doomed from the start.**NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: Alright guys, I’m gonna need your trust on this one.

Just get to the end and you’ll understand why I had to do this. This is a STANDALONE book.**",
