  "title": "Lord Caldwell and the Cat",
  "description": "Victor, Lord Caldwell was a paragon of manhood. However, he possessed one flaw -- he disliked cats, and the new tenant of his estate cottage owned a tomcat who had just set upon his faithful hunting hound. Worse yet, when Victor assured the irate lady he expected no rent due to her sudden reduced circumstances, her fiery temper flared, as she thought that the height of condescension. Never did Victor dream that their battle of wits could touch a chord so tender ... or that purrfect bliss with Catherine might depend on his courtship of a contentious ginger cat.",
