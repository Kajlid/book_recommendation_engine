The only solution: travel to Washington and go tow-to-toe with the world's most powerful and ruthless media mogul. Armed with Annie's sizeable chequebook, Alexis' red bag of tricks, and Maggie's top secret folder of dynamite information, the Ladies of Pinewood have a daring plan to pull off their most important job yet - and this time, failure is not an option.",
