  "description": "In a world wrought with fears stemming from natural catastrophes to terrorist activities, America faces its biggest challenge yet. Discord and apprehensions are pushed to the extreme as Mayan and Hopi prophesies approach fruition and people see signs that “the end is near” everywhere they look. The presence of “Doomsday Preppers” is common and prevalent, deteriorating the security people once had in their government and each other. As tensions grow, so does the paranoia that drives the nation to a crossroads that will change history.The world Dakota lives in is becoming unrecognizable. Though she holds onto her hopes of a better tomorrow, the thread of peace seems to unravel faster than it can be contained. What will become of Dakota and the people she loves, when a spark ignites America into an inferno of fear?About the AuthorI'm an American author with the independent publisher, Creativia.
