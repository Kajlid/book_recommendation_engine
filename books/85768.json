  "title": "The Presidents of the United States",
  "description": "According to the history books, fewer than forty-five men have held the position since the inception of the United States of America. As it turns out, the history books are incorrect, or at least incomplete. This book will hopefully help to set the record straight, enlightening the reader to the true story behind the highest office in our land. We will learn about the office itself and the men who held it, as well as their wives, their pets, their homes and their second-in-commands. As you read, you will hopefully learn something new, and possibly even enjoy yourself. So, without further ado, strike up the band and play \"Hail to the Chief,\" because here come the Presidents of the United States.",
