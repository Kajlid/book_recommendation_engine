The only condition to inherit is that I marry and live with my husband for a year.One problem. I’m not dating, and the only one I want to propose to is the gargoyle I’ve been crushing on for months. When I explain, Goreg offers a marriage of convenience with a quickie divorce at the end. He’s sweet and shy, and with his muscular frame and glorious wings, I’m kind of blown away by his offer even if he does occasionally turn to stone and lurk on the roof.I’ve got one year to convince Goreg we have a chance at forever. But then his brothers and wolf shifter best friend move in to help fix up the B&B, and it’s one cultural mishap after another. When the year is up, I’ll have to decide. Do I want to be single again or remain a gargoyle’s bride?Gargoyles Just Want to Have Fun is set in the Monsterville, USA world. Each book is standalone and can be read in any order.
