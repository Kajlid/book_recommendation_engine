  "description": "She never thought she’d see him again…this is a second chance sports romance in the Wild Men Series.  Sky  Colton Wild isn’t just the famous football player everyone sees on their television screen.  I met Colton one summer vacation when we lined up on opposite sides of a flag football field. He was the cocky kid with clear blue eyes and a constant smirk. When he picked me up over his shoulder and ran with me the length of the field, I wanted to hate him.  But somehow we were the last two left around the campfire that night. We talked for hours under the stars. And when he kissed me, I didn’t want him to stop.  The next morning, I left.  I thought I’d never see him again.  And for ten years, I didn’t.  Colton  Sky Rosewood was the one that got away, the fiery redhead with a temper to match.  It felt like way more than a teenage crush, but what did I know back then? Plus she gave me a fake phone number, not to mention a false last name. I tried everything to find her, but it was like she’d disappeared into the ethers.  Ten years later, I’m out for my morning beach run and I crash into…Sky Rosewood, just before she gets knocked out by an errant wave. I try to be a gentleman and give her mouth to mouth, but she comes to and tells me off, her temper still intact. And so is my crush.  Except now Sky’s a woman. A beautiful woman who agrees to give me the right number this time.  I’ve got my second chance with the woman I never forgot, and there’s no way I’m letting her get away again.  Turns out I shouldn’t have been so cocky…",
