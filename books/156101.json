  "description": "Emrys Marlowe had only ever fallen in love once, and that was with Kiyoshi Gwynne. He’d been young and Kiyoshi had been a man in which he could care for… and he’d loved caring for him. Now, six years later, he finds himself nervous as for the first time, he’s meeting his best friend Lindsay’s brother Ísarr. Ísarr Trevelyan, bookshop owner and unpublished screenwriter, has been quite content in living with his sister above the shop while she attended college. When she befriended two actors one afternoon, he’d thought nothing of it, and since their busy schedules kept them away from L.A. for the most part, it wasn’t until today, six years after her meeting Emrys, that he finally got to meet the man. Neither man expected to feel anything for the other, but the light and the completion they feel lends wings that can surely weather any storm… can’t it?",
