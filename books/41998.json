  "description": "Tanwen Evans has traveled to the world famous Sodom Virtual Reality Resort to find her passion. Her twenty year marriage to her high school sweetheart has recently ended, and with both of her children out of the house she finds herself alone for the first time in her adult life. Unwilling to trust her heart to another man, she believes that indulging in some racy virtual reality fantasies will help her find her long buried sexual side without the messy complications of a relationship. When she arrives at Sodom she discovers much to her shock, and fascination, she has been booked during the annual ‘Leather Kiss’ BDSM convention. Bryan Hamilton isn’t a fan of virtual reality fantasies, he prefers real life any day of the week. As a founding member of ‘Leather Kiss’ he attends the convention at Sodom, but usually enjoys his submissives without the aid of technology. When he runs into Tanwen all of his plans change. With her gentle disposition and her ladylike manners she calls to him like no woman has since the death of his wife. He discovers that she is a natural submissive and begins a campaign to win her heart, that includes joining her in a series of mind-blowing VR adventures. Tanwen has to fight her growing attraction to the handsome Master who is supposed to be just a vacation fling. The more they’re together, the more she finds herself yearning to have Bryan be her Master both in the virtual and the real world. She has to decide what’s more important, protecting her heart or taking a chance on the kind of love she’s always dreamed about.",
