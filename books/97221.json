  "description": "Book 7 in a series of 8 novellas: Having gained confidence in their love for each other, and in touch with their most intimate pleasures, the raw burn between them explodes into new hot passion. Can Natalie handle the raging desire she has for Tanner, or will it emotionally shatter her? Will Tanner allow intimacy, or reject the deep connection between them?“The raw burn she felt for Tanner never diminished, searing inside her, leaving her no choice but to express it in any way possible. She craved him, addicted to his male scent, his lean muscles, and his possession of her. If only she could get closer, even closer than she had. The urge to have every part of him, to take him, rose with new fury.”Raw Burn, 7th in the series of 8 novellas in the Touched By You series, is a romantic tale that takes place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The sex scenes are graphic - includes light bdsm. The author was inspired by the endearing romance in the Twilight series. And the sexual enlightenment, and sweet romance, in the Fifty Shades Of Grey series. Touched By You is a unique love story, with full character development, and added intrigue from the billionaire’s life, that will make each book in the series hard to put down.",
