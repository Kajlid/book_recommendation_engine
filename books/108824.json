Only Mia’s love has the power to do that—so he vows to do anything and everything it takes to win her heart again.From the first moment they see each other again, intense sparks of attraction fly. Between irresistible kisses, a romantic Sullivan wedding in Napa Valley, and a deeply sensual connection that neither of them can deny, can Mia and Ford finally rediscover a love—and a friendship—strong enough to last forever?",
