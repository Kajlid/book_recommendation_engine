  "description": "Powerless is the second installment in the Mortal Monsters series.Werewolf, shapeshifter, seer. If you’d said these words to me two months ago, I’d have said they were the things of stories and legends. Now, they’re my classmates, my friends and even those closest to me. Best friend, boyfriend and my own mother.So what does that make me? I’m something different. Something dangerous?I’ve kept my abilities locked up tight, hidden, even from myself, but the shapeshifter that was after Eli set them free, when he kidnapped and tortured me. With no one left to rescue me, I was forced to accept what I am in order to free myself and save Eli. Now that my abilities have been awakened, I can’t turn them off. If I can’t get control, they could destroy me, and everyone I care about too. I might just be the strongest supernatural there is, but I feel completely powerless.",
