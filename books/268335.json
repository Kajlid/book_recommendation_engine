  "description": "Michael. He's always been the one who got away, ever since high school. The standard to measure all other men in my life.  Even after years of working under him, the sexual tension is as thick as ever. Every time he comes into my office, I have to remind myself not to drool at his chiseled body armored in suits. I'm too chicken to act on my attraction, however... he isn't.  He's the young CEO of a company for a reason -- he always gets what he wants. What he's wanted for the past three years has been endless blondes, but on the day of my engagement to another man, it seems like he has a new interest: me.",
