  "description": "This would be his last chance to get them back; he was sure of it. He had to get them back. He couldn't risk letting it happen again-ever Little did the old man know that the amulets would lead his grandsons, Scott and Will, into a land of enchantment called Acacia in which those who enter realize a distinct power. Few possess a truly potent power, and with that comes the responsibility to honor the land that provides their enchantments. That's how it had always been and should be until Dryden showed up. With a wicked fury Dryden took over the once peaceful land with a power that was unmatchable or so he thought. There is but one who possesses a power that can possibly challenge Dryden's, but he's only a ten-year-old boy from the outside world who just wants to go home.",
