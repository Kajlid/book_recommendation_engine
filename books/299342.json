  "description": "Don't want. Don't think. Don't feel. After conquering multiple nations of the first, second, and third world, the Aftermath has eradicated war, violence, crime, and sin. Subsequently, self-expression and free will have been limited. Reigning for over two-hundred years, the Aftermath’s silent Leaders have split humanity into two groups— the Citizenship and the Elites.Citizenship Members are assigned Destinies and are monitored through Workforce chips and the ever-present scanning red, while Elites live in marble Metropolises and have only one duty in life: create art. Unbeknownst to both stations, the art created by Elites serves a greater purpose to the Aftermath than simply entertaining the Citizenship, and its Leaders monitor the influence fields of each Elite and each work done by them meticulously.But what happens when a Citizenship Member seeking individuality meets an Elite questioning her inspiration? Are they pursuing selfish desires or will they be the catalyst of change?",
