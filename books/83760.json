He’s been burned by his ex who sticks around to torture him and he lives with a family heartache that he’d rather not talk about. But he’s got a thriving business, his dream car, and good friends.

Luckily, their angel is a true believer and pulls every trick he knows from under his halo to make this a match made in Heaven.Who says God doesn’t have a sense of humor?",
