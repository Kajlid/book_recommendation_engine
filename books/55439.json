But when he discovers that Pepita, his mysterious new beloved, is an undercover policewoman with an eye on his plans for the biggest theft of his career, his fury at the woman is boundless. What neither Miguel nor the policewoman know is that Pepita has a perfect double, who is now in terrible danger -- and that double is Sukey Reynolds.",
