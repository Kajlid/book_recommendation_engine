  "description": "Mike Connors is a competitive and up-himself teenager who tells his story in the present tense and first person, as though talking to a tape recorder. Mike's parents died in an accident a year ago and he lives with his aunt, a business woman who doesn't have much time for him. She's given him a mobile phone so he can keep in touch when necessary. Mike's suburb is being stalked by a serial killer, and three deaths have occurred, all different - the only common feature is the means of death via a blow to the back of the head. All the victims were wearing something blue, hence the killer is known as 'Blue'. Mike happens upon the scene of Blue's latest murder and is observed by the killer. Soon a series of mobile phone calls begin, and Mike is talking regularly to Blue. It becomes clear that Blue knows a lot about Mike - secret things that no-one else can know... In this tense, tightly written thriller, it gradually becomes clear to the reader who Blue really is. But the authorities have nothing to pin the murders on - eventually they will have to let the murderer out.",
