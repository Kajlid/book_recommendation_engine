  "title": "Can You See What I See? The Night Before Christmas: Picture Puzzles to Search and Solve",
  "description": "Scenes from Clement Moore's 'Twas the Night Before Christmas inspire twelve elegant and fascinating compositions where readers search for dozens of intriguing hidden objects. The first photograph, \"The Night Before Christmas,\" features a gingerbread house, Christmas cookies, candles, bulbs, and more. \"Visions of Sugarplums\" is an abstract composition of Christmas confections; and \"Such a Clatter!\" is a dynamic explosion of objects. In \"It Must Be Saint Nick,\" Santa is shown in shadow; and in \"A Bundle of Toys,\" the presents in Santa's sack are revealed as a magnificent jumble. The final photograph, \"Happy Christmas to All\" is a beautiful, pastoral landscape, lustrous under new-fallen snow. The original poem is printed on the endpapers. Can You See What",
