But then one man's lust for power destroyed this balance: Vestor assassinated his sister, Mother of the Minca tribe. His army ravaged the Dute and Carroo tribes. A once-idyllic world was thrust into war, famine, and despair.Yet today, there is hope. Vestor's niece, Cora, has a vision: if she can convince an emissary from each tribe to rendezvous at the Heart Stone, she can overthrow her evil uncle, take her rightful place as Mother Minca, and restore harmony.But the Dutes have disappeared deep into their mountains. There are rumors that the Carroos are extinct. And Cora must move swiftly--lest Vestor learn that she's pregnant with the Mincan heir.“Imaginative and ambitious, the fantasy novel Journey to the Heart Stone adventures through an ancient, magical land, conveying real-world insights along the way.” - Foreword Clarion review",
