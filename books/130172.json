Apparently neither have her family and friends, for when someone tries to murder Gunthar, every sign points in their direction. Helene realizes the only way to prove her loved ones' innocence is by exposing the true assassin. As Helene and Gunthar spar over the identity of the traitor, fierce determination gives way to mutual attraction. Helene must race against time, and dark secrets of the past, to unmask the would-be killer before the kingdom plunges back into war and takes the life of the man she has unexpectedly learned to love.\"",
