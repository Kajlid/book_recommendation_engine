Consumed by bitterness at the injustice of it all, he needs to work out if he really wants to get even – when someone offers to help him do just that.Set in contemporary England, The Queensberry Rule explores how social media and technology can be used to bypass conventional justice, with devastating consequences.If The Queensberry Rule was a film, think The Firm meets Falling Down meets Fight Club.",
