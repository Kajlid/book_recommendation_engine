  "title": "2L8 My Luv: A Story of Love and Betrayal",
  "description": "“2L8 My Luv” is the novel your English teacher warned you against. It doesn’t follow grammatical rules. It bastardizes the English language. It has no narration, exposition or description.  That’s because its story of love and betrayal is written entirely in text messages, with all the syntax errors and raw emotion typical of the medium.  Its texting style makes it read like fiction on speed. And yet the characters’ innermost thoughts and feelings are all bared in the texts, as one complication leads to another.  “2L8 My Luv” is a coming of age story of two BFFs, Sarah and Jen, who continue to keep each other’s darkest secrets as they head off to different colleges and get entangled in relationships with BFs.  But as decisions are made that can’t be undone, their friendship is tested to the breaking point, leaving them to face their greatest fears alone.
