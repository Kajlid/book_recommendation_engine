  "title": "Too Much Temptation",
  "description": "Reader favorite Lori Foster adds the first full-length contemporary novel to the Brava erotic romance line, and it's a story that's poignant and funny and searingly sexy in all the right places. Breaking his engagement should make a man's life simpler, but for sinfully handsome Noah Harper it meant defying his grandmother, losing his job, and disappointing everyone who thought the bride was his perfect match. Though the breakup wasn't his fault, he agreed to play the gentleman and take the flak for it. After all, he'd lived without his grandmother's approval before; he was wealthy enough not to need the job she'd given him; and, while facing the resulting mix of scandal, disaster, and confusion wasn't exactly fun, freedom from an appalling mismatch was definitely worth it. The first thing he planned to do was enjoy his freedom -- to find a woman who was willing to pursue pleasure for its own sake. He never expected his grandmother's sweet, innocent assistant, Grace Jenkins, to rush to his defense -- or to find she had a passionate nature to match his own. Suddenly, freedom is nowhere near as important to Noah as being with Grace -- for her loyalty, love, and luscious womanly curves are Too Much Temptation.",
