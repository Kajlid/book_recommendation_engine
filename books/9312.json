  "description": "Lucy was once the beloved Goddess of the Moon, and could have any man she wanted. But these days, the goddesses of the Etruscan pantheon are all but forgotten. The only rituals she enjoys now are the local hockey games, where one ferociously handsome player inflames her divine blood. Brandon Stevenson is one hundred percent focused on the game, until he looks up and sees a celestial beauty sitting in the third row.",
