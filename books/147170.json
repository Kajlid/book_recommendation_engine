  "description": "Cat Glamour is lost in a world of pain and self-imposed guilt. She hides behind her weight, her children, and a past she can’t forget. While her 91-year-old, decidedly different, grandmother provides emotional support, Cat needs to take control of her life which has been shattered by her abusive ex-husband and tragic events of the past. On the day Cat decides to start an exercise routine, the last thing she expects is a modern-day genie to pop out of her Wii machine. Unfortunately for Cat, her genie is somewhat unreliable in his wish-granting capabilities. In a series of hilarious misadventures, he sends Cat to a castle in France and back in time 20 years in an attempt to solve both Cat’s weight issues and emotional stresses. Cat’s journey is one filled with quirky adventures, realistic love, and above all, self-discovery.",
