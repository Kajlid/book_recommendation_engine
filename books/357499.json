  "description": "Have you ever wondered how the world will end?\nNo? Well don't sweat it. Most people don’t, and the few that do expect the cause will be a dramatic change in climate, a pandemic, or mostly likely war. That's what we've all been taught to believe, and we’re comfortable with rational explanations. But people weren’t always so quick to accept the facts provided by so-called experts. There used to be a time when we believed in myth and magic. Our minds were open to the idea of things that couldn’t be seen…the fantastical.I had been like you until I met Winston Stewart; the day I learned to believe that there are other forces at work—not the least of which is fate. Fate is an amazing thing. It put Gandhi in South Africa, Nelson at Gibraltar, and Winston Stewart on that train in Alexandria Virginia.You say you don't know who Winston Stewart is? Don't worry...you will.Antithesis is a modern-day urban fantasy from Michael J. Sullivan, creator of the bestselling Riyria Revelations. It's the story of myth and magic where one man is given the gift of power that could change the world for better—or worse.",
