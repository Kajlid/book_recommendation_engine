  "description": "The Liddiards have lived at Honeycote House for generations. But all that might be about to change ... Rakishly charming Mickey Liddiard has several problems. Unbeknownst to his angelic wife Lucy, his family-run business, Honeycote brewery - the mainstay of picturesque Honeycote - is up to its beer-bottle neck in debt. His drinking is getting out of control. His affair with local millionaire's wife Kay is more about peace-keeping than passion. And for each of Mickey's misdemeanours there is a knife being sharpened. Ambition, greed and good old-fashioned revenge all conspire to bring about his downfall - but will true love save the day?",
