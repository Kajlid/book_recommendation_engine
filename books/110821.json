  "description": "Ms. Paragon, the world's greatest superheroine, has fought Nazis, slime monsters, and criminals beyond count, and always emerged victorious. But she meets her match in Rex Titus, a mammary-obsessed plastic surgeon who has developed a radical new method of breast augmentation - and who intends that the already buxom Amazon become his next patient!It's wits versus tits in what can only be described as a battle of epic proportions!Warning - the following e-book contains adult situations, crude humor, and extreme breast expansion. But it also has a quote from Charles Dickens, so it all sort of balances out.46,000 words.A NOTE TO POTENTIAL This second edition ebook is DRM-free, and has been tested using Amazon's emulation software for the Kindle Fire, Kindle, the DX, and the iPad. They all look fine, but if there are problems please let me know and I will fix them. Thanks.",
