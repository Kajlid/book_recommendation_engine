  "description": "Land of Peace Synopsis Prince Audax Leonis has been struggling to make sense of the last few days. One moment his sweet Anna was dying in his arms and the next he was being consumed by a giant vortex. He woke up in a strange world, a world of noise and chaos. The goddess had saved Anna. But she had also made a grave mistake. What had Iustitia been thinking? “They will think that I have abandoned them. They will call me a coward.” Sleep is impossible. The guilt and fear sickens his stomach. He hears them in his dreams. The people that have died, and those that will, those that are alive and suffering at the hands of that monster and his despicable men. “Send me back! Please, I have to return!” He cries in the middle of the night, but there is only silence. There are no answers, never answers. Just more questions. Tomorrow he will walk to her room and see her. Perhaps, tomorrow will be the day. But until then, he is trapped. Trapped in time.",
