  "description": "Have you even wondered what it takes to break a bad habit?So have I. And so many other people after failing when trying to change an old behavior.Truth is we all need to get out of the prison of our bad habits so that we can start living life to the fullest. That’s why I created this book.Basically our life consists of the actions we do every day. We repeat them, one after another, and that results in the person we’ve become, what we’ve achieved through the years, how our perception of the world is formed and what our life looks like.If you want to have some kind of control over your life, you need to be able to develop, destroy and replace habits.But we need to start small. It’s a learning process and accepting it as such will help you along the way.That’s why I dedicated the first section of the book to understanding the importance of habits.I’ve also included a brief explanation of habit forming and breaking, as there’s science and psychology behind all that. But I’ve summarized it in an easy and understandable way so that we can get only what we need from that and put it into practice right away.Then, still in this first section, I’ll help you get clear about the habit you want to break. It’s crucial that you choose one for this experiment.Then you’ll have plenty of time to do that with any other bad habit you’d like to kick, but after you’ve succeeded with the first and know exactly how this strategy works.In the second part of the book I’ll walk you through anything you need to keep in mind when working on breaking the habit.",
