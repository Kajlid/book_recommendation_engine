  "description": "Rosetta and Fawn are complete opposites. Rosetta loves fancy dresses and flowers. Fawn would rather go on adventures with her animal friends. Then the queen throws a fancy dinner, and Fawn decides she doesn’t want to go. So Rosetta makes a deal with her. If Fawn dresses up for the dinner and minds her manners, Rosetta will spend a day doing whatever Fawn wants. Rosetta thinks it’s the perfect plan. But she never imagined just what Fawn would want to do! Can their friendship survive a day of frogs, mud, and . . . worms?",
