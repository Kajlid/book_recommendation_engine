  "title": "Pot Luck",
  "description": "Pot Luck , Zola's most acerbic satire, describes daily life in a newly constructed block of flats in late nineteenth-century Paris. In examining the contradictions that pervade bourgeois life, Zola reveals a multitude of betrayals and depicts a veritable 'melting pot' of moral and sexualdegeneracy. This new translation captures the robustness of Zola's language and restores the omissions of earlier abridged versions.",
