  "description": "The Studhorse Man is a classic Canadian odyssey--a story told by a madman who works naked in a bathtub. It is the tale of Hazard Lepage, last of the studhorse men, and owner of a superb blue stallion named Poseidon...the sole survivor of its breed. Hazard's maniacal search to find the perfect mare for this magnificent horse is opposed by his fianc√©e of thirteen years, Martha Proudfoot, so much so she refuses him both herself and her Arab mares. This is a compelling saga that will move all readers.",
