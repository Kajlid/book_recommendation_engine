  "description": "When an evil... I mean nefarious wizard... okay, sorcerer shows up to menace the kingdom, King Samuel calls in the troops - an old knight named Sir Roger, his trusty sidekick, Blug, and the kingdom's wizard. Thankfully, the wizard had a friend - Smoke the Dragon. A mighty, fire-breathing Wyrm with only one small phobia. A fear of knights. Oops. \"If Knight Terrors had been published within the British Empire, Nicholas Ozment would be knighted by Her Majesty the Queen and served tea and crumpets by the reigning ruler of fantastic hi-jinks, Mr. Terry Pratchett himself. The unantithalian Ozment delivers (literally; someone else told the tale, he's just the messenger) grand adventure with artistic aplomb, and the characters that populate his pages snap with a fine appreciation of life. Merlin could not hold the tails of Ropespor's robes; Ivanhoe would be Sir Roger's valet; and as for Smoke...well, Puff who? As Terry Pratchett may very well have once said, 'In the beginning there was nothing, and it exploded.' I say, anyone who disagrees is just a bloody stabard.\"--Jason M. Waltz, publisher Rogue Blades Entertainment",
