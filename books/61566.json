  "title": "Exposing Phallacy: Flashing in Contemporary Culture",
  "description": "A sexual climate consumed by display ought to be ideal for flashers, yet their actions are taboo and illegal. While others flirt with the accoutrements of romance and sexiness for lovers, flashers confront the spectator with sex organs. They ask no consent, baring the genitals of which they are so proud, convinced their spectators will desire them. But they rarely do. Instead, they are more likely to object to the imposition of the male flasher and leer at the female flasher. While softcore porn is fashionable and ubiquitous, the flashers public full frontal display is still forbidden.",
