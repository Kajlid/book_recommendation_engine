  "description": "Imagine. You receive a mysterious task. From someone you have never met. About something that will put you face to face with the most dangerous criminals the world over. And, in trying to complete the task, the certainties in your life will change beyond recognition. What would you do? On his birthday, Daniel Cameron receives an old wooden casket from a long-lost great, great uncle, Hamish. Hamish is a Master Thief and the Alderman of the Thievers' Guild. The Guild keeps alive the old motto: steal from the rich, and give to the poor. It is all that stands between the world and a tidal wave of un-restrained crime. But the Guild is in terrible danger. And the only one who can save it is Daniel. To test his will to take on the challenge, Hamish conceals the casket somewhere in Forres, the small town in northern Scotland where Daniel lives. He must find the casket before the forces conspiring to destroy the Guild get to it. If Daniel doesn't get there first, all will be lost. If you were Daniel, what would you do?",
