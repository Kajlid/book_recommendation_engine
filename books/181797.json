That is until he discovers that the killer is a supernatural creature that possesses innocent people and forces them to commit crimes without their knowledge. Collingwood vows to track down and kill the creature before any more innocent lives are lost, but it is more than a match for any hunter and Collingwood is unable to stop its reign of terror. As more people are killed with Collingwood always being the last person to see the victim alive, he begins to understand the creature’s true intent. It has a dark and secret plan for him, and when Collingwood uncovers the truth his resolve will be tested to the limit.",
