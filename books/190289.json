  "title": "The Everywhere House",
  "description": "Sherry Lincoln's childhood home had sat next to the Brentwood Library for forty-two years. Each time she visited the library, she always took a moment to reminisce and also to inspect it for changes as the house embraced new owners. In 2013, she noticed something peculiar: her house was gone. Puzzled and saddened, she inquired at the library, hoping someone would have information about why her house was \"missing.\" Not only had the librarian heard, but she had been a part of the deconstruction effort, which was to provide land for the expansion of the library. Still saddened, but now wanting to hear more of the story, she contacted Habitat for Humanity of Springfield, MO, the organization that recycled every piece of the house, and learned that her house was not gone--it was everywhere, piece by piece becoming the homes of others.",
