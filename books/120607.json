  "description": "Johnny diMarco is a spoiled, rich brat who has made his way through almost every Dom at The Hammer Club. None of them can handle him. Even Oliver has tried and has sadly had to admit defeat.  Dolph Waters is a newcomer to the Hammer, but he’s been a Dom at a club up north for quite a while. When he hears about Johnny, he’s intrigued and agrees to meet the sub and give it his best shot.  It doesn’t take long for Dolph to realize that Johnny needs far more than a simple blistering spanking, the sub needs attention and intense focus from his Dom. The more he gets to know Johnny, the more Dolph falls for him and wants to be the one to give Johnny what he needs. His biggest obstacle is Johnny himself who has decided that BDSM is a lie, one he isn’t interested in anymore.  Can Dolph convince Johnny that they can not only be friends, and lovers, but also Dom and sub? Or is he doomed to have his heart broken?",
