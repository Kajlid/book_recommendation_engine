  "description": "One of the most promising young talents in cartooning makes his debut with a dazzling collection—part freakish dreamlife, part quirk-o-rama autobiography, all genius.Long a fixture in comics anthologies, David Heatley's deceptively crude, wickedly observant drawings have begun showing up on the New York Times op-ed pages and the cover of the New Yorker , introducing him to a vast new audience, Now, in My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (title courtesy of the Ramones song), we are treated to the full range of Heatley's remarkable, wildly unique voice and vision.My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down is Heatley's life story told in six different but connected narrative threads. \"Sex History\" describes every sexual encounter dating back to kindergarten, with details that would make a therapist blush. \"Black History\" is an unflinchingly honest meditation on his own racism. \"Portrait of My Mom\" and \"Portrait of My Dad\" are beautifully paced vignettes, skewering and celebrating his lovably dysfunctional parents. \"Family History\" tells the story of his family from his great-great-grandparents' lives and closes with the birth of his own children. Woven in and around the larger pieces are \"dream comics\" that expand on the same themes with a baffling unconscious logic. Every inch of My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down is filled with visceral art and emotionally resonant storytelling at once stunning, truthful, and uncomfortably hilarious.",
