  "description": "\"I can't even eat a taco without feeling like I'm supposed to be saving the world.\"Zak Guan, professional bartender and college dropout, is pretty much your standard-issue layabout...until a chance encounter with a runaway girl plunges him into a hidden world of supernatural intrigue.Robyn Bennett is the embodiment of the poor little rich girl—a senator's daughter, an up-and-coming fashion model. Trouble is, Robyn's got a secret...one that puts her, and everyone around her, in danger. And Zak—who'd just as soon spend his free time on the couch beneath a cat, enjoying short ribs, recreational substances, and video RPGs—may be the only one who can help.The pokey shore town of Benediction is not as wholesome as it seems. Dangers lurk in every shadow. And Zak, unbeknownst to him, is heir to a legacy; a power that's beginning to stir within him; a destiny, to do battle against otherworldly evils. To help the helpless and protect the innocent.Will he accept the call, even if it puts his bland but comfortable life—and the lives of his screwball friends—on the line?",
