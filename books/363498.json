  "description": "Bradley Multriener is a twenty-one-year-old corporal in the U.S. Marine Corps on his second tour in Ramadi, Iraq, a place he knows well. Before joining the Marines, Brad came from the suburbs of Chicago and had a variety of experiences that gave him an understanding mind and a compassionate heart. In the confusion of battle, Brad is separated from his platoon and captured by a small band of war-hardened Iraqi fighters. Azooz, one of the fighters Brad's age, is the translator for the group. In a short but intense time together, Azooz finds something in Brad he never thought he would find in any a real friend. Vince Perritano wrote After We're Free while on his second tour in Iraq when he was twenty-one.",
