  "title": "Forever Beth Our Love",
  "description": "Empowering women was not the motive behind the Forever Beth Series but oddly enough the main character although fictional seems to hit home for many. A Story line that controversially begins with a brutal sexual attack at the hand of the main character’s then husband (Forever Beth Lost and Found) shines a light on a subject that is usually acknowledged when …. too late – when one of two ceases to live, life taken away tragically. Our Love is the second installment in the Forever Beth Series. A romance novel with a hint of humor, a bit of suspense, a touch of love making and a whole lot of mystery. Our love continues following the relationship between a NYPD Detective with a secretive background and a Domestic Violence Case Worker whose past interferes with her present and future. For their relationship to work as a couple both must adhere to the words “let not man put asunder”. If not, their futures even apart will be in jeopardy. Forever Beth Our Love un-doubtable is my best work so far. A year this September of penning my work for publication I see my own growth with taking chances - writing / describing scenes – acts many will find offensive, distasteful and or down right unpleasant. Product of a Pentecostal, Holiness, Baptist and Methodist background I too probably would wince at the idea of even mentioning the subject of sex. However I hope the words I used – the diligence and effort set forth will prove an outcome of more than acceptable but rather prudent and tastefully done.",
