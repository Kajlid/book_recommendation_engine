Jahi has made a living as seductress, but she’ll be damned if she is going to trade one kind of slavery for another. Each haunted by their past, can they learn to trust in one another, the love that has grown between them? Will they even have time? The demon hoard has changed leadership, and a new drug is sweeping the streets of Los Angeles. With every evil entity out there looking for Jahi, can Michael keep her safe, or is he blinded by a love that will betray him? Do people ever really change?",
