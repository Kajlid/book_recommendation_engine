  "description": "Anya has never been one for the spotlight, but her family seems to now be front and center, and the talk of the town in Underlayes. In the aftermath of her mother’s death, the discovery of said mother’s deceit, and Anya's half-sister getting ready to challenge her own father for the witches’ throne, keeping a low profile may prove to be difficult. Add in the fact that she’s pregnant, by her female mate, and it may turn out to be impossible.Kierra has never been one for many words. So if she were forced to explain how she impregnated Anya, it probably wouldn’t be easy for her. Especially since the truth would mean revealing her origins; she’s not a vampire, or even anything close to it. And living in a realm where her kind isn’t allowed may cause a few ramifications. Plus, should the kid call her Mom, or Dad?Jump right back into the world of Underlayes where this magical family takes dysfunction to brand new heights.",
