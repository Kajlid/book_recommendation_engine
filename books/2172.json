  "description": "It's a wild ride through Scranton in this darkly funny and touching story about guys in their twenties trying to figure out life in their hometown. The boundaries of friendship are tested as one of them hits rock bottom. Welcome to Scranton paints a portrait of a small town that includes political corruption, a disgraced teacher, and the hilarious misadventures of young men. The story takes you deep beneath the clich√© of small town life. It offers scenes that make you laugh out loud, situations that make you cringe, and, above all, Scranton itself looms large as the kind of ugly, lovely town that we all know too well. www.welcometoscranton.com",
