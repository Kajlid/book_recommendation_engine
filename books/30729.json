  "title": "Knox",
  "description": "Sammy Olson was kicked out of his own home by his boyfriend and left to fend for himself. He finds work at Theo's Bar and Grill, but what he isn't prepared for is the attention he's getting from two very handsome men. Trevor Amite left his coven behind when the leader challenged him. It was better than winning and becoming the new leader, something he didn't want. While Knox fights the demons that haunt his sleep, he discovers both of his matesâ€”and one of them is a vampire. Can he come to terms with the idea of having a bloodsucker for a mate, or will he take Sammy and walk away from what fate has decided to give him? And can Knox keep the coven Trevor left behind from killing the man he isn't even sure he wants? Each book in Lynn Hagen's Zeus's Pack collection features a different romantic trio. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
