  "title": "The Rape of Kuwait: The True Story of Iraqi Atrocities Against a Civilian Population",
  "description": "The Rape of Kuwait was written right after the invasion and prior to the first Gulf War that freed Kuwait from Iraq's grasp. The book consists of individual stories of what people experienced on the day of the invasion. There are stories about Kuwaitis, Palestinians, and other nationalities. Author Jean Sasson traveled to London, Cairo, and Saudi Arabia to interview those fleeing the violence. She was one of the few writers given an interview by Kuwait's Emir and Kuwait's Prime Minister. The book hit #2 on the New York Times Bestseller's list as it was the only book that told what was happening on the day of the invasion. Readers note that the war had not yet started, nor ended, so there is no resolution regarding the war in this book. It is strictly about human beings caught up in war.",
