  "description": "After losing it all, Dresden is forced to move in with his uncleâ€”a man who makes it very clear that he doesn't want Dresden and his son there in the first place. With a two-year-old son to take care of, Dresden is increasingly desperate to move out of the drug-infested trailer park his uncle resides in. When he finds out his uncle's dirty little secret, he must grab his son and run. Being one of the partners of the Triple-B ranch and half owner of the Ugly Broad Saloon, Harland Macy tries to lead a simple life in Bear County. That is until he meets Dresden. What started out as simple fascination turns into a fantasy come to life. When he discovers that Dresden is not only his mate, but can conceive his child, Harland must find a way to stop Dresden's troublesome uncle from destroying the life Harland so desperately yearns for.",
