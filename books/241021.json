  "description": "Dreams and reality twine in TEMPTED KINGDOM, a steamy new reverse harem serial for fans of sassy heroines, reimagined fairytales, and gothic romance. \n“What exactly is so wrong with being what I am?” I asked. Sy lifted his eyes to me, their almost-black brown trapping me as he said quietly, “What you are, Saylor, can tempt kingdoms.”  She is the key to their escape, and they are the key to her survival…  When vagabond and criminal-on-the run Saylor Greyson boards a bus to Los Angeles, she doesn’t expect to end up in a coffin in a world she thought only existed in the pages of fairytales. A world of astonishing magic, deadly curses, and a vast kingdom… that’s all hers. If she can just remember it.  It turns out that everything Saylor has ever known was an elaborate dream– except for her knack for seduction, the illicit power that sent her running in the first place.  With time running out, Saylor will need the help of her not one, but five super hot guards…. guards with questionable loyalty who conveniently happen to be immune to her sexy superpowers. Each of these men had a part to play in the dream of the life she knew, and Saylor suspects that tangling with them might be the only way to untangle her fabricated identity from the one she must remember if she hopes to break the curse and take back her kingdom for good.  **This is the first in the TEMPTED KINGDOM serial! New parts will be released every 2-3 weeks. When completed, all six will be released as an omnibus.",
