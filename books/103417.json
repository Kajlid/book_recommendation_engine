  "description": "Subjected: Omnibus EditionAll three books from the Subjected Series in one volume...A brief Blurb about each Book:Subjected: Parallax (Book One)•\tA Scientist and a reclusive Writer are led on mysterious journeys to the past and the future, by an Alien—or Angel (they’re not sure which)—in a desperate effort to re-balance reality after a ruthless corporate mogul uses the scientist’s discovery to alter history to his own making…Subjected: Eye of God (the Prequel)•\tDaniel J. Sayer weighs his loss, his life, his learning, and his sanity when an Alien—or Angel (he’s not sure which)—shows up at different points of his journey and begins addressing some of those “Big Universe” questions Daniel’s been asking…Subjected: the Predicate (the Sequel)•\tDr. Daniel J. Sayer has just learned that his life is essentially over, yet at the same time is reluctantly ushered, by an Alien—or Angel (he’s still not sure which), into the heart of a terrorist crisis, with the lives of thousands of children in the proverbial balance…The books in this Omnibus Edition are presented in the above order. However, they were written as stand alone works, and hence can be read in any order as desired by the Reader. Though they carry central, overarching themes, each has a different focus, style, and intensity—much as the different stages one goes through on our own journey’s through life.To help simplify it for you, Book One starts in the middle of the Protagonist’s adventures. So, it’s up to you, the Reader, to decide if you’d prefer next to go back in time, or forward in time. And as the Protagonist learns along the way, the past and the future weigh formidably on the decisions and actions of the present!",
