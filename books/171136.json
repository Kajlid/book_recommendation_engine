  "description": "“When Rob lost control the first time, spread out on my bed and writhing in the throes of ecstasy, I knew I would do anything to see him again.” Rob Martyn A sexually confused Englishman with his marriage and career in the toilet, Rob is a disappointment to his snobbish family. One seductive test-drive later, and Rob is propelled into a world of glamour, drag queens and hot sex with wealthy New York businessman, Lexington Black. Lexington Black I guess I should file seducing Rob under another of ‘Lexington’s Bad Ideas.’ Cynics say love doesn’t hit like a lightning bolt, but they’re wrong. The only problem is, I’ve lied through my teeth to get Rob into bed. I’m not talking about a white lie, but one the size of the Empire State Building. When he finds out, we’ll both be in heartbreak city. Alone. Drag queens, a Bridezilla and an English wedding gone wrong provide a backdrop to this gay awakening, sexy romance!",
