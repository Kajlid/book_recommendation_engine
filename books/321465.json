  "description": "As one of the new Masters of Avalon, Saul Danvers takes his responsibilities seriously. With two Masters absent from the club, he knows it's not the best time to take a few days' vacation, but he needs to clear his head. When the opportunity to borrow a cabin becomes available, he's all over it, packed and ready to head two hours away to where the fall leaves are dropping and the nights are drawing in colder. Halloween is on its on way. Too young to feel so damned old, Caera Huxby stands on a precipice of life and death. She can't sleep for the monsters in her head, she barely eats, and functioning like a normal human being is foreign to her. She can only see one way out of the mess, and the decision is final once it's made. Desperation is a powerful motive. When an offer from someone she considers a friend comes from out of the blue, Caera takes it as a last chance to find some peace. Little does she know that when the Masters of Avalon set their minds to something... They don't quit.",
