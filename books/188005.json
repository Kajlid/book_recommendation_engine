  "description": "DISCOVER JONATHAN AND MONICA  ------- He was the dream I never knew I had until he claimed me. The kinky billionaire who wanted to give pain as much as I wanted to receive it. He’d marked me as his own and I accepted him. I trust him completely. I swear I do. But, now things are getting complicated. I have a career, and he has his claim. How far is he going to go to mark me? And am I going to run or stay? WARNING: This novella has some of Jonathan and Monica’s roughest encounters. That's how they like it! *This takes place after he reclaims her in the studio, and before the second wedding. If you already love them, they're hotter than ever!",
