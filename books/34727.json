  "title": "Best Foot Forward: A 500-Mile Walk Through Hidden France",
  "description": "A touching and inspiring tale of the Texan pioneering spirit, English eccentricity, and two women old enough to know better. When Susie Kelly decides, on a whim, to trek alone across France from La Rochelle to Lake Geneva, she entrusts her French farmhouse full of assorted animals to a total stranger from San Antonio, Texas. For each of them it will be a life-changing experience. Both will find their resourcefulness and ingenuity tested to the limit as, in their own ways, they explore and enjoy the culture, cuisine and people of Europe's most fascinating country. While Texan Jennifer Shields copes heroically with lost dogs, erratic electricity, old men hiding in bushes, and a language she cannot speak, Susie doggedly tramps 500 miles over unknown terrain, frequently lost and either too hot or too cold. Armchair travellers will enjoy this tale of laughter and tears following the adventures of two women old enough to know better. \"A book to inspire\" GOOD HOUSEKEEPING",
