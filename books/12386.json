Grammy award–winning singer, Academy Award–nominee, Broadway star of her critically acclaimed one-woman show and beloved actress in The Rose, Beaches and Down and Out in Beverly Hills—Bette Midler is a household name whose career and fans span generations. In A View from a Broad, originally published in 1980, Bette relives her career through memories of endless rehearsals, her fear of flying, crazy schedules and wisdom she learned from Thai Gondoliers, with the trademark razor-blade wit that her fans have grown to know, love and expect. Filled with photographs, a new introduction and heartwarming stories that highlight only a portion of a brilliant career, A View from a Broad is the perfect gift for anyone who loves music, theater or just plain fun—and will be cherished by the fans of Divine Miss M for years to come.",
