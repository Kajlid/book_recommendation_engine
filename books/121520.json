  "description": "Emily Henry's  Book Lovers  meets Netflix's Romantic Comedy Your Place Or Mine in this workplace romance between two Filipino editors—romance & science fiction and fantasy—set against the backdrop of the vibrant Philippine book publishing scene.Emma Morales, tenacious romance book editor and proud cat lady, knows romance, but love? Nope. Thank you very much. Enter nerdy sci-fi and fantasy editor Kip Alegre, who quotes JRR Tolkien for breakfast and knows heartbreak all too well. When Emma gets a career-changing sci-fi romance manuscript which may just save their publishing house from folding, she knows she must work with Kip if she wants to succeed. Sounds simple enough, right? But when well-meaning meddling best friends, an obsessive ex-boyfriend, and a beautiful ex-fiancée come into the picture, the job doesn’t seem so simple anymore. What starts out as a friendly—flirty—literary smackdown between Emma and Kip grows into something deeper than either of them had signed up for. The deal was to edit the book, not their lives.Emma and Kip may be willing to read the manuscript over and over again, but will they be willing to give love a second read?",
