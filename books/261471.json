  "description": "After her grandmother’s death, Sammie finds herself thinking about the Christmas Coin and all the sweet memories attached to it. She decides to take a trip back to her grandmother’s house in Holly Hamlet, Vermont to find it. With the impending sale of the house, all Sammie wants as a keepsake of her grandmother is the coin and the story that she still holds close to her heart. With fifty years of possessions tucked inside the house, she realizes she has her work cut out for her. When the little girl next door innocently mentions the Christmas story, Sammie realizes that Ally could be the key to her finding the Christmas coin. As the weekend goes by, Sammie becomes attached to Ally, and subsequently her single father Jack. Her plans begin to change more than she could have imagined. Jack Stevens had heard about the impending arrival of his neighbor Mary Holt’s granddaughter. Seeing her bright red hair and immaculate red mustang, he knows a woman like that is just making a quick stop to get whatever it is she came to Holly Hamlet for. But as he and his six-year-old daughter Ally spend time with Sammie, he begins to see her in a different light. As he finds himself inviting Sammie to join he and Ally in their Christmas traditions, he worries about his little girl. She’s already had one woman walk out on her life. Sammie had told him she was only in town for a day or two. Seeing his daughter’s attachment to Sammie, and ignoring his own growing feelings for her, he’s worried about Ally’s heart breaking when Sammie leaves town. Will a decades old tradition and the sparkle of Christmas work its magic on two people who both need a gift that can’t fit under the tree?",
