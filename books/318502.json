That’s what my father used to say before he died from a broken heart brought on by my mother’s affair. She left us when I was only seven years old, and I’d dedicated my life to tracking her down to get the answers we were never given. But soon, I became the hunted, and I was going to learn that my father had been right – and he had a few secrets of his own.CONTAINS: KIDNAPPING, MAFIA, DUBIOUS CONSENTMayhem is a novella in the Quick and Dirty Series.
