  "title": "Surviving Everest: Tragedy and Triumph on the World's Deadliest Mountain",
  "description": "This gripping account of the 1996 Mount Everest tragedy made famous in Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air is told from the perspective of filmmakers. When David Breashears agreed to climb the world's tallest mountain with an IMAX camera to film from the summit, he had no idea that his expedition would become embroiled in a tragedy that would make headlines around the world. On May 10, 1996, two expeditions led by experienced Everest guides Rob Hall and Scott Fisher summited the mountain, only to suffer the loss of eight members--including the two leaders--on the way back down. At the time, Breashears and his filmmaking crew were at the base camp preparing for their own climb, originally planned for that same day but postponed after realizing there would already be several other groups on the summit. Instead of making a film, Breashears and company participated in the rescue and only later reached the summit of Everest to successfully complete their film. Â  Broughton Coburn, a long-time resident of Nepal and a friend of David Breashears, was commissioned to write a book about the filmmaking expedition, the tragedy on Everest, and the mountain itself. Filled with stories and photographs chosen to capture the prevailing power of this mountain in the world's imagination, Tragedy on Everest is a taut recounting of disaster and triumph at 29,000 feet - published just in time for the 50th anniversary of the first American team to summit Mount Everest.",
