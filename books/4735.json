  "description": "This book is centered on Jesus. The author's intention, from chapter to chapter, is to underscore the necessity of an active, abiding faith in Jesus Christ. Tozer reaches into his personal experience as he applies the rich truths of key texts from the final chapters of the letter to the Hebrews. This book is a companion volume to Jesus, Our Man in Glory, which is based on the earlier chapters of Hebrews. Together, the two books examine most of the important emphases in the significant Letter.",
