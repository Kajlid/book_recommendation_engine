  "description": "A picture of deception... Annabelle Lawson knew nothing about the breathtaking stranger she met on the train -- only that he'd make an ideal model for the budding young artist...and that she desired him more than she believed possible. But after she'd been seduced, she learned that she'd also been betrayed. The man she thought she loved was really Magnus Wallis -- a scoundrel like his father before him, the loathed cousin of Annabelle's benefactor, the honorable Earl of Whitby. A landscape of love... No longer the naively romantic girl who would tumble for a rogue, Annabelle cannot avoid a reunion with the despicable Magnus, who wants to include her portraits in his new London gallery. She means to show him her coldest face -- but upon seeing him again, her every intention melts from the heat of his touch. It is clear that Magnus still burns with love for her. But is he still the villain he once was, or can he be reformed into a man Annabelle can dare to love?",
