  "description": "Hayden spent the first twelve years of his life hearing about the infamous Dark Prism: his corrupted magic, his fractured mind, the towns that were destroyed during his dark experiments, the people he killed….But it wasn’t until Hayden’s childhood home exploded that he learned that the most evil mage in the Nine Lands was actually his father.Now Hayden is being credited with the Dark Prism’s demise, even though he swears he doesn’t remember anything about the explosion that destroyed his home and killed his mother. All he wants to do is live a normal life, but after being sent to Mizzenwald for formal magical training, it’s obvious that that isn’t going to happen. Hayden tries to find a place for himself in a world left devastated by the Dark Prism, but with enemies around every corner and a defective dragon for an ally, things aren’t looking good.Surviving his first year of school becomes Hayden’s top priority, but will he have to follow in his father’s footsteps to succeed?",
