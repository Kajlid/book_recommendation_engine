  "description": "Accountant-extraordinaire Mary Holmes is determined to make the most of her second chance... a job with Vitruvius Security. Then, her boss hires a specialist, Crash Coolidge, to work undercover to smash a truck-cargo heist gang. Mary is horrified to discover that the sexy, insolent new-hire is a criminal who is scarily relaxed about the prospect of killing people. Even in a tough-guy company like Vitruvius Security, Crash Coolidge is the equivalent of a Rottweiler surrounded by Chihuahuas. And he wants whip-smart, curvy Mary on his team. She smells like cake...When Mary is targeted by the sinister and mysterious head of the heist gang, Crash, a man who thought he had nothing left to lose, ends up with everything to lose. They team up to hunt the shadowy figure, and Mary ends up wanting a second chance for Crash Coolidge as much as she wants one for herself.A secret-past, opposites-attract, high-octane romantic comedy with a killer hero, a whip-smart, full-figured heroine, and her deaf, smelly guard dog.
