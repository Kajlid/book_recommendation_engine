  "description": "You're Stormy Jones, a pregnant 17-year-old punk rock chick with \"sky eyes\" and a pink tipped blond Mohawk with spear tats on each side of your shaved head. You're racing a stolen chopper that belongs to the chief of the Seminoles and it seems half the cops in south Florida are hot on your tail from land, sea, and air. You're wanted by the Feds for domestic terrorism and you and your Seminole/Cuban boyfriend Nokosee just made the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List but it's all a big misunderstanding. You didn't mean for anyone to get hurt. If it counts for anything, you did it for love; to love and protect Nokosee and the baby he put inside you. He's the first of the New Seminole groomed by his nutcase dad Busimanolotome Osceola to wage an eco-war on the \"Outside\" that will restore south Florida to its natural state. But that's not you. You're not a tree hugger, you're a boy hugger, a one boy hugger and it's not your fault people are dying all around you.In this sequel to RISE OF THE NEW SEMINOLE, Stormy Jones fights to overcome everything thrown at her and does it in a way that would make all girls proud-- not in a superhuman way or through the assistance of some heroic act of a man or monster but by her own means, stumbling as it were through raging hormones, bullets, and a host of bad decisions toward a seen it all/done it all stoic-eyed adulthood and motherhood by the time she's 18.
