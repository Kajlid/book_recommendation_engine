As he ponders the answer, he begins to wonder about the nature of his relationship with Carter.Psychoanalysis can do that, you know.Meanwhile, a new client wants to see Nick. He claims that only Nick will be able to catch his cheating wife in the act. And it might end up being a good deal for everyone involved.

Of course, Carter is along for the ride because beard burn isn't good. So they're off to the woods for 10 days to rough it.Or are they?Don't turn that dial! The further adventures of Nick and Carter will continue after these messages from our sponsors.",
