But when a family emergency brings me back home, I'm forced to pack up my life and take the only available job.  Wesley Steele is the owner of Good Wood Tree Removal Inc. and the boss from hell. A typical lumberjack, he’s bearded, arrogant and offensive. He’s everything I despise in a man. I want nothing to do with him or his flannel clad chest.  But, he's on a mission, intent to change my mind. How far is he willing to go to prove there's more depth to him than meets the eye?",
