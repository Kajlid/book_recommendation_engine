  "description": "A Brand New Stand Alone Sports Romance From USA Today Best Selling Author MJ FieldsI never wished on falling stars or simply dreamed of making it into the major leagues. I did the work. I made it happen.I never expected my last night out with my minor league crew would end up with us stepping in for a no-show stripper at a bachelorette party in the VIP section of Kingston’s.I sure as hell didn’t expect that the hottie with the pink sash and gold lettering spelling out “Bride To Be” would have me calling dibs on a woman for the first time in my life.Spoiler alert: she had no ring, she was no bride, and I knew that going … in.After the hottest hour of my life with the stand-in bride, I left her with my number on a baseball card, confident I’d see her again, and then headed back to Jersey.In the blink of an eye, everything changed.I woke up in the hospital, not remembering anything from that night. What I did know was I had been dropped by my team and that I had a long road ahead of me in order to get back on the field. Then life swung hard, returned me to the game, gave me some vivid dreams, and dropped the stand-in bride back into my life.Except, she wasn’t at all what I expected, and she brought her own issues to the field.Nothing good in life comes without doing the work.This would be no exception.Batter up.",
