  "description": "Some secrets refuse to stay buried.By all rights, Sue Jewel should be dead. In place of celebrating her fortieth birthday, she was wrapped in plastic and stuffed in the trunk of a car. Worst part is the man she promised to spend her life with is the one who tried to kill her. With a little help from Fate, Sue walks away from the ordeal, but her husband doesn’t. Now with a new lease on life, Sue wants to put as much mileage between her past and her present as she can. It would be a lot easier if something supernatural with dark intent wasn’t along for the ride. Desperate to break free from it all, she finds herself in Freewild Cove, making new friends, catching the eye of the handsome coffee shop owner, and hoping to magically cut her ties to her would-be murderer once and for all. Lorna, Vivien, and Heather are back. And with the help of Grandma Julia’s ghost, they’re kicking supernatural butt and taking names!",
