When homeless hit, I knew I could deal with it easily, until weeks turned into months, then, months turned into years, until not having a place to rest my head became chronic.

I am telling this important story for all America to take heed to those loved ones in their lives. I especially am begging the mentally ill to seek help before calling it quits in life.
