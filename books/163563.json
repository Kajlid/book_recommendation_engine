  "description": "Combine one troubled boy with his concerned prep school teacher. Stir in a pinch of quantum physics, add Italian Renaissance political intrigue, and serve piping hot with Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Machiavelli, the Medici’s, and a Borgia Pope on the side. That is the perfect recipe for a time travel adventure crackling with historical detail.\"Lorenzo’s Daggers is a delightfully entertaining story of time travel between modern-day New England and 15th century Italy. Author Ron McGaw keeps the pages turning quickly with endearing characters, taut prose, and a riveting storyline that stands alone for its novelty and intrigue. But Lorenzo’s Daggers is more than just good fiction. It is also a deft portrayal of Renaissance Florence—a city of prolific genius that produced some of the most creative minds of Western Civilization. Through the travels and travails of protagonist Prester John, readers can well imagine the life and times of the Renaissance giants of Western art, science, political theory, architecture, and philosophy. Lorenzo’s Daggers—a worthy read!\"Brigadier General Lance Betros (retired)Former Head - Department of History, West Point",
