  "title": "Loyalty To Your Soul: The Heart of Spiritual Psychology",
  "description": "Loyalty to Your Soul establishes Spiritual Psychology as a paradigm-altering frontier. It initiates a radical shift at the core of contemporary psychological thought by unveiling a technology for using everyday life experiences as rungs on the ladder of spiritual evolution. This book is uniquely suited for anyone seeking to discover and cross the bridge that spans the waters between life referenced in material reality and life lived within the context of spiritual reality. Loyalty to Your Soul shows you how to first gain access to, and then gradually learn to live from, that-sacred place inherent within everyone, referred to by the authors as the Authentic Self-a place where emotional suffering ceases and profound peace and love are present. While many people have written about such an inner state, Ron and Mary Hulnick show you how to travel there . . . and what to anticipate once you arrive. The radical technology they introduce empowers readers to transform challenging or negative human experiences into direct experiences of the Soul.",
