Along with her ex-boyfriend, Nick Evans, they make the trip to the Canadian Rockies where his Pack is located. Nick has promised her answers, and she knows that only he and the Pack can help her through this transition.The change in scenery isn’t an instant fix, however.Brooke still struggles with accepting what she’s become: a werewolf.

Brooke lives with constant nightmares of that night, and the only thing that helps ease her suffering is the one who caused her the most seven years ago: Nick. She shares a connection with him that she can’t quite explain; at first, it’s nothing more than familiarity before these feelings of betrayal slowly revert back to love and trust.As if trying to control her urges isn’t enough, when they arrive at the manor, Brooke is met with more challenges than she originally thought. A jealous female, an aggressive full-blood, and lies make adjusting to this life almost impossible.When the vampire coven they thought was defeated declares war on the Pack, can they come together as a team to save themselves, or will the secrets Brooke uncovers drive a wedge between her and her newfound family before they even stand a chance?",
