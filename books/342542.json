  "description": "A rainy day can be a great day ... to bring the outside inside and let imagination take over! And a few dazzling costumes can lead to a full day of dress-up for the four little girls who know just what they would do if they were morning glories or toads or ladybugs or worms. But even the hardiest of garden creatures must sleep when night falls and the fireflies come to say goodnight ... Here are Miela Ford and Anita Lobel at their mesmerizing best in a picture book to bring magic and light to any forecast -- or any time of day.",
