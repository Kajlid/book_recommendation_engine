  "description": "Finding her lover in bed with another woman is just the beginning of Julie Bird’s surreal trip to China. Losing her way in the suburbs of Beijing does little to improve her mood…and then the bandit shows up. Bandit, in twenty first century China? Things go from irritating to bizarre when a sword-wielding madman, or hero, rescues her. He claims to be the son of an emperor from three hundred years ago, and must return to fight for the throne. This man, although hot, is obviously not in his right mind. But what else could Julie do except repaying his kindness?",
