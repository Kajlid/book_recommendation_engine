  "description": "From the outside Claire Ridgeway looks like she has it all —a handsome, successful husband, three young, healthy daughters, a beautiful home in Toronto and a cottage in Lake Country. But Claire knows there are fissures in her marriage that could threaten everything. Even so, she’s shocked when Kirk announces he’s in love with another woman. Turns out his late nights at work have been spent wining and dining this other woman.  Shattered by Kirk’s revelation, Claire is sure her marriage is over and when Kirk suggests counselling she wonders if there’s any point. But with so much at stake, shouldn’t she at least try? Not just for her and Kirk’s sake, but for their daughters…and the fourth child Kirk doesn’t even know she’s expecting. (marriage in jeopardy, romance series, pregnant heroine, baby, family life, women's fiction, family drama)",
