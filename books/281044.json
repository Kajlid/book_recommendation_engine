  "title": "Boys and Burlesque",
  "description": "They were my whole world—four boys who morphed from best friends to lovers. They were my biggest fans, and my quiet strength. Until they left me. What I once gave freely became my weakness. Judged, shamed, alone, and with no one to count on, I found I’d do anything to survive. I never bared my soul, but my body was my ticket to success. And fame. Burlesque might not have been the type of dance I dreamed of, but it rocketed me to the top. My body was mine to own. If people wanted to see me, they had to pay for a ticket. But all my carefully laid plans and rebuilt dreams crash when the spotlight lands on the boys who used to be mine. Josh, Brant, Wes, and Landry are back, standing at the edge of the stage and holding the pieces of my heart. They want forgiveness. A second chance. But when I handed them my heart once, they shattered it. And I might not survive giving it to them again.",
