  "description": "Vampires made themselves known to humans eight years ago. Since then, things have become fairly routine for us. We get along with humans, we pay our taxes, and go about our lives with no complaint.I am Charity Harwood, vampire. When a warrior I dreamed of almost three hundred years ago walks into my bar, I’m suddenly thrust into the life of our police force, the Krieger. This ancient defender is all muscle and business.When Lycan’s arrive in Port Royal and start attacking vampires, Dragus comes in search of one that has recently been in my bar. That victim, Adam Castillo, and I share an ability that forces our lives to cross.Oh, did I mention that Lycan venom is like a bad poison to vampires? Well, it’ll take trust and a friendship with a witch to help find a cure.That is, if my intended mate will get over his aversion to me getting up close and personal with these rabid hybrids.",
