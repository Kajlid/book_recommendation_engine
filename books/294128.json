  "description": "Dorothy M. Johnson wrote dozens of highly acclaimed western stories and books in her long career. The stories in this book are her very best. They were ranked as four of the top five stories of the 20th century by the Western Writers of America, with \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" as number one. That story plus \"A Man Called Horse\" and \"The Hanging Tree\" became major Hollywood films. This is the first time Johnson's famous stories have been published together in one book. This edition is destined to earn a place in every western library. Great educational tool too!",
