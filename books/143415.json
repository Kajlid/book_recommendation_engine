  "description": "She’d met him at a chance encounter in an upscale bar in downtown Los Angeles. And then she’d did what many women do: she took a short cut to love. Before long she is lost in a haze of passion and desire and longing. Rarely are their trysts planned, but this much she knew: he owned her life. She had long given up her rights to it. And with his possession of her life, she had lost her self.",
