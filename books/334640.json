  "description": "Femme Metal By Nathalie Gray Alexandra Novona has been called many things. Soldier. Enemy. Bodyguard. Bitch. Her body's been through enough refits to trip every metal detector in the system. But nowadays, she's what is politely referred to as a \"privateer\". A new tag for an old job—slaver. On the Femme Metal, a tough, ugly-as-hell little ship, she prowls deep space procuring males. Human or alien. She doesn't much care. As long as they generate profit. And nothing will stop her from supplying her wealthy customers with top-grade male specimens for their brothel ships. Not even the seven-foot, blue-skinned, silver-haired wonder her customer very specifically requested. Unfortunately for Alex, she hadn't counted on the gorgeous Yithian being a Hunter or how her own attractiveness and desirability could get her and her crew into hot water. Sekmeth Meroh always gets his prey. For an exorbitant fee, he will catch anyone, of any race, on any world. He's the best of his kind—a Hunter—and sneaky to boot. Sekmeth's latest assignment—capture Alexandra Novona and her all female crew for a brothel ship near his own home world. One little problem… Neither Alex nor Sekmeth can keep their hands—or lips—to themselves.",
