He’s crude, crass, and has a filthy mouth, but I’m drawn to him. After everything I’ve been through, the arrangement he offers seems to be exactly what I need. What I didn’t expect is for him to be the answer to my prayers, healing me in ways I never thought possible. He awakens something in me I thought long dead. Will he ever want more, or am I fooling myself by thinking he could settle for someone like me?***VENOM***I wanted Emily the moment I saw her.All I could imagine was what I’d do to her if I got her in my bed. The more I get to know her, the more I see how deep her wounds are. She’s fragile. As much as I crave her body, bringing her into my world could break her, and not just emotionally. I can’t let that happen.I won’t.Men like me don’t get a happily ever after. Emily is better off without me, and I pray she doesn’t learn that the hard way.CAN BE READ AS A STANDALONE or in the series order:ForbiddenTemptedClaimedDeceptionSeductionRenascence",
