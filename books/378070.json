  "title": "Truth About Me: A Hijra Life Story",
  "description": "The Truth About Me is the unflinchingly courageous and moving autobiography of a Hijra (Eunuch) who fought ridicule, persecution and violence both within her home and outside to find a life of dignity. Revathi was born a boy, but felt and behaved like a girl. In telling her life story, Revathi evokes marvellously the deep unease of being in the wrong body that plagued her from childhood. To be true to herself, to escape the constant violence visited upon her by her family and community, the village born Revathi ran away to Delhi to join a house of Hijras. Her life became an incredible series of dangerous physical and emotional journeys to become a woman and to find love. Translated by V. Geetha from Tamil.",
