  "title": "Who Will Tell the People: The Betrayal of American Democracy",
  "description": "Who Will Tell the People is a passionate, eye-opening challenge to American democracy. Here is a tough-minded exploration of why we're in trouble, starting with the basic issues of who gets heard, who gets ignored, and why. Greider shows us the realities of power in Washington today, uncovering the hidden relationships that link politicians with corporations and the rich, and that subvert the needs of ordinary citizens.  How do we put meaning back into public life? Greider shares the stories of some citizens who have managed to crack Washington's \"Grand Bazaar\" of influence peddling as he reveals the structures designed to thwart them. Without naivet√© or cynicism, Greider shows us how the system can still be made to work for the people, and delineates the lines of battle in the struggle to save democracy. By showing us the reality of how the political decisions that shape our lives are made, William Greider explains how we can begin to take control once more.",
