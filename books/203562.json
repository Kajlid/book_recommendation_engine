  "description": "It’s 1920 and Alexander Stanley has been cursed to live as a frog longer than he lived as a human. On a fateful night in 1880, he is cursed in the arms of his lover. His love sent away and trapped in a desert spring, Alex is not sure he will ever escape. Gabriel, a scientist, appears as if by another sort of magic, one day dropping his pocket watch into the pond. Alex offers a trade, the return of the pocket watch for a rescue. What Alex doesn’t realize is that Gabriel needs rescuing just as much as he does.",
