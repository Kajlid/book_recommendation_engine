  "description": "When Donald Gardner's parents tell him they'll be taking an exciting road trip through Kansas, he openly cringes. He is sure it will be a boring summer vacation. But at one of their final roadside stops, they are approached by a poor woman offering to sell a strange item-a silver shoe. While Donald's mother is initially reluctant, she is smitten with the shoe and buys it.Wanting to impress his classmates, Donald brings it in for show-and-tell when the new school year starts. His friends liken the shoe to something out of The Wizard of Oz, and his teacher agrees the idea is not farfetched considering author L. Frank Baum wrote about \"silver shoes,\" not ruby slippers, which were strictly in the movie.Donald is skeptical that the shoe is anything more than a relic, but when he accepts a dare from his two best buddies to try it on, frightening and incredible things begin to happen. And when he meets George Clarke, a reclusive man who has been in hiding for many years, Donald finds out there is a lot more to Baum's story than he thinks.Join Donald as he unravels Baum's earth-shattering secret in Silver Shoes.",
