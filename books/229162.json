  "title": "The Elephant in the Room: Women Draw Their World",
  "description": "This book brings together sixteen comic artists, all women, from India and Germany to explore how women see the world and themselves, and how that is similar and different across cultures. In the striking, surprising, often funny drawings featured here, the women take apart received ideas of identity, power, love, sex, family, and bodies, putting them to new purposes to yield a rich interweaving of the personal and the political. Bold, original, outspoken, and thought-provoking, The Elephant in the Room is the perfect tonic for our dark affirming and entertaining but never less than powerfully political.",
