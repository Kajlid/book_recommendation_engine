  "description": "From the deepest expanse of Donald Morrison's imagination comes 10 tales that will showcase he writhing labyrinth of this authors mind. Among these pages we will follow a tormented boy with the ability to control the actions of others (Toby); an author that unwittingly makes a trade for his soul in order to write the perfect novel (The Devil's Script); journey to the old west for a tale of revenge (Spirit Walk), and walk the streets of Los Angeles with a Catholic priest that finds a new faith in his ability to commit the unforgivable sin of suicide (Fall to Grace). This is Donald Morrison at his most twisted; at home in his darkness.",
