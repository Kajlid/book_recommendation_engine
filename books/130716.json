  "description": "Camelot.  Resurrected on the tomb of what was once London, the land is protected by a force-field called the Endless Knot; and also by the Rooksâ€”the soldiers who are Selected from the citizenry each year, with neither warning nor the opportunity for appeal.  For centuries following a catastrophic war the Rooks have safeguarded Camelot and cut it off from the rest of the world, but their brutality has pushed some citizens to the brink. On the 12th of September, in the year 626, an unknown assailant opens fire on a party, killing over a dozen. The next day a team of rebels infiltrates and takes over a section of Parliament, the stronghold of the Rooks, determined to be the first people to leave Camelot in over seven hundred years.  Six young people are embroiled in these events. Tryamour and Unghared become hostages of the rebels, but Yvain is fighting with them. Dorigen is trying to find out how any of this happened, while Degare, a Rook himself, is trying to stop it at all costs. And Palamon is trapped in Parliament, with the woman who once saved his life.  But all is not as simple as it appears. The rebels are aided by fanatic outsiders and a traitor somewhere at the height of power. The Knights who control Camelot have their own agendas, and no one can be sure of who to trust.  It begs the question of whether the people of Camelot should fight to escape the Knot that's tied them in place for centuries...  Or if they're better off with the devils they know.",
