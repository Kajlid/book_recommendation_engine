Diplomats gather to draw a new map of Europe, and aristocrats and royals arrive to celebrate the downfall of Napoleon Bonaparte. Among them is Lady Caroline Wyndham, one of the wealthiest widows in England. But, like so many others at the Congress, Caroline has a dark secret.Caroline was born Karolina Vogl, the daughter of a radical Viennese printer. When her father was arrested by the secret police, Karolina’s childhood was stolen from her, lost in a pit of dark alchemy and despair. Now, under the protection of a new name and a new nationality, she has returned to Vienna to save her father at last. When she comes face-to-face with Michael Steinhüller, her father’s old apprentice, now a charming conman and professional survivor, they are both granted an unexpected chance at love…but the supernatural forces that shattered Caroline’s childhood still rule Vienna behind its glittering façade of balls and salons, and her disguise is more fragile than she realizes.",
