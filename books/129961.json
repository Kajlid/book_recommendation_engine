But everything is more fun with company, so Mr. Peanuts writes a letter to Cousin Squirrel and invites him for a visit!Featuring candid photographs of wild squirrels in handcrafted, homemade miniature settings, this irresistible book is sure to surprise and delight readers and animal lovers of every age!",
