  "description": "One spelled pumpkin spice latte. Three handsome but unfriendly neighbors. A town where the unexplained might just be magical… When Opal moves to the town of Silver Springs, the last thing she expects is to be greeted by three ridiculously attractive men as her neighbors. Unfortunately, they’re kind of jerks. Getting along with her neighbors is the least of her worries though; she has a writing deadline to meet, and to meet that deadline she’ll need lots of caffeine. One pumpkin spice latte later, the bickering between Opal and her cute neighbors changes into something fiery, something passionate. Fighting her feelings just might be impossible, and the only way to undo it is to figure out just what was so special about that latte. Will Opal’s heart win out, or will her head? Maybe that latte wasn’t such a bad thing after all… Opal is a standalone reverse harem romance. It is part of the Jewels Café series and contains steamy scenes.",
