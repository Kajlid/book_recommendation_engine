  "description": "A gripping and timely novel that follows Sigrid―the dry-witted detective from Derek B. Miller’s best-selling debut Norwegian by Night―from Oslo to the United States on a quest to find her missing brother.She knew it was a weird place. She’d heard the stories, seen the movies, read the books. But now police Chief Inspector Sigrid Ødegård has to leave her native Norway and actually go there; to that land across the Atlantic where her missing brother is implicated in the mysterious death of a prominent African American academic―America.Sigrid is plunged into a United States where race and identity, politics and promise, reverberate in every aspect of daily life. Working with―or, if necessary, against―the police, she must negotiate the local political minefields and navigate the backwoods of the Adirondacks to uncover the truth before events escalate further.Refreshingly funny, slyly perceptive, American by Day is “a superb novel on all levels” ( Times , UK).“Ingenious. Humorous. Wonderful.”―Lee Child",
