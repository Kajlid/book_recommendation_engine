  "description": "Stephanie Klein was an eighth grader with a weight problem. It was a problem at school, where the boys called her \"Moose,\" and it was a problem at home, where her father reminded her, \"No one likes fat girls.\" After many frustrating sessions with a nutritionist known as the fat doctor of Roslyn Heights, Long Island, Klein's parents enrolled her for a summer at fat camp. Determined to return to school thin and popular, without her \"lard arms\" and \"puckered ham,\" Stephanie embarked on a memorable journey that would shape more than just her body. It would shape her life.",
