  "description": "Sophia Cruz was an average 17-year-old girl from Mission Valley, until the day she had a knife put to her stomach and fear inserted into her heart. Some may have called it stupidity. She called it a necessary sacrifice. Why else would she leave everything behind and walk arm in arm with the devil into a world of prostitution and human imprisonment? This is Sophia's story. She wants you to know who she was before that day. Before she became just another missing girl . . .Note to Reader: This is a short novella, a tie-in to the upcoming full-length novel, 60 Days, due to release in 2014.",
