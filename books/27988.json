Survival becomes his only goal as he flees civilization for a chance to pursue a better life. Leading him into this vague hope for the future is a fox wildling who takes him far into the mountains and far beyond anything he has ever known. The war rages on in the cities, but Estin will find that where he has fled to is far from safe. Ultimately, Estin must decide what he is willing to do and become, as well as who to trust if he is to survive, no matter where he lives.",
