  "description": "**A sexy, standalone sports romance from NYT bestseller Lexi Ryan**  The favor seemed simple: Keep my new stepsister out of trouble for one summer. I’ve never met Grace Lee, but Mom tells me she’s a quiet and artsy college student with a troubled past. When I agreed to let her stay with me, I thought it was no big deal. I expected to share my apartment with a sullen girl who’d spend hours locked in her room.  I didn’t expect a walking fantasy determined to make me lose my cool.  I didn’t expect a woman with secrets so dark, so deep, I’d throw away everything if it would save her from the past.  Rushing in to do this favor is turning my life upside down—and not just because Grace needs her ass spanked. Keep her out of trouble? Grace is the trouble. And I want in.  RUSHING IN is a standalone novel in The Blackhawk Boys series. It contains heavy subject matter and is intended for mature readers.  Football. Secrets. Lies. Passion. These boys don’t play fair. Which Blackhawk Boy will steal your heart?  Book 1 - SPINNING OUT (Arrow's story)  Book 2 - RUSHING IN (Christopher's story)  Book 3 - GOING UNDER (Sebastian's story - coming late 2016) More Blackhawk Boys titles to be announced in 2017!",
