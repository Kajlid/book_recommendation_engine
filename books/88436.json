  "description": "He's faster than a speeding arrow... more powerful than the Sheriff of Nottingham... able to leap high taxes in a single bound! He's Mickey Mouse! He's back in color -- and traveling back in time: battling evil medievals in our second book of Floyd Gottfredson's Sunday classics. Donald Duck, Goofy, and mischievous Morty and Ferdie are invited along too... if they dare! Standout stories in this volume include \"The Robin Hood Adventure,\" in which Mickey joins the Merry Men: swordfighting, jousting, and risking his life to rob the rich! Then Mickey faces Gold Rush gunslingers as the \"Sheriff of Nugget Gulch\"-- and outwits the ever-sneaky Mortimer Mouse in \"Mickey's Rival!\" Restored from Studio art sources and enhanced with a meticulous recreation of the strips' original color, Robin Hood Rides Again also includes more than 30 pages of swashbuckling extra features. You'll enjoy coveted non-Mouse Disney comics by Gottfredson; rare behind-the- scenes art; and commentary by a Round Table of Mickey scholars.",
