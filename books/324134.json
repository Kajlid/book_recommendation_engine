  "description": "Ray's a former mob enforcer who heads west to live off his comfortable retirement, provided graciously by his ex-employers. He's got it all. A new place, a new business, and he's making a pretty good go of it. Better than most folks in 1935 California. Still, things aren't perfect. There's some bad stuff going down with his town, his employees, and local cult leader, Mr. Alistair. Things get even more complicated when former FBI agent Charlie shows up, needing his help. Can Ray resist Charlie's charms, or will fall for the man despite it being the worst idea in a long line of bad ideas?",
