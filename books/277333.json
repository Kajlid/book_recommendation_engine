  "description": "Sleeping Beauty had it easy. Her curse only made her take a nap when she turned 16. As if it wasnâ t bad enough already that because of her frost giant heritage from her father the kingâ s side of the family she was 6 feet tall when she was only 12 years old, poor Princess Bronwyn (the Bold) of Argonia was cursed at birth to tell nothing but lies. With her father away at war and her mother heavily pregnant, Bronwyn is even more in the way than usual, so she gets packed off to Wormroost, her auntâ s place in the glaciers, and en route she meets her musician/magician cousin Carole , a not-so-brave gypsy lad, and a princess-turned-swan. The lot of them encounter monsters, sorcerers, sea serpents, mercenary mages and sirens--many of whom are related to them. Without quite intending to, they embark on a quest to end the war, heal a battle-ravaged land, end a ban on magic and lift Bronwynâ s Bane.L. Sprague de Camp said, â I found BRONWYNâ S BANE delightful reading. I wish I had her fertility of imagination in thinking up amusing twists, turns and business of plot.â",
