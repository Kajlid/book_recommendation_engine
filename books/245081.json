  "description": "When Paul awakes in another dimension, bereft of time and space, he is certain he has died, for his memory is intact and he can recall the moments leading up to his death – but he is unable to speak. When he is urged to “find his voice” by his spirit guide, Ulysses, he is met with a startling realization of his post-life fate, as Ulysses assists him in charting a new course.Set in the southern bayous of Louisiana and beneath the majestic skies of Mississippi, Love In, Air In explores the very essence of the human experience and the connections between souls throughout.",
