  "description": "Mitch has had a bad year: his long term relationship ended, his firm went bust, and he's been drifting since then. His luck hasn't changed for the better when he gets off the bus in a small town a few days before Christmas hoping to find some work and wait out the holidays before moving on only to find that he has arrived in a werewolf controlled town on the night before full moon. Not the best place for a shape-shifting cougar to be. Finally, against his better judgment, he rescues a young boy being abused by four werewolves in human form... Mitch is desperate for a change in his luck, but he still has a way to travel before he finds it.",
