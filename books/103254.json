  "description": "The Bottom of the Sea is an e-book collection of five short stories from Zachary Jernigan, author of the acclaimed science fantasy novel No Return (Night Shade Books, 2013). At close to 30,000 words, these narratives span the whole range of speculative fiction: \"The War is Over and Everyone Wins\" is a near-future tale of racial and familial conflict. \"Fear of Drowning\" features a young woman on the cusp of love, on the cusp of betrayal, in a science fantasy universe of gods and angels. In the low fantasy \"The Bottom of the Sea,\" an old blind man discovers just how far he'll allow himself to be led by his adopted son. \"Pairs,\" a far future story, chronicles the revenge of one of the two living human beings left in existence. The contemporary fantasy \"All My Ghosts\" follows an immortal man as he makes his way across a frozen tundra to save his mortal son. All the while, he is plagued by ghosts.",
