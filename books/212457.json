  "title": "Atheism Advanced: Further Thoughts of a Freethinker",
  "description": "Atheism Advanced answers many questions, including: Why must atheists stop \"speaking Christian?\"â€”not only to prevent religionists from setting the terms of debate but also to prevent them from determining the very thoughts we think? Are there any religions without gods? How are gods created, and are they being manufactured today? Why is science necessarily atheistic? Why must atheists advance from being simply \"without gods\" to being \"Discredists,\" thinkers who reject belief-based reasoning altogether? Includes an anthropology of comparative religion.",
