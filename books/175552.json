  "description": "Anna Jennings is not having a good day. In a single morning, she’s caught with her pants down (literally), dealt with scalding coffee splashed across her lady humps and bathed a top client in a whirlwind of french fries. It can’t possibly get worse, right?  Add in a group of superhero coworkers, a super hot, super off-limits boss, a side-kick named Carl with a spandex fetish and a super villain named Captain Zinger, and Anna may have to admit defeat and hop the midnight train to Looneytown.  Now Anna must join forces with her team of superheroes and an accident-prone Carl to save her boyfriend, her sanity, oh, and the entire world.",
