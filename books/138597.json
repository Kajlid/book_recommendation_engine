  "title": "An Unlikely Duchess",
  "description": "Edward Crawdon, Duke of Hartridge is being forced by his slightly overbearing, but loving mother to spend time with her old friends at their estate in Ireland. He is not aware but a contract exists between the two families that states Edward must marry their eldest daughter. On the day of his arrival Edward, who is yet to be made aware of the contract, meets Lady Rebecca, Caroline’s younger sister under very unusual circumstances. Edward cannot stop thinking about Lady Rebecca but she is completely unsuited to being a duchess. However, she becomes rather a toast of the Ton and Edward realises that he cannot stand idly by and watch Rebecca marry someone else. He cannot marry her but does not want her to marry anyone else! Ultimately, Edward must decide; will he admit his true feelings for Rebecca? Will he defy his responsibilities and duties, his idea of a “proper” duchess and follow his heart?",
