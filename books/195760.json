  "description": "Right when Jane and Brady have everything right in the world, they lose the one thing they didn’t know they wanted. The pain is too much, the expectations are too high and the pressure they put on each other tears them a part.  They have one chance to make it right, one chance to try and move on from the hurt and pain but is Jane ready to put her past behind her or is she going to take the easy road out and give up?  The drama finally concludes in this heart-wrenching series full of twists, turns, cliffhangers, deaths, and hot, steamy nights.  Life isn’t as easy as it seems, especially under the heat of living in Hot-Lanta.",
