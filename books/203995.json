  "description": "\"Original in concept and delightful in style\"-GoodbooksToday Some die for love......or power. Would you? This is the burning question which must be answered. The Lord of Fire's adventures continue, as he takes the helm of the Alliance between humankind and his own Gaian clan.  Newly elected as governor of Baram, entrusted by title to fulfil ancient prophecy as Supreme Protector of both races, Luminor sends his most promising young warrior Xandor to search for other lost Gaians and bring them to safety.  Xandor's mission takes unexpected turns, as he also searches for his betrothed, and his sense of duty and honour are tested to the limit.  Meanwhile, a terrible threat looms, a challenge to Luminor's birthright, and to save all his people from its dark magic, he must take the battle to a foreign land, playing into the hands of a power-mad adversary.  Luminor's unique ability to control the Five Fires, courage and love are on his side, but will it be enough to settle the question of power once and for all........  Or will he die trying?",
