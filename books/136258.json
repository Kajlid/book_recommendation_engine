  "description": "This Trio Set of novellas showcases the tantalizing stories of three sexy performers of Sanguelascivia, exclusive Erotic theatre for Vampires: Giuliana, Vincenzo & Gretchen.  'The Submission of Giuliana'\"As I lay there being taken by two men, my orgasm swept through me, yet it was for another who had pleasured me only in the realm of my mind.\"Giuliana never dreamed life would lead her to where she is now-- serving as a courtesan in the swanky vampire theatre Sanguelascivia in Venice, Italy. Some days, she hates to admit, she loves her job-- what woman wouldn't enjoy being sexually pleasured in a variety of new ways every day? She has been serviced by some of the most mouthwatering men she has ever laid eyes on. And still other days, she cannot believe she has lowered herself to this. Then there are the Vampire patrons to whom she is expected to submit and service privately after the shows. Her life at Sanguelascivia is in severe contrast to the simple life she once knew with her husband and child. But she no longer allows herself to think of them. It is too painful to face the loss.Giuliana vowed she would never love again. That is, until she sees Vincenzo her first night at the theatre and something stirs deep within her. Night after night she aches as she watches him with other women, wondering when she will finally have her turn to be pleasured by him. The only way she is able to endure her performances with the other men-- and oft times women-- is to fantasize about him pleasuring her.Will she ever feel him against her skin, feel his lips hot upon hers, feel him moving inside of her?  'La Amore di Vincenzo'“The first time I laid eyes upon her, I was instantly mesmerized by her softness, her beauty. I knew at once that I was done for… never would I want another woman.”Vincenzo was reasonably happy with his life. He had a stylish place to live and a job most other men would die for— having sex with multiple partners every night and servicing wealthy clients in the VIP, male and female alike. For years now, he had been one of the star performers at Sanguelascivia, a swanky erotic nightclub in Venice for the Vampire elite.But then Giuliana wandered in to the club, a destitute young widow who had nowhere else to turn. She was nothing like the other women there at Sanguelascivia. Sure, many of them were gorgeous and naturally, he enjoyed fucking them, but none of them ever interested him in the least. Perhaps it was merely because Giuliana was not yet hardened by this lifestyle. She was beautiful in a soft and compassionate kind of way that he had not known in a long time. Never has Vincenzo seen anyone quite like her. And now, he cannot seem to get her out of his mind. Nor does he want to.Vincenzo begins fantasizing about Giuliana during his every performance with the other women. Then he must agonizingly witness her initiation performance with two men. Will he be able to stand it, or will his emotion get the better of him? Will they ever be scheduled to perform together so that he may know the pleasure of being with her? It is as if someone is determined to keep them apart…But then something happens which forces Vincenzo to act quick, altering the course of both of their fates forever. He has to make the most difficult choice of his life— fleeing Sanguelascivia, and the woman he loves.Will he ever see Giuliana again or will he go through eternity longing for the one woman who has ever touched his heart? 'The Seduction of Gretchen'“He has me so flustered— just right where he wants me— pulse quickened, heart pounding… it’s like my first time all over again!”Gretchen has worked at Sanguelascivia as an erotic performer and blood courtesan for several years, done it all, seen it all. She thought she had grown numb to the Vampires whom she was required to service. It was just a job. They were just the clientele. That is, until the night Lucius shows up. While on stage in the midst of her performance, Gretchen first locks eyes with him, his gleaming blue eyes never departing from her. With every move she makes, she feels him watching her, making her hotter by the second. She fully expects him to be there after the performance to request her services, but to her surprise, he is nowhere to be seen. Perplexed, Gretchen tries to brush him from her mind, yet hard as she may try, she cannot. What is it about him? No man— human or Vampire— has ever had her feeling quite like this, has ever penetrated her soul as he had. And she isn’t sure whether she likes it. But one thing is sure, there is no denying it. What is happening to her?Then soon again Lucius is there, boring into her with those cryptic eyes. And once more, he disappears before the end of the night. She finds herself fantasizing over this Vampire— something which she never thought she would do. Gretchen resolves the next time she sees him, she’ll be damned if he’s going to slip away again without speaking to her. She will take matters into her own hands if she must. She will request him!When at last she realises her long-awaited private session with him, Gretchen discovers Lucius has a delicious secret which she never thought possible. And just as furtively as he appears, so does he vanish once more. Left with so many questions, she can scarcely wait to see him again. And Lucius only feeds her preoccupation with him, sending her expensive gifts in between his random visits. Inferring a sense of urgency, this enigmatic Vampire suddenly asks to come away with him to Paris to be his bonded blood servant— and lover. Relishing her sexual freedom, Gretchen has never been one to desire this arrangement so many others hoped for. However, she fears that if she lets him go, she will never see him again, feel him again. But, what will be in store for her once she leaves the familiar comfort of Sanguelascivia?Warning: Contains steamy Sensuality & Explicit Sexuality.
