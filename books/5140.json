  "description": "Bob Dylan wrote the classic song \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" and thereby unforgettably marked the passing of an otherwise insignificant character in the movie \"Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid\".Brendan Gisby has written this utterly beautiful novella to honour the short life of his father, a man of seemingly as little significance.The story is narrated with haunting subtlety, rhythm and depth of feeling by his teenage son as he takes a bus ride back to school for the first day of a new term, where he will have to announce his father's sudden death and deal with the resultant reactions without bursting into tears. He also has to come to terms with the fact that, on reflection, there is a huge amount he doesn't know about his father and that all he is really left with are snippets of personal memories.Make no mistake, THE BOOKIE'S RUNNER is a modern masterpiece. In writing it, Brendan Gisby has not only honoured his father, he has ennobled him.",
