  "description": "In Two Faint Lines in the Violet, Kiernan explores poetry’s unique ability to document yet revision the nuclear age, how when singing somewhere between the personal and political—if we listen closely—we might hear the social.Fueled by her investigation into Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Plant—the first large-scale nuclear unit and also the first shut down due to embrittlement concerns—the etiology of her father's brain tumor, and her experiences coming of age in New York City, she laments and fêtes the abundance of lessons learned, ultimately tuning in to \"the electricity of life\" (Amy King), where personal and industrial meltdowns converse and converge.Judith Vollmer, in Women's Review of Books, January/February 2016, says \"Kiernan's sonic variation is keen and her palette complex in this, her debut book of poetry, the title of which comes from Marie Curie's visual accounting of beauty and power hidden from the naked eye.\"",
