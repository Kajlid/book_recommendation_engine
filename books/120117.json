  "title": "Tell It to the World: International Justice and the Secret Campaign to Hide Mass Murder in Kosovo",
  "description": "On April 5, 1999, local police in Serbia found a truck floating half-submerged in the Danube River. When they pulled it to shore and opened the cargo hold they found it filled with human bodies. The truck, and the bodies, then disappeared.The full picture would only emerge years later, when the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia investigated and prosecuted the chief architects of the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo. It exposed a stunning secret campaign to murder Kosovo Albanians and systematically hide the evidence by transporting their bodies hundreds of kilometres away.Eliott Behar, a former war crimes prosecutor at the Tribunal, tells the true story of what unfolded through the eyewitnesses, victims, and perpetrators who testified in The Hague. Tell It to the World takes you inside the international criminal justice system, attesting to the strength and resilience of the human spirit and the darkness into which we can descend.",
