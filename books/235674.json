  "description": "A new witch in town, a brutal bloodbath, and I'm out of options.Evil gathers in the Louisiana swamps, and it comes for the witches of New Orleans. If I had known, maybe I would have kept my guard up. I may have changed the focus of the city's witches to defense, instead of learning. But vanquishing the city's demons left us complacent, and comfortable. We celebrated, and enjoyed the period of peace that followed.But we have no idea of the danger we're all in.When the vampires come in the night, swift and deadly, the witches of the city are left scattered, hurt, and broken. Now, wracked with grief for the injured and the dead, I have to find a way to lead, but there are those who won't make that easy for me; those who would rather go back to the old days, where witches killed vampires with impunity, whether they were decent people or not. I can't allow that to happen. We worked too hard to make New Orleans an inclusive place, and I'll die before I let someone destroy everything we've built.",
