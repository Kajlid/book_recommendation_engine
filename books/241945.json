  "description": "He needs to stop running from his mistakes. Cowboy or doctor? Sawyer McCord has been wrestling with that question since he came home to the Circle H after fleeing his remote clinic in the Himalayas. A tragedy there has him doubting his medical skills, but his reception on the ranch has been chilly at best. Sawyer can't blame his family—or Olivia Wilson, his brother's ex—for their anger. So why does Olivia's opinion of him suddenly matter so much? Sawyer has unfinished business here and at his clinic. If he's ever going to redeem himself, he needs to start by making amends to the one woman who might never forgive him.",
