  "description": "S’bren doesn’t realize what a mess he’s stepping in when he steals me away. He just wants to resonate. Sweet, right? But his methods are all wrong and resonance doesn’t look as if it's happening anytime soon for either of us.  So I’m going to use this time away from the camp as an opportunity. We’re going to go exploring and not return to the beach camp until I'm good and ready. It's one part punishment for him - being my guide - and one part adventure for me. We'll have fun, swing from some vines in the fruit cave, and then return to Icehome when we're good and ready.  What's not part of the plan? Falling in love. Matters of the heart are tricky when the khui gets the final say...and mine is totally silent.",
