  "description": "**NOT A STANDALONE SERIES! HIGHLY recommend to read Darkness & Collector Series prior. Lightness Saga contains story-lines, world-building, and spoilers from previous books and characters. Starting with Darkness Series> Collector Series> Lightness Saga. A war is brewing. Kennedy is one of the last known Druids. Wanted dead by the Seelie Queen and as a coveted asset to defeat this cruel ruler, Kennedy has become a mark. Especially by a sexy, merciless Dark Dweller, Lorcan Dragen. Kidnapped and taken prisoner, Kennedy’s life takes a dramatic turn, down a path she never imagined. Spending time with a man who killed her best friend’s mother and her friend, she knows he is not someone she should care about. But the longer she spends with her enemy, the more her feelings blur the line between what is right and wrong, what is true and what is not. As her magic grows, so does the shy, nerdy girl, and she soon realizes nothing on a list or in a book will prepare her for what is ahead. Even her own feelings. **Sexual content, language, alcohol, violence, death, and other mature content intended for readers 17 and older.",
