  "title": "Making Learning Whole: How Seven Principles of Teaching Can Transform Education",
  "description": "New in Paperback! Make learning more meaningful by teaching the \"whole game\" David Perkins, a noted authority on teaching and learning and co-director of Harvard's Project Zero, introduces a practical and research-based framework for teaching. He describes how teaching any subject at any level can be made more effective if students are introduced to the \"whole game,\" rather than isolated pieces of a discipline. Perkins explains how learning academic subjects should be approached like learning baseball or any game, and he demonstrates this with seven principles for making learning from making the game worth playing (emphasizing the importance of motivation to sustained learning), to working on the hard parts (the importance of thoughtful practice), to learning how to learn (developing self-managed learners). At the end of each chapter, Perkins includes \"Wonders of Learning,\" a summary of the key ideas.",
