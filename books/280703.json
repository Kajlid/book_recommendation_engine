  "description": "In a split second, life can steal a last breath ... and derail all future plans. While flying home after a phone call that left me heartbroken, a row to myself would have been ideal. Instead, I was unknowingly sitting shoulder to shoulder with a strikingly attractive single dad and ex-Marine. I could have pretended not to notice the man, but there was something familiar about him. It didn’t take long before I pieced together where I knew him from or why he was back in my life.With chaos holding me hostage, I wanted to hide but couldn’t avoid Brett Pearson, our old family friend, and my teenage crush, because he kindly offered to help out with my family’s business—The Barrel House. Handling my father’s distillery would be a distraction from my brutal reality. Except, I never paid close attention to the art of making bourbon, unlike Brett, who was full of bourbon knowledge. He offered to teach me a thing or two, but all I could focus on was the way his lips moved when he spoke to me.I needed to grieve, and my head was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but my heart was splitting at the seams. Bourbon was spilled, drinks were shared, but could passion ignite from a dying last wish?",
