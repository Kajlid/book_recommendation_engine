  "description": "Alexander Keane didn't believe in destiny — until he met Jane Layton. Following a chance encounter, they are surprisingly paired up for a dance competition. When they share a waltz, it's as though time is standing still. They seem like a perfect match — except for one simple problem. Jane will settle for nothing less than a temple marriage. But Alex hasn't been to church since he was fifteen, the year his father left their family.Four years later, even though they both know they're meant to be together, Alex still holds on to his aversion to attending church, and Jane maintains her conviction that she will be married in the temple, or not at all. But then a series of dramatic events turn both their lives upside down. Through an experience that could never be explained by logic, Alex gets a glimpse into the past that could forever change both their futures — but only if he can let go of his pride enough to forgive another.",
