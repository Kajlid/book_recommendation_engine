  "description": "\"What a journey you have been on, Joy Montgomery. But it isn't over yet . . . . No . . . I'm afraid you have much farther to go.\" Joy Montgomery is a hero. The Treemakers are finally home, safe and free in a well-deserved and long dreamed of paradise. The children can now settle into normal, carefree lives. Or so they thought. Troubled by secrets their newfound paradise reveals, coupled with tangled feelings toward those she loves, Joy sees the painful truth: they're still prisoners forever wounded by the effects of a traumatic past. An ominous warning from a trusted friend strengthens her resolve to never let down her guard, to always be prepared, to be ready for war . . . both inside and out. Once again, the Treemakers are faced with escaping disaster, and Joy's strength is pushed to its limit, her sanity pushed to the brink of collapse. Just when their situation couldn't get any more desperate, they're thrust into a series of shocking tribulations that are nothing short of nightmarish. Will the Treemakers of Greenleigh annihilate the forces of evil that seek to capture and control their souls? Or will the magic Joy thought she found turn out to be just another illusion? This is the second book in the Treemakers Trilogy. This series is intended for mature YA audiences, as there are certain mature themes (abuse, character deaths, etc., ) which may be too emotionally intense for younger readers.",
