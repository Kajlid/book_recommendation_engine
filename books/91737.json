  "description": "The War Between the States is raging. Three brothers barely out of their teens, Ephraim, George, and Ely Watson, are all trying to survive the heart-wrenching bloodshed as soldiers enlisted in the 17th Connecticut - a regiment under the command of Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant. Their operation proves to be quite dangerous, especially since their regiment is going hand-to-hand and toe-to-toe with the belligerent rebel mastermind, Confederate Commander General Robert E. Lee. In the months to come, the strife of war will cost many thousands of men their lives, namely Ephraim and George Watson. Though grief-stricken, the sole surviving brother Ely wills himself to remain brave and courageous for the sake of his loved ones back home, all awaiting his safe return. He will grab a rare opportunity to leave the military to start afresh, and attempt to bury the painful memories of the war forever.",
