Do not be tempted to go in, and temped you will be, for the Devi of the temple grants wishes. But she must be promised something in return…  Aditi talked to the stars when she was married to a man ten years older than herself, and they whispered to her that she was responsible for her own happiness.

And then she hears about the temple of the Devi… and she is tempted!",
