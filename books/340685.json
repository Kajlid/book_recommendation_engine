  "description": "Poetry from former national poet of Palestine, illustrated by original drawings by John BergerMahmoud Darwish was the Palestinian national poet. One of the greatest poets of the last half century, his work evokes the loss of his homeland and is suffused with the pain of dispossession and exile. His poems display a brilliant acuity, a passion for and openness to the world and, above all, a deep and abiding humanity. Here, his close friends John Berger and Rema Hammami present a beautiful new translation of two of Darwishâ€™s later works. Illustrated with original drawings by John Berger, Mural is a testimony to one of the most important and powerful poets of our age.",
