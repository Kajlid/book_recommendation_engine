Riley already has some pretty weird traitsâ€”telekinesis, astral travel and mind-reading abilities, to name a few. Her dreams are so real to her that her hands ache in the morning from pushing the heavy fruit cart down the path to the marketplace in her dreams. She even feels the kisses of the man that's in her dreams. Riley discovers that the dreams she is experiencing are past life dreams. She begins to believe this when she goes to University and she meets Michael, a guy that when she looks into his eyes, she sees the man from her dreams and she knows they have to be together. As their young love blooms her dreams reveal to her that Michael could be in danger. When another mind-reader, Brenda, won't leave him alone and threatens the lives of both Riley and Michael, Riley vows to do anything to keep him alive.",
