  "description": "Ezra Fontaine, a cutthroat CEO and divorcé, whose only soft spot is for his luxury car collection. Anton 'Tony' Cargill, a proud slacker and greasemonkey, who develops a work ethic for the first time in his life when he gets his hands on his richest (and finest) customer's private number. After a spontaneous string of drunken texts, Tony’s ‘natural gifts’ have Fontaine on the hook. But landing the silver fox won’t be as simple as just whipping it out. Or will it? Stealing the Silver Fox is a high heat, reverse age gap (younger top) MM romance which takes place in the same universe as Claiming the Cleanfreak and the Fresh Taste of Ink series.",
