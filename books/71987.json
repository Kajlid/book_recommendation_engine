Now that she's back in Broken Bend, Louisiana, it's clear that putting down roots may be just as tough as putting out fires. To her surprise, sweet Ava next door makes Caley's new nanny job feel fulfilling. But Ava's single father, rancher Brady McCollough, is a play-it-safe kind of fellow…not what Caley's used to facing. He's focused on protecting Ava—yet he can't ignore Caley's incredible effect on her. Or on his guarded heart. And with a leap of faith, they might both find life's best adventure: love.",
