  "description": "Jasper has finally taken the step to be with his mate, leaving everything and everyone he knows behind. Starting over is hard, especially when you find out your Alpha mate is controlling and dominatingâ€”something Jasper isn't going to stand for. Zeus tries to cope with the fact that Jasper isn't as submissive as he wants him to be. Trying to model his relationship after what his parents had isn't working out so well. Can he give up his control in order to save his relationship? Toby Kramer is human, and he's running from a man who wants to see him dead after finding out Toby unknowingly slept with the guy's partner. He ends up in Pride Pack Valley, trying to start over when an obviously committed couple makes a play for him. Toby wants no part of that. Can Jasper teach Zeus to let go of his control while teaching Toby to trust that they aren't out to toy with him? Jasper has his hands full with his two men when trouble finds Toby and tries to take his little mate away from them. Each book in Lynn Hagen's Zeus's Pack collection features a different romantic trio. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
