  "description": "In Heir Apparent there are as many ways to win as there are to get killed. \"A stylish tale [that] addresses both fantasy gaming and censorship.\" ( New York Times Book Review)From Edgar Award-winning author Vivian Vande Velde comes a rollicking story that puts a high-tech twist on the classic medieval fantasy-adventure.In the virtual reality game Heir Apparent, there are way too many ways to get killed--and Giannine seems to be finding them all. Which is a shame, because unless she can get the magic ring, locate the stolen treasure, answer the dwarf's dumb riddles, impress the head-chopping statue, charm the army of ghosts, fend off the barbarians, and defeat the man-eating dragon, she'll never win.And she has to, because losing means she'll die --for real this time.Junior Library Guild Selection * New York Public Library Book for the Teen Age",
