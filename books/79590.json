  "description": "Good versus Evil. Light versus Dark. It's a battle that has been fought since the beginning of time and all Rhiana wanted out of life was to be able to do her part in tipping the scales in the favor of good & light each day. With the help of her coven that stretches across continents and the support of the deities above she truly believes her actions make a difference in the world. Mundane her life isn't, but in a matter of hours it becomes turned upside down so many times Rhiana isn't sure she will ever get it straightened out again. There are other forces working against her, natural and otherwise, and they've decided to strike where it would hurt the most - members of the High Priestess's coven. The brutal attacks are followed with a death threat that strikes fear in everyone and Rhiana starts to wonder if she'll be able to protect the people she loves and defeat an evil that thirsts for nothing less than complete destruction. With the help of every witch in her coven and her abilities in the Craft she decides to fight for everything that she loves and believes in. Will it be enough?",
