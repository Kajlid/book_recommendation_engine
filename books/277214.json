Romance isn’t even on the radar. Until one little package changes everything.  In a single mind-blowing hour, I end up with a package meant for Valentina Smith, and I find out she’s innocent & untouched. I won’t even mention what’s in that package.  Next thing I know, my other brain gets the best of me. Valentina deserves the best, so that brain says, running my mouth like it has no business.  I don’t expect to fall for her. So hard it brings me to my knees. Did I mention she’s meant to be worshipped?  Valentina  O.M.G. Hotter than sin Lucas Cole got my package. And opened it. I just knew God had it in for me.  I’ve got a problem to solve with just the solution. Until Lucas ends up with my, ahem, toy.  Lucas is everything I can’t have—hot, broody, and the kind of guy who rescues people for a living. I don’t need to be rescued, but I wouldn’t mind a taste of the rest.  *This is a full-length, standalone romance with a guaranteed HEA.",
