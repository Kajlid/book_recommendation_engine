  "description": "\"Sophie Garou is a master at taming her inner beast, which comes in handy since she's a werewolf. With a big promotion at work and a supersexy boyfriend, Heath (whom she recently spotted leaving a jewelry store with a beguiling ring box), she's one happy girl. But when Heath starts spending long nights at the office with his new associate--a dead-ringer for Career Day Barbie--Sophie smells trouble. And when her professional relationship with her big new client--who also happens to be Texas's brilliantly blue-eyes most eligible bachelor--begins to sizzle, she wonders if her animal instincts are leading her in the wrong direction. Just when it seems that things can't get any more complicated, they do. The Houston werewolf pack has sniffed Sophie out, and their message is chillingly clear: you're either with us or against us. And unless she can prove that she's with them, the next full moon may just be her last.\" ---- From Back cover",
