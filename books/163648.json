Murder or self-defense, what did it matter? One man was dead and another wanted revenge.Having grown up with a silver spoon in his mouth, John is a young man who sets out on an adventure of self-discovery. His confidence is on the rise until a single failure in judgment sends him fleeing for his life. Wanted for murder, John’s flight carries him throughout a nation broken by war and stitched together by the transcontinental railroad. Along the way he encounters an array of colorful characters. Friend or enemy, mentor or tormentor, each will have a profound impact on John and his fate. Hounded by a mercenary posse, John must remain a step ahead to survive while waiting for a resolution he fears will never come.",
