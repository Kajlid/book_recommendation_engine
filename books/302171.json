They have a reputation to uphold and me… I have a reputation to avoid. I need to stay hidden. I need to stay safe.Or else he’ll find me, just as he always has.But there’s a problem with that.I’m not very good at staying hidden, and these boys… they’re not very good at keeping secrets.Between the four of us, we’re bound to run into chaos. Just like we’re bound in other ways.Wolf Bonded is a full-length romance novel with multiple love interests. It’s the first book in the Wolfish trilogy, a paranormal series where the main character has no intent to choose just one of the sexy werewolves who’ve fallen head-over-heels for her—whether they like it or not.",
