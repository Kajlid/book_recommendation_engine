  "description": "Natalie Kempe doesn’t feel anything, but that might have something to do with the fact that her sister has died, her dad is sick and now her mom doesn't want her. She’s about to meet someone though who will make her feel—whether she wants to or not…'I was twelve when my sister died, but fifteen when all my messed-up-ness started to come out. Maybe I knew the way I was going about things wasn't normal at the time, but I didn't care. If it occurred to me to do something—it didn't matter what it was—I’d just do it. Kane was one of those things I just did. He was the smartest guy in our school. He was also a trained fighter and a car thief. No one messed with Kane. Except… I did.'Parties, sex, violence, friendship, laughter, love and sacrifice. After Nothing is compelling, challenging and real.After Nothing has adult themes and content—including intimate partner violence. Recommended for readers 18+",
