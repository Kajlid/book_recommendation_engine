  "description": "My plans for a solitary weekend of hiking and hot-tubbing at my family’s cabin in the mountains take a turn when I arrive at dusk, only to discover it’s been rented out. The unexpected guests aren’t actually strangers, though. They’re construction workers who renovated my college dorm. Who growled at any boy who dared to look in my direction while I was trying to study. But I don’t need protection this weekend. I’m looking for a sweet kind of oblivion that it turns out only four strong arms can provide. Little do I realize they want a lot more than forty-eight hours of uninhibited bliss. These possessive men want double the happily ever after.",
