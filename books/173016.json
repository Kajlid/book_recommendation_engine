  "title": "PLOTINUS Ennead IVI.3-4.29: Problems Concerning the Soul: Translation, with an Introduction and Commentary",
  "description": "For Plotinus, the nature and status of the human soul is one of the central problems of philosophy.  Ennead  IV.3­–4.29 constitutes his most penetrating enquiry into this topic, addressing the issues of the relation of the individual soul to the World Soul, the descent of the soul into body, its relations with that body, problems of personal identity and the nature of memory, sense perception, and the true seat of the emotions —many of which still have a resonance today. The treatise is an excellent example of Plotinus’ distinctive method of not dogmatic (though he is no sceptic), but worrying away at questions until he has uncovered their complexities to the best of his ability. Such a work requires detailed commentary, such as is provided here, to tease out fully the fascinating convolutions of his thought.",
