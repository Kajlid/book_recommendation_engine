  "title": "All My Love, Jesus: Personal Reminders From the Heart of God",
  "description": "All My Love, Jesus is a collection of devotions and encouraging reminders lovingly selected from my personal prayer journal written over the past 41+ years of ministry. They are God's reminders to you, the reader, that He alone is your source of hope, strength, and encouragement, no matter the problem, situation, or circumstance you may be facing in your life at any given moment. Unlike most devotionals, those included in All My Love, Jesus can be chosen by title, scripture, topic, or by date for special holidays, making it ideal to meet your specific need whenever you really need it. Devotions are also broken down into 25 key topics that all of us face throughout our lives, ranging from anger, loneliness, perseverance, and hope, to faith, God's will, trust, and temptation. Each devotion was written for deep thought and spiritual reflection, or for a quick pick-me-up when heading out the door to face your busy day and just need a word of God's encouragement. Whether you're a student of the Bible or a new believer, All My Love, Jesus will become as much a part of your morning as a cup of coffee, or a part of your evening as a cup of tea, and will be just as refreshing. Written in a simple, down-to-earth style, this devotional will make an ideal must-read for anyone who needs to be reminded that God is still God and God is still good!",
