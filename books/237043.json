  "description": "Arthur and Friends is the continued adventures of Arthur, the plucky, scruffy stray dog from Ecuador who followed his owner Mikael through the jungle to find his forever home. From Arthur's first Christmas in Sweden and trips to London, to a terrifying bout of illness and family camping adventures, Arthur and Friends is the next gripping, uplifting chapter of Arthur and Mikael's story. Interspersed with this narrative are heart-warming, moving readers' stories of their own rescue dogs. From Ecuador to America to Australia and everywhere in between, the stories of these other 'Arthurs' prove both that dogs are man's best friend, and that a little kindness can go a very long way.",
