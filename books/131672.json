  "description": "Trinka lives in a lofty world called Ellipsis, where schools prize their students' abilities to predict the future … or at least, she does until she flunks out of her fantastical school. She is sent away to join her father in a watery world where she won’t need talent. But when she decides to get there by stowing away on the airships run by the mysterious dream merchants, she ends up on a journey she never could have imagined.As she crosses into unfamiliar worlds full of unexpected adventures, Trinka finds herself both helped and hindered by an ever-growing collection of talismans—strange objects and strange creatures given to her by the people she encounters on her journey. Along the way, Trinka discovers the secrets that have fractured her family and scattered them across the four worlds. But will she find the strength, courage, and confidence to do what no one (especially her) has ever believed she could?",
