  "title": "Roman's Redemption",
  "description": "I once told you, \"Every sin I commit, every life I end, every soul I purchase, I do so to watch in gratifying amusement as it fades out. I've taken these lives with whole and complete intentions of watching my sins and transgressions affect and alter the life of others.\" I'm afraid those words no longer hold even a thread of truth. The man you once knew is now nothing more than a ghost. The blood staining my hands is no longer a consequence of my amusement. I have become pure evil. The blood you see is the result of my visceral need to hinder the torment and desolation left in my wife's wake. If you are foolish enough to believe all men are worthy of redemption, even those of us born evil, take my hand and allow me to show you what I believe about Redemption. For this is, after all Roman's Redemption. \n***This book contains raw and graphic sex, obscene language, violence, torture, rape, and assault. This book is intended for MATURE AUDIENCE MEMBER'S ONLY and NOT intended for the weak at heart, nor persons with triggers related to assault, rape, or abuse.***",
