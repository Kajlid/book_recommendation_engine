  "title": "The Shadow Hunter",
  "description": "On a moonlit night 30,000 years ago, a young Neanderthal boy dreamed a true dream. In his dream, the spirit of the cave bear commands the boy to follow her. He brings the spiritual beliefs of his people to this alien world, while maintaining a connection with the earth and with the spirits of animals. The clash of prehistoric shamanic traditions with future technology makes for a gripping taleâ€”the first novel written by this Nebula Award-winning author. This riveting tale is an updated version of the author's first published novel, and reflects current technology changes in the world since its original publication in 1982.",
