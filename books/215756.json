  "description": "Chloe Lucesco and her cropduster, Persephone, soar into the heart of Washington's apple country in search of a fresh start. But despite her best efforts, Chloe once again finds herself waking in a strange motel room after a night of dancing on tables. During her unexpected first encounter with the aloof César Amador Faramundo, Chloe is surprised by her intense need for his presence, and intrigued by his reluctance to discuss Demeter Greene, the mysterious recluse known to locals as “la Diabla.”When a malevolent force nearly swats Persephone from the skies over la Diabla’s orchards, not even César can prevent her plunge into the mystery hidden deep within a gnarled grove of trees. Now too deeply involved to simply fly away, Chloe must unravel a knotted secret that binds her unremembered past to nymphs dancing in woodland rites, the man who can change her life, and the matriarch who might end it.An ancient act of mercy stalks the gods who walk among us, and whispers a haunting reminder of the impermanence of voice.",
