  "title": "My Body in Nine Parts",
  "description": "Fiction. Jewish studies. For decades, Raymond Federman has been dazzling readers with his unique brand of \"surfiction\"--throwing zany words all over the page and inserting himself into every fiction, often through such zany alter egos as Moinous and Namredef. Now comes the greatest self-reverential work of all as Federman spins all manner of tales of various parts of his own body, recounting his childhood in France, adult life in the U.S., Jewish heritage, and career as a writer, with no effort made to distinguish between fact and fiction, memory and imagination. Previously published in France as Mon corps en neuf parties, Federman's masterpiece is now available for the first time in English, with augmented translation by the author and accompanied by ten photographs by Steve Murez.",
