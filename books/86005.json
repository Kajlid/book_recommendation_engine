  "description": "James Castleden has had enough of the press surrounding him and his club. Ravage is his place to let loose. He is possessive and dominant. When the younger sister of the woman he used to date walks into his club, James is not ready for the instant attraction he feels toward her. Prudence Star fell in love with James seven years ago. She is no shy virgin and knows exactly what he is. James does not scare her. She’s read the reports about his association with club Possession and she craves what only he can give her. When their flirting deepens, James cannot stop the craving inside him to own, to claim, and to take Prudence as his woman. But Possession and Ravage are under serious threat. Dominic and Eugene were just the beginning. There is nowhere to hide and no way to keep his woman safe. The Owners have no idea who they’re really dealing with.",
