  "description": "KikiThere's no way I'm letting this alien who calls me his Xiveri mate claim me as his. He may say the right things and stir emotions in me I never expected to feel again for any male, but his kind has already taken too much from me as is.Trapped now on his harsh, snow-consumed planet waiting to be hunted, with no way of escape, I'll do the only thing I can. The one thing I've been training for since the aliens first came to the human moon colony to hurt us. I'll fight.Va'RakuNobu has never seen a queen before who is able to wield sword and staff, fist and tongue. A warrior queen, and mine to claim. But when her hate puts the entire village at risk, I finally come to understand the provenance of her pain.While she is the only one who can unravel it, I can teach her control, acceptance, release. But first I will need her trust. And only then can we fight together against our shared enemy and bring him to his knees.Taken to Nobu is a full-length (90k words), standalone, interracial, SciFi romance complete with an alpha alien overlord, warrior heroine, fated mates who are also enemies-to-lovers, world building and extra steamy bits. Trigger warning: this book is about a woman overcoming a past sexual trauma (neither described nor depicted) and the gentle, but firm male who helps her get there. All Xiveri Mates books can be read as standalones, each one with a guaranteed HEA, however I recommend reading book 1 first as this helps sets the stage.",
