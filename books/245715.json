  "title": "Jordan Proves the Afterlife: Investigating Life After Death Through Science, Religion, and Everything in Between",
  "description": "Have you ever had a lifelong idea destroyed? After spending his life as a skeptic, physician George Jawahir began to believe in the afterlife in 2015, after his son Jordan died at the age of 22. It wasn’t grief that caused George to reconsider his beliefs. Two days after the death of his son, George was called by a former patient who claimed Jordan had contacted him from the afterlife. The information that the caller relayed in the brief phone call was something only Jordan could know.Still disbelieving, even after the second such call, George used his skills in science, medicine, and logic to try to explain the unexplainable. Using every resource available, he applied himself to finding what work has been done to study the afterlife, even looking into the arguments afterlife deniers use to discredit such work. After long research, George found no earthly explanation for the unusual occurrences he and his family experienced after Jordan’s death; the messages and signs they repeatedly received from four different mediums were unmistakably from the afterlife.George knew that keeping this information to himself was selfish, considering the hope that it could bring to so many. Risking ridicule, he wrote this book. After all, the question “What comes next?” is of ultimate importance to every living person. Through this book, Jordan continues to send his gifts from the other side.",
