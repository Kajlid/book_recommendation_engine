  "description": "The Once and Future King has always been my curse.You think King Arthur is a hero.You blame me for the fall of Camelot. Because I refused to choose.Yes, I loved Lancelot. Once upon a time, I loved Arthur, too. I loved all of his friends, even Merlin, the cantankerous wizard. But Arthur’s jealousy destroyed our love. He smashed the Round Table, banished Lancelot, and locked me in a burning tower. He would rather see me dead than love another man. Even his best friend.So now I’m doomed to repeat this grim tale over and over until Arthur wins my love. But this vampire queen will never choose Arthur. Not after what he’s done. I will certainly never choose him over Lancelot. I will never settle for just one knight. Not when I can have them all. Oh, and this time? Arthur will be the Once and Dead King, because Camelot is mine.",
