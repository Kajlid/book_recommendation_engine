  "description": "\"Chaucer made easy!\"Geoffrey Chaucer’s “The Miller’s Prologue and Tale”, from The Canterbury Tales, clearly translated into Modern English, while faithfully interpreting and preserving the flowing structure of the original medieval text.On a journey with his fellow pilgrims to Canterbury Cathedral, Robin, a drunken miller, tells an earthy but imaginative story of how the beautiful young wife of a middle-aged carpenter is seduced by Nicholas, a clever but cunning scholar.To continue their sexual relationship, Nicholas devises a ludicrous plan to keep the affair secret from not only the suspicious husband but also his rival, a well-mannered but equally lecherous parish clerk.“The Miller’s Tale” is stuffed with drama, crudeness and hilarity, and is Chaucer at his most outrageous.Contains strong language.Reviews“The perfect introduction to Chaucer, brilliantly capturing his unique style for the modern reader.” JS Hayer, The Supplement.“Chaucer’s masterpiece clearly translated and easily understood. Ideal for students.” M. Collins PhD.Penbury Press, 2013.",
