  "description": "They came from another time to ensure that the future would belong solely to the machines. They are Terminatorsâ€”indestructible killing engines hiding inside shells of flesh and blood. Tireless, fearless, merciless, unencumbered by human emotion, dedicated to the complete eradication of mankind. But despite the frailty of human flesh, nothing is as immortal as the human spirit, and even the strongest metal will bend by the will of a mother fighting for the future of her children.Dark Horse Comics has long been regarded as the heavyweight champion of adapting film blockbusters to graphic fiction, and The Terminator is one of the finest examples of bringing top comics talents to the expansion of a premier action/adventure mythos. Featuring work by fan-favorite creators James Robinson, Matt Wagner, John Arcudi, Paul Gulacy, Ian Edginton, and more, The Terminator Omnibus Volume 1 features over three hundred story pages in a full color, high-quality, value-priced edition.ContainsTempestOne ShotSecondary ObjectivesThe Enemy Within",
