  "description": "After leaving an abusive relationship, Andy Daniels heads back to Las Vegas to reunite with Earl, the love of her life, only to find him gone. Devastated from losing him, she realizes life holds for her several choices, return to her burnt-out hippie days at Berkley, succumb to society’s expectations and settle down with a suitable companion, or hold onto her faith in love and wait for her lost love to return. Andy chooses the latter.  To her friends, Andy’s clinging to love seems futile and even a little pathetic, yet no one seems to be able to deter her. As the years pass, Andy’s love grows past her love for Earl. She learns to appreciate the love of friendship, coworkers, neighbors and everyone who crosses her path, but mostly she learns to love herself. Her love grows to such epic levels that she simply cannot help become a magnet and attract what she desires most of all—the love she lost so many years ago.",
