  "description": "How do you fight a villain who's convinced the world he doesn't exist? Dire has done the unthinkable, and forged an alliance with a hero to bring the fight to the Murder Maestro, in the heart of Britain itself. But the sinister mind manipulator's roots run deep here, and Dire will find herself up against both new faces and old foes... not all of them human. Her travels will take her to worlds beyond, and places most would tremble to venture. But she is Dire, and all shall tremble before her! This is the fifth novel from the Tales from the Teslaverse project.",
