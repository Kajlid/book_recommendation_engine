  "description": "Winston Constantine is no prince charming...I crave him so badly I think I might be losing my mind. He's right in front of me, but he’s just as remote as my dreams of getting away from my stepbrothers. I keep playing his twisted games, and I want to stay just as distant as he is. But I can’t. I never could. I’ve fallen for him. Hopelessly. Irrevocably.But Winston isn’t a lover, he’s a business venture. A way for me to pay for college. A ticket out. He’s never pretended to be anything other than that. I can’t blame him for making me fall in love.There can be no happily ever after between a maid and a prince, no matter what the stories say.",
