  "description": "Alexa Robbins is so consumed by her career, the only sex she has is listening to her nymphomaniac neighbors go at it. When Sebastian Law discovers her in the eighteenth floor conference room early one morning, the table becomes a pallet for making one of her fantasies come true. Will he enjoy her extensive repertoire of fantasies? On the outside, Sebastian appears a buttoned-up, well-dressed, techno geek. Inside, he's a Dom with a hearty appetite for all types of carnal pleasures. He risks alienating Alexa by revealing his true nature, but he won't keep the secret for long. Together, they explore all the things that turn them on. And discover whether they're a perfect match for life beyond the 18th Floor..",
