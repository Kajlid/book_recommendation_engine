  "description": "Dav Pilkey's beloved Dumb Bunnies return in their second silly adventure--now in Scholastic Bookshelf!From \"A supremely silly adventure. This time out the dim-witted trio go to the zoo, where they spot a butterfly hovering over the sign \"Lion\" in front of the big cat's cage and figure the butterfly is the lion. Announcing that \"THE LION IS LOOSE,\" they almost start a riot. As in the first two books, much of the humor is the buck toothed bunnies' garden grows SWEET POTATOES that smooch, and MUMS that look just like mom.... Pint-size fans and their good-humored parents should equally enjoy this one.\"",
