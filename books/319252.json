It’s less great when you turn up to find him dead on the floor, and an armored giant dressed like a freaking ancient warrior standing over his body though.Ares, the God of War, has lost his power and the only way for him to get it back? Me. Apparently, I’m a goddess. One with the power of war. I mean, it does explain a lot.To my relief, Joshua, my shrink and only friend, isn’t really dead. He’s been kidnapped and taken to Olympus—the world where I’m supposed to belong. I vow to do whatever it takes to find him. But Ares has other plans for me. He wants my power, and the easiest way for him to get it is to kill me.When Hades suggests a compromise, I’m forced to work side-by-side with a giant, murderous warrior god. One with far too many secrets. Ares might be the brute everyone thinks he is, but I’m no angel. He awakens a power within me that I’ve failed to control my whole life.And I soon discover that Joshua isn’t the only one that needs saving.This is the complete collection of The Ares Trials, including The Warrior God, The Savage God and The Golden God. It is intended for adults and is packed with magic, mythology and enemies-to-lovers soulmate romance!",
