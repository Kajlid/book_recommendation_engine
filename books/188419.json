  "description": "Enlil a.k.a the Phantom, the oldest vampire and head of The His name is Enlil, but others call him the Phantom. Those who love him call him P. He is a vampire, a blood drinker as old as civilization—a watcher of men protecting humanity from those who would destroy it. And he is lonely beyond death.Drawn to a London theatre, the scarred but handsome immortal watches as a distorted version of his life plays out onstage. In his mind, he once more sees the Paris Opera House and Christine, the reincarnation of the only woman he loved. He revisits the moment when she rejected him, shattering his heart. Then he sees her onstage. She is Christine reborn. More than that, she is the wife he loved millennia ago. Through her, he may find his loneliness ease—or have his heart splintered anew. Or, perhaps, he could end his long life as easily as falling asleep.",
