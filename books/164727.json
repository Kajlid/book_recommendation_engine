  "title": "Bushwhacker: Autobiography of Samuel S. Hildebrand",
  "description": "Bushwhackers in the American Civil War operated as guerrillas, outside the normal chain of military command. Like William Clarke Quantrill and \"Bloody Bill\" Anderson, Samuel Hildebrand was a proud Missouri bushwhacker.  In this long out of print book, Hildebrand describes raids and executions his band of men carried out. He remained at the end of the war and unreconstructed rebel and fervent racist. Like many of his southern brethren who fought, he never owned slaves but kept a captured black man with him after the war.  This self-serving but fascinating account is a valuable addition to the canon of Civil War literature. In it, Hildebrand claims that others have tried to tell his story but have gotten it wrong, so he has a notarized statement by prominent men included as verification of authenticity.  Every memoir of the American Civil War provides us with another view of the catastrophe that changed the country forever.  For the first time ever, this long-out-of-print book is available as an affordable, well-formatted book for e-readers and smartphones.  Be sure to LOOK INSIDE or download a sample.",
