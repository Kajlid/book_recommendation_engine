  "description": "This story is all about an old man's enduring love for his dead wife and her beautiful white rose bush.Not exactly a romance, more of a fantasy about how it is so important to care for one another.A slight thread of the supernatural has been woven in, as some of the things that happen are just not possible.Or are they?This story is being published solely for the benefit of The Merlin Charity in connection with Children In Need, and all proceeds will go to them.",
