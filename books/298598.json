  "description": "The Order of the Sisters of Divine Grace is holding a convention on the Philadelphia campus of St. Elizabeth's College—and the list of invitees is studded with unlikely Main Line luminaries like charmless coronation king Henry Hare and foul-mouthed Norm Kevic, the most-talked-about radio talk show host in Philly. Also on hand is guest speaker and retired FBI agent Gregor Demarkian. The festivities include a reception and buffet dinner... which turns into a Last Supper for the nun who keels over due to a fatal case of pate poisoning. It's murder for mother's day—Who stuffed the ice sculpture with fugu, a foul-smelling, potentially lethal Japanese food fish? And why kill a nice nun like Sister Joan Esther when it's the truly evil Mother Mary Bellarmine whom everyone despised? Demarkian has to sort through an ever-shifting maze of facts and suspects—including a Society Hill matron who's no saint and a minor celebrity with a very bad habit—before he can crack a case in dire need of divine deliverance... from death.",
