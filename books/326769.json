But when Samantha is called by the hospital to say her fifteen-year-old daughter Keira has been hurt and is in a coma, and Julia’s daughter Grace comes home covered in blood, refusing to speak, two mothers’ lives come crashing down.More than ten years ago – when their daughters first started at pre-school and formed an instant bond – sweet-natured single mum Julia and PTA queen bee Samantha had become unlikely friends.For years, the two families’ lives were intertwined. Barbecues, dinner parties, sleepovers for the children.

And Grace won’t tell Julia anything about what happened. But as Samantha’s daughter fights for her life– Julia is forced to ask herself: what is her own child hiding?She can’t believe her gentle-natured girl could have done something terrible. But Grace is keeping a secret. And if it’s what Julia fears it might be, she could lose her daughter forever. Could she lie to protect the child she loves with her whole heart?",
