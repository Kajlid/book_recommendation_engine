I am the Toad, the motor-car snatcher, the prison-breaker, the Toad who always escapes!\" Tired of spring cleaning, Mole ventures above ground into the warm sunshine, and happens upon his friend Ratty. Together they picnic on the sparkling, burbling river, brave the sinister Wild Wood in wintertime to visit the bad-tempered Badger, and take to the open road in a caravan with dear, silly old Toad. But when Toad's attention turns to motor cars, his reckless behavior goes from bad to worse. Badger, Rat, and Mole must save their friend from ruin, and Toad Hall from the clutches of the rascally Stoats and Weasels.",
