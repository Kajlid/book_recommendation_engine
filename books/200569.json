  "description": "When Charlie McLeary rode into Silver Canyon, Colorado, all he wanted was a drink, a meal, and a woman. What he got instead was caught in the middle of a feud between the miners and the owners of the Squaw Gulch mine. He did not want to take sides, but you can push a man like Charlie McLeary only so far before he does choose, and the losing side will pay a heavy price.",
