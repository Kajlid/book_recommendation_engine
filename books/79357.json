  "title": "Too Much Trouble: A Very Oral History of Danko Jones",
  "description": "More than just a history of Danko Jones, this book is an exploration of the rigid politics that govern both underground and mainstream music and how a band can succeed without pandering to either. Danko Jones may be a straightforward rock band, but their story is anything but. They're a band that has roots in many different music communities--the North American indie rock scene, the Scandinavian garage rock scene, and the European metal scene--but belong to none of them. They've toured with both Blonde Redhead and Nickelback and can attract intense fandom in one part of the world while being rejected in their home country. \"Too Much Trouble\" follows a 15-year saga that goes from college radio DJ booths to corporate boardrooms and from dingy after-hours bars to the biggest festival stages in Europe. It's a must-have for fans of Danko Jones or anyone interested in a behind-the-scenes look at how both the mainstream and underground music industries work.",
