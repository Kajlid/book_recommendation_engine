  "title": "TBR: DEAD BUT WELL READ",
  "description": "I always thought I’d die crushed under the weight of my TBR pile, but my death was a plot twist I didn’t see coming.Save your sympathy! Now that I’m dead, I’m living my best freaking life. I’m free to read books for hours on end without worrying about food, rent, or, well, any other interruptions.It looks like I might finally be able to get through my TBR list… maybe.The only one who can see me in my ghostly form is Wasabi, an adorable rat that lives in the library archives. That changed when a not-quite-human guy showed up in town and caught me admiring his gorgeous body—er, I mean, smile. If it was possible to die twice, I’d have done it on the spot from sheer embarrassment. I was drawn to him like a moth to an ugly Christmas sweater, but I fought the pull. My TBR list was calling, and men were a distraction I didn’t need or want. Books before boyfriends, am I right?But it turned out the man wasn’t traveling alone. He was part of a three-man team that investigated strange ghostly occurrences, and they’d come to Amberwood to figure out why lost souls were gathering here. They are determined to convince me there is more to life than books and show me the joys of being shared by three adoring partners.Resisting one irresistibly sexy man was hard enough, but three? And that was before a purple-eyed reaper appeared in town, and I started making bets I couldn’t win. I was fighting a losing battle by continuing to deny what my heart was telling me… and that was before I got a lap dance from death.I can’t deny I’m addicted to their touch. Still, I prefer to keep my drama inside the pages of a book. But that becomes impossible when I realize lives are in danger… including those of the men I’ve started to think of as mine. I’m still haunted by my death, but maybe it’s time to face the truth and stop being such a good ghoul. They say you only live once, so I guess it’s time to find out if you only die once as well. Is YODO a thing?My TBRs aren’t going to read themselves, and these men are becoming a distraction I don't need. Although, maybe I could take a quick break after I finish one more chapter....Sensitivity Note-If you’re the type to clutch your pearls while reading spicy romance books… then I suggest you run and grab your necklace, because you’ll be needing it quite a bit 😉.This book does discuss death and dying (yes, I’m aware the title kind of gives that away). While there are definitely sad moments that pull at the heart, TBR takes a humorous approach to the topic—unless we’re talking about Death with a capital D (and a “D” in his pants that only gets hard for his soulmate). He’s no laughing matter, and tends to get violent when Axelle is insulted. TBR includes fight scenes and Axelle is badly injured in one battle.",
