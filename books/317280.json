  "description": "After six years of living in denial, Luca is finally faced with the truth. A brutal discovery he refused to accept when I needed him most.Now the vengeance he so desperately craves isn’t directed at me, but the monster responsible for destroying all our lives.That might put us on the same side this time, but that doesn’t mean I can forgive him for not believing me. Or for hating me when I loved him.Just when I think the darkness couldn’t drag us down any further, it threatens to swallow me whole.Only this time Luca is right there beside me, reminding me how things used to be… fighting for me. Begging for my forgiveness.Something I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to give him.Until he proves that the boy I fell for still exists, underneath the one who broke my heart.And I begin to wonder if there ever was a question about our future.Dear Reader,The Destruction You Desire is the fifth book in my Maddison Kings University series and the second book in a duet for Peyton and Luca. It's a dark bully romance that contains mature content and demanding alphaholes that some readers may find disturbing. You have been warned.",
