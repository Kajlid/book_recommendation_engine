  "description": "How fast can a pink ’57 Cadillac whisk me away from my dead-end life? Because my twenties have been less than what was promised in the college brochure.  Then one day, it happens. Instead of falling in love with my best friend like I was supposed to, I meet a rock star who happens to be a fan of my site, NoPinkCaddy.com. You’d think that would be where the story ended, but it’s actually just the beginning.  How does a southern girl from New Orleans, who just wants to make her own way in the world, merge her life with that of one of the hottest rock stars on the planet? Well, let me tell you, it’s not easy. This book is recommended for anyone who refuses to take the easy road in life, and those girls who dream of falling in love with a rock star. It’s not all tight jeans and guitar serenades, but hot damn, there are some fun times along the way.  This book is recommended for readers over the age of 18.",
