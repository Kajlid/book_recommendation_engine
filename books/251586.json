  "description": "\"No matter how unwilling they were to admit it. They were all aware – no, they were all sure of the likely possibility of me being a bloodthirsty demon. Maybe it was more true than I realized.\"300 years ago, during the Salem Witch Trials, two organizations emerged to destroy each other. The Hunters of the Leadership and the Council of Witches. When a woman is wrongly accused and put to death, the Council puts a prophecy in place that a girl would be born with so much strength and sorcery that she’d be a mortal god, strong enough to rip the world in two with sheer will. On her seventeenth birthday she would come into her power and use it to avenge her fallen ancestors, free her persecuted kin, and flatten the earth. As a counteract, the Leadership too told of a girl who would bring the first to her knees in an epic war.Present day, Evangeline Welt has become a little too comfortable with her mundane routine. Completely unaware of who she and what she is meant to do, she thinks it’s all just an elaborate bedtime story when her best friend tells her she’s a witch. But when he whisks her away just before she is murdered, she begins to think there is some merit to what he’s saying. Not fond of the idea of being a weapon she begins on a trek across the country, meeting people who grant her safety and comfort; and family who provide her with answers. All in the effort to discover if she’s truly the genocidal maniac she is said to be in the two weeks before her birthday.",
