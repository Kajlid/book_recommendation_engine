  "description": "\"LIVE like there's no tomorrow, LOVE with all your heart, and LAUGH until your spirit lights up!\" Thus said little nine-year-old Cory, dying of leukemia. Cory lived every second of his five final and cancer-ridden years to the fullest. This wise old soul walked his talk, embracing life with passion and without fear of death. He lived to inspire others and brought everyone he touched--teachers, fellow students, medical professionals, Hollywood actors--his timeless message. His inspiring wisdom continues in Over the Rainbow Bridge. Laugh and cry with Cory--and never fear death again. ----30% of the net proceeds of Over the Rainbow Bridge will be donated to Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation of WWA to help families dealing with pediatric cancer and CureSearch National Childhood Cancer Foundation for research.----",
