  "description": "The new translation of the bestselling memoir Night in one volume with its companion novels, Dawn and Day \nNight\n is one of the masterpieces of Holocaust literature. First published in 1958, it is the autobiographical account of an adolescent boy and his father in Auschwitz. Elie Wiesel writes of their battle for survival and of his battle with God for a way to understand the wanton cruelty he witnesses each day. In the short novel \nDawn\n (1960), a young man who has survived World War II and settled in Palestine joins a Jewish underground movement and is commanded to execute a British officer who has been taken hostage. In \nDay\n (previously titled The Accident, 1961), Wiesel questions the limits of conscience: Can Holocaust survivors forge a new life despite their memories?Wiesel's trilogy offers insights on mankind's attraction to violence and on the temptation of self-destruction.",
