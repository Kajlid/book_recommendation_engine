  "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box: Uncollected Short Fiction",
  "description": "Before the Golden Age of magazines drew to a close half a century ago--soon to be beaten at the entertainment game by the new little boxes with moving images that were finding their way into the homes of more & more Americans--a young PR man at General Electric sold his 1st short story to one of the doomed publications. By the time he'd sold his 34d, he decided to quit GE & join the likes of Hemingway, Fitzgerald & Faulkner. & try to make a living at 1500 dollars a pop. With four major magazines running five stories each week & smaller ones scouting as well, it was a seller's market, & Kurt Vonnegut was delighted & comfortable being published regularly by The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, Argosy & others.",
