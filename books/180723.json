  "description": "Rene Hire left her Miami sensual roller coaster ride with Nick Johnson and she finally landed in Los Angels, but she did not arrive alone. Barbara Dahl and big time film director Jacob Lenz were with her and the young blonde beauty and her Hollywood actress dreams had serious power to match her serious desires to succeed and make a scene the public could remember her by. The first stop at the hill top mansion in Malibu saw her acquire an agent from a powerhouse company, and the agent Robert Parson learned how seductive she could be as an actress who knew how to sell herself and create visions to remember her by. Jacob Lenz threw a party with the big time industry insiders and the blonde beauty charmed them all and had an audition for a major motion picture supporting role the very next day. She also had acquired the interest from film star Colt Martin, the famous bad boy who wanted her to make him feel good. He learned the hard way that Rene Hire knew how to control the scenes she directed as she improvised the ways she had of exposing herself. Behind everything else loomed the chance of the lead role in Jacob Lenz's movie that was starting to be conceived, and the lovely blonde never stopped surprising people. When it came to dreams Rene Hire had something to show everyone.",
