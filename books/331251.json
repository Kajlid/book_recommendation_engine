  "description": "From the moment I drowned in the lake of secrets, I knew things would never be the same.All I’d wanted for my eighteenth birthday was a kiss and a summer to be remembered before heading off for college. What I got was so much more.I wasn’t just trapped in a cabin at the lake with a group of my rowdiest friends; I was trapped in another dimension. A dark one, where dreams manifest before your very eyes, fears are conjured in the cool mist, and the dead are living by our sides.One thing I was certain of, the only way out . . . is in.",
