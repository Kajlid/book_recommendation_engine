  "description": "Stalking is only a crime among humans. In a lioness’s world, it’s called dating.  Jeoff, is a bit of a killjoy, a super cute one who gets furry on full moons.  But so does she.  Luna is everything Jeoff is not. Outrageous, outgoing, and violent. Very violent, and unafraid to go after what she wants—and she wants Jeoff.  Silly man, he thinks he can resist, but once a lioness sets her sights on a man, paws off! And if anyone thinks to try and take him… There’s a reason why the ladies of the pride win the yearly award for Baddest Biatches.  Fear the claw. *Snarl*.",
