  "description": "Eden Gray is traumatised from his rape eighteen years earlier and the part Sean Keller played in it isn't easy to forget. Eden goes from happy to desperate within minutes, never sure how long a good mood will last. But he knows that he loves Sean with all his heart and wants to lay his ghosts to rest permanently. Sean feels the same way. He treads on eggshells around Eden, afraid for his mental health and mindful of his suicide attempts. He has a hard time dealing with his guilt, and hates that it overshadows his love for Eden more often than not. Something needs to happen to let them connect and bond permanently and bring them into the light... CONTENT ADVISORY: This title contains rape-related subject matter.",
