  "title": "Dingbat Adventures in Trickle Valley",
  "description": "Dingbat is a very small, very scared and very lost bat. A fierce storm over Trickle Valley has blown him about so much that he no longer knows which way is up. He left his family to search for a new home but now can't find his way back to them. He needs to get to them quickly as they are in danger. With a little help from some Trickle Valley magic, he meets up with Katie, an 8 year old girl who is scared of insects, spiders and small things with wings. Can she overcome her fears and help Dingbat find his family and a new home - before time runs out? Entrant in the 22nd Annual Writer's Digest Self Published Awards 2014: Judge's Commentary& Feedback - I enjoyed this story. I quickly accepted the fantasy of the bat being able to talk to Katie. Once I did that, the story flowed naturally. I liked Katie, her caring and understanding. Adding Jeff into the story added some tension. Would he actually capture Dingbat before Dingbat saves Katie and the rest of the bats? This was a good story. You write well. This book was easy to read because you didnâ€™t crowd the pages with heavy blocks of text. Bats are an intriguing topic to kids. Just gross enough to be scary and interesting.",
