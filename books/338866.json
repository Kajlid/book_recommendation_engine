  "description": "Meet Ethan Lederer. He's got a great girlfriend, and he's in all honor classes. Life is almost normal until Lydia Krane shows up in chemistry class. She's not really Ethan's type-she's some variety of goth with peculiar markings up and down her arms. But he feels an attraction to her he can't explain. As they get to know each other, Ethan finds himself opening up in ways he never could with his girlfriend or his family. Lydia is so different. She loves theater just like Ethan. They're even going to star together in the school play, a Hollywood version of Macbeth.  But suddenly Lydia changes. Why does she seem so attached and desperate? It doesn't take long for Ethan to realize that Lydia will do anything to keep him, the boy of her dreams.",
