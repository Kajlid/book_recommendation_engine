  "description": "When musclebound frat bro Brad gets run off the road by a reckless driver, he thinks it's game over. When he wakes up inside his twin brother's favorite corny shifter romance novel, he realizes the real game is just beginning.Desperate to get back to a world where he's top dog, Brad finds himself in the crosshairs of Raul, the menacingly hot hero of The Wolf's Mate, who's intent on teaching Brad a whole new meaning to the word alpha.Not only does Raul insist that Brad is an omega– his omega–but Brad is going to have to come to terms with the fact that he isn't just a part of this fictional world. He's a stand-in for the main character, and the only way out is to make sure he gets to his happily ever after.-Author's Note: This is the first installment of a new mpreg serial following Brad, a quintessential frat bro and Raul, the brooding werewolf love interest he never asked for--and, in typical '80s alpha male hero fashion, is never gonna give him up. Prepare for hot shifters, snark and banter, gay awakening, found family dynamics, sassy (and intrusive) siblings, a villainous heroine, cliffhangers galore, and meta mayhem.",
