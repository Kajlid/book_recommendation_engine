  "description": "An Eppie Erotic Award Finalist 2010! They Didn't Want Ransom - They Wanted Her Body! Captain James Bonny was a pirate feared on the high seas, by none more than by the Spanish. Captain Bonny surprises the crew of the Spanish ship Fenix; a brief but bloody fight leaves the ship his to plunder. Luck has it that the Fenix was carrying a special cargo, Princess Stefani of Spain, bound for the new land to marry her betrothed, Lord Francisco Diego, accompanied by her eight lovely handmaidens. With twenty days before they reach their home port to sell their human cargo at the slave auction, Captain Bonny and his band of cutthroats teach their captives the pleasures of the flesh. In spite of their reluctance, the women soon learn that the way of survival is to satisfy the lust of the men in any manner they desire. And the women learn that powerful men have ways of making them feel the pleasure, even when they try to resist the urges that spread through their bodies.",
