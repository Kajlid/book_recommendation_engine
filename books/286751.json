  "description": "A funny and feel good romcom by International selling Author, Sasha Lane.  Emma is turning forty, and that’s when everything in life falls in to place, right? Apparently not.  As Emma moves into a beautiful new house with her lovely boyfriend, Joe, she feels that life couldn’t get more perfect. But perfection is short lived as Emma’s friend’s relationships all start falling apart at the seams, with adultery and mid-life crisis wreaking havoc.  Joe is also given a promotion at work meaning he is away from home in London, leaving Emma alone and under pressure to keep everything together.  Joe‘s new found love for life in the big city, and his close relationship with his new work colleague, Karen, leave Emma questioning everything.  Is she destined to follow in the footsteps of her friends, or will she and Joe stand the test of time?  Hilarious, heart-warming and romantic! Will Emma find her happy ever after?
