  "description": "They're spicier than hot sauce and as cool as iced cappuccino. The Cheetah Girls outshine any diamond with their supa-dupa inner sparkle! Now see how it all began in the first books of the series starring Galleria, Chanel, Dorinda, Anginette, and Aquanette. Each bind-up features four Cheetah-licious tales about girls having guts, brains, courage, and friends (while flashin' some style and always shining from the heart).",
