  "description": "A gorgeous gift edition of Michael Morpurgo's three Christmas stories, along with a brand new story—illustrations by Quentin Blake, Emma Chichester Clark, Michael Foreman, and Sophie Allsopp.Curl up by the fireside and let Michael Morpurgo envelop you in stories of faraway lands and unexpected adventures. In 'The Best Christmas Present in the World', a mysterious letter in a secret drawer brings one night in the Great War vividly to life. Writing home from the front, a soldier has an incredible story to tell. The second tale is 'On Angel Wings'. A singing of wings, a glorious light, and a sudden beacon of brightness? It can only mean—can it really?—a visit from the Angel Gabriel himself. When the Prince and Princess marry in 'The Best of Times', joy rings out across the land. But all too soon it fades away and a shadow hangs over the royal palace. As Christmas approaches, Prince Frederico must find a way to warm his new bride's aching heart. In the new story, 'The Goose is Getting Fat', Gertrude the goose is getting bigger by the day, and Charlie is proud to look after her. But as Christmas approaches, the thought of the grizzly fate awaiting her fills him with sadness. Can he save Gertrude from the Christmas dinner table?",
