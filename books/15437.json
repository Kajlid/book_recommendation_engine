  "description": "When Sela Marin encounters Jonavon Wyatt outside a mall, she’s surprised by the instant, powerful attraction and her ability to read his thoughts so clearly. Realizing he is her life-mate, she makes a bold move in the tradition of all female Crainesians, and is surprised to learn he has a fiancé. Confused by his ability to resist her advances, but hoping his insight along with their mind-mating and dream-sharing will bind him to her, Sela gives him three days to succumb to her pheromone lure. But Jonavon is half Human and untrained in Crainesian ways. So, what's a strong Crainesian woman to do when her life-mate is too clueless to follow when beckoned? Seduce him with his own desires, of course!",
