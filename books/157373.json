  "title": "Blood Matters",
  "description": "Grief changes people. Brittany used to be a normal teen. She ate like one, slept like one, and had typical teenage mood swings. But after she found her best friend dead, everything changed. Grief could explain her loss of appetite and her lack of sleep. It might even explain why she sees her dead friend everywhere she goes. But it certainly won't explain why everyone she touches develops bruises or why she's attracted to the smell of blood. And, what about the new found urge to eat her boyfriend? Blood Matters is a vampire novel with a new spin and a unexpected twist. As much as this book centers on struggles, inside and out, it's also filled with compassion and true-to-life characters.",
