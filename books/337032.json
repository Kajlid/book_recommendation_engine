  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN: B0BJ7J2Q5QI’ve been told I’m the grumpiest goalie in the league, and that may be the case, but who cares when I’m also killing it this season? The Carolina Comets are currently on a record-breaking run, and I intend to keep it that way.This means the last thing I need is distractions, but my mother didn’t get that memo. She’s getting married, and after the fiasco I caused at her last wedding, I’m required to bring a date.That would be easy, except for one little thing: I don’t date.So why is the only person I want to take a single mom who can’t stand me?We’re a horrible match, and it makes no sense that I’d be into her. But the more time we spend together, the more it’s starting to look like this might be one game I can’t win.GLOVE SAVE is a standalone hockey romcom. There's a grumpy goalie who likes to argue with a ten-year-old, a single mom, lots of fun banter, and STEAM galore!",
