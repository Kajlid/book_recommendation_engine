  "description": "'Professor Henry Tomlinson, accredited member of the National Microbiologists Association, author of the best seller 'The Futility of Sheep', widower, father of twins, sat on the chair in his ransacked study and for the first time in his life, asked himself if he was losing his mind.' There are three things which can irrevocably change a man's life - the death of a loved one, a moment of revelation and saying the wrong thing at precisely the wrong time. Unfortunately for Professor Henry Tomlinson, he has recently experienced all three. And it's those experiences which threaten to push him over the edge. Is his past really key to understanding his present, or is it yet another trick of his mind? 'Existence Is Futile', the debut novel from Scott Andrews, tells the story of one man's struggle to keep his head whilst he tries to come to terms with his own reality. 'Existence Is Futile' aspires to address a number of existential questions, is brave enough to attempt jokes which don't include toilets and inclusive enough to include a ninja. That's right. A ninja.",
