  "description": "An eclectic grouping of 67 poems, accompanied by 14 black-and-white photos, that novelist Duff Brenna (Too Cool & Minnesota Memoirs) calls a \"heart-winning collection.\" \"If poetry collections can be 'page-turners,'\" Brenna notes, \"that's what this one is. \"Griswoldâ€™s causally brilliant verse is for anyone who savors good storytelling, ironical bites of humor, intellectual explorations, clear-eyed takes on history, gigantic bursts of humane love. . . Just Enough Clothes is more than a triumph. These poems are for all seasons.\"",
