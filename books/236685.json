  "description": "NOTE: This is the second edition of the ebook, an updated one published in July 2017. The first was published in late 2016. Ranked among GoodReads' Best True Crime, Best History Books, and Best Non-Fiction Books of the 21st Century lists. The assassination of John F. Kennedy ranks among the biggest stories of the 20th century, according to a survey of American historians and journalists. While numerous books cover the 1963 tragedy from a conspiracy or lone-assassin viewpoint, this work by veteran journalist Kevin James Shay tells the story that occurred between Kennedy's 1960 presidential triumph and his assassination. The compelling narrative, infused with often behind-the-scenes details that have been brought to light in recent years, provides a compelling account that is particularly geared towards the average reader, not the assassination researcher.Shay witnessed Kennedy's funeral in Washington, D.C., as a boy and grew up in Dallas. He has researched the killing off and on since 1978, when eyewitness Bill Newman entered his college newspaper office and led him on a search. While Shay leans heavily toward the conspiracy side, he is almost 100 percent certain that Oswald was involved in some way. Whether he was a patsy, government informant, or actually fired his rifle at Kennedy is still undetermined.He unearths some information not highlighted much before, such as the involvement of Willie Somersett. The Klan leader actually opposed the racial violence in the 1950s and 1960s to the point that he risked his life exposing and helping to prevent it, by being an FBI informant. Somersett likely helped save and prolong Kennedy's life at least once.",
