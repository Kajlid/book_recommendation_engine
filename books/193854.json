  "title": "Jimmy's Blues: Selected Poems",
  "description": "Finally in paperback, here is James Baldwin's only collection of poems. Baldwin's language is deceptively simple--this poetry is easily understood. But the emotions behind the words go to the core not only of the poet's soul, but of America's. Readers will see Baldwin here in both a familiar and an altogether different light.",
