  "description": "Real vampires do musicals. Biting Love, Book 5Gunter Marie \"Junior\" Stieg is stuck selling sausage for her folks in small-town Meiers Corners. Until one day she's offered a way out--the chance to play pit orchestra for a musical headed for Oz, Wonderful Oz. But someone is threatening the show's young star. To save the production, Junior must join forces with the star's dark, secretive bodyguard, whose sapphire eyes and lyrical Welsh accent thrill her. And whose hard, muscular body sets fire to her passions. Fierce as a warrior, enigmatic as a druid, Glynn Rhys-Jenkins has searched eight hundred years for a home. Junior's get-out-of-Dodge attitude burns him, but everything else about her inflames him, from her petite body and sharp mind to what she can do with her hip-length braid. Then a sensuous, insidious evil threatens not only the show, but the very foundations of Meiers Corners. To fight it, Junior and Glynn must face the truth about themselves--and the true meaning of love and home. Cue the music, click your heels together, make a wish and get ready for one steamy vampire romance. Contains biting, multiple climaxes, embarrassing innuendos, ka-click/ka-ching violence, sausage wars and--shudder--pistachio fluff.",
