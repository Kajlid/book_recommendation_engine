  "title": "Everyday Survival: Why Smart People Do Stupid Things",
  "description": "The author of the life-changing bestseller Deep Survival once again brings us revelations about ourselves from the cutting edge of science. Laurence Gonzales shows how modern society has made us lazy and susceptible to previously unknown threats. \"Curiosity, awareness, attention,\" he writes. \"Those are the tools of our everyday survival...we all must be scientists at heart or be victims of forces that we don't understand.\"Gonzales turns his talent for gripping narrative, knowledge of the way our minds and bodies work, and bottomless curiosity about the world to the topic of how we can best use the lessons of our evolutionary history to overcome the hazards of everyday life. He finds that natural laws profoundly affect our actions, and he reveals the hidden causes and costs of our behavior, whether as individuals or as a species whose decisions may be leading to darker times. Whether you are climbing a mountain or the corporate ladder, Everyday Survival will change the way you view your choices in our complex, dangerous, and quickly changing world. 6 illustrations",
