  "description": "Steven Carvelle is a journalist and a self-diagnosed alcoholic. Lately his dreams have been taking a turn for the worse, and the violence that was once only in his mind has begun to manifest in the world around him. When a series of murders overflows into the lives of Steven, his girlfriend, Karen, and best friend Miles (a detective on the local police force), Steven is forced to dive further into his mind and the realm of self-awareness than ever before. Questioning not only society and religion, but even his own sanity, he must decide what is real, what is not, and how everything in his life has intertwined to lead him to now. Then he is required to make a decision. At its heart, a tale about what happens to these characters while these events unfold around them. Most of all it's about understanding and coming to grips with who you are, and the frightful and dangerous consequences of thinking you are someone you are not.",
