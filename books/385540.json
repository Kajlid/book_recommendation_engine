  "title": "Two Spirits: A Story Of Life With The Navajo",
  "description": "Twenty years after publishing his groundbreaking The Spirit and The Sexual Diversity in American Indian Culture, anthropologist Walter L. Williams publishes another book on Native Americans, teaming up with award-winning writer Toby Johnson. Together they have produced a work of historical fiction that is striking in its evocation of Native American oppression, but also of insightful Navajo philosophy, spirituality, and gender wisdom. Set in the Civil War era of the 1860s, this novel tells the story of a feckless Virginian who comes West and finds himself captivated by a crossdressing Two-Spirit male shaman, highly respected among the Navajo as spiritual leader and healer. Together the pair help the Navajo return to their sacred homelands. Full of suspense, plot twists, and endearing romance, Two Spirits will captivate readers with its positive approach to life and love and its wonderful ending. The novel is, at once, educational, entertaining, sexy, romantic, mystical, enlightened.",
