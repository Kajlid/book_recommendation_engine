  "description": "WARNING – Do not buy this book if you find bathroom humor childish or immature. This includes all my high school teachers and counselors… and my bosses… and my grandma… but not my grandpa! Paw Paw, you’ll love this book! Someone has been committing heinous attacks in Fromage, Wisconsin. They cut the cheese at the high school football game, clearing out half the stands. Someone also dropped an axe into a wheel of cheddar at Wal-Mart, bringing in the HAZMAT unit to clean up the mess. Now, they're plotting something even more atrocious. The only person who can stop the insanity is a teenage superhero called the Wisconsin Samurai. In the city of Fromage, cutting the cheese, whether it be with a knife, an axe, or even a tomahawk, is as disastrous as a bean-filled bubba with a bad case of irritable bowel syndrome. And the Samurai is fairly certain that the owner of the S. B. Dedli Cheese Plant is planning the worst attack yet.
