He's seen the worst in people, and trusting Andy isn't easy.To Andy, homeless means addictions, overdoses, and panhandling. It's a world he doesn't understand, and isn't sure he wants to. Yet, when it comes to life and death, he can't just walk away and let someone die.Their worlds couldn't be more different, but the more they get to know each other, they find that, inside, where it matters the most, they really aren't so opposite. Trust comes hard for both men, but when a murderer starts hunting homeless boys, the two work together, showing them that no matter where you come from, dreams really can come true.",
