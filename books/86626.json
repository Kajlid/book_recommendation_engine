  "title": "The Art of Brom",
  "description": "The Art of Brom is the largest, most comprehensive retrospective ever published on the work of this extraordinary dark fantasy artist. Brom has collected together the very best of his art spanning his 30 year career. Many pieces have never before been published. Brom has written an insightful autobiography sharing his artistic journey from his earliest childhood drawings, his frustrations with commercial art, challenges breaking into the industry, to his years working in games and film, and insights into his latest personal works. Brom's art is a harmony of extremes: dark and beautiful, haunting and inspiring, majestic and raw. The Art of Brom is equally diverse. Here are images made iconic through his illustrated novels and his work in film and games. Many of the book's images, including those previously published, have been rescanned from the original artwork, and color-corrected by the artist himself, ensuring meticulous reproduction quality. Furthermore, this collection is designed by Brom allowing him the opportunity to arrange his art in a personal manner, with large full-color images and details to show his brush work.",
