  "title": "A Tinfoil Hat of My Own: A Tale of Friendship, Bikers, and Werewolves",
  "description": "Bikers are sort of pissy. So are werewolves.  Dealing with the devastating end to her long-term relationship with Cobweb, Eunice decides to pick up the broken pieces of her heart and glue them back together with the healing song of nature and a nourishing brandy to replenish the soul.  As evening falls on her drunken pity party in the park, it's time to head home and deal with the consequences of the not-so-anonymous tip to the cops and what she may or may not have done to Cobweb's bike--and clubhouse.  All thoughts of that end when something bigger than a pissed off biker gets ahold of her--nothing says burning calories like booking it through woods with a mermaid-killing werewolf at your heels.  Will Cobweb miss her? Will Eunice survive?  Friendship, bikers, werewolves, and repurposed tinfoil. Some stories just have it all.",
