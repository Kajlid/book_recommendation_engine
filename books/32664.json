  "description": "How does an alpha she-wolf who can snap a man in half, learn to love and accept a pair of males who can only beat her in a game of chess?Deena’s searched a long time for a man she can claim, but nobody’s ever stirred her interest, until Simon and Frank. The moment she meets the nerdy friends, she wants to mark them as her own, but as alpha of her pack, she can’t settle for a pair of geeks as her mates even if in the bedroom they make her submit.At first Deena terrifies them, but as Simon and Frank get to know her, they realize that beneath the tough exterior is a woman who wants a man—or two—to take control. When it comes to fistfights, they might not have the strength to prevail, but in a battle of the mind and heart, they’ve got the smarts it takes to emerge victorious, to her screaming pleasure.Trust fate and two men, to show this she-wolf that with a little bit of bondage, teasing and pleasure, she can claim the geeks who draw her, because after all, even a bitch can’t fight fate and her need for love.",
