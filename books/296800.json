The way she gives in to me is intoxicating, but I need more than hot nights and sexy dates.When she introduces me to her daughter, I fall for that little girl hook, line and sinker. No one has ever played me for a fool like that kid can do with a single dimpled grin. I want to keep them both.Heather’s been hurt before. She’s hanging by a thread and doesn’t trust easily, but I want more than just some fun. How can I show her that we can build something incredible together?",
