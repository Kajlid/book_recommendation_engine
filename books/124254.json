  "title": "Analysing Sentences: An Introduction to English Syntax",
  "description": "This highly successful text has established itself as a standard introduction to the practical analysis of English sentence structure. In this second edition, Noel Burton-Roberts has fully revised his original text to improve the clarity of exposition and the level of exemplification and to make the analysis more consistent with current assumptions. As before, important concepts such as constituency, category and function are carefully explained as they are introduced. Tree diagrams are clearly explained and used throughout to help the reader visualise the hierarchical structure of sentences. The final chapter sets the analysis within the context of generative grammar and language study in general.",
