  "description": "In a male-dominated world, a few friends try to escape, to find a safe place. A place where your body is yours, a place based on principals. A place where men and women are seen as equals. While most people on earth are suffering, their little community seems to be thriving. Everyone lives together in peace, or so they thought.",
