Instead, she takes a job away from home as a nanny and riding instructor for the wealthy but dysfunctional McKinnerney family. The family friends are not as respectable as they should be, either. The village doctor, Alex Carver, is notorious for his philandering ways and everyone seems to be conducting a clandestine affair.To add to this, Sophie has a mystery lover â€” a silent stranger who visits her in the night. Could it be Callum, the rugged young gardener, or even Mr McKinnerney himself? Whoever he is, Sophie finds his attentions a welcome escape from the nagging demands of the irritable Mrs McKinnerney. In an atmosphere of suspicion and secrecy, Sophie is determined to discover the identity of her silent seducer.",
