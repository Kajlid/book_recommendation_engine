  "title": "The Sky is for Wonder: Poetry for children",
  "description": "This poetry for children is a playful and brightly illustrated portrait of children growing up, discovering the outside world, all the while capturing the fun of playing in one's own backyard. In the short pages of this book, we discover the joy of playing in rain puddles, flying a kite, gazing at the flight of birds, discovering the spiritual beauty of the planets and stars, and relishing the drifting snow on a winter's evening walk. This book is a delight for children and for adults who may read to them in the lilting poetics of its upbeat rhyme.",
