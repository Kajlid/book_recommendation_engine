  "description": "Everyone knows the stories about na√Øve girls being taken by beautiful monsters.  Often the monster is a tortured soul with a fucked up past, but even then, that monster is redeemable.  This is not one of those stories.  My monster revels in the carnage he creates.  Our story is not one where good prevails and the villain becomes a hero.  My reality is dark. His demons are darker.  And though I love my monster, this is no fairytale. There is no happily ever after. This Saga contains extremely dark themes.",
