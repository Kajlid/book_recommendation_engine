  "description": "Inspiring Women Stories from 10 Amazing Women about Resilience, Confidence, Passion and AmbitionDo you, like many women, sometimes feel insecure, despite your success? There’s nothing wrong with that. What matters is how you deal with it. In Amazing Women 10 women tell their personal and inspiring stories, women who don’t necessarily see themselves as inspirational. Each one is special because of the confidence in herself, her ability to overcome difficult situations thanks to her resilience, her motivation and passion to make her dreams come true and her ambition to learn the lessons life presents her. These are the main themes in the stories. What is so special is that these inspirational women could be our neighbors, friends, sisters, aunts, stepmothers, daughters or co-workers, anyone close to us. So close that we sometimes fail to see how inspirational they really are. But also a woman such as Josette Dijkhuizen who was UN Women’s Representative in 2013. She said: ‘At the United Nations General Assembly, I was given the opportunity to make an independent statement during the ‘Advancement of Women’ session. It was a few months ago and it still feels surreal that I was given the opportunity to speak to the UN. To be able to speak for seven minutes on behalf of Dutch women was a great honor. I don’t think I will ever forget that feeling.‘",
