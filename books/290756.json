  "description": "It was an uncomplicated favor: Go bail Addie Johnson out of jail.I had no idea that the charges against my best friend’s little sister meant I’d have to take her into my custody for two weeks. Two weeks living in my parents’ house in my hometown in Georgia.Two weeks to figure out what the heck happened to the sweet computer nerd who captivated me that one summer.But that shy girl is gone. Now, the blonde bombshell with the crappy boyfriend and ditzy exterior is hiding something. Something BIG. Addie tries to use me the same way she plays every other man, but I’m not buying it.I know her. The real her. And I’m not going to stop until I figure out what she’s keeping from me.But I can’t cross that line. My job, sanity, and (if her brother finds out) my life all depend on it.This is a Romantic Comedy between a computer genius, hiding her nocturnal hacking career from everyone, and a brooding sheriff, who makes even his ugly tan uniform look good.",
