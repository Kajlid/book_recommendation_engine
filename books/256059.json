She's not like any woman he's ever metâ€”comfortable in the woods, with a horse, and with a gun.When Penny and John are taken against their will by a shadowy figure looking for evidence they don't have, both realize they've stumbled into something dangerous. With their friends and family desperately searching for them, Penny and John must make a daring escape.When they emerge back into the real world, they discover their kidnapper just won't stop. This city man and country woman must bring a powerful, ruthless man to justice, all while fighting a very inconvenient attraction to each other.",
