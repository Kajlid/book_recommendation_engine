Oh, and the fate of the King of Sweden - and the world - rests on her shoulders.Born in a Soweto shack in 1961, Nombeko is destined for a short, hard life. When she is run over by a drunken engineer, her luck changes. Alive, but blamed for the accident, she is sent to work for the driver - the brandy-soaked head of a project vital to South Africa's security. Nombeko may be good at cleaning, but she's amazing with numbers. The drunken engineer isn't - and has made a big mistake. And only Nombeko knows about it...Uproariously funny, this is an entrancing tale of luck, love and international relations.",
