  "description": "The paths of Christian, Daniel and Alan coincide in San Francisco at the beginning of the computer age. They take whatever jobs they can, working as performers in the theaters of the city. It is the early 1990s. In the melting pot of San Francisco they meet Mordred Vienna. Mordred is one of a new wave of performance artistes. She uses her body as the canvas for her performances and the focus of her installations. With her partner, Mildred, she reflects on her position in relation to the male models around her. In describing the lives of the dancers of the city, as they progress through Silicon Valley and, ultimately, on to Hollywood and success, Mordred Vienna increasingly finds she is describing her own life and transformations.A work of gay/trans fiction with erotic content.",
