  "description": "Laura Kinsale's best romantic comedy, narrated in Nick Boulton's sexy, wicked voice...Trevelyan d'Augustin and Lady Callista Talliafaire were secret sweethearts, until the day her father dismissed him with a whip across the face. Ten years and three jiltings later, shy Callie is resigned to a quiet village life as the late earl's spinster daughter. But now Trev has returned from his estates in France, upending everything, dragging her into adventures, stealing Hubert the prize-winning bull, and flinging Callie's heart into mayhem again. Laura and Nick fans who enjoy a practical, witty heroine will love shy Lady Callista with her cattle and daydreams, and believe dashing Trev will be a lucky man if he can win her back...or perhaps just kidnap her instead!",
