When Roar and Tempest meet, their fate has already been sealed by lies and betrayals. But when they’re captured by a common enemy who plans to kill Roar and usurp Tempest’s ancestral lands, they’ll need to overcome old wounds and forge ahead as partners, proving that heroic feats can happen in the heart as much as on any battlefield.",
