  "title": "Dead Solid Perfect",
  "description": "The legendary golf novel, rereleased in a special edition with a new foreword by the author. Don Imus said it \"Dan Jenkins is a comic genius.\" And nowhere is that genius more evident than in Dead Solid Perfect, his uproarious 1974 novel about life on the PGA Tour. To some, Kenny Lee Puckett, the star of Jenkins's ribald saga, is a more important figure in the history of golf than Bobby Jones himself.",
