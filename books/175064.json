Worried what their unchaperoned situation will do to her reputation, Roady is uneasy when the snowfall keeps them stranded—just long enough for him to lose his heart.  Sally Stanford has a secret—one that sent her running from St. Louis to Y Knot and into arms of her sister. A secret that would shatter Roady’s high opinion of her, if he knew. When Sally realizes her plan is doomed to fail, she turns to the only man she trusts.  Continue the McCutcheon family saga in Montana Snowfall, Book 7 of the McCutcheon Family Series, a heartfelt western historical romance by USA Today Bestselling author Caroline Fyffe.",
