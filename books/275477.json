  "description": "What They Want by New York Times bestselling author Omar Tyree adds another sexy, scorching novel to his growing list of beloved urban literature. Successful model Terrance Mitchell had no plans to ever settle down. For what? Being single was freedom, where relationships were binding. Nor did he have any plans for a family, with snotty-nosed kids running around, cramping his style and eating for free. To hell with all that. Terrance loved his life as is. He was a well-traveled, good-looking model in an industry full of insatiable and beautiful women. Women who adored him and were willing to do almost anything to prove it. He liked it that way. And he had become accustomed to it. Then it happened. One of his beautiful women fell over the cuckoo's nest and shattered his peace of mind. From then on, Terrance could never again lead the blind mice with his flute without feeling guilty about it. He realized that women had a purpose for him. They had dreams and aspirations that included his participation. Of course, a man in his position, constantly surrounded by beautiful women, would know this already. But just because he knew what women wanted didn't mean he was capable of or willing to give it to them. Nevertheless, Terrance suddenly felt inspired to try.",
