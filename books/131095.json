  "description": "Charlie’s back! Miserable and unsettled in his predictable, suit-and-tie existence, Charles Benson, Jr. is finally waking up and realizing a few things. He hates his life. But instead of a change, he finds himself thrust deeper into the same ol’, same ol’, only worse. Or is it?  Kami Monroe. Tattooed. Pierced. Outspoken. Fiercely sexy. Jaded after being burned by an unreliable dreamer, she rolls her eyes at Charles’s uptight monkey suits and Polo shirts, even as she secretly craves the stability he represents . . . not to mention the unexplainable and explosive chemistry sizzling between them. There’s only one thing stopping them. Each other.  Second chances . . . Add to the mix an angel getting one last shot at Love Detail before moving up the ranks, and you could have a match made in Heaven . . . if they’d just get the hell out of the way.",
