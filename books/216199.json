Everything is so damned difficult for me! Like a never-ending dance where the choreographer is never satisfied!”And if life were an eternal dance?

But in a play of silence and destiny, their roads divide, and Anna loses her equilibrium yet again.Will any type of melody unite them again? Or is Stuart her true love?Will dancing save her?",
