  "description": "His name is Pietro, or \"Peh-troh\", as they pronounce it in Sicily. Not that it would be a good idea to mention that to anyone in the city.A name - that was all his father left him before being driven in an early grave. All he had was a name, his heritage, the birthright of a family both great and terrible. The Mafia.No matter how much his mother tried to take it from him, no matter the fact that it's what had cost them the lives of his father and his older brother, he was drawn to that bloody birthright like a moth to the flame.He had found pride in that name, in his origin, in his new family. He had every right to. His father had moved in the country straight from Sicily, after all.In this blood-chilling crime thriller by Jim Roland, the reader gets a glimpse of the mob's rough underbelly in a city being swept be the winds of change. In a ruthless world that had already cost him a father, a brother and his innocence, Pietro is trying to carve out a life for himself.When things take a bloody turn for the worse for his famiglia, though, his heritage starts to feel more like a curse than a gift.Will he hold up his end of the deal and possibly pay its price in blood, like his father did?Will he try to escape his legacy of violence, blood and lawlessness, like his mother had tried?No matter what he does, he's a part of the Family now.And the Mafia isn't something you can turn down the generosity of.",
