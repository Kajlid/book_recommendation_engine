  "description": "Second Lt. Jack Walker doesn't always think ahead and when he decides to defy logic and send off for a mail order bride, he might have left out only a few details about his life at the all-but-forgotten Fort Gibson...Upon arrival at a forsaken military fort in the middle of Indian Territory, Ella Davis learns Jack's situation isn't quite what she's believed from his letters and while hoping to avoid such a fate, she's been made the fool again. Unfortunately, this time she can't run and hide from the man who's done her wrong, but neither is she convinced their marriage will be the same one she'd envisioned for them...Now it's up to Jack to find a way to show his always skeptical bride that he is indeed trustworthy and that despite what she might believe she does belong somewhere in the world: right there, with him.",
