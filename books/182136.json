  "description": "Riley is perfectly comfortable being a single code jockey and watching movies at home in her sweats – she’s a fiercely independent woman, successful and intelligent, and she has no use for vapid conversations or relationships. Unless, of course, they are work-related.  Being one of only two women at her computer security firm, she is chosen to work a job for a corporate client with some…special requirements. In order to not raise any suspicions regarding their security leak, Riley must masquerade as the CEO’s latest supermodel conquest, hanging on his arm at various functions as well as around the office, wearing slinky outfits and painfully high heels, and pretending she hasn’t a thought in her pretty head.  All because the client insists.  Riley is far out of her comfort zone on this case, and her maddening but handsome playboy client, constantly criticizing and controlling her looks, doesn’t make her job any easier.  She can’t wait to get back to her movies and sweats, but CEO Dirk Kent seems to have other ideas. And what Dirk wants, he tends to get.  NOTE: This is Part 1 of a 3 part serial. Cliffhanger ending! Books 2 and 3 are FREE with Kindle Unlimited.",
