  "description": "It was strictly against the rules for Patience Goodfellow to fall in love with Brady Shaw, saloon wonder, ex-gunfighter, and ladies' man. But Patience knew he had a heart of gold.

But loving an angel might change him in ways he never expected. Now, Patience can only pray she'll get her chance for earthly happiness...and a love that could only come from paradise...",
