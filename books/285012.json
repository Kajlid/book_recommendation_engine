  "title": "First Light of Day: A Cautionary Tale of our Future Written by One of Today's Leading Experts on Technology Innovation",
  "description": "FIRST LIGHT OF DAY is two things. First, it's a compelling story wrapped around a disquieting look at life in 2045 in the aftermath of a technology revolution that profoundly changed the nature of society. Second, it's a non-fiction look at the technologies available today that make this revolution possible and even probable.In the fictional, part one of the book, the world is on the brink of creating the first truly sentient machines. Technology has changed everything from travel and work to government and even personal relationships. Most developed societies are segregated between high-end knowledge workers who enjoy all the benefits of life in the new digital cities and the majority of the population who have been rendered economically superfluous. The characters' inner struggles are intellectual, philosophical and spiritual--and their time before losing control of their lives to their own creations is running out.The second non-fiction part of the book provides an overview of the 10 categories of technology that play crucial roles in the story and are shaping our world today.The author, Michael J.T. Steep, is the founder and executive director of the Disruptive Technology and Digital Cities Program at Stanford University School of Engineering and one of today's leading experts on technology innovation. He wrote this book as a cautionary tale for anyone who wonders about the impact of unchecked technology development currently underway.",
