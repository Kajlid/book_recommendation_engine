We are not original or unique and keep our best talents and most original ideas trapped inside. We fear what other people may think and so we continue to produce work that is an inferior copy of someone else’s.Your best work is your work; it is original and is uniquely yours. It comes from inside you and does not resemble the work of someone else at all. Nowhere is this more important than in the field of creativity where we must make hundreds of connections in the brain, become smarter, think faster and be more astute as we find the lucrative A-Ha moments in daily life.
