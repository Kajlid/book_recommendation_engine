  "description": "Helping a friend out with a favor, Lindy Haggerty agrees to put her dance shoes back on to rescue a troubled show. But Lindy has no idea just how doomed the production is until the backstage tantrums, demands, and threats turn a simple pas de deux into a rather scandalous pas de mort…When the past-her-prime diva, Carlotta Devine is found dead from an apparent blow to her head in her dressing room, no one is surprised. Less proficient at grands plies than grand entrances, Carlotta was every dancer, director, and stage manager´s worst nightmare. While Carlotta´s last dramatic gesture may be getting raves from her troupe, Lindy´s not so taken with cold-blooded murder. But sorting out a theater full of suspects, each with their own just cause, will be harder than getting Martha Graham back on the boards. And as Lindy dances closer to the truth, she makes a startling discovery: Carlotta´s murder was a mere dress rehearsal for something deadlier to come. A shadowy killer has scheduled a final curtain call—and Lindy is taking center stage.",
