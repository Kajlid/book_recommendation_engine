  "title": "Tempting the Deputy",
  "description": "Tough, taciturn and wounded in ways that no one else knows about, Marietta rancher and part-time Deputy Sheriff Logan Tate is a man in total control of his life. Until he catches British photographer Charlotte Foster hitchhiking and ‘insists’ she gets a ride into town in his squad car…  After her run-in with Deputy Hardass, Charlie Foster is ready to ride her thumb right back out of Marietta the very next day. But that night, a trip to Grey’s Saloon fires up her imagination – and her wild side – when she overhears the town’s first responders panicking over how to come up with the money needed to repair Harry's House in just 90 days.  Charlie has an ingenious solution to their problem, that might just require her to photograph twelve smokin’ hot guys naked. And, as luck would have it, also involves getting some much needed payback on Deputy Hardass – who isn't too enthusiastic about participating in the calendar shoot.  But as he spends more time with Charlie, Logan can't ignore the chemistry sizzling between them. Can a man who lives by the rules fall in love with a woman who breaks all of his?",
