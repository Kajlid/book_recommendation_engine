But when my grandmother got sick, I didn't think twice before packing my bags and moving to Crimson Hollow, a small town in West Virginia. Two years later, I'm still here and finally adjusting to the quiet life.Only there's nothing ordinary about this town.A walk in the woods proved almost deadly and left me changed forever. I was attacked by a rogue wolf, and now, I belong to the Crimson Hollow pack. I'm a shifter.To make matters worse, my arrival in the pack created a rift among the wolves, making it impossible to tell friend from foe, including the three alpha's sons who have taken a keen interest in me. If dealing with all that wasn't enough, wolves are disappearing. We must discover who is behind it, or there won't be a pack left to fight over.",
