  "description": "MR. CONFIDENCE WILL FORCE YOU TO TAKE FINANCIAL PRECAUTIONS When a wrongly accused man (Don Juan Jackson) gets out of prison, he focuses his attention on becoming a good example for his six-year-old daughter, who at her tender age has been terribly influenced by her mother and her mother's many paramours. He plans to get a job to be a family good father, but his plans are derailed soon after his release. His life becomes packed with unbelievable excitement when he is drawn into a life of white-collar crime by his childhood pal, Lex. They commit several scams and schemes—and Secret Service agents are watching. But with the money abundantly flowing in, Don Juan takes explosive measures to get custody of his daughter and to avoid another trip to the penitentiary. Pulse-pounding seconds pass as Don Juan risks his freedom and fatherhood for the score of a lifetime.",
