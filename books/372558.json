  "description": "Something laughed, something big and horrible. Lewis ran through the maze. He felt thin branches curling down to hold his arms and legs. He screamed and flailed away. The branches snapped. And Lewis saw bright red blood oozing form the broken twigs...When Lewis Barnavelt and his uncle Jonathan vacation in Europe, they are looking forward to meeting their English cousin Pelham. At Barnavelt manor Lewis befriends the housekeeper's son Bertie and together they explore the mansion and grounds. But in the garden maze Lewis accidently unleashes demonic forces that summon the ghost of the wicked Malachiah Pruitt. Three hundred years earlier Pruitt had accused one of Lewis's ancestors of witchery and tried to have him burned at the stake, Now Pruitt's ghost has returned. Can Lewis fight the maniacal wizard or will all the Barnavelts perish?John Bellairs has written another scary thriller starring Lewis and Uncle Jonathan, who last appeared in The Letter, the Witch, and the Ring, the third book in The House with a Clock in Its Walls series.Since John Bellairs's untimely death, Brad Strickland, a longtime Bellairs fan, has completed The Vengeance of the Witch-Finder, just as he did The Ghost in the Mirror. Mr. Strickland is the author of several books, including Dragon's Plunder.Frontispiece by Edward Gorey.",
