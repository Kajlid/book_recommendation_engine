  "description": "The chilling, dark psychological suspense thriller from ex police officer and child protection social worker, John Nicholl. Be careful who you trust...The Mailer family are oblivious to the terrible danger that enters their lives when seven-year-old Anthony is referred to the child guidance service by the family GP following the breakdown of his parents' marriage.Fifty-eight year old Dr David Galbraith, a sadistic predatory paedophile employed as a consultant child psychiatrist, has already murdered one child in the soundproofed cellar below the South Wales Georgian town-house he shares with his wife and two young daughters.Anthony becomes Galbraithâ€™s latest obsession, and he will stop at nothing to make his grotesque fantasies reality.The novel is entirely fictional, but draws on John Nicholl's experiences as a police officer, child protection social worker, manager and trainer.During his career the author was faced with case after case that left him incredulous as to the harm sexual predators chose to inflict on their victims. The book reflects that reality.The story is set in 1992, a more naive time when many found it extremely difficult to believe that a significant number of adults posed a serious risk to children.The book contains material some may find upsetting from the start.It is dedicated to survivors everywhere.The gripping sequel: 'When evil calls your name' is now available on Amazon.",
