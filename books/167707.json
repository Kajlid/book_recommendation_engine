  "description": "Young, talented, ambitious. Wild.  Three friends, who struggled for fortune and fame, have finally found themselves thrust into mega-stardom.  What is right if there is no wrong…  For Ty, Lena and Danny, they're about to find out as they cross the boundaries from all things safe to an arena testing love, friendship and loyalty. An arena that's forbidden, taboo…and oh so tempting.  They’re riding hard and fast in a world where sex, money, love and rock & roll are all a game of give & receive, where any wish can be granted if you just ask...  Open, honest and raw, this is a rare glimpse of what happens behind the fortune and the fame, beyond the limelight, past the adulation and acclaim.  Welcome...to the real.  ***Give and Receive is an erotic romance serial released every 4 to 6 weeks, at approximately 10000 to 14000 words each. Due to graphic sexual content and language, we recommend this to mature audiences, ages 18 and over, who are comfortable with this subject matter.***",
