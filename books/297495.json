  "description": "Once upon a time she became mine. Mine to destroy.  I used to have it all. Successful career. Loving husband who adored me. A future full of possibilities. A perfect fairytale nothing could break. Until one day, life as I knew it was crushed into tiny little pieces. I was charged with a murder I didn't commit. And no matter how much I begged for justice, no one believed me. Least of all the man who promised to stand by me through anything. And the husband of the woman I allegedly killed? He vowed for me to live in a hell on earth–and even then it wouldn’t be enough to atone for my sin. His words rang in my ears every single day as life became an endless nightmare.With time, I grew to hate him so much my heart burned from it. Until three years later new evidence was found. And everyone believed my truth. I might be free but I’m still part of a twisted game the monster is playing. And the only way I can survive in it? Trust a man who I promised to hate till my last breath.",
