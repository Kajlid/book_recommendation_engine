  "description": "The Ogaron realm is about to suffer another ten thousand year battle - the great struggle between the twin gods Ogaron the ruler of light and Dragharam the ruler of darkness - to determine who will rule the realm for the next ten thousand years. The off-springs of Ogaron - the Gryphons (people who can turn into griffins), oppose the off-springs of Dragharam - the Draghars (people who can turn into dragons).Some months before the day of the battle, the youngest princess of Griffin Island, Theodora, is kidnapped by the Draghars and taken to Dragharon as a captive. There, Theodora meets the dragon of wisdom fire, the king of the Draghars, the strongest among dragons, who happens to be a menacing but charming young man.Jeidin and Ominis - the two strongest griffins - are sent by the Gryphon authorities to retrieve the princess. However, behind their backs, Ominis is plotting to kill King Alfred of the Gryphons and get the throne of Griffin Island.---The cover picture belongs to Tarivanima, a wonderful artist on Deviantart.com.",
