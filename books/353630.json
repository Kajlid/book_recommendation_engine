  "description": "Nina, auditor extraordinaire, is known at work as the Ice Queen, where her colleagues joke that her frosty demeanor travels to the bedroom. But what they don't know is that Nina spends her after-work hours locked into fiery games with her boyfriend Andrew, where she acts out her deepest fantasy of being a prostitute. Nina ups the stakes in her anonymous guise, being drawn deeper and deeper into London's seedy underworldâ€”where everything can be bought and sold and no one is to be trusted.",
