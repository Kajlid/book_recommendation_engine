  "description": "Is love worth the threat of extinction? Following the death of her parents, Eren Donovan is forced to move to Spruce Knoll to live with an aunt she’s never met. She soon learns that the entire town’s population are channelers—people who can manipulate energy. Channelers are tied to the fate of the world, and as it slowly dies, they are going extinct. But they alone have the power to save the earth. Meeting local boy Aiden makes Erin think the threat of extinction might not be the worth the benefits of belonging to such a society. But the mysteries in Spruce Knoll rotting the very roots of the town threaten to topple the new life Erin is building. Some of the locals don’t like that she’s from a family that embraces mixed bloods. Some of them are even willing to kill to keep the bloodlines pure. It soon becomes apparent that the untimely death of Eren’s parents was no accident and that there are those that want her dead too. If she can’t embrace her unwanted power, she may not only fail to protect the only family she has left, but she could also fall prey to the very people who murdered her parents.",
