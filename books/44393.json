Sexual killers, rapists, pedophiles - none escape his cold fury. However, when someone begins 'poaching' into his territory, Axel is caught between the urge to find and kill this kindred soul or greet another of his 'species'. Is the Rider a real spiritual entity or just the product of a kid's scarred psyche? Do you dare to find out? Feeding the Urge is a novel exploring a traumatized man's inner struggle between feelings and urges. It is Will alone stronger than Demons? Adult only.",
