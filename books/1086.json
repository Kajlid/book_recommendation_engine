That's where the immortal Nick Fletcher finds her. In love with Amalie, he's determined to see if they have a chance together. Now that he's back in her life, Amalie can't deny that her feelings for him have never faded. Through Nick's care, Amalie's power returns, making her visible to the Dark Fae King Reiden. With a singular hatred for Amalie, the one POW who escaped, Reiden creates an environmental disaster to kill her--a disaster that will make the worst hurricane's wreckage seem like mild clutter. To survive and break the past's hold on her, Amalie will have to ally with those who betrayed her, reach out to those she herself betrayed, and unite her two selves--the person she once was and the person she wants to be. ** A BookStrand Mainstream Romance",
