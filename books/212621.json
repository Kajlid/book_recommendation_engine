They have everything a gay couple could possibly wish for - A Central Park West Co-op, a summer house on Long Island, recognition in the arts, children (by Dan's previous marriage), family approval, and each other's love. But when Daniel goes to England to produce a TV series for the BBC and Jonathan is left alone at their summer house, their seven year perfect union is about to undergo its severest test. Enter Stevie, young beautiful, fottloose, female and ripe for an unconventional post summer romance. Who could be a better, or more vulnerable, target than Jonathan?",
