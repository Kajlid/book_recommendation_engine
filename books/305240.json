  "description": "Legend says every twenty-five years, Winter chooses a new bride. Most believe it’s nothing more than a myth or a fairytale, but then Winter’s messenger comes to my village and chooses my sister as his next bride. I never fit in, never belonged, so I decide to take her place and marry the god myself. My family always said I was blessed by Summer himself, holding a warmth inside of me even during the coldest winter months. When I find out it’s true, that Summer had indeed been watching over me my entire life, things grow complicated. Both Winter and Summer want me as their brides. Choosing between them won’t be easy. In fact, it might just be impossible. How can you choose which half of your heart to follow? **Winter’s Bride is a standalone, 45,000 word novella. This book includes some steamy scenes, and in the end, our heroine might not have to choose between her love interests.**",
