  "description": "This is the Activity Story Book adaptation of Sunshine and Her Big Blarney Smile! It is a delightful pairing of traditional story book and companion activities to entertain kids in the age range of 3-7. Activities include numerous full page coloring opportunities, the complete story to read and a variety of age appropriate, fun things to do. Children who learn about symbolic cultural differences among the countries of the world will be fascinated...castles, folklore, and more! I affectionately refer to this pair of delightful books as my little travellin' sunshines!",
