  "description": "Under normal circumstances, PI Donald Strachey wouldn't take a job from right-wing radio \"shock jock\" J-Bird. But Strachey not only needs the money, he's also intrigued that the death threats against the radio DJ are being made in the name of a radical gay rights group that has been defunct for over twenty years. When things escalate past mere threats, Strachey has precious little time to uncover the connection between a group from the past and the violent present.",
