  "description": "Torrin Wyatt was doing routine maintenance to the ComSat of the ship he was assigned to in the ITFS. An apparent accident results in him waking up in an unfamiliar place, all alone. He finds himself in an empty civilian spaceport on what seems to be a small abandoned planet with a very strange, icy landscape. Things still don't make any sense after he meets Victor Healey, a twentieth century American who also mysteriously arrived in the same terminal a month earlier. They're soon joined by others from all throughout human history, and begin discovering what they all have in common. It becomes a fight for survival as they're suddenly under attack from the forces that brought them together.",
