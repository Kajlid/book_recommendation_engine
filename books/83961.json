  "description": "My name is not actually Penny Dreadful. It is Penelope Jones. The 'Dreadful' bit is my dad's JOKE. But I am definitely not dreadful... it's just sometimes people don't appreciate the brilliance of my ideas! I mean, it was a BRILLIANT IDEA to hunt a VAMPIRE and Cosmo said Mr. Bentley-Bucket was only pretending to be human. Also Grandma Overall who does not see the BRIGHT SIDE needed cheering up, so I don't know why she didn't like her super-sparkly MAKEOVER. And the water spraying all over the kitchen was completely worth it because I ended up being a Record Breaker!",
