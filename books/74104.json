  "description": "In this gentle, but beautiful memoir, Valerie shares her experience of trading a life in the fast lane of Johannesburg for that of Rotterdam's serene Oude Haven, where after separating from her husband she sets about restoring a historic barge in return for her rent. Her touchingly sincere story is one of discovery, friendship, endurance and love and, most importantly, never allowing the landlubbers to get you down!",
