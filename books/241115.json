  "description": "A snowstorm, a highway, a lonely hotel…  Devastated by the deaths of her parents and disillusioned with life, Caroline Daynes is in America trying to connect with their memory. Travelling to her mother’s hometown of Williamsfield in Pennsylvania, she is caught in a snowstorm and forced to stop at The Egress hotel – somewhere she’d planned to visit as her parents honeymooned there.  From the moment she sets foot inside the lobby and meets the surly receptionist, she realises this is a hotel like no other. Charming and unique, it seems lost in time with a whole cast of compelling characters sheltering behind closed doors.  As the storm deepens, so does the mystery of The Egress. Who are these people she’s stranded with, what secrets do they hide? And, in a situation that’s becoming increasingly nightmarish, is it possible to find solace?",
