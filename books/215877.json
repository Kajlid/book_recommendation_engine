  "title": "Danger: Dinosaurs!",
  "description": "The John C. Winston Co., 1953. First Edition [stated] and first printing. Octavo, olive-green cloth (the green cloth apparently varied a bit in shade with this title), 210 pp.; pictorial jacket, correct with twenty titles on the back. Iconic endpaper designs of course are by Alex Schomburg; in this case, as with several others in the series, Schomburg also executed the memorable dustjacket. Near Fine book, with very little sign of wear anywhere; top page edges a bit darker than bottom edges or fore-edges, as is almost always the case. Not a whole lot of age-toning to the textblock, either. Jacket isn't quite VG, but is NOT price-clipped, still showing the $2.00 price. One notable chip, top front, peripheral wear, rubbing (see scans). Tight, complete, clean and, though somewhat worn, still a solid example of an inexpensively produced, always-actually-read-by-the-original-owner title. If you're here - and you are - you know the Winston series of juvenile sci-fi novels, a 37-title series issued between 1952 and 1961. The first editions are not common, Dinosaurs !, from early in the series, has long been known to be one of the scarcest, a work by Richard Marsten, one of the many pseudonyms of famed writer/screenwriter Evan Hunter (\"Evan Hunter\" was itself a pseudonym, for the real guy, Salvatore Albert Lombino). - L64",
