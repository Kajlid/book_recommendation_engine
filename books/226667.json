  "description": "High-powered Boston attorney Emma Madison is celebrating her latest courtroom victory when she gets a call from a number she doesn't recognize. Area code 803—home. Home is Juneberry, South Carolina—eight hundred miles, twelve years, and a lifetime away from Boston—and Emma's father has had a serious heart attack. Emma rushes to his bedside, and a weekend trip threatens to become an extended stay. She has to work fast to arrange the affairs of his small-town law practice so she can return to her life and career in Boston. And then Michael Evans shows up. They'd shared hopes, dreams, and a passionate love as young college students during a long-ago summer. But Emma walked away—from Michael and from Juneberry—to finish college and start a new life. Michael has never forgotten her. Enveloped in the warmth of family and small-town life—and discovering that she still cares for Michael—Emma knows she'll have to make a choice between the career she's worked so hard to build and the love she left behind.",
