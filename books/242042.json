  "description": "Calista \"I am the monster they created. I’m the whore they’re ashamed of.\"  When life tried to break me I grabbed that b*tch by the throat and squeezed. I thought I could overcome anything. I swore I could handle him, but after being forced to play at the Devil's playground I ended up craving his touch.  One taste of his poison made my loyalties begin to waiver.  Romero \"I’m a living nightmare, I’m everything they fear.\"  I’ve been called the Devil, deranged, and a savage. I lived by a code created by rebel souls. We were sinners and thieves that made no apologies for taking whatever the f*ck we wanted. Saving a girl in the woods was never part of my plans, but when I saw the crazy in her eyes I knew it was a match made in hell.  Now secrets are piling up, the bodies are rotting, and time is running out to finish what I started.   Forewarning, our story is more than a little f*cked up.    Authors Note : 18+ I am not going to put a long 'warning' on this book. I will say that Savages is a VERY cautionary tale that has no regard for hard limits. Reader discretion IS highly advised.",
