  "description": "In this \"mystery of cold beauty and dark isolation, written with crystalline precision\" (Miami Herald), a series of crib deaths in Syracuse, New York, draws the attention of police and national media. Is a serial infant murderer at large?A \"haunting story, icy cold in its upstate New York setting but glowing with the unusual brightness of its heroine\" (Eugene Weekly), Origin stars a solitary fingerprint examiner who finds herself playing a critical role in the case. Diana Abu-Jaber, a \"gifted and graceful writer\" (Chicago Tribune), masterfully \"transcends formula\" (Kirkus Reviews) as \"the tension of Origin escalates, shaped as much by beautifully nuanced prose as menacing events\" (New York Daily News). Reading group guide included.",
