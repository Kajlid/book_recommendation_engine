  "description": "TROUBLE IN PARADISEThe islands are home to an eclectic mix of ex-pats, escaping a troubled former life. For Captain Jolly, refugee from an acrimonious divorce, the good life looks set to come to an abrupt end - the Do Over, his 38-foot sailing Catamaran, lies scuttled amongst mangroves, threatened like the island itself by a violent tropical storm. Can this tropical idyll and its inhabitants survive the trial that lies ahead? Captain Jollyâ€™s Do Over is an irreverant Rum-Diaries style romp with some interesting insights into the human condition.",
