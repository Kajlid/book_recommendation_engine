  "description": "Blood is thicker than water, but dirt makes it all go away... Yes her father is dead, and yes Fiona might have pushed his lifeless body down the mine shaft that's hidden under the house, but that doesn't mean that she killed him. Or does it? Alone with her crazy Ma and twin sisters, life becomes hellaciously complicated. Especially when Deadwood's newest and sexiest Sioux deputy starts snooping around and asking questions. There's only one way to keep her mother's house and the deputy distracted and that's by turning the mansion into a house of sin. Gatlin might be a lawman, but he's still a man. Gatlin Whitehorse might be taking a chance every time he steps foot into the MacGregor house, but more than Fiona's sexy curves draw him to the strange Victorian mansion. Seamus Mac Gregor has gone missing and his wife and daughters don't seem to know a damn thing about it. But after a hot encounter with the oldest daughter, the secrets of the house won't stay buried for long. While he finds the truth, he loses his heart. It's a who done it, fun and flirty mystery where all of Deadwood becomes a suspect. To find the truth the deputy might have to get Dirty in Deadwood.",
