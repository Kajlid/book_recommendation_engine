  "description": "NETFLIX NEWS! The 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN series is being adapted into a steamy Netflix dramedy series called SEX/LIFE, coming soon! Because BB Easton had so much fun writing her best-selling, award-winning memoir, 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN, she decided to give each of her four men his own steamy stand-alone. STAR is Hans's book--a whirlwind rock star romance based on true events. In 1999, I met my Prince Charming. He was the tall, tattooed, wickedly handsome bass player for the up-and-coming rock band, Phantom Limb. But, more importantly, he was mine. I knew it the moment he flashed me that shy, dimpled smile. And he knew it too. Hansel “Hans” Oppenheimer wore his heart on one sleeve and scrawled lyrics about me on the other. Unlike the losers of my past, Hans showered me with tenderness, took me places I’d never been before, and showed me the type of all-consuming love I’d thought only existed in fairy tales. But, like any good fairy tale, my road to happily ever after was paved with challenges, and right when I least expected it…it forked.In 1999, I met my Prince Charming.In 2000, I met my soul mate.\n*STAR is Book 3 in the 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN spin-off series but can be read as a complete standalone.",
