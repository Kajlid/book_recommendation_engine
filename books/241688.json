  "description": "Adaline Sharp has crossed the world to be anonymous. She's put thousands of kilometres between herself and those who need her, and joined forty-seven others on a group tour through Europe. Freedom is bliss. Acting her age is a novelty and the world away from home is wonderful. But her low profile is not to last.Intrigued by the wide-eyed girl who can't seem to get enough of the world, fellow tour mate Rory Frost adjusts his priorities. He's going to see everything, but he's going to see it with her.Except Adaline didn't come here to make friends - friends equal obligations and expectations, and Adaline's learned that to need someone is to bind them. Rory must show Adaline that the right relationships can empower her if he is to have any hope of seeing her again after the international departure terminal.",
