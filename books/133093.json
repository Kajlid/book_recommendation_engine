  "description": "Even though Bethanne Hostetler has found some peace eight years after an attempted assault and the accidental death of Peter Miller, she is still haunted by the memory. When her Englisher cousin, Candace--who has just been crowned Miss Crittenden County--reveals that she has a stalker, all of Bethanne's old fears come rushing back.Jay Raber had once been Peter's best friend, and the fact that he did not protect Bethanne that fateful night has haunted him ever since. To make matters worse, she continues to avoid him--even as he continues to love her. Jay can only hope and pray that one day Bethanne will see the person he is today and not the boy he used to be. As Candace's stalker becomes bolder, Officer Ryan Mulany becomes her escort to various events. He knows he should only think of Candace as a job, but the more time they spend together, the harder it gets to maintain professional distance. And when everyone's worst fears are realized, all four must work together to prevent another tragedy before time runs out and another innocent person is hurt. From New York Times bestselling author Shelley Shepard Gray comes this emotionally taut story of learning to forgive, trust, and love despite the pain of the past.",
