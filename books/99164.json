  "description": "Khrystiana had always been different, a difference that had kept her from being chosen from amongst the other children at the orphanage. She had always been more or less alone, for not only the children mostly avoided her, the staff did as well. Khrystiana would learn on her sixteenth birthday just how different she truly was, due to a series of event that would occur... Events that would prove that she had not been as alone as she had always thought.",
