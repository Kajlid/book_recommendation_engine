  "description": "The title, Evil is a Terrific Rubbery Goblet, was born from an exercise with refrigerator magnets and Carrie's nephew, Daniel - and captures her central attitude toward the tonic known as \"life\". Carrie Gardner has been writing poetry for 20 years, but this is her very first independent publication. Her poetry has been described by friends, critics and fellow writers as 'rare and uniquely detailed', 'devastating moving pictures', and 'way cool'. Carrie describes her poetry as experiments in truth. You decide.",
