  "description": "Due to circumstances completely within his control, Shax, the Demon Prince of Thieves has fled, er, emigrated from Earth to seek his fortunes out in the galaxy. With his faithful friend, Verin, by his side, they acquire a gently used ship with a drag-queen AI.  Hell for the Company: Brimstone 1 Everything's going just fine, thank you very much. All right, the anti-gravity cows are a bit problematic and some of Shax's buyers are bad for his health, but he manages until he comes across an injured angel in a psychedelic alien jungle.  Fear of Frogs: Brimstone 2 While Shax recovers from a near fatality, his shipmates have taken the initiative and found them a lucrative cargo run. Shax is horrified to find out what sort of cargo. Unfortunately, he'll soon discover that a healthy fear of frogs doesn't prevent frog-driven disasters.  Shax's War: Brimstone 3 The boys desperately need a vacation. With the not-quite-ill-gotten gains from the Frog incident, Shax takes the Brimstone's crew to the exclusive resort planet, Opal. What could possibly go wrong?",
