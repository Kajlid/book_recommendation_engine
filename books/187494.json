When the tides turn on his investment and financial ruin threatens what little family he has left, Benedict will do anything to save them. He will return to London to find a wealthy bride and to discover the identity of his silent partner. Once, Miss Judith Sutherland dreamed of love, but it cost her everything. Humiliated by the man she loved, Judith returns home to care for her dying father, but his death brings her position as lady of the manor to an end. After living far from the ton for years, she must find a new way to live, independent of any man. What better way than as a lady’s companion?

A single dance and two lives change forever… As danger and scandal court Benedict and Judith once again, will they surrender to their heart’s desire? Or will they allow duty and pride to destroy any chance at happiness?
