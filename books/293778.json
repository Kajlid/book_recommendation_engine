  "description": "I have nowhere left to run… I’ll never love another the way I loved him. He might have been a prince, but to me he was just Erik. The father of my child. The man whose love was so fierce, it’s like it never left me. Some days I swear I can still feel his presence surrounding me, until I’m reminded that our love song is over. Moving on is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.Hollow without him, the music that’s been pouring out of my soul is the only way to ease the ache. It will never replace the love of my life, but for my baby’s sake, I have to try. Every tragic lyric, every minor chord, proves that I can’t outrun his ghost or the truth... my heart beats only for him.",
