  "description": "THIS NOVELETTE IS NOW FREE AT SMASHWORDS!In this fantasy novelette (8500 words) we read about the slate-blue world of Ziraf. In addition to humans, Ziraf’s Dreamers created spirit beings called the Troil, who communicate with and sometimes counsel their mortal companions. The Troi Wagmi suggests to the Headman of Greivat Fastness that he might ask the Zem’l for immortality. But when the Headman approaches the aged Shrine Guardian Gilzara with a request for help in summoning the correct Zem, Gilzara himself is seduced by the idea of immortality, if he might obtain it not only for himself but also for his dying wife. Krozem, the Creator of Humankind, proves to be surprisingly receptive, but things do not turn out quite as planned.",
