Dead Man's Hand addresses the myth of ghosts. Skull Creek Stakeout addresses the myth of vampires (it started in the Upper Room). Dead Low Tide addresses the myth of zombies and the walking dead. Rumor of a Werewolf deals with powerful men who refuse to honor God and are turned into beast-like creatures (Book of Daniel). All these events are mentioned in the Bible.\" Eddie JonesPraise for the Caden Chronicles Mystery series\"This series has the same longevity and wholesome quality as The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew but the author writes for today's youth.\" ~ Amazon review\"I enjoyed reading this fun suspense adventure.
