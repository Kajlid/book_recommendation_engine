  "description": "Best Seller on Amazon! Spirituality is not about joining a church, taking a religious label or becoming a fanatic. It is having an intimate relationship with the Living God and knowing He dwells inside you. When you really know Him, the problems you are stressed out about now, will fade away. Tomorrow is a new day and God wants to do a new thing in your life. \"The writer is engaging, more than the typical dry, religious preaching. I learned things about myself, how to make positive changes and how to love myself. Positive, inspirational teaching and stories from the life of a real person who God has helped overcome a difficult past and face the world with confidence and success\"- Jaime \"Not only did this book bring tears of pure to joy to my eyes, it made me feel something in my heart that wasn't there before. Recently, I have been struggling with my faith. I have always known there was some higher power out there, but I have never fully opened my heart to the idea of it. Sure, I have been to christian summer camps, and I go to youth group on Sundays, and I do those things that people of faith are supposed to do. I just never fully opened my heart to the idea that there is a God. After reading this book, I feel my faith growing stronger, and I want to open my heart to God and feel his presence in my life\"- Shayla",
