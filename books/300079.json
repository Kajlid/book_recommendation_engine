  "description": "After her husband left her for her best friend, Hayden Young moved to Hope Valley looking for a fresh start for her and her daughter. The last thing she expected was to run into the man who had rocked her world in the middle of the wine section of the local grocery store. And no matter how many times she tells herself she hates the egotistical jerk, she can’t stop the tingle she feels every time she looks at him.Micah Langford was a man who enjoyed the variety. He had absolutely no interest in finding one woman and settling down. Then a one-night-stand from his past—and the best sex of his life—came rolling into town, and the self-proclaimed bachelor started wanting more. The only problem is, she can’t stand the sight of him.When hate gives way to fire, igniting a passion neither of them can deny, Micah finds himself thinking about the future—or more specifically, how he can fit Hayden into his. But when a case he’s working on heats up, and she starts asking questions he can’t answer, Hayden has a decision to make. She can either take a leap and put her trust in him, or she can let the secrets destroy them.",
