  "description": "Love’s Memoir takes us back to a time when growing up meant living off the land, hunting, fishing and farming. Out of necessity, folks pulled together to make a life and find ways to have fun in the beautiful, and at times forbidding, Ozark Mountains. It’s a tale of joy and learning and loss in the style of Mark Twain’s timeless adventures of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. Experience a by gone era of life in a small Ozark Mountains community through the story of one boy’s coming of age in a land of rushing streams, haunted caves and deep woods.",
