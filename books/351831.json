  "description": "Perhaps if Joe and Vicky had known what relocating to a tiny village, tucked in the Alpujarra mountains, would really be like, they might have hesitated... They have no idea of the culture shock in store. No idea they will become reluctant chicken farmers and own the most dangerous cockerel in Spain. No idea they will be befriended by an 85 year old spliff-smoking sex-kitten or rescued by a mule. Life is never dull as they embark on their Five Year Plan. At the end of five years they must decide. Will they stay, or return to the relative sanity of England? Vicky and Joe's story is packed with irreverent humour, animals, eccentric characters and sunshine. 'Chickens, Mules and Two Old Fools' was awarded the HarperCollins Authonomy 'Gold Star' in November 2008. 'laugh-out-loud funny...especially the Spanish women heckling over eggs from the The English...hilarious...engaging...the interspersion of recipes is charming' HarperCollins 'This is wonderful. I have tears in my eyes...the humour, the warmth, the joy...I love this book...the two of you sitting on the sofa in that dusty street listening to Spanish tunes on the crackly radio. What a sight you must have been...' Aleck Loker, author of 18 books including 'Ancient Explorers of America'. 'I love the relaxed writing style and easy humour of this. Great stuff!' Denny Gillan, author of 'Will You Love Me Tomorrow'. 'Victoria Twead is a natural storyteller with a knack for charm and wit.' Robin Bayley, author of 'The Mango Orchard'.",
