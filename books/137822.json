  "description": "In 2013 I lost one of my dearest friends in a senseless act of violence and it made me reflect on the incredible value of friendship. Our world is so different without our friends. This devastating loss also brought tremendous gratitude for the friendships I’m blessed to have. It reminded me of how precious these relationships are and all the amazing things I learned about friendships over the years. I wanted to share what I learned. This book isn’t a guide to making casual friends, it’s about the depth of value real friends have in our lives. Told through personal stories, it shares insights on how to navigate the challenges that real friendships face. And above all, it reminds us to pause and acknowledge our friendships, these true treasures of life, while we still can. The Opposite Of Poverty Is Friendship is a reminder that life is almost meaningless without your friends; they are your greatest treasure.",
