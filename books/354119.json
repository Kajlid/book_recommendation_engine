  "description": "It’s just another lonely and boring night for widowed Officer Trisha MacAvie Sutton as she pulls into a convenience store after her Friday night shift. Turning down the hot chocolate aisle, Trisha comes face to face with Nazz Pisani and Pasquale Deluca, two super-sexy jocks from her high school days who were known for the Sandwich Play, a spectacular move on the soccer field that rendered an opposing player helpless. Painfully shy back then, Trisha hid her desire for the two hot hunks. But now? Oh yeah. She’s game for a little two on one.",
