  "description": "Charlie has been without a Master for a few months and has spent that time settling into a life that doesn’t depend on someone else. He still aches to submit, except after all this time, it’s no longer a “have to” thing, but a “want to” thing. Well, until he walks into the tattoo shop Irons, and decides that the artist there belongs in the “bend me over and do evil things to me” column.Troy’s wolf is vibrating beneath his skin, growling, clawing, and snarling to get closer to sweet Charlie. He’d always seen the human man with his Master at the local mostly-werewolf BDSM club, Knots, and the sight excited him like nothing else. But it isn’t until the man walks into his tattoo shop without a collar that he realizes why his beast howls when he catches sight of Charlie. The gentle, submissive human is his mate. After inking him, Troy is dying to make sure his man is cuffed and claimed.",
