  "description": "A funny, fast, and noisy tale about finding friends where you least expect to is the perfect vehicle for reading aloud.Poor Pierre! He lives all alone at the foot of a mountain, and his heart, how it longs for a friend. Perhaps if he hops in his car — toot, toot, zoom! — he will find a friend on the other side of the mountain! On the road — SCREECH! — he meets Goat, who kindly offers to help. And that, says Pierre, is exactly the sort of thing his friend will do when he finds him! Up, up they zoom, collecting an amiable Sheep and Bear along the way. Will the car make it to the top? Will it get safely down? Will Pierre ever find a friend? Phyllis Root’s wry, cumulative story revs readers up with BIG sound words, while Matthew Cordell's energetic illustrations and a fun, dynamic design keep them happily strapped in for the ride.",
