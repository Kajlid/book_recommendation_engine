He rather enjoys his own wastrel life.He finds the perfect solution when he rescues one hugely irritating spitfire by the name of Miss Katie Pringle from drowning. She's a runaway bride. Her wealthy father and even wealthier betrothed are offering an extremely generous reward for her safe return. All Niall has to do is get her back to London and claim his riches. What can possibly go wrong?",
