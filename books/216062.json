  "description": "Gamers are celebrities. Superstars. Idols to the masses. Only a few ever make it out of Piper's Mill, most toil their lives away in the small town just dreaming of a better life. Liam thought he had a comfortable life all worked out when it winds up wrenched away from him. Drawn into other's schemes to hack the game and steal some spotlight he never expects to find himself playing in a game nobody has ever heard of. He never expects to find himself deep in a dungeon at level one with no gear and barely any skills. He certainly would never anticipate suddenly being tied to forces that promise not just to reshape his life, but the world outside the game. Time to level up.",
