  "description": "Who is the Spiritual Wanderer? He's an ordinary person like you and me. When he crawls out of bed each morning, he needs to find a cup of frozen coffee before he can contemplate searching for spiritual answers in the cosmos. As his day unfolds, Rodney Curtis looks everywhere for meaning and hope-and always for humor. He wanders through the lives of people around him, through the streets with his beloved dogs and even searches for spiritual guidance in the lights high above us, although that winking glow up there sometimes turns out to be a streetlight. Rodney Curtis uses his unique wit and gifted storytelling throughout these 40 easy-to-read short essays. Rodney takes a humorous, extraordinary look at his ordinary life as he searches for spiritual guidance and hope in everyday events and in the lives of those around him. These stories will lift you up and make you laugh and when you are finished reading, you'll pass it on to a friend and buy another copy for another friend. Some chapter titles to entice",
