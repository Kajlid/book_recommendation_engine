  "description": "It is January 1, 1913; and Ilaytha is about to begin her service as a test subject to the warlock Edwin Hubble. Despite being a brilliant scientist, Ilaytha is human and thus will never be able to work on her own. Only warlocks like Sergei Diaghilev and Henri Becquerel are allowed to pursue art, science, or literature. Humans exist to perform hard labor and to produce warlock children; but Ilaytha believes herself to be the exception to the rule. Her pride will force her to learn what lies behind the fa√ßade the warlocks have created.",
