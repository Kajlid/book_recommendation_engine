  "title": "Southern Mail",
  "description": "In his first novel, Saint-Exupéry pays homage to “those elemental divinities—night, day, mountain, sea, and storm,” turning an account of a routine mail flight from France to North Africa into an epic rendering of the pioneer days of commercial aviation. The book is also a poignant reminiscence of a tragic affair, in which the uncertainties of love and flight enhance the mystery of one another. Translated by Curtis Cate.",
