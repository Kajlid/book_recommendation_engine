Sequel to Draw One in the Dark and The Gentleman Takes a Chance.Sequel to Draw One in the Dark and The Gentleman Takes a Chance—a new entry in Sarah A. Hoyt’s celebrated Shifter contemporary fantasy series!For years, Rafiel Trall, one of Goldport's finest, has been walking the fine line between enforcing human law and protecting the shifters who come his way.  A lion shifter himself, he's found this duty onerous.  Lately it's been lightened by his friendship with Tom Ormson, a dragon shifter, and Kyrie Smith, a panther shifter.  This should make it easier for him to find a solution for the crimes of a feral shifter—but not when an as yet unnamed entity takes out the Great Sky Dragon, the head of all dragon shifters.  With his power devolving on Tom Ormson just as Kyrie finds that a mysterious ailment prevents her from shifting, Rafiel must rely only on himself, a seductive dragon girl and an even more seductive and unreliable old shifter to solve the crimes, maintain shifters hidden and keep his best friend in the world from becoming a dragon of unimaginable mass destruction.",
