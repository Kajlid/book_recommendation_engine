  "description": "A practicing neurosurgeon himself, Gupta provides a unique look inside the high-pressure world of medicine and paints a vivid picture of the method by which surgeons learn often through their mistakes. Every time surgeons operate, they are betting that their skills can beat a brain tumor, a faulty heart valve, or a clogged artery. Sometimes, they re wrong. At Chelsea General, surgeons answer for bad outcomes at the Morbidity and Mortality Conference, known as M & M. This extraordinary peek behind the curtain into what is considered one of the most secret meetings in all of medicine is the backdrop for Sanjay Gupta s first novel. \"Monday Mornings\" follows the lives of five surgeons as they push the limits of their abilities and confront their personal and professional failings, often in front of their peers at M & M.\"",
