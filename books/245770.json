As the obscure treasure hunt suddenly turns into deadly reality, the historian is unwittingly plunged into a world she never believed existed: A world in which in which history has the power to kill and in which the legend of Vlad the Impaler, the fifteenth-century Wallachian prince who inspired the tale of Dracula, is still very much alive.Her desperate search for the truth, leads her from the University of Oxford, to London, Paris and St. Gallen, and from there to a remote monastery in the Făgăraș Mountains, at the heart of what was once the principality of Wallachia.",
