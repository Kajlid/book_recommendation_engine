  "title": "The Pre-Flood Origins of Astrology",
  "description": "What is modern astrology and why are so many people fascinated with it? Where did it come from and is there any truth to it? Find out what the sun, moon, and planets are for, according to the Bible, then see how the ancient pre-flood world perverted that knowledge to form a type of proto-astrology. Learn how and when the horoscope was invented and how it is used in the occult world. Learn what wise men who followed the star of Bethlehem knew from the Bible and the wise men's own account of what they experienced. From these records, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the books of Enoch, Jasher, and Josephus, we learn the history of astrology and why Christians should not be involved with it. Numerous scientific studies are also examined in this work. Brought to you by Biblefacts Ministries, biblefacts.org",
