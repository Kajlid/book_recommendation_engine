  "description": "After Maria Mast’s abusive ex-boyfriend is arrested for being involved in sex trafficking and modern-day slavery, she thinks that she and her son Carter are finally safe.   But the danger has only just begun.  Someone begins stalking her, and they want blood and revenge.  Agent Derek Turner of Covert Police Detectives Unit is assigned as her bodyguard. From the moment they meet in a bank robbery where she saves a little girl's life, he is fascinated by her.  When Maria returns home to her former Amish community in Unity, Maine, Derek goes with her as her undercover bodyguard, and tried to blend in with the other Amish men.  For him, it’s personal. He’s determined to arrest her stalker and shut down the sex trafficking ring that he believes may have killed his late wife two years ago.  Maria's secretive eyes, painful past, and cautious demeanor intrigue him.   As the human trafficking ring begins to target the Amish community, Derek wonders if the distraction of her will cost him his career…and Maria's life.
