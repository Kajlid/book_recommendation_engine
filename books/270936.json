Returning home to London from her magical holiday in Norway, still on a high after meeting the wonderful Kristine, her newfound happiness is dealt a crushing blow when she discovers that her ex has been stealing from her and she is going to lose her business. A letter from an American lawyer throws her an unexpected lifeline, informing her that she’s inherited a house and a restaurant in Presley, Louisiana, from her biological mother who gave her up for adoption at birth. Meanwhile back in Covington, nothing ever changes in Kristine Miller’s life. She’s grown tired of her job at the local bank, and she’s reluctant to go back to dating, unable to get Hannah, who has gone silent on her, out of her mind. When Hannah suddenly shows up in Kristine’s life again there is no denying that destiny has a plan for them, but Hannah’s life is in London and Kristine’s is deeply attached to the beautiful South. As Hannah searches for the story behind her Southern roots, can they overcome the challenge of distance to give themselves another shot at love? Second chances are rare, and you can’t question fate when it keeps drawing you back together…",
