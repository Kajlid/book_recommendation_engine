  "description": "Price of Fame By Ashley Ladd When Average Jane Wendy Applegate is called home to be at her ailing mother's side, her secret identity is put in grave jeopardy. Neither her mother, sister, or the man she left behind knows she is the scandalous masked mega rock-and-roll star, Skye Blue. The more she tries to protect her heart and her identity, the more she fuels the coming holocaust. She certainly never dreamed that the respectable doctor she pines for has a thing for her alter ego. Feeling schizophrenic, Wendy finds herself green with envy of herself and struggles to come out of the closet before she loses more than her career...before she loses herself.",
