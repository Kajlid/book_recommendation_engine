  "description": "A modern day royal romance He was the reason storms were named after people.Purgatory: n. A place or state of suffering. An intricate balance of heaven and hell. Passion and pain. My purgatory was a palace. When my father died, I was forced to live in Thornebridge Castle- biding my time, hiding in the library and wishing I were invisible. But there’s no hiding from fate. There was a growing threat to the Crown in our country. Prince Sutton thought that threat was me. With his cruel words he unleashed a world of secrets that made me question everything I’d ever known. With his unpredictable touch he awakened something primal within me, within us. The only thing I hated more than Sutton Thorne was the way his presence set my soul on fire. I thought I’d given the Crown everything I had to give. No more suffering. In a few short months, I’d be gone. But I was about to learn what true sacrifice really meant.",
