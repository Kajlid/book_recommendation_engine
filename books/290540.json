To wear the perfect white dress and stand beside Royce Hale, the liar I tried desperately not to fall in love with and failed.Or maybe I’m still trapped in hell because the devil is here too. He lurks at my side, plotting terrible ways to make me his.It’s win at all costs in this family, and I know now just how far the Hales will go to get what they want.But you can’t survive in a house full of lies without learning the art of deception, and once I become a Hale, I’ll show them exactly what I’ve mastered.THE DECEPTION is the third and final book in the twisted Filthy Rich Americans trilogy. It should be read after THE INITIATION and THE OBSESSION.",
