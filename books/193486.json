  "description": "He is nameless.He is homeless.He is friendless.He is lost. Until he is found . . . by a team of mutts who shelter him and teach him how to survive the wilds of the city park. And so he becomes Waggit, the best hunter and tracker in the pack, and the dog with the most powerfully wagging tail. Waggit grows to love his team, especially its leader, Tazar, and his best friend, an old dog named Lowdown. But life in the park is dangerous and uncertain. In winter, food and warmth are scarce. Another team of wild dogs is a constant menace. And always, there is the fear of capture by park rangers. Waggit can't help feeling that something is missing . . . something warm and cozy and . . . human. Then one day everything changes and Waggit must face a new threat and a new choice. Peter Howe's tale of an abandoned puppy's search for a home is an exciting mix of humor, adventure, and suspense. Most of all, it is a story of how love can turn strangers into family.",
