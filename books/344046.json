  "description": "After death, one soon discovers that every theologian was right. The afterlife offers too many inconvenient options including the chance at reincarnation, a boring existence as a ghost, the ultimate demise of oblivion or a short walk into the great unknown on the other side of The Light. AFTERLIFE is a humorous yet tragic tale that forces everyone rethink their postmortem prejudices. If you think life is frustrating, try death. \"Afterlife delivers a story crawling with heart, humor and hope. Packed with a cast of characters who surprise with insights, integrity and insults, this book made me more curious about life's after-party. We can all hope that Guy's vision can light the way, because we'll be laughing and learning on that path while we wait for our turn at care that's critical.\"- Ron Seybold \". imaginative, funny and smart.\"- HeidiSpringer",
