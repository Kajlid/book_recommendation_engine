I’m ready for Mr. Right Now and Ian is everything I’ve ever wanted in a first time. He’s kind, funny, confident, and has a legendary…stick.Seriously, his stick has its own page of search results, complete with gray sweatpants shots hot enough to make even a clueless virgin drool.And yes, my brother will murder us if he finds out, but we’re both grownups.We can keep a secret. We have to since I just landed an art therapy job working with his troubled team.All we’re doing is a little practice. (Or…ehem...big practice.)Too bad my heart didn’t get the memo.",
