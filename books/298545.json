  "title": "Homefront",
  "description": "When Mia Sharpe's boyfriend, Jake, deploys to the war in Iraq, much of her sanity goes with him. Faced with the daily anxiety of what she views as his inevitable death, Mia's struggle to stay positive is challenged by a sensationalist media, a quasi-mother in-law, the brutal honesty of a disgruntled soldier's wife, and the magnetic post-war depression of a Vietnam veteran. Homefront explores the uncomfortable truths of a deployment: jealousy, selfishness, joy, anger, and abject fear. Through the interactions between the book's vivid characters, Homefront reveals the unexpected beauty to be found hiding in the torture of waiting as each character responds to the war in his or her own unique, and painfully intimate, way.",
