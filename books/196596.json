  "description": "SHIP'S BOYFor Kelly, it was an impossible dream come true when he shipped out on the Space Angel. Ship's boy was the most menial job aboard, but it was excitement enough just to be in space. Things became more exciting than even Kelly wanted when an unimaginably old and powerful entity commandeered the Space Angel and sent the freighter on an incredible mission to the center of the galaxy -- with two hereditary killers and a poetic crab added to the crew for extra interest! Kelly knew that he would finish the trip as a seasoned spacer -- or a very dead one.",
