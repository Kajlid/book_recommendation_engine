  "description": "Steve Harvey, the host of the nationally syndicated Steve Harvey Morning Show, can't count the number of impressive women he's met over the years, whether it's through the \"Strawberry Letters\" segment of his program or while on tour for his comedy shows. These are women who can run a small business, keep a household with three kids in tiptop shape, and chair a church group all at the same time. Yet when it comes to relationships, they can't figure out what makes men tick. Why? According to Steve it's because they're asking other women for advice when no one but another man can tell them how to find and keep a man. In Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man, Steve lets women inside the mindset of a man and sheds lights on concepts and questions such as:—The Ninety Day Rule: Ford requires it of its employees. Should you require it of your man?—How to spot a mama's boy and what if anything you can do about it.—When to introduce the kids. And what to read into the first interaction between your date and your kids.—The five questions every woman should ask a man to determine how serious he is.— And more...Sometimes funny, sometimes direct, but always truthful, Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man is a book you must read if you want to understand how men think when it comes to relationships.",
