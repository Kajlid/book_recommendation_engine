  "description": "Liam has jumped from the frypan and into the fire.He’d hoped the rumors were fake or exaggerated, but the nasty streak hidden under Prince Briar’s pretty exterior outshines everything else. The more Liam resists, the worse it grows, and the Prince insists he needs to change his mindset, accept it, and think only of submitting.Liam knows he’s selfish, but he doesn’t see how such punishments will turn him into someone loyal who puts the Prince’s desires first. How can he ever serve such a monster and enjoy it?Prince Briar owns every part of his body, and if he has his way, he’ll own Liam’s mind too.",
