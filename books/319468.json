Now she has to trust Johnny—whom she betrayed in more ways than one—to protect her whereabouts. Johnny may have an infuriating moral compass and the timing of a storybook hero, but is he immune to the temptation of revenge?Johnny’s focus has always been his music business, and a bad influence like Hannah is the last thing he needs at work, or around his brother.But some things are too powerful to be stopped. For someone like Hannah, second chances—in life and in true love—don’t exist. She didn’t think so, at least. Johnny is about to prove her wrong, and being wrong has never felt so right.
