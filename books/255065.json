  "description": "Ever wake up one morning and think, something’s gotta change around here…?  Rose has just emerged from a disastrous relationship with a bald philanderer, and she's not happy. Something's gotta give. Oh and That’s Another Thing is the story of what happens when Rose signs up to earn five hundred karma points by doing good deeds – with the ultimate goal of qualifying for reincarnation as a cat.  Since Rose is a lazy, self-obsessed writer with more interest in reviving her squalid love life than improving the lives of those around her, her quest for personal transformation isn't easy. Luckily, she's supported by a cast of fictional assistants, including the sultry Madame Sputnik, the inscrutable Guru Fred (from Wagga) and Father O'Flaherty, the incumbent priest at St Agnes of Colostemy.  The debonair and dateless Captain Savage, her one Real friend, acts as official adjudicator of the process, giving out - or more often taking away - points as Rose selflessly befriends little kids, old people and bile bears.  Rose swishes through her year of good deeds with all the panache of a rhinoceros at a tea party. But she does learn something.",
