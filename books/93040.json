  "description": "The Reid family is back and this time it's Jane's turn to find her happily ever after. We first met Jane in the Indelible Love series where she and Max Davis, appeared to be on their way to finding love. As we all know, love is no easy four letter word, but with the help of Jake and Emily, along with the rest of the Reid clan, life becomes a bit more fun. Here is Jane herself, taking center stage, describing her very personal story.Hi! I'm Jane Reid, age 27, and this is my story. I've chosen to give you details of my life in a blog format - which means, no daily minutiae, just the good stuff. I'm currently dating Max Davis, same age as me, med-student, all around good guy, and my sister-in-law's ex-boyfriend. Sound complicated? You ain't read nothin' yet. If you think that's complicated, let me tell you about a few other \"complications\" in my life. I'm slightly (okay...more than slightly) attracted to Donovan Taylor, my childhood crush. Did I mention Donovan looks like Henry Cavill? My boyfriend has a med-student stalker in his life and a high school ex who was a lot more than just a high school ex! Max and I are always at odds with one another for who knows what reason, and there are more days of angst than bliss. Luckily, we have plenty of supportive family members and friends who help us along the way. Who will I end up with? What twists and turns are waiting for me on the next page? You will have to tune in and read all about it. Feel free to let me know what you think about my life and how you think I can fix it / improve upon it. Ttyl!",
