  "description": "Summoning The Strength is a tribute to some amazing women whose lives no one could have predicted would become so closely connected. Their compelling story shows how they navigate life, death, fear and disappointment with courage and grace. This book has it all; humor, sex, difficult family dynamics, love, friendship, deception, politics, and extreme honesty.Katherine Doyle believed she was liberated. She heard the playing field was being leveled. Popular opinion said the world view was changing, but the record reflects what our greatest minds have known all along. The more things change, the more they stay the same. This notable phrase rang true for women coming of age during the sexual revolution. Grandmothers, mothers, sisters, and daughters make the same journey no matter the vehicle. Katherine and the women in her life remarkably navigate obstacles known and unknown. Their story will help you laugh if you want to, heal if you need to, and no longer accept the statement \"we are only human\" as an excuse for bad behavior. Summoning the Strength captures the nature of a life well lived and shows how the worst of circumstances can help us discover the best of ourselves.",
