  "description": "In I Am Currency, knowledge is not only power...it is currency. Nevel Walker's photographic memory makes him more valuable than he may like in a post-apocalyptic world after books have all-but disappeared. When a meteor slams into the earth causing a shift in the earth’s magnetic core, the age of technology ends and economies across the globe crash. So for tenth grader Nevel Walker, having a photographic memory is a secret his family has to try to keep. With a dystopian government that keeps all known books under lock and parents involved in an underground movement to protect the books that do still secretly exist, Nevel is in a dangerous position. A chase through the Australian Outback changes Nevel’s fate as he finds love, mystery, and almost-certain death.",
