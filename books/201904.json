  "description": "When celebrities need a crime solving quickly and discreetly they call in the specialists, the Celebrity Crimes Investigation Agency, otherwise known as the CCIA…  One desperate phone call is all it takes to turn Amber’s day from boring to completely crazy.  The call? Her old university boyfriend Ennis, now a heartthrob actor, begs for Amber’s help. His brother Joel is dead and Ennis has to discover the truth about his death before the world’s media hear about it and batter his door down demanding answers.  The CCIA has already assigned its top agent, Charlie Huxton, to the case. Amber’s mission? Ennis doesn't trust a stranger to keep quiet so he pleads with Amber to shadow and help Charlie throughout the investigation. Ennis was her first love and she still has a soft spot for him – how can she refuse?  Scarily out of her depth Amber knows she needs to somehow get Charlie on side with her involvement in the case – and fast.  Plunged into the world of crime Amber’s battling something darker and far more dangerous than she’d imagined – and it has nothing to do with the equally scary chemistry fizzing between her and Charlie.  Will Charlie agree to work with her to find out how and why Joel died?  Can she help uncover the truth before word gets out and an already distraught Ennis is hounded by story-hungry journalists?  Just as importantly, can she keep her sanity and manage to still be alive when the mystery is finally solved?",
