  "title": "Mortal Foe",
  "description": "A picture is worth a thousand words…  But what if that image can only be seen through the lens of one camera? What if the snapshot can only be seen by a select few? What if the photo has its origins in the pit of Hell? What if that face belongs to an enemy bent on destruction?  This is Buddy Cullen's fate when he first dreams of his grandfather's death and then inherits his grandfather's antique camera and captures an image that haunts him and seeks his death. Can Buddy survive the curse that he sarcastically dubs \"Popcorn\"—a curse that no one wants to believe exists and stalks the city of Cleveland, beginning with its baseball team—a mortal foe?",
