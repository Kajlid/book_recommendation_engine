  "description": "From Pulitzer Prize winner and celebrated American master N. Scott Momaday, a beautiful and enchanting new poetry collection, at once a celebration of language, imagination, and the human spirit.He must be ranked among the greatest of our contemporary writers. -- American ScholarWe imagine and we dream, and we translate our dreams into language. This book is an enactment of that creative process. It is a celebration of words for their own sake. (from the preface)A singular voice in American letters, Momaday's love of language and storytelling are on full display in this brilliant collection comprising one hundred sketches or dream drawings--furnishings of the mind--as he calls them. Drawing on his Native American heritage and its oral storytelling traditions, here are poems about nature, animals, warriors, and hunters, as well as poems that explore themes of love, loss, and mortality. Each piece, full of wisdom and wonder, showcases Momaday's extraordinary lyrical talent and his own intimate connection to the natural world. The collection is also illustrated with a selection of black and white paintings by Momaday that capture the spirit of his prose.Poignant, imaginative, and inspired, these are poems that will nourish the soul.",
