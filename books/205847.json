  "description": "A woman of character and highly set moral standards, Catherine Daniels has led a quiet life and has always done what was expected of her. She has made the best of bad situations and even endured years of loneliness during two less-than-ideal marriages. With a simple click of the mouse and years of wondering “what if…” Catherine finds herself heading down a road where what is right and what her heart wants will be two different things—if she can survive. For Alex Stevens, Catherine was his escape from unhappiness into a fantasy world. She was the woman of his dreams on the screen. But what happens when she is also the woman of his dreams in real life—and not available?",
