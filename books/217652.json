  "description": "Two dominants. One willing and damaged submissive. Unmistakable attraction. Under Colin and Anthony's careful instruction, Sydney flourishes. The two dominants are showing her what the lifestyle is truly about, but Sydney's attachment to the best friends and her desire for them to top her is only growing stronger. Her visible wounds and hidden scars cause Sydney to worry and doubt herself as a worthy play partner or submissive for anyone, yet they don't stop her from fantasizing she belongs to Colin or Anthony...or both. While they unravel the nightmare life she has been living, the connection and chemistry between Anthony and Sydney deepens. Colin wants nothing more than for Sydney to be in a happy and healthy relationship, and he's confident his best friend can give her that, along with everything else under the sun. But Anthony's own dark past causes him to resist his feelings for Sydney. With the clock ticking closer to Sydney's first public scene, Colin must move quickly. With three hearts involved, can Colin convince Anthony that he is the right one for Sydney without his own feelings getting in the way and will their strong friendship and bond survive?",
