  "description": "Romantic. Funny. Sexy.  Professor Stephen Worthington’s life makes perfect sense. He teaches classes Tuesdays and Fridays. He has dinners with his parents on the weekend. He goes to the gym with his stepbrother twice a week. And every night he heads home at a reasonable hour, alone.  Only one thing is bothering Stephen’s perfectly organized life: Miss Julia Wilde. Never has Stephen dealt with a more unruly student. She’s rude, provocative, infuriating and the clothes she’s wearing are completely inappropriate.  But all this changes once Stephen finds himself out of the classroom and in Julia’s bedroom. Suddenly the roles are reversed and the stuffy professor receives a much-needed lesson between the sheets.  ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS is the first book about professor Stephen Worthington and his female student, Julia Wilde.",
