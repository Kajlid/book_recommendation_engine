  "description": "Modern girls seemed always in a hurry. Now the one who slammed into Jacob Hessman on the street near St. Paul's Union Depot has boarded his train. He knows her flapper-chic in her bobbed hair and stylish dress, so different from the sweet, country-bred kind of girl who once filled his heart.Gwendolyn Smith's window to escape Hugh Phelps is closing fast. Performing in speak-easies and underground clubs has left her mistrustful of most men, but the big fellow she plows into on her flight to the station seems safe enough to attach herself to for short term protection.Friendship unfolds, but Gwen hides behind lies, wishing she might deserve such a God-fearing man as Jacob, and Jacobâ€™s pursuit of a perfect wife conflicts with his mounting concern for Gwen. Meanwhile, Hugh is catching up. For Jacob and Gwen, trapped in their pasts and misconceptions, the time for truth and love is running out.",
