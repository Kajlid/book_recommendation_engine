  "description": "This book is out of print. Look for a new edition coming soon.Hungary, 1750 Janos Vesh is a man on the edge with a past he’s fought all of his adult life. These days he roams the highways seeking what little vengeance fate has to offer for wrongs done to himself and to his family. Stefan Novák knew from the beginning what he courted. Berserker, they’d called the bewitching young corporal, and his madness in battle was frightening to see. Still, nothing could turn Stefan from making Janos his—until now. A robbery gone bad, a descent into darkness, and Janos’s fragile hold on sanity begins to crumble. Stefan has one last hope. Will it succeed where all else failed?",
