  "description": "This novella may contain violence that is too graphic for younger readers. There’s an old lady who lives in the apartment above mine. She isn’t like most old ladies, with their dozen cats and pictures of their families decorating the walls. She keeps propane tanks in the bathroom, bottles of bleach and ammonia under the sink and in the pantry, and a bow and dozens of arrows in the living room closet. She also owns a storage unit full of sheet metal, matches, non-perishable foods, assorted combustible chemicals, nails, a hammer, and other bizarre things.Most days she sits in front of the window in her living room and watches the world pass her by, but I know better. She’s waiting.This is the true account of Dr. Z, one of the last survivors of the twenty year blight that killed billions of people across Earth. I have collected her memoirs through our interviews, through eye-witness accounts, and by visiting the towns she wrote about. I give these accounts to you, because should the Out-Break ever happen again, I want you to survive too. - KT",
