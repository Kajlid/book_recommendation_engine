  "description": "Megan has been offered the opportunity to prove she’s more than a pretty face. Drew Mackenzie is hell bent on ruining that opportunity, making him her number one enemy. He couldn’t be any further from her type, but something about him gets under her skin and stays there. Is it the annoying way he looks at her as if he might kiss her at any moment, or is it that arrogant chuckle that irritates her? One thing’s for certain…he’s the last guy she ever wanted or expected to fall in love with. Drew has spent a lifetime avoiding being anything like his womanizing father. Hell, that's why he moved away, to get out from under the man's control. But Megan stirs an all-consuming desire within him that’s difficult to ignore: the alpha male inside him wants to claim her, take her to his bed and unleash years of pent up sexual desire, but if he does… his father wins, in more ways than one.",
