  "description": "IT IS THE summer of 1938 when young Paul Moreaux discovers he can “fade.” First bewildered, then thrilled with the power of invisibility, Paul experiments. But his “gift” soon shows him shocking secrets and drives him toward a chilling act.“Imagine what might happen if Holden Caufield stepped into H. G. Wells’ The Invisible Man , and you’ll have an idea how good Fade is. . . . I was absolutely riveted.”—Stephen King",
