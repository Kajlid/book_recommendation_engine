  "description": "Josh Nicodemus is a rock star at the top of his career who is weary after a year-long road tour that has sucked his songwriting dry. Past his album deadline, he sneaks away to the remote island of Serenity after a chance encounter with Tony, a teenage boy at his concert who reminds Josh of his roots and the musician he longs to be.  Looking for a temporary home, Josh walks into The Down Dog Café, owned by former child star in hiding Jordan Drake. Known as J.D. on the island, she’s all grown up now and living a quiet life. But when talented, music-crazed Tony turns out to be Jordan’s nephew, sparks fly between the hero and heroine.  Jordan Drake is totally opposed to her nephew, Tony, following in his father’s musical footsteps because she’s afraid he’s too young to handle the success and he’ll make the same mistakes she made. The Miley Cyrus of her day, Jordan has worked hard over the past ten years to clean up her life and find her equilibrium. But when the frontman for the band Nicodemus arrives in Serenity, all her hard-won peace is knocked for a loop and everything she values is threatened. She’s in for the fight of her life when Josh agrees to mentor Tony during his stay on the island.",
