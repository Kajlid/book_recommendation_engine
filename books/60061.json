  "title": "Lost Apple",
  "description": "Laid off by their school districts, Frank, Paul, Arianna and Jan are enticed by billionaire Tim Schimmel's generous financial offer. The only catch: surviving his summer program (and each other) in the stifling, bug-ridden hills of the Arkansas Ozarks. But physical discomfort is a minor nuisance when confronted with the bizarre machinations of their wealthy host. Determined to foster an army of social activist educators, Schimmel subjects his guests to a series of trials and deceptions in hopes of breaking down their “docile teacher mentalities”. From a school in an abandoned amusement park, to a utopian community where children run free, to a prison camp for unruly teens, Lost Apple Education Park is a place where visitors ultimately confront themselves.",
