Promono-Dei the World-Queen has a jewel called the Oracular Topaz which will answer any question, except about the future. Her great antagonist is Kordo-Strî, leader of the great naval dominion of Nobalos. Kordo-Strî manipulates people’s thoughts, but falling short of full mind control.

Then she confronts a more dangerous coalition, including Âryoso-Rûn, King of Roude-Kî, Nobalos’ powerful but wavering ally. But even before Âryoso-Rûn’s army can arrive, her soldiers have already been driven back by Nobalos’ other forces. Meanwhile, Kordo-Strî’s husband has invented Malga’s first steam-powered warship for the Nobalan navy. Nobalos, with two other wars to fight, must win quickly. Promono-Dei must win quickly because one of her allies has betrayed her. Meanwhile, the revolutionary Nobalan steamship is launched. The fate of the Hegemony, Nobalos and all Malga hangs in the balance.",
