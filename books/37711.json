  "description": "One special night, something incredible happens! A little mouse who is being chased by a cat finds himself inside a home, gazing at a beautifully decorated Christmas tree. As the mouse pokes through the gifts, he comes upon a book and falls into it. To his surprise, he is in a stable, and Jesus has just been born. He watches as shepherds come to worship the baby and tell Mary and Joseph how the angels appeared to them, singing “Glory to God in the highest!” This beautifully illustrated story helps children experience the nativity in all its glory through the eyes of an endearing observer!",
