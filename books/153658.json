  "description": "Travis Mallory wasn't expecting to meet the young beauty the day he went to the local High School to put a stop to the dealing that was going on there. As the son of the head of the local cartel, not to mention heading his own crew, he had a reputation which did not involve raiding the kiddie pool. But one look at her tight body and those amazing eyes that seemed to suck him in, and he was a goner. Little did he know that the little innocent was going to be more trouble than any he'd ever faced before.",
