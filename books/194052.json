  "description": "Everyone has a past.Mine left me shattered.Inside me hides a terrified girl, afraid of people, love...living.No one has a clue.Hidden behind a façade, I’m the bitch they believe me to be.That's what an actress does.Puts on her face, steps on stage, and reads her lines.I've been doing it for years.The problem is, I'm not an actress anymore.All the sets I’ve carefully constructed have crumbled, leaving me exposed.What happens when they see who I really am?When he sees?Like a falling star, I'm beautiful to watch, but the glowing embers in my descent can burn.When the flames from my past collide, devastation may be left in their wake.And the last thing I want is for Adrian to be caught in the crossfire.",
