  "description": "Anne Boleyn is dead and the faction that surrounded her utterly destroyed. In the wake of her mistress's execution, former maid of honour Bridget Manning has left the dangerous world of the court, determined never to return. But Henry VIII has other plans for her. He issues a royal summons and Bridget is in no position to refuse him. Once more she finds herself drawn into the orbit of the Tudor court where she must navigate a new but equally tumultuous landscape: the Pilgrimage of Grace has recently threatened the stability of the throne; Jane Seymour has become queen but will not long enjoy the honour and the king finally has his yearned for son and heir. Once the prince is born though his father's paranoia is given full rein and there is nothing he won't do to protect his inheritance from the court of traitors that threatens to swallow them all...  \"Court of Traitors\" is the sequel to \"Ambition's Queen\". The third book in the series, \"Masque of Deception\", will now be published in February 2015 as I decided to make some changes ( SO sorry for the delay, I promise it is coming!)",
