  "title": "Beyond the Edge of the Universe: A Steady Path of Mindfulness and Letting Go",
  "description": "The book is an exploration of the intersection between the Buddha’s teachings, particularly mindfulness and meditative practices, and modern scientific theories about matter, consciousness, reality, and the universe. It is not a collection of philosophical notes, but rather a rigorously testable treatise on certain aspects of science, training of the mind, and the path of direct experience. Divided into three self-contained parts, it examines Buddhist terms like mindfulness, Jhana, Nibbana, and emptiness, drawing parallels to ideas in quantum mechanics and parallel universes.The author examines both scientific and philosophical approaches and reveals that they alone are insufficient to grasp reality’s true nature. By emphasizing practices from the Pali Suttas left by the historical Buddha, the text suggests that meditation offers deeper insights into reality, gradually leading to experience of Nibbana, the ultimate state of peace and freedom. The author combines personal meditative experiences with scientific and philosophical reflections to present a holistic view of consciousness.Drawing from his many years of meditation practice following the original Pali Sutta texts and combining Samatha and Vipassana methods-- tested through 'TWIM 6R' approach--he explains how one can remain completely free from the universe by letting go of all reactions while experiencing the progressive stages of voidness of all phenomena. He uses real-life examples to provide the best possible accounts of these experiences, bringing much-needed awareness and optimism. He emphasizes that the experience of Nibbana left by the historical Buddha, is real and attainable even today. It’s simply a matter of dedicating time and effort to experience it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\"A must-read for anyone seeking to explore the intersection of consciousness, science, and spirituality.\"- Delson Armstrong, author of A Mind without Craving\"As a scientist and researcher with a deep desire to understand the workings of the universe, he offers in this personal account his own \"theory of everything,\" derived from his own journey and extensive research. As science delves into the fabric of reality, Indu shows how TWIM provides a practical path to understanding how consciousness and the universe are profoundly interconnected.\"-David Johnson, the author of 'The Path to Nibbana'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Contents1.
