  "description": "The first in the award-winning Pickup Men series  It takes a pissed-off Brahma bull named Shockwave to show rodeo pickup man Marty Fairgrave the cold hard truth about champion bull rider Tripp Tripp will never leave the safety of his closet or acknowledge Marty in public. Sometimes loving someone just isn’t enough, and after a year of hiding what they are, Marty finally sees the light — and it’s no longer shining on Tripp.  Tripp Colby would do anything for Marty. Well . . . almost. He’s never loved anyone before, and isn’t quite sure how to handle it now. But he knows Marty is his everything, and in order to win him back, Tripp will have to overcome his darkest fears and step into the light.  But no matter Tripp’s intentions, the cost might be too high and the effort too late for these two cowboys to ride off into the sunset.  * * * * * * *  2015 EPIC Book Best Contemporary Romance  2014 Lambda Literary Award Gay Romance  Word 45,000; page 174",
