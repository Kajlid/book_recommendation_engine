  "description": "Sometimes love could use a little push - Mrs. Claus is ready with a little magic for the Holiday Season For the last ten years, Laura Chun put her heart and soul into becoming a physical therapist and sharing her love of dance with young students. When she receives an ornament and a mysterious message, she chalks it up to a Secret Santa – or in this case Mrs. Claus. It comes at the perfect time. A former student invites her to dance in the Nutcracker with her… & her father. Matthew Benson would do anything for his daughter, Juliet. After they lost her mother years ago to a sudden illness it’s been just the two of them. Now Juliet’s earned the role of her young lifetime in a local ballet company. The only obstacle is that each dancer’s parents are expected to appear on stage. Juliet asks her favorite dance teacher to step in, and soon Matthew understands why his daughter thinks Laura hung the moon. He’s losing his heart to her as well. Spending hours rehearsing together brings Laura and Matthew closer together and soon their onstage family may just become one offstage as well. Will they take the chance and have… A Dance for Christmas?",
