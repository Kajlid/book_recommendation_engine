  "description": "Chloe Ellis’ decision to celebrate the end of a turbulent relationship sends her off for a weekend of hiking and bonding with Mother Nature. When a rainstorm strikes during a spontaneous mountain climb, she has no choice but to seek shelter - and become hopelessly lost within a dank and dismal cave system. There’s one more problem: her golden-eyed, incredibly sexy rescuer isn’t the average hiker. He’s also a dragon.  This 25,000-word, humorous novella is the first part of a series of standalone stories featuring hot shifters. It contains strong sexual themes and is not intended for readers under adult age.",
