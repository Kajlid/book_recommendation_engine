  "title": "A Cloud of Witnesses",
  "description": "Isolated, clinging to the isolation, I huddled in the ugly rough shell of addiction, hatred, fear, resentment. How could I know others of my kind lay within easy reach? Yet when the shell cracked, just a bit, I found others just like me who understood. Not alone, I learned others, for centuries, shared the fears, overcame the resentments, set aside addiction, substituted love. I found friends in books, especially the Bible and the Big Book, Alcoholics Anonymous. Not alone, I stood with you, with many others, in a cloud of witnesses to recovery. In A CLOUD OF WITNESSES - TWO BIG BOOKS AND US Barbara Rollins responds to Hebrews as she did to Ecclesiastes in A TIME FOR VERSE - POETIC PONDERINGS ON ECCLESIASTES. Joined by OAStepper, author of SLENDER STEPS TO SANITY - TWELVE-STEP NOTES OF HOPE, the responses are written not only to the scripture but to companion quotations from the Big Book, ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS.",
