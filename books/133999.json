  "description": "Through Genevieve—a woman struggling with an idealistic vision of love—a door is opened into the lives of the characters through which Marie-Claire Blais came to the forefront of feminism in Canada. Night after night in a club called The Underground, Genevieve and her friends live out their loves and their tragedies apart from the day-to-day life of the city. Each glance, each embrace, and each ensuing encounter weaves a profound matrix of human isolation, with transcendence found in the healing power of love.",
