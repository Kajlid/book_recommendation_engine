  "description": "Love isn't always pretty - especially not when you fall for a Beast. \n   I ran like hell from the tragedy in my past. I didn’t slow down, and I didn’t look back. But I couldn’t outrun the memories...or escape the nightmares. I came to North Carolina to be alone. Hayden Graham attracts problems like a magnet. She's a complication I don't need. This time, the mess she's in has put her life in danger. What she needs is a hero to rescue her. But I'm no knight in shining armor. I'm a wounded animal – a Beast. She tastes like Heaven. She only adds to my Hell. She makes me want things that I can’t have, things I'll never deserve.  Love isn't always pretty. Sometimes it's hard. Sometimes it's rough. And sometimes... it's f****ng dirty.   Book 1 of 2 in the Beast & Beauty Devil's Blaze Duet",
