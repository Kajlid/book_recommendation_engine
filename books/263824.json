  "description": "1194 \"I should have had nothing to do with those accursed Angevins. I should have run like hell in the opposite direction.\"  Giles de Soutenay can scarcely be blamed for his disappointment. Promised an heiress by Queen Eleanor, he is dismayed to discover that, although young and attractive, his bride has all the warmth of a stone effigy.  For the newly widowed Isabella, the reality of a new husband is no cause for celebration. She will do her duty but no more. She will give de Soutenay no reason to complain but he will not have her heart, for any belief in love and tenderness died during those brief years of her first marriage. However, she has reckoned without Giles' perseverance.  After the snows of winter, spring brings hope, until the arrival of a stranger threatens Giles and Isabellaâ€™s blossoming happiness. A stranger who might tear them apart before they have truly found each other. Only if Giles can learn patience and Isabella can learn trust can they hope to find lasting love.  This is book 3 in the Out of Time series but is a standalone novel.",
