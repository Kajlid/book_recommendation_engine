  "description": "Rebecca has never been very good at maths. But now, if she doesn't improve, she'll go into the B form and be separated from Tish, Sue and the rest of her friends. So why does Max, the handsome new maths teacher, ignore her and devote his attention instead to Roberta Jones? And who stole the money raised for charity from the sponsored surfing competition?",
