  "description": "Sapphire “Saffi” March used to be known as an eccentric genius, the girl who had made a laughingstock of her illustrious family. But she’s reinvented herself since then. Now a post-graduate honor student, Saffi is determined to be a dutiful daughter, with no one in her world ever supposed to know she’s also the most diehard fangirl of Sweden’s #1 Sex God.It’s her greatest secret, and the times she watches the sex god sing and dance are the only times she could just breathe…and be herself.Handsome like a classical statue but earthy and sexy like a pagan god, Staffan Aehrenthal is the most wildly successful rockstar that ever came on stage. He should be celebrating being on top of his world, but a woman’s betrayal had Staffan forging a path to self-destruction instead.Life no longer meant anything – until serendipity introduced him to a beautiful and funny girl with an adorably unique fascination with fishes.When their worlds collide on one fateful weekend, Saffi is disguised as a gum-chewing hardcore groupie while Staffan pretends he hasn’t been trailing after her all over the Internet. It’s a recipe for the most hilarious and heartbreaking of disasters because when fangirls lie, the craziest things can happen – like a rockstar falling in love.",
