  "description": "In the great city of Buda, Hungary, I have sought to establish myself as a member of the new vampire court, and create a family with my love, Ignatius, and my fledgling vampire daughter, Laura. Yet, I am constantly menaced by unknown forces, and the threat of my blood union to Vlad Dracula looms over me. Though I am no longer his prisoner, Vlad Draculaâ€™s voice echoes in the recesses of my mind. His blood binds us together in a twisted matrimony in spite of the deep hatred for him that burns within my soul. I yearn to be free from this darkest of magic for I fear that he will return one night, and I will not be able to resist the call of his blood.",
