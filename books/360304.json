  "description": "Gathered here is a beguiling selection of folktales from Zimbabwe and Botswana. This treasury contains most of the stories previously collected in Children of Wax and seven new tales from the Setswana-speaking people of Botswana.A girl discovers that her young husband might actually be a lion in disguise, but not before they have two sons who might actually be cubs... When a child made of wax follows his curiosity outside into the heat of daylight and melts, his siblings shape him into a bird with feathers made of leaves that enable him to fly into the light.... Talking hyenas, milk-giving birds, clever cannibals who nonetheless get their comeuppance, and mysterious forces that reside in the landscape -- these wonderful fables bring us the wealth, the variety, and the particular magic of traditional African lore.Letter from Mma Ramotswe --Guinea fowl child --Bad way to treat friends --Girl who lived in a cave --Hare fools the baboons --Pumpkin --Sister of bones --Milk bird --Beware of friends you cannot trust --Children of wax --Brave hunter --Stone Hare --Tree to sing to --Blind man catches a bird --Hare fools Lion, again --Strange animal --Bad uncles --Why Elephant and Hyena live far from people --Wife who could not work --Bad blood --Sad story of Tortoise and Snail --Old man who saved some ungrateful people --Lazy baboons --Great snake --Girl who married a lion --Two bad friends --How a strange creature took the place of a girl, and then fell into a hole --Greater than Lion --Head tree --Grandmother who was kind to a smelly girl --Baboons who went this way and that --Two friends who met for dinner --Thathana moratho tree --Tremendously clever tricks are played, but to limited effect",
