But all that will soon change.In the beginning there was Ezekiel \"Easy\" Rawlins and Raymond \"Mouse\" Alexander, two young men setting out in life, hitting the road in a \"borrowed\" '36 Ford headed for Pariah, Texas. The volatile Mouse wants to retrieve money from his stepfather so he can marry his Etta Mae.But on their steamy bayou excursion, Mouse will choose murder as a way out, while Easy's past liaison with Etta Mae floats precariously in his memory. Easy and Mouse are coming of age and everything they ever knew about friendship and about themselves is coming apart at the seams.As Mosley takes Easy and Mouse on this journey to manhood, he weaves together a remarkable cast of friends and foes, who are introduced here for the first time and will later appear in Easy Rawlins mysteries. This is the chance to unravel the mystery behind the souls of every character.",
