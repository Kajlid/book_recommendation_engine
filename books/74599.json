  "description": "Two American veterans of the First World War Battle of Chateau Thierry reunite in Paris in 1928. Kurt, now a Berlin correspondent, is writing the great American novel about the grinding end to the war, the desolation of the peace in Germany, and a doomed romance with a German nurse. Bill is a Paris-based literary agent who wants to place the novel in bookstores at the same time as Ernest Hemingway's new war novel. Kate, a Left Bank writer, publishes Kurt's book while keeping its raw drive alive. She, too, has a story reaching back to the war and Chateau Thierry.Cameos by Djuna Barnes, Bricktop, and Janet Flanner, Solita Solano, Mina Loy, and John Maynard Keynes.",
