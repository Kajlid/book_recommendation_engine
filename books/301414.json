  "description": "Elliot suffers from depression and OCD, is successful at writing but unsuccessful at everything else. Elliot makes his way in the city by routine and ritual, never stepping far outside a few familiar spaces.Breakfast (never in the morning) at his favorite diner, a record store that hasn't dusted its ceiling fan since the 1970's, a hole-in-the-wall cafe to drink black tea and judge the terrible tongue-tied poets on the shoddy ill-lit stage, a park with swings that are always annoyingly wet, and his immaculate apartment in the city. He struggles with childhood memories he can never completely forget.Then enter Aiden Faust, the too-loud and too-passionate guitar player that takes the stage one night and just won't stop staring at Elliot. Aiden is full of hope and promise and everything Elliot needs, but Elliot can't have what's good for him. Right?",
