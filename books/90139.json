  "title": "Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Awakening",
  "description": "The mind contains the seeds of its own awakeningâ€”seeds that we can cultivate to bring forth the fruits of a life lived consciously. With Mindfulness , Joseph Goldstein shares the wisdom of his four decades of teaching and practice in a book that will serve as a lifelong companion for anyone committed to mindful living and the realization of inner freedom. Goldstein's source teaching is the Satipatthana Sutta , the Buddha's legendary discourse on the four foundations of mindfulness that became the basis for the many types of Vipassana (or insight meditation) found today. Exquisite in detail yet wholly accessible and relevant for the modern student, Mindfulness takes us through a profound study \"There is a wealth of meaning and nuance in the experience of mindfulness that can enrich our lives in unimagined ways,\" writes Goldstein. In Mindfulness you have the tools to mine these riches for yourself.",
