  "title": "The Care and Feeding of Sex Demons",
  "description": "Keeping a sex demon happy and well fucked is always the safest option, even if you have your own relationship issues. When saving the world on a regular basis, a happy home is very important.  Cy’s job as an apocalypse stopper isn’t an easy one at the best of times, but with the help of his weird family, he survives. Sure, he sneaks out every once and a while to watch August his sex demon feed, but he loves and is committed to Patrick, his fae prince lover, even if it means giving up the anal penetrative sex he loves and Patrick has issues with.  All adult relationships are based on compromise. It's just that most don’t require fucking a sex demon to keep him alive and non-murder-y at the same time as you're trying to quit your job to save the world on your own time.",
