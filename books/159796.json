  "title": "Forever Dark",
  "description": "One tragic night. One backseat promise shattered forever. Madison Thomas is shouldering guilt she may never forgive herself for. Her darkness has consumed her for three years and slowly seeped into every part of her life. She’s relying on substance. She’s trying to be brave when all she’ll ever be is bent. Cash Bryant, a college quarterback with a promising career, wants to show Madison there’s still hope. He’s her one sliver of light that never fades. He wants to let go. He needs to let go… before she destroys him completely. There’s something about the girl wearing hoodies to hide her dark eyes that reminds him of the girl he fell forever in love with. In the shadows of their blue-lit mornings, she makes him weak, steals the beat in his chest, and he’s reminded of the girl he used to know. Author's Note: This book was previously available as Forever Love with Megan Smith. We have separated the books into two standalones, Forever Dark and Forever Light. You will see that both stories follow the exact same time frame and include the same group of friends but while you read something in Forever Dark you will see some extra interaction in Forever Light, Landon and Macy's story.",
