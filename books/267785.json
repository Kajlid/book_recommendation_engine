  "description": "Camden, a formerly deceased soldier for the Incroptia, awakes to find himself as the newest activated Unit in Underearth. Unfortunately, Underearth is neither a name for Heaven nor Hell. In fact, Underearth is an underground complex where humanity has continued its’ existence after the surface of the earth was rendered uninhabitable due to excessive atmospheric interference. Through the unintended consequences of well-intentioned motives, Camden has joined Underearth equipped with the tools to destroy it. Despite his most earnest attempts to acclimate to life in Underearth, the small but driven forces of resistance in this underground world have other plans. Unwittingly and, at times, unwillingly, Camden finds himself standing toe-to-toe with the governing powers of Underearth. This is the first book of a three book series. If you like David Estes’ The Moon Dwellers, Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games, and Hugh Howey’s Silo Series, you won’t be able to resist the gripping Zach McClellan series.",
