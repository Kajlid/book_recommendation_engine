  "description": "I'm the President of the Tormented Souls and if there is one thing I hate, it's women. They are needy and only good for one thing. Spreading their legs. Not even the sweet little thing my sister brings around can change my opinion.When I agreed to be a surrogate, I didn't realize all that would come with it. I wasn't raised around big, tatted up men who treat women like they are nothing and I refuse to stand to be treated that way. Wrench and I don't get along, but we are stuck together. Something must give. **WARNING: CONTAINS ADULT CONTENT. If vulgar language or explicit, naughty sex bothers you, please pass. Also expect a hard headed man and a stubborn woman. There is blood and violence as well.**Alternative Cover Edition for ASIN: B00MQCAZHI",
