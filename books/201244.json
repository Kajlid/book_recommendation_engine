  "description": "An ancient secret is no match for amateur sleuth and professional trouble magnet Lexi Carmichael!  My work as a computer geek has me traveling around the world, solving mysteries and fighting bad guys. Sometimes with my friends, but always with trouble by my side. So you'd think I would've expected to be plagued by danger when I headed to Egypt with my best friend, Elvis Zimmerman, and boyfriend, Slash, to help track down Elvis's missing and estranged father. Nope.  Genius runs in the family, and we quickly discovered Elvis's father is hot on the trail of an ancient and elusive artifact…one that people are willing to kill to find. Tombs, tablets and code come together as we follow a set of clues that has been waiting millennia to be discovered.  Cracking code is my specialty, but I never expected to tackle one from fifteen hundred years before the advent of written language. The sands of time are running out. If the artifact falls into the wrong hands, we won't be able to rewrite history. So it's up to us to find and safeguard the secret to ensure no living soul ever encounters it…again.  Don't miss the adventure that started it all: No One Lives Twice is available now!  This book is approximately 75,000 words  Carina Press acknowledges the editorial services of Alissa Davis",
