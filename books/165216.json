  "description": "Her father was known as the Ice King and he hated her with a cold fury that well deserved the name. Hated her enough to force her to wed his most despised enemy, the debauched, debt-ridden Earl of Whitby. Still, Lady Noelle Rivers had her pride, and she wore it like armor about her slender shoulders. No man could take that from her â€” certainly not this haunted, mocking stranger she must now call husband. But with masterful caresses and fierce, demanding kisses, the Earl soon showed his reluctant bride the dizzying pleasures that come to those who surrender to love... and seek only passion!",
