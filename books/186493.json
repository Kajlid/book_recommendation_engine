  "description": "From sacrifice . . . glory.Starless skies will swim with smokeBorn of the fire of a fallen earthWyrms will writhe over the welkinThe spirits of darkness will swallow wholeEvery creature, every spirit, every god.Yet every end brings new beginningsNew gods arise, and some old are forgiven.This world will die. But Naglfar will carry us home.Ragnarok is at hand. The gods fight one another, and while humans are caught in the crossfire, their hands are hardly clean, as nation fights nation for resources and survival. Sigrun, Trennus, Minori, Adam, Lassair, Saraid, Ni√∞hoggr, and their allies must rely on the words of the Firebringer to try to break the back of prophecy, and avert the end of the world. But questions remain. Will Adam allow prophecy to consume him, and break all bonds of friendship and kin? Will Sigrun walk her dark road alone, at the end of time? Or can destiny be shattered?",
