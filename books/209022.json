Desperation is a story about Colt Fargo, the owner of Club Wicked Cove, and Ceejay Powell, a woman driven by her past to join the lifestyle in an effort to find absolution for her guilt.  Colt happens upon Lady Silver involved in a scene that contravenes the ethics of his club and sets out to find what motivates her to demand such a scene each every time, subsequently giving her an ultimatum that she must accept if she wants to remain a member of the club.

In his quest, she finds the key to his guarded past and soon they are both fighting off the siege of emotions that threatens to overwhelm them.
