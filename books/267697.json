  "description": "Welcome to Hawthorne Asylum. Welcome to hell. This place isn’t run by the doctors who make you talk or the orderlies who force you to swallow your pills. It belongs to them, to the Infamous Four. Tabloids, talk shows, documentaries—their faces have been plastered everywhere. Not because of their impressive rap sheets, but because of how they look. And when I arrive, they take notice. Especially their king: Lincoln “Laces” Caster. He’s dark and disturbed. He’s controlling and possessive.The exact kind of boy I should stay away from if I want to clear my name and get out of here. * This is an upper-YA bully romance not intended for readers under seventeen. This book may contain triggers for some readers.",
