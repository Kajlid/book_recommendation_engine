  "title": "Encyclopedia of Muhammad's Women Companions and the Traditions They Related",
  "description": "This work is divided into two books: Book I contains all of the Traditions (ahadith) related by 150 women Companions of Prophet Muhammad (/) according to the six canonical books of Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu Dawud, Sunan Ibn Majah, Sunan al-Nisai and Sunan al-Tirmidhi. The Traditions are organized according to the Divine Law (shariah), but this work begins with moral character development. A brief glance shows that women Companions related Traditions in many areas and not just in areas relating specifically to women. Where there is more than one Tradition on the same topic, one is presented and references to the other versions are indicated below that specific Tradition. Book II contains the biographies of over 600 women Companions of the Prophet including her name, her mother's name, the name of her children, the name of her husband (s) and where information is available from the earliest sources of Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Sad, her biography.",
