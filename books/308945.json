  "description": "The story is about a future technology called “prisms.” “In colloquial terms, the prism created two newly divergent timelines … and it allowed communication between the two.” The ability to talk to one’s doppelgänger in an alternate timeline has a massive and complex impact on society and individuals, including an epidemic of existential crises: “Many worried that their choices were rendered meaningless because every action they took was counterbalanced by a branch in which they had made the opposite choice.”",
