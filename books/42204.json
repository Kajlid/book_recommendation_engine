  "description": "Volume 1 of The Hungering SagaA man is not great because he is a good man. A great man can be good, evil, or any shade of gray in between. A great man is a man who sees the world around him, and changes it to suit him, instead of letting it change him to suit itself. Lowin Fenly didn't want to be a hero, and he never thought of being a villain, but sometimes the path that must be walked by great men leads to dark places. Body twisted by dark magic, the scribe-turned-Knight must learn to control the beast he is becoming, or risk losing the few remnants of humanity he clings to. For more books by Heath Pfaff, have a look at the of Steel (Chaos Awakens 1) amazon.com/Servant-Steel-Chaos-Awaken... of Steel (Chaos Awakens 2) amazon.com/Crown-Steel-Chaos-Awakens-... of Steel (Chaos Awakens 3) amazon.com/City-Steel-Chaos-Awakens-B...
