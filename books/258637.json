  "description": "Power Thoughts for Teens and Young Adults is 365 days of daily inspirational thoughts to increase joy, inner peace and self-esteem. Too often we have a tendency to believe our stressful thoughts as if we have no choice but to believe everything we think. And the way we start our day has tremendous power and influence on how the day goes. This book helps teens to choose thoughts first thing in the morning which will empower them and help them to take a positive approach based on their own inner-dialogue instead of listening to the negative voices of the culture. As we change our thinking, we change our own individual world. We were meant to live out our dreams and to be, do and have the life we choose for ourselves. This book is a major step in that direction.",
