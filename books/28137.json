  "description": "In racing, you're in or you're out. Sometimes both at the same time... Go ahead, call Callie Monroe the queen of fools. She already does. After NASCAR slammed its doors in her face, she came up with the idea for the X-TREME Racing League. Now she's all but relegated to pit row while her business partner-aka XRL's bankroll-takes the credit. One look at NASCAR champion Derrick Derringer red-lines Callie's fantasy gauge. And when he actually \"notices\" her next to her Playboy-hot boss, he makes her sweat. Derrick has always been attracted to the studious type, but Callie's got the cherry on top of her beauty and brains: she's a gear head. She's also scared to death of him. He's never had to work hard to get a woman in his bed, but with Callie, he finds himself changing tactics for a prize he never expected. Her heart. Callie has no intention of being Derrick's next \"checkered flag,\" but if she's to lure him over to XRL, she'll play the game. A dangerous one. Not only because his kiss sends her focus sliding out of control. There's a saboteur who seems intent on putting XRL into the wall-no matter how many people have to die. Warning: The author doesn't guarantee this book will help you \"get lucky,\" but does have documented proof that the love, laughter, naughtiness and hot, hot, hot sex in this book will leave you gasping for air. Dangerous curves ahead!",
