  "description": "Jillian, Carol and Meg won't consider themselves victims - they're survivors. Survivors of a terrible crime that hit the headlines and changed their lives for ever. And now that Eddie Como, the College Hill Rapist, has been murdered, shot down outside a packed courthouse moments before his trial, all three women are openly ecstatic that he's dead. They are also the prime suspects in his murder. Detective Roan Griffin has no doubt that the murder of Como was a professional job, especially when the gunman is killed only blocks away from the shooting. But who ordered the deaths of Como and his killer? Could three ordinary women have been driven to do the unthinkable? Has someone in the Survivors Club become a killer? Then another woman is brutally attacked and the hunt is on for a ruthless killer. Someone wants to finish what was started. Someone wants to make sure that no one survives the Survivors Club...",
