  "title": "Melville Goodwin, USA",
  "description": "This is a novel about a major general - a specialist in combat who became a general through the ambition of his wife Muriel. General Goodwin had led tanks through the turmoil of war with only the usual press attention. But when he pushed aside the tommy-gun of a Russian sentry in Berlin he became the focal point of publicity and of the attentions of Dottie Peale. Muriel did not know Dottie and the General soon found himself in fields of action for which he had not been trained.John Marquand has brought a great sympathetic understanding to this highly trained leader in war who had become isolated from the sophisticated world outside the army. Dottie was noticeably attractive in any society and in the freedom of wartime Paris she represented for Mel Goodwin a break in the monotony of high echelon routine. That taste of excitement was not forgotten amidst his much publicized return to New York and Muriel's ambitious planning. Dottie understood Mel's need and was heedlessly eager to satisfy it. And Muriel knew that her husband was a general who could only belong to her by remaining a general.The conflict between these two women and the General's struggle with himself as he searches for a normal life despite his lifetime special training makes the most dramatic novel Mr. Marquand has written. The activities of the Pentagon, the excitement of New York, the liberties of Paris, the crisis of battle, the life in foreign stations and the quiet of small-town New England are all part of the General's career and responsibility.",
