  "description": "Being a teenager is confusing enough for anyone, but Jack “Riot” Willard is sixteen going on geriatric. As a temporally displaced soldier, Jack has to deal with a world that has had more than a few makeovers since he was forced out of the timestream. His powers amplify his emotions to a dangerous degree, so if Rosario and her family can’t help Jack learn to control himself, steps will be taken. He’s got one shot at moving past his war, and she’s it.",
