  "title": "Behind the Hood",
  "description": "PLEASE NOTE: This is not a romance book, if you want romance start from book 2. See additional notes at the bottom of the blurb.Life on the rough side of New Zealand.In this South Auckland neighbourhood where gang culture, drink, drugs, sex and violence is already a way of life, a vicious attack on a teenage girl sparks a ripple effect of revenge and fury. Live the carnage through multiple viewpoints as the tale unfolds to a bloody climax. NOT for the fainthearted. WARNING: Language and sexual references are graphic. 18+Additional notes: This book has no M/M. It has different main characters from book 2 and 3. The Rata brothers are minor characters in book 1 and major characters from book 2 onward. My suggestion is to start from book 2, then read book 3, and if you like those two then you could try book 1. Graffiti Heaven is a prequel series based around Ash Rata when he was younger.",
