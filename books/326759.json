  "description": "Meet Bobbie Faye Sumrall. This “titanium magnolia” (Bookreporter.com) from Louisiana won’t take sass from no one! And she is determined to have herself a good day—even if she has to kill someone to get it…\n“Bobbie Faye is a hurricane-force heroine who makes this novel the perfect adventure yarn.”—The Tampa Tribune\nWhen Bobbie Faye wakes up on the morning of the Lake Charles Contraband Days Festival, she’s looking forward to balloons, booze, and babies in pirate costumes. Instead, she discovers that her trailer’s flooded, her no-good brother’s been kidnapped, and the criminals are demanding her mom’s tiara as ransom.\n“An outrageous hoot.”\n—The New Orleans Times-Picayune\nSoon Bobbie Faye is committing (unintentional) bank robbery and (fully intentional) car jacking to retrieve her family heirloom. The one bright spot comes in the hard-muscled, impossibly sexy form of Trevor, the guy whose truck she just took hostage. Luckily, Bobbie Faye knows how to outsmart angry bears, drive a speedboat, and handle a gun. As for handling Trevor? No gun-shyness there. Now, if only that pesky state police detective, who also happens to be a pissed-off ex-boyfriend, would stay out of her way . . . \n“Hilarious, pitch perfect.”\n—Publishers Weekly (starred review)\nFirst published as \"Bobbie Faye's Very (very, very, very) Bad Day.\"",
