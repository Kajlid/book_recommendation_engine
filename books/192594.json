  "title": "The Jutland Scandal: The Truth about the First World War's Greatest Sea Battle",
  "description": "This volume presents the whistleblowing accounts of two Royal Navy officers who defied the British Admiralty and told the truth about the WWI battle.Though the Royal Navy had been the undisputed ruler of the sea for a century, it faced a surprise challenge in the First World War from the German High Seas Fleet. When the two forces met across the North Sea near Jutland, the British battleships and cruisers were battered into a draw, losing far more men and ships than the enemy.The public waited for the official histories of the battle to be released, but no official report was produced, due to objections from Admiral Beatty. This led to Admiral Bacon producing his own account of the battle, called The Jutland Scandal, in 1925. Two years later the man instructed to write the official report, Rear-Admiral Harper, decided to publish his account independently, under the title The Truth about Jutland.Together, these two books lay bare the facts about Jutland and reveal the failings of senior officers and the distortions of the early historians. Presented in one volume for the first time, this book tells the truth about the scandal that developed following the largest battle ever fought at sea.",
