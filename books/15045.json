  "description": "Like all English villages, the quiet and charming Thorpe Amberley in the heart of the Suffolk countryside has it secrets, it mysteries and its legends. It also has it traditions such as the Tamberley Morris Men, a dysfunctional band of 'blow-ins', mainly professionals, who rehearse every Thursday and drink at the local pub. Nothing much has disturbed the tranquility of Thorpe Amberley for centuries.Until now. A stunningly beautiful American woman comes to the village to teach at a nearby school, and her arrival coincides with with the resurrection of deadly seeds of jealousy, evil and murder.When the village is rocked by a series of gruesome and apparently ritualistic killings, it soon becomes clear that the local police are up against dark forces that they are wholly unequipped to deal with. Unlikely help comes from a Patagonian 'Machi' through the Morris Men's 'Squire' and the unexpected assistance of an ex-NYPD policeman.A hunt for not one, but two serial killers, is on, and Thorpe Amberley will never be the same again.",
