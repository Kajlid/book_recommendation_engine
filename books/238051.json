But the chivalrous Aubrey Russell doesn't care.  Accidentally thrust into the headstrong young lady's path, he decides she needs a protector. Determined that the girl should not ruin herself in pursuit of the truth, Aubrey dogs her every step ... and finds himself in a spot of bother.

The only question is, will he be able to save himself?",
