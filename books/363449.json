  "title": "Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God",
  "description": "We human beings are burdened by our tendencies to harshly judge others and ourselves. Unfortunately for believers, this bent is as prevalent in the church as in the world.Pastor and author Gregory A. Boyd calls readers to a higher standard through understanding the true manner in which God views as infinitely worthwhile and lovable. Only an attitude shift in how we perceive ourselves in light of God's love can impact how we relate to people and transform our judgmental nature.Believers wrestling with the reality of God's love and Christians struggling with judging in the local church will appreciate this examination of how we move from a self-centered to a Christ-centered life.",
