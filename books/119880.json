  "description": "What does a typical twenty-year old do when wooed by an older university teacher? Surrender or flee?Gina vomits out of stress, writes crude poetry, and stops talking to Daniel because of deeply-rooted inhibitions. But she also submits indecent essays which expose her talent and weaknesses to him; she is the perfect targetâ€”lonely, ambitious, and chronically shy.Gina sits in the last row, observing how Daniel subjects himself to her peers' ridicule as he tries to win her affections. She bites her nails, writes this diary, and hides a multitude of secrets, including a lifelong family conflict following a tragedy that blighted her childhood.She is unlovable, having suffered rejection before, but she tries to keep herself amused. On the bad days, however, self-sabotage is what she does best. Daniel is a welcome distraction, but is he what she really needs?How easy is it to fight guilt, low self-esteem, and an overwhelming need for attention? What to do with a long-kept secret when it is finally revealed? Is it easier to abandon or be abandoned? Does either have to happen?Perhaps more kitschy than artistic, this often cringeworthy story is an unexpected combination of the two. Warning: this might be the silliest and most primitive novel you have ever read.",
