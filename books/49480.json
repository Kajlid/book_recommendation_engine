  "description": "Set in modern day South Carolina, a determined vampire hunter finds a young female, half breed vampire wanting protection in exchange for information on humans in the middle of the vampire transformation process, which starts a deadly game of cat and mouse. Gavin has nothing left to lose. He becomes a hunter of humans that are about to turn into vampires who coincidentally also carry a sexually transmitted disease between the victims. During one of his “outings”, Gavin discovers a child named Solstice that is in hiding from other vampires that want her because she is a “day walker”. Gavin agrees to help protect her in exchange for information on the vampires he is looking for.  Between obsession and carelessness, they find what Gavin was looking for but after a botched attempt, they are now the prey in the situation. Confused between his hate for vampires and the love he is developing for a child that he doesn’t know much about, Gavin struggled with his past demons and his faith in the world and humanity.  What Gavin doesn’t realize is that Solstice has her own agenda and secrets that are tied to their consistent pursuers. Solstice’s “abilities” are rare and a clan of vampires, mostly consisting of women that were prostitutes, pursues Solstice and the abilities her body contains.",
