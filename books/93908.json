  "title": "Miss You Like Crazy Tpb",
  "description": "A re-issue of the exhilarating, highly acclaimed first novel from the author of Bite the Stars. “Maylou wanted to feel buoyant and gung ho. She wanted to feel like a grand prize winner in life's sweepstakes, but with her mama newly dead, buried under ground like a bulb that could come to pretty flower only in her mind, she thought herself destined to remain swampy and downtrodden.” Miss You Like Crazy is a road novel belonging to Maylou Puce Turner, a young woman whose beloved mama dies'somewhat triumphantly'after winning a game of gin rummy in a steamy Florida trailer park. Suddenly alone with her distraught old daddy, Maylou embarks on a weird and wonderful odyssey to put her mama to rest and somehow get everyone back to Kansas. Originally published in 1994, Miss You Like Crazy will be re-issued to coincide with the author's latest book, Bite the Stars . This is an exuberant and moving debut novel about the steely bond between mother and daughter, and proves without doubt that the best humor is rooted in tragedy.",
