  "description": "In this humorous and witty guidebook for the unhitched, Jared Milrad and Nathan Johnson share practical tips on how to tie the same-sex knot, while barely remaining sane and relationship savvy along the way. Featured in Hillary Clinton's historic presidential campaign announcement in 2015, Jared and Nathan wrote, \"So, You Want To Get (Gay) Married\" as an honest exploration of life as a Millennial couple in the United States, even when one happens to get thrust into an international spotlight just weeks before their wedding. The couple's priceless wisdom includes, \"Just Settle Netflix And Chill Your Way Into Marriage,\" \"Convince Your In-Laws That Pets Are Better Than Grandkids (And Cuter),\" and \"Apologize Without Really Meaning It.\" For the young and not so young, Jared and Nathan share the many triumphs, joys, and challenges that they've encountered along the way to lifelong bliss (whatever that is). It's a journey you won't want to miss - that is, if you really want to get (gay) married.",
