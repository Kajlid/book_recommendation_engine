  "description": "Unique, moving, and true - this radiant love story is set against the horrific backdrop of World War II Nazi Germany. When Lilly \"Aimee\" Wust, a gentile mother of four and wife of a Nazi officer, met Felice \"Jaguar\" Schragenheim, a Jew living underground in Berlin, neither could have guessed that their brief initial encounter would develop into a blazing, devoted love. As the Nazi stranglehold closed in on them, Lilly and Felice found themselves fighting insurmountable odds to stay together. Extraordinarily passionate and heartrending, this is a rare and personal look at the love and strength of two women whose commitment to each other defied the brutality of their time.",
