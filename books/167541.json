  "description": "Amoroso: Alfonzo XVI   \"There is only one codicil to my living; that I die having honored my familia.\"  -Alfonzo    The 27th is a date dreaded by a Mafia Kingpin. Alfonzo has a date with a board of ruthless criminals to determine his fate for unknowingly breaking a blood contract. Not being born isn't grounds for nullification. Being detained by a psychopath clamoring for revenge isn't a reasonable defense. An appearance is mandatory, nonappearance serves as grounds for a death sentence. Can a son of a Don sway the verdict or a Mafia Queen renegotiate the terms of an ancient agreement or will standing in for a Kingpin be considered deadly contempt?  Read the gripping Alfonzo saga, considered a 'gem', an 'underground hit' and a original story with a 'pulse' on 'world events'.",
