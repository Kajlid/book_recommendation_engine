  "title": "The Unsung Love Story",
  "description": "This classic love story begins in the Spring of 1892 in a small southern town only a few folks have heard of: Green Springs. It was love at first sight on that early Easter morn when Cristy Anne Hayse and Lisette Haley locked eyes for the first time. From that moment on they knew their destinies would forever be intertwined in the tangled web known as life. \"Not one word had been spoken, and yet, the connection achieved by that one magic moment in which our eyes locked spoke volumes more than any words could ever describe.\" - Cristy Anne, The River: The Unsung Love Story. What started as a simple glance, would turn into a life long romantic struggle between the love they bore for one another and societies expectations of who the two were supposed to be. It was a love that would transcend all time, trials, gender, and location. A love truly for the ages. A romance that flowed as true as a river's tide. This tale is of the unsung love story known by most folks as, The River.",
