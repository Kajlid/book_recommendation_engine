But while she is prey to the Queen’s jealous suspicions, Queen Mary is fading; while Elizabeth is twenty and healthy. The country looks to the young princess for its future. Imperious, high spirited, fighting for her life, Elizabeth already shows the diplomacy, the baffling changes of mood, and the power to win men’s devotion for which she would be famous as Queen. This is the second book in the series started in Queen Bess.",
