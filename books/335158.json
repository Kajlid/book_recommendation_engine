  "description": "Wrong bed.right man? Between her waitressing job, volunteer work, and college classes, there are never enough hours in the day for Maggie Reilly. Especially not for a relationship. She's got the perfect arrangment, though-a lover she meets three or four times a year. This weekend is one of those rare times, and she's more than ready for a few nights of stress-busting sex. But when she shows up at the hotel expecting to hop into bed with one man, she accidentally ends up with quite another: Ben Barrett, Hollywood's most notorious bad boy. Ben, determined to lay low after another scandal, has checked into the hotel for some much-needed sleep. What he gets is a scorching-hot makeout session with a gorgeous, naked redhead. He won't accept her apology, but what he will accept is a place to hide out-in her arms. In exchange, he'll give her what she wants. A full week of no-strings sex. Ben soon finds out that one week with the fiery redhead is definitely not enough. He finds himself wanting more. A lot more. Now if only he can convince Maggie that a bad boy might just be good for her-and the best thing that's ever happened to both of them. Warning: This title contains a sexy movie star and a sassy redhead who know exactly how to heat up the sheets. The wild sex might require the use of an air-conditioner. Graphic language and explicit sex.",
