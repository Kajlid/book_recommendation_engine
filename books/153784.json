  "description": "The only thing inevitable in love is despair. I knew from the start that he would wreck me. Nothing could have prepared me for the day he walked into my life ... or the day he walked out of it. I self-destructed. All that remained was a shell of the girl I once was. SHATTERED. And I don't know if I'll ever recover.",
