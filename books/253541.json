  "description": "“Any other man would jump in happiness at the idea of a woman dancing half naked on him,” I told him, making him raise his head to look at me. No. He wasn't looking at me. He was glaring at me. Athena was a stripper, but not because of vested self-interest—she needed to support her half-brother’s medical bills. Hiding behind her mask, the Mysterious Vixen fulfilled every man’s fantasies as she gyrated sensually half naked on stage. She was in there for money, just money. But in comes the most delicious looking man she had ever laid eyes on, Damian, and she was supposed to give him something she never a lap dance! Damian, the scalding hot yet ironically ice-cold CEO, dared shun her performance, remaining aloof until she kissed him. He loved it way too much that he just had to have her. Athena gets tangled in a web of pure sinful sex, lust, and attraction, without the commitment—the perfect setup. But nothing stays perfect for long. Someone else finds her very stalking her, wanting to get close to her, desiring to eliminate those she loved. Will Damian and Athena get the chance to take their passion to greater heights and turn it into something more? Or will her secret admirer get to her first?  Masked Feelings takes you on a roller coaster the sizzling world of strippers, sex, desire, to the warmth of family and friendship, and down to the dark alley of obsession and danger.   Take a bite of the excitement it offers. Let yourself loose. Grab your copy now!",
