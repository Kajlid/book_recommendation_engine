  "description": "Part 1 of 3 of a serial series (needs to be read in order) Be warned: This books ends with a cliffhanger. Hardened by her damaged past, Alice Bennett has no desire for any type of relationship and easily dismisses the warnings about her handsome, but extremely difficult, temporary boss. She is determined to do her job, and do it well. She needs this job, and the references that come from working at a prestigious law firm. But the moment she lays eyes on him, Alice’s determination waivers as unexpected desires stir inside her – even as he barks orders about her choice of lunch. Dylan Marshall is the best lawyer in the city and knows exactly what he wants, and how he wants it done. As the senior partner at his prominent law firm, he expects the people working for him to do what they’re told. Discouraged by the string of incompetent temps, he has low expectations for anyone new the agency sends his way. But the latest temporary assistant is anything but incompetent, and Dylan discovers he wants to know more about her, and intimately. Especially when she stands her ground and questions his orders. Suddenly, this domineering boss learns he prefers a woman to be his equal. Content warning: Adult language and situations, plus some very hot explicit love scenes.",
