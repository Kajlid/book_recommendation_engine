  "description": "Torn apart for ten years, can they reclaim their love?  For as long as Emlan could remember, T’renan had been part of her life - friend, protector, confidant - but when she tried to show the massive alien warrior she wanted more, he left her. When she heard that he had been killed, she couldn't let herself believe he was really gone.  Ten years later, just as she finally starts to move on with her life, word comes that he is alive. At first she is overjoyed, but the protective warrior of her youth has been replaced by a bitter, angry male.  T’renan never wanted to leave Emlan, but neither could he resist her innocent advances. A temporary assignment guarding trade routes seemed like the best alternative - until his ship was captured and he was enslaved in the mines of Quatar. Only the memories of Emlan keep him sane during the torturous years of his imprisonment, but when he finally manages to escape, nothing is the same. He has lost everything else - is he going to lose her as well?  Fate kept them apart for ten years; can they overcome the distance between them and find their way back to each other?  Each book in the Alien Invasion series can be read as a standalone romance. This sweet and steamy HEA is intended for adult readers.",
