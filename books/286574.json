  "description": "I started writing this book during the time my wife was struggling with her late stage cancer because if we had this information years before, she probably could have lived much longer and possibly could have beat it. She did survive for almost 20 years after her first symptoms appeared although at the time, we did not know that they were cancer symptoms.It is not medical advice, just a simple exposure to what might make a difference in your choices in fighting cancer and possibly autoimmune disorders.This book discuses a number of things that can affect the outcome of your cancer struggle as well as some things that might even prevent cancer in the first place. There are places and people around the world where cancer is rare, practically non-existent. There are other thing s that increase not only your risk of developing cancer, but can also increases its rate of growth as well as helping it to spread in your body.This book is not about traditional cancer treatment because that is the realm of medical practice. It is about why cancer develops, why it spreads, and what you can do to reduce the risk, presence, and spread of cancer.",
