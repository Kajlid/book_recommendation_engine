  "description": "Waiting in Deep weaves complexity with simplicity, heartache with humor, producing a remarkable story you won't forget. In 1943, Lottie Johnson's husband and young daughter were tragically killed. Her troubled, estranged cousin, Edgar Dewberry, is the only person who knows exactly what happened and is still trying to forget. In 1972, he returns to Mt. Brayden, South Carolina at the same time the town council wants to buy Lottie's land for their expansion. In her anger she makes a deal with God: if he will show her, in a practical way, how to love the people she hates, she'll do it. His answer is in the two acre garden surrounding her. Following his instructions, her life is altered with such magnitude, even the town she once hated, reaps the benefits of her obedience. Through years of journaling, her endearing relationship with 10-year-old Rebecca, and exasperating relationship with Dovie, her hilarious neighbor, Lottie exchanges her grave clothes for more than she is capable of imagining. Waiting in Deep drops you in the center of southern culture during the 1970s; four unforgettable lives keep you there long after the last page is read.",
