  "description": "A country in chaos, a clash of civilizations, and a family torn asunder...In the midst of the upheaval and violence of Iran's 1979 revolution, a young girl struggles to make sense of a complex swirl of mystery and change. In the vein of The Kite Runner, Iran-born author, Rahimeh Andalibian tells the true-life story of her Iranian Muslim family and two brutal crimes â€“ one that her father solved and another which took the life of her innocent sixteen-year-old brother. In a post-9/11 world where trauma still guides our understanding of the Middle East and we continue to associate Iran with isolation, embargoes, and nuclear threats, The Rose Hotel, takes us first into the early intimacy of her pious family as they lived in prosperity in their luxury hotel in Mashhad, Iran. Their life of beauty and tranquility is ruptured by revolution and followed by a fall from grace, as her homeland is forever altered and her family uprooted, first to London, and finally to California, where they suffer a different kind of revolution. Struggling to acculturate and adjust to a new host culture in America, they soon discover that although they escaped Iran, they were not free from their own lies and hidden truths.Heart-breaking and intimately told, The Rose Hotel is a story of healing, rebirth after tragedy, and hard-won redemption.",
