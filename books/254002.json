  "description": "When Red has to go spend the night helping Grandmole, Bird and Squirrel are put in charge of taking care of Squirrel's daughter, Birdie. But Birdie wants to go with her mom because staying home is so BORING! So Bird convinces Squirrel (despite his better judgment) to have some fun while Red is gone. And as far as Bird is concerned, nothing is more fun than setting off in search of the most elusive creature of the forest: Bigfoot! And even though Squirrel teaches Birdie that being prepared is always best, nothing can prepare them for the crazy adventures ahead!",
