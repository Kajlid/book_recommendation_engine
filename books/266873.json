  "description": "What kind of trouble can a witch get into when she lives in the only supernatural town in the Wild West? A lot.  Meet Adalyn Lovett, the local and only witch of Redstone and a bone to pick with anyone who wants to cause problems for her supernatural home. After losing the town sheriff to a demon attack the year before, she’s taken the task of protecting Redstone on herself. The idea? If any demon outlaws roll through, she’ll have the magic and skill to banish them, protecting everyone. She just needs to test the spell, a little piece of illegal black magic she shouldn’t even have. Not too hard. Just banish a demon with it.  Things seem to be going as planned until they don’t. Adalyn has brought all manner of things home with her without even knowing. Demons, bounty hunters, and an aggravating, warlock US Marshal who thinks he knows best.  Adalyn’s got a bit of a mess to clean up. A sexy mess, but a mess nonetheless.  Witch of the Wild West is a steamy fast burn RH paranormal romance series set in the Wild West! From hellhounds to warlocks, and everything in between, jump into Adalyn’s wild world and join her in following her wild heart. Expect fun adventures, hot scenes, and a feisty female lead who won’t let anyone tell her what to do and won’t choose between the men she falls in love with. It’s all or nothing in the Wild West!",
