  "title": "Exploits of the Satyr",
  "description": "As the title suggests, Exploits of the Satyr is provocative. Sexy, but not a sex novel. It's sci-fi, but not entirely. Think Vonnegut. It's humorous, philosophical, a spiritual journey, a love story, all channeled into the format of a psychological thriller. It's a modern-day Frankenstein that entertains and challenges the mind. And, as with Mary Shelley's iconic novel, here too man plays God in a scientific quest to create new life and becomes shocked and haunted by his creation. But in this story, the components of a dead body aren't sparked to life: a charismatic technological monster is born.Artificial intelligence (AI) is a primary theme. A convoluted and nonlinear story that spirals back on itself like space and time. The last chapter is the first. It begins where it ends, with the protagonist, John Lazard Slater III, known simply as John, or Slater (or Satyr to his fans and foes), crash-landing back to Earth. Thus ends, and begins, a biographical tale about mental, physical and spiritual seduction. The tragic and comic chronicles of a man who belatedly discovers he was procreated by members of a cult – marrying genetic technology with ancient artifacts – to initiate the Second Coming of Christ.Visit www.toddcrawshaw.com for excerpts and more information.",
