  "description": "From Wall Street Journal & USA Today Bestselling Author Lauren Landish. Roxy Price  After ten months without a date, I’m eager to go to the hottest new ticket in town, Club Jasmine. I deserve a night of fun. I’ve worked hard and I finally got a promotion. But for one night, I’m going to let loose. That’s when I see him. The drop-dead gorgeous Jake Stone. With his god-like physique, pure blue eyes, and chiseled jawline, he might be the hottest guy I’ve ever laid eyes on. A total heartstopper. The man’s probably a player. Then again, maybe that’s what I need—a man who knows what he’s got, knows how to use it, and knows how to make me scream to the heavens. Screw it. You only live once. But when I go in Monday morning to meet my new boss, I’m greeted by that same irresistible smile. And Mr. Stone is making it perfectly clear that strictly professional is not in his vocabulary. Heartstopper is a full-length Romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger!",
