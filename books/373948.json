Mace Bishop and Pylon Buso run a security agency, protecting wealthy tourists from the violence on Cape Town's streets -- all the while hoping their own shady pasts won't catch up with them.But when they try to invest some dirty money in a lucrative property deal, they clash with a new and dangerous set of Obed Chocho, corrupt politician par excellence, and Spitz, a ruthless hitman who kills with mechanical efficiency.And somewhere behind it all is an old adversary, Sheemina February, looking to settle a score from the bad old days . . .",
