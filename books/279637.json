  "description": "This Halloween, the full moon has a few tricks up its sleeve…   Harry f*cking Young. Mr. Perfect, himself. Hot, smart, and with a British accent to boot. He’s the guy everyone on campus wants. Except me. Because I’m his roommate, and he’s straight, and living with someone so scorching and off-limits is becoming pure torture…  On Halloween night, I head to a gay costume party to blow off some steam. Soon I hit on a tall, masked stranger… And find Harry’s eyes underneath the mask.  That’s right: all along, my “straight” roommate was hiding something. And soon it becomes clear that the person he really wanted all this time was me.  On one hand, Harry is perfect, and anyone with a pulse would jump at this chance. Duh. Then again, you can’t hook up with your roommate and live to tell the tale without ruining your dynamic forever, right?  From the looks of things, I’m about to find out…  And either way, this will clearly be a Halloween to remember forever. For good, or for bad…",
