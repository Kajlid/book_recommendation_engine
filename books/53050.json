  "title": "New York Mosaic: Do I Wake or Sleep, The Christmas Tree, Many Mansions",
  "description": "In all three of these novels voices move the stories - each carefully constructed narrative is built by the layering of conversation, perception, and inner monologue onto lyrical descriptions of a vibrating New York City. In Do I Wake or Sleep, the lives of two Americans (a journalist and an alcoholic novelist) and a beautiful European refugee intersect for just twenty-four hours as a witty contrast of American and European culture unfolds. In The Christmas Tree, the elderly Mrs. Danforth is celebrating the holidays with her grandson, the boy's mother, and new step-father, when her homosexual son, the boy's father, appears on the scene with his lover and the story draws to its tragic conclusion. In Many Mansions, the voice is that of Margaret Sylvester, in her eighties, living alone in a New York hotel room. She decides, after considerable deliberation, to reread an unpublished manuscript about her life and her poignant and sometimes tragic story is communicated with astonishing brevity and immediacy.",
