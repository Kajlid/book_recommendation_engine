  "description": "Expanded new edition of the landmark book demonstrating the practice of phenomenology through visual illusions and ambiguous drawings.Since the initial publication of Experimental Phenomenology in 1977, Don Ihde’s groundbreaking career has developed from his contributions to the philosophy of technology and technoscience to his own postphenomenology. This new and expanded edition of Experimental Phenomenology resituates the text in the succeeding currents of Ihde’s work with a new preface and two new sections, one devoted to pragmatism and phenomenology and the other to technologies and material culture. Now, in the case of tools, instruments, and media, Ihde’s active and experimental style of phenomenology is taken into cyberspace, science and media technologies, computer games, display screens, and more.Praise for the First Edition“…the unencumbered style of the book and prolific use of concrete examples makes the content accessible both to the beginning student of philosophy and to the intelligent layman.” — Review of Metaphysics“An important and much-needed contribution to the field of phenomenological philosophy.” — CHOICE",
