  "description": "Every year the MM group on Goodreads does a free read event, Bonded is my submission for 2014 Love's Landscape Event. At the beginning of the event, a story letter is submitted from a reader, asking for a very specific story. This is the letter from Tonnya.  STORY LETTER: Dear Author,  My soul ached for command and love, and I was lost. Until I met them. We’d seen each other at different times but it wasn’t until the night I almost killed myself trying to lift more weight than I should that our worlds finally collided. What started out as lifting partners and movie marathons turned into weekend jaunts across the city and every free moment spent together, a tension building up between us that left me holding my breathe. I’ll never forget the night He took control and shattered our worlds, morphing our growing friendship into something more. I used to tell myself I would walk this earth lost and broken forever, but I know now my soul was waiting for Sir and Pup to save me.  Sincerely, Tonnya",
