  "description": "\"One night eight years ago and you ran, angel. One night now and you're gone again. I won't let you run this time without giving chase.\"Eight years ago Evangeline Rowe met her ice-blue eyed, perfect cowboy, but she was running from a past he would have kept her trapped within. One night of unbelievable passion, a lost and consequently broken heart, and only memories that haunted her dreams and made all subsequent liaisons fall short. By the time she is called back to Auckland to tend her dying father, she has only just managed to vanquish the ghosts of her past enough to settle down. Her time as a cowgirl-in-the-rodeo-ring is coming to an end - and then she sees him. Standing across the crowd at Sweet Seduction, listening to her sing. With his arm wrapped around his fianc√©e. Try as she might to refuse him access to her heart again, Nick Anscombe has never forgotten that night eight years ago either.

Gunshots, attempted kidnappings, hostage situations, hot investigators and just as hot police detectives, everything comes to a head when Eva faces her past and accepts who she is inside. And who she is began that day eight years ago - but was it truly the same for her ice-blue eyed cowboy? And can she still be the cowgirl-in-the-rodeo-ring she desires and let him back inside her battered heart?Love at first sight has never been so dangerous and so very delicious at the same time.",
