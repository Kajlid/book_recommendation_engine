Imagine that the story of Miss Susie isn’t an innocent, age-appropriate song. What if she was a party girl whose life intertwined with other campfire songs? Forget the eight-year old thrill of almost saying a bad word while chanting this song over slapping hands, and get comfortable, because you’re in for a wild ride. Follow Miss Susie as she meets a dreamboat and interacts with her best friends Miss Mary Mack and the \"Princess\" Pat as they have adult adventures intertwined with songs from your youth that will show the darker side to lighthearted songs. Song list included.",
