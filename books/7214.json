  "title": "Stieg Larsson: The Real Story of the Man Who Played with Fire",
  "description": "Stieg Larsson's former publisher reveals the real man behind the mega-bestselling Millennium Trilogy--a man who fought heroically for human rights, and who brought that same political and moral passion to his writing.Until the trilogy's posthumous publication, Larsson was best known for his devotion to left-wing causes and as a tireless anti-fascist activist. Horrified by the rise of far-right extremism in Sweden, he dedicated himself to exposing these often shadowy and violent groups--at great personal risk--gaining international respect for the depth of his commitment and knowledge.Jan-Erik Pettersson shows how Stieg's energetic championing of social justice and women's rights characterized his life as well as his work, finally animating the Millennium Trilogy and particularly the character of the unforgettable Lisbeth Salander. Throughout the book Pettersson explores the issues, people, and places who inspired Larsson's portrayal of Salander and her champion, journalist Michael Blomkvist.",
