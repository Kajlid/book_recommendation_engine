  "description": "An FBI Counter Terrorism team operating in Afghanistan and embedded at a US Army Ranger outpost is ambushed. One survivor, a veteran agent named Casey Jennings, endures a brutal run for survival from the Taliban. Before reaching safety, she makes a shocking discovery, the magnitude of which is not immediately apparent. Unusual circumstances bring Casey together with a retired KGB officer into an awkward alliance as they struggle to stop another rogue KGB agent from activating an old Soviet plot. Casey is initially reluctant to work with the retired agent, but when he reveals a personal motivation for stopping his former colleague, they develop a common bond. In the tradition of Ludlum and Forsyth, Eves of Destruction takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride of action and suspense in Afghanistan, Rome and London and finally to San Francisco where the retired KGB agent, the FBI and the police work desperately to prevent a massive terrorist attack on a American institution.",
