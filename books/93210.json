  "description": "A bitter, generation-spanning conflict between two great ruling families for India's most precious lands forms the enthralling central thread of \"Mahabharata.\" It is this sweeping, shifting struggle - with its magnificent cast of characters and its deep moral ramifications - that William Buck brings to us in this beautiful retelling of the ancient Sanskrit epic. The men and women, gods, demons, and animals are once again restored to life as they take part in this drama of savage battle and tender love, sensuous celebration and profound meditation.",
