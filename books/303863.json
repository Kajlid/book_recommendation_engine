But after Jessica’s previous line of work, this should be a piece of cake—until a murder in the bank takes things to a whole new level. Now her contract says she’s the new owner, Jessica has no idea what she’s doing, and the bank won’t let her leave.For centuries, the bank’s owners have stood between the Gateway in the upstairs hall and the occult syndicate who want it for themselves. As she deals with magical clientele who know the stakes far better than she does, Jessica must decide just how far she’s willing to go to keep this job. Because if she doesn’t, she’ll end up as dead as the body in the lobby. Or worse.Illona Andrews’ Inkeeper Chronicles meets The Magicians in this snarky, fast-paced Urban Fantasy Adventure from International Bestselling Author Kathrin Hutson.",
