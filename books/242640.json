  "description": "Two vampires, a werewolf, a wizard, and a gargoyle are charged with saving my race. Sounds like the beginning to a bad joke, right? If only.  I’m Merry Young, the best demon hunter my kind has ever known. Which I guess is why they asked me to save them all. Like I’m some kind of super hero, not the evil creature of the night the humans dream up in their fantasies. If they only knew what actually hunts them.  Unfortunately I’m neither of those things. I’m just a vampire. But, when the disease that’s killing us starts in on my daughter, I summon a strength I didn’t know I had.  The guys and I must find the cure for what’s plaguing the vampires. I won’t consider the alternative. Because before I’m a superhero, or a vampire, or whatever anyone thinks I am, I’m a mother. And I won’t let the demons have my daughter.  The hunt is on. And I never miss.  **WARNING: This book is a reverse harem, full of foul language, sex, violence, and other taboo content. **  Coven of Magic: Dec. 6, 2017 Break of Magic: Coming Feb. 2018 Kiss of Magic: Coming April 2018",
