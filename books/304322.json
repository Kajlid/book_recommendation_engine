  "description": "How did super-orderly Iridessa get into such a fix? First, Tink’s crazy idea to take a pirate bottle from Captain Hook goes horribly wrong. Then, in the flutter of a fairy’s wing, Iridessa and Tink find themselves trapped inside the bottle, floating forlornly on the ocean waves! But as they bob along, the bottle crosses paths with all sorts of unusual sea life, from green turtles to flying fish to beautiful, but selfish, mermaids. And gradually, Iridessa learns something new—a little adventure isn’t such a bad thing!",
