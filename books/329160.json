  "description": "Sixteen is too young to begin criminal profiling. Someone out there's given him no choice...When his younger brother disappears off their lawn during an innocent game of catch and no one believes Stevie didn’t just run off, sixteen-year-old Michael DiSanto is forced to take on the search himself. No one, neither his parents nor the police officer who answers the dispatch call can fathom that Stevie could have been kidnapped in the mere few seconds Michael took to grab change for the oncoming ice cream truck. But they don’t know Stevie or have faith in him as Michael does, seeing beneath the label of “special” that society has branded Stevie with, a label that covers a depth of power. A power, as Michael will soon find out, is shared between brothers.When more Asian boys go missing in surrounding Berkeley, California neighborhoods, Michael finds he can slip into cracks and crevices of the investigation that the police can’t, making himself the boys’ only real hope for survival. Yet, he soon finds that his relentless search is drawing him into the orbit of a deadly enemy, one that will stop at nothing to keep secrets, for whom nothing is sacred, not even the lives of children, including Michael’s.Publisher’s content warning: racism, off-page sexual abuse, family death and grief.",
