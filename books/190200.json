  "description": "Vaporized was selected as the winner of the 2016 International Book of the Year prize by getAbstract from a field of 10,000 business and strategy titles. The prize was announced at the Frankfurt Book Fair on October 19, 2016Digital technology has upturned entire industries and irrevocably altered the way we live, work and do business. Now, it is set to transform every sector and economic system on the planet in almost unimaginable ways - even those once thought to be immune from its effects. In his groundbreaking new book Vaporized, digital pioneer and business futurist Robert Tercek takes us inside the worldâ€™s largest cultural and economic transformation since the industrial revolution, and explains what it means to consumers, employers and policy makers. Dynamic and engaging, Tercek does for digital business theory what Malcolm Gladwell has done for sociology, translating a complex, arcane subject in approachable and relevant terms. In contrast to the digital-era doomsayers and hand-wringing pundits, Tercek offers an insightful, optimistic analysis of the future and a practical blueprint for survival that no business leader, from the Fortune 500 CEO to the small startup owner, can afford to ignore.",
