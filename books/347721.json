  "description": "When Jay's daughter is molested in his ex-wife's care, Jay has to fight to take custody of Emmy. But before he can take her in he has to clean up his act, get a job, an apartment, go into therapy, and prove he isn't an alcoholic. And that isn't the hardest part of all of it. To succeed, Jay has to come to terms with his own dark past and learn how to finally put those inner demons to rest.Rick was abused as a child and always told himself he never wanted to date anyone like his father -- out of work, quick to temper, unable to get his life together. As a young man Rick couldn't help falling in love with Jay, but he knew better than to do anything about it. Jay was his best friend, not what Rick needed in a partner. Now, though, Jay is doing his best for his daughter, overcoming his past and moving forward with his life. Being with Jay might just be Rick's undoing, if he can find the courage to risk his heart.",
