  "description": "Demi has it all figured out. She is going to be a ballerina just like her mother wants. Since the dance studio is the only place she feels like she fits in, it’s the perfect plan. All she wants is a normal life, one where she and her parents aren’t moving to a new place after another one of her accidents. But Demi knows she is far from normal because she can feel it every time she walks near a park, or a tree, or a flower. Demi has a gift-or a curse; green things call to her. They tug at her soul and she has no idea how to control it. That is, until she meets a young man with a similar gift who shows Demi the path to discovering who she is and what she and her gift are meant for.",
