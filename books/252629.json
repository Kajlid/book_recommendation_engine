  "title": "Never After",
  "description": "When I walked down the aisle all those years ago, I thought I was about to begin a fairytale romance...  Boy, was I ever wrong.  Now my would-be Prince Charming is doing a stint behind bars, and my two kids and I are back in the one place I never wanted to see again - the home of my witchy, poisoned-apple-giving Wicked Stepmother.  A loveless home is no place to raise your kids and playing cleaning lady to the seven messiest brothers in history isn’t going to cut it.  Elsabeth Delle bursts into my life like a winter storm - with an idea that might get both of us damsels out of our distress.  It starts with a bed, a webcam, and whichever Internet strangers are willing to offer up their golden coins.  What could go wrong?  As it turns out, it's not a what. It's a who.  Royal Princeps.  He seems almost too good to be true - all radiant green eyes, perfect scruff and a body that's just made for sin. He’s definitely the fairest of them all.... But I've got to figure out if this handsome hunk is my Knight in Shining Armor, or the Big Bad Wolf in sheep's clothing; ready to eat me all up (and not in the good way.)  Or, as I'm starting to suspect, maybe he's a bit of both...  Never After is a Snow White-inspired, curse-word infused bedtime story for adults only - exploring what happens when your fairytale \"happy ending\" is actually just the beginning...",
