  "title": "Donald Duk",
  "description": "Welcome to Chinatown, Chinese New Year in San Francisco. Everybody's birthday. The lantern festival of the fifteenth day. Welcome home. Crashing Cantonese opera, dancing lions, comic book heroes, and a childhood among partying pagans. Donald Duk is a twelve-year-old kid with a name he doesn't like and a family that doesn't deserve him. As this novel opens, Donald would rather be Fred Astaire than the son of a Chinatown restaurateur. In this robust and vigorous work, Donald learns to see himself more clearly as he, and we, see his culture free of distorting stereotypes.",
