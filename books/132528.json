  "title": "The Final Recollections of Charles Dickens",
  "description": "England, 1870: His health failing, his most important work all but done, Charles Dickens is readying for the final bed. But there is one more story that he must tell.The Final Recollections of Charles Dickens blends a historically-accurate telling of Dickens’s life with a gripping portrait of betrayal, murder, corruption, obsession, and love. It’s the story of Dickens’s coming of age, caught between the worlds of England’s ruling elite and the seamy underside of London society. The novel captures a full range of Dickensian Dickens; the hauntingly beautiful Amanda Wingate; Geoffrey Wingate, Amanda’s scheming financial-swindler husband; and Florence Spriggs, a mutilated prostitute whose once-lovely face has been carved into a mask of horror.Meticulously researched and masterfully told, The Final Recollections of Charles Dickens captures the voice of the beloved author, the divided city of London, and the uncertain tenor of the times.",
