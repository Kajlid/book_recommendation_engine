  "description": "A young girl named Drinna awakes in a place called the Sea of Grass in the world of Trithofar. She does not understand how she arrived, nor where her merchant parents have gone. She knows, however, the Sea of Grass is a dangerous place. She finds she has no weapons, no food, no water; she has only the knowledge of the Sea of Grass her parents gave her to help her. But Drinna is a kunjel. She was returning home from abroad because her people must undergo a rite of passage to control the rage of the kunjels. Out here, in the Sea of Grass, the rage, uncontrolled, can both protect her or doom her. Worse still, the Sea of Grass is full of vicious monsters and dangerous enemy races. And atop all of this, someone is looking for her, to kill her...or worse.",
