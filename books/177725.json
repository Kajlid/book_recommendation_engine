  "description": "Théoden: Now that my King's decree has been fulfilled, I need to get my city in order. I have my boys to brand before I send them off, and a stubborn wolf, vampire and dragon hybrid son to House train. Fun times ahead.  Noel: My night started off full of passion and pleasure. So that must mean I'm really bonding with my brothers and their sons. I'm also looking forward to my training with Marco. It's not going to be fun or easy, but I know I'll learn so much, which is what I want. I don't just want to be feared as a vampire, I want to be respected, too.  Deacon: My arrangement with Théoden turned out to be more profitable for me than I had expected. The vampire Prince gave me my mate when he turned over the five humans I demanded. Elijah, though stubborn, will learn that we are meant to be together. He will submit to me by any means necessary.  Warning: This serial contains strong adult content not meant for sensitive eyes. The novelettes in this serial will be filled with dark, twisted, raunchy and steamy scenes between powerful, sexy men that will either offend you or get ya revved up. This series will not be pulling any punches, and it won’t apologize for hurting your feelings, either. You’ll find no fluff and ruffles here. The vampires are not misunderstood, hopeless romantics looking for love. The werewolves are not cute and cuddly and the dragons aren’t the ones from your childhood. This is NOT a romance. There are approximately 21600 words in this novelette.",
