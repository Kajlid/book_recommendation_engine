  "title": "Just Another Number",
  "description": "Just Another Number is a memoir structured by the first 23 men Maggie Young had sex with. Her story is about how American society curbs women to validate themselves by men. Through her lovers, Maggie relives the toxic and at times, life-threatening situations she endured under that mentality. The book paints a gritty portrait of a Tennessee teen who- in the midst of bulimia and meth abuse- joins the Navy. Just Another Number hops through the various shades of chauvinism in the conservative Bible Belt, the male dominated military, and the superficiality of southern California. Her story is littered with hypocritical Christians, brainwashed warriors, deadbeat band guys, and the spoiled, cocaine snorting trust fund offspring of Californiaâ€™s elite. It also entails child abuse, eating disorders, drug cultures, social media, and military corruption.",
