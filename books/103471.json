Unemployed and battling addiction, Rick Maloney wants to be a caring, responsible parent to his only child. Soon, though, he loses his way and begins a steady descent into darkness that will force him to confront old demons.A deeply moving story about the anti-heroes in life and how they can be our strongest facilitators of growth, A Father’s Son is a heartbreaking tale of a teenage boy thrust into adulthood prematurely.Through Justin, the novel also touches on the universal themes of first loves, betrayal and the struggle for identity. Ultimately, A Father’s Son is a stirring tale of how parent and child can grow so far apart while remaining affectingly close through a shared love of Canada’s national passion.",
