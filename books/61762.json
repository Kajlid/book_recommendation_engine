  "description": "From the voices of our beloved children in Uganda come 'The Songs of Kiguli.' With a chance to be heard and a rythmn of their hearts tuned to fine precision and melody, they give you their thoughts, hopes and dreams hoping you will listen through the harmonic literary penmanship they so carefully wish to vocalize. Together these children from the ages of 11 to 17 years bring forth a world poetry movement under the direction of their school and its teacher, Philip Matogo. (Author of ‘Whispers in the Sky’) The First of its kind, ‘The Songs of Kiguli’ are sure to have a deep and profound impact upon our future generations to come.",
