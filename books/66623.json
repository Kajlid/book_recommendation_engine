This book describes domestic violence to young children and offers hope. Children are taught healthy ways to get anger out of their bodies and what to do when they witness adults getting anger out of their body in an unhealthy way. Julie has again taken a complex social problem and broken it down into the language of children.Julie Federico is a former middle school counselor. She holds a bachelor’s degree in social work and a master’s degree in counseling and educational psychology from Indiana University. Her first book Some Parts Are Not for Sharing is a child’s first book on body safety.Far too many children are living in homes where there is domestic violence. Julie Federico's book \"Anger Is Okay, Violence Is NOT\" contains a lesson that all children should learn. We all feel anger, but that there are healthy ways to let the anger out. Hurting people when you are angry and domestic violence is not okay. I highly recommend this book to parents, teachers, and mental health workers and agencies.",
