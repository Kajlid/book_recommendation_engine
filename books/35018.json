Or so he believes until he meets the drop-dead gorgeous photographer he wants to revamp the art department of his e-magazine.Caleb Mitchell, bad boy extraordinaire, lives life on the edge. He's been around the world covering murder and mayhem. Back in New Orleans to tend his dying mother, Caleb is worn down by grief. He seeks the diversion of working at a local e-magazine to help keep him sane. He doesn't expect the instant attraction to the bright-eyed editor/owner. That Darcy is probably straight doesn't matter to Caleb. Because when Caleb wants something, nothing will stand in his way.Not even Darcy.",
