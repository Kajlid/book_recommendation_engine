  "description": "If living life to the fullest was a test… I’d get an ‘F’.The summer before senior year was supposed to be fun, but my mom had other plans. What she failed to realize was that I wasn’t a little girl anymore, and just because she said so, didn’t mean I had to listen. I was born into a family that no matter what I did, or how I did it, looked at me like an outsider. You hear ‘you’re wrong’ enough times, pretty soon that’s all you’ll believe. But I’m more than they think I am, and one of these days, it’s going to be my turn to live…. and finally be free.Prequel to Waiting For A Fall/Young Annabelle",
