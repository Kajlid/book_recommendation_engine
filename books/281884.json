  "title": "Poetic Letters To God",
  "description": "Poetic Letters to God is a collection of letters addressed to God in the form of verses. I have been writing letters to God since my childhood. I used to scribble my heart out on paper every time I was upset and doing that comforted me more than anything could ever do. Those scribbles were unreadable; I could never decipher what I had written as they were just a bunch of lines and curves inked on paper while my heart did the talking. Years later, poetry found me, which is the greatest blessing I have received from God and then, I began talking to God through free verses letting my heart leave its worries on paper, in the hands of God",
