  "description": "Hannah Prescott has an overzealous admirer whose advances have gone from challenging to terrifying. There is only one solution: Nikolai Ivanov. Nikolai, with his tendency towards violence and connections to the Russian mob, is exactly who Hannah needs to keep herself safe. Nikolai Ivanov has had no use for relationships. However, witnessing Hannah's distress and fear pulls him at ways he doesn't want to admit. He agrees to Hannah's charade, but is determined to keep it impersonal. At first. Against his will, all of his protective instincts are triggered and while he wants to create distance between himself and Hannah, he can't keep his hands off of her. Nikolai's father creates more problems when Hannah and her younger sister are threatened in attempt to control Nikolai. Can Nikolai keep Hannah and her sister safe while admitting how important Hannah has become to him?",
