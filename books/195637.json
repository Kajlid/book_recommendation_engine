  "description": "The Urban Homestead is the essential handbook for a fast-growing new movement: urbanites are becoming gardeners and farmers.

By growing their own food and harnessing natural energy, they are planting seeds for the future of our cities.If you would like to harvest your own vegetables, raise city chickens, or convert to solar energy, this practical, hands-on book is full of step-by-step projects that will get you started homesteading immediately, whether you live in an apartment or a house. It is also a guidebook to the larger movement and will point you to the best books and Internet resources on self-sufficiency topics.Projects include: \n   How to grow food on a patio or balcony \n   How to clean your house without toxins \n   How to preserve food \n   How to cook with solar energy \n   How to divert your greywater to your garden \n   How to choose the best homestead for you \n Written by city dwellers for city dwellers, this illustrated, smartly designed, two-color instruction book proposes a paradigm shift that will improve our lives, our community, and our planet. Authors Kelly Coyne and Erik Knutzen happily farm in Los Angeles and run the urban homestead blog www.homegrownrevolution.org.",
