  "title": "Sweet Tea and Southern Grace",
  "description": "Sweet Tea and Southern Grace is in the genre of Christian Fiction and is the author's first published novel. It is in the style of Jan Karon's Mitford Series and its setting is a small Southern town in rural America where sitting on front porches, drinking sweet iced tea out of heirloom glasses, and participating in innocent gossip are the favorite pastimes of the good folks of Park Place, South Carolina. The story revolves around the town's Presbyterian Church and its almost meddlesome minister, Reverend Rock Clark, whose meddling ways quite often get him into trouble. There's a sweet romance brewing between the story lines, but the young preacher is too busy tending to his flock and putting out fires to recognize it. A culmination of mystery, intrigue and God's grace makes this book a delightful read.",
