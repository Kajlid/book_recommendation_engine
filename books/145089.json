Desmond Chadwick resents the new life he is forced to live when his coven moves from the city to the country. He doesn't want anything to do with it, which includes denying his newfound mate, a sexy dragon shifter. Vincent waited patiently for Desmond to lose the attitude and accept their mating. The vampire was young and impulsive. He would give him time to get to know him. Desmond blatantly ignored Vincent until he found their third mate, a human named Samuel Ware. Vincent stepped in when Desmond brought Sam to the farm and the man panicked. Convinced he had been drugged by the handsome stranger from the bar where they had met, Sam didn't even blink when he discovered there were dragon shifters, vampires, and trolls. It was only the beginning to a whole new life, one he prayed was better than the one he had lived for twenty-five years. After learning he had two mates, Sam was overjoyed until someone tried over and over again to kill them. Note: This book contains double anal penetration. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
