Before leaving Gaspar, I told Ali we’d still be together. I made promises I didn’t keep, and I lied over and over again. I threw our plans out the window and made a life for myself.I’ve barely had time to go home, because touring keeps me away. We haven’t been in touch in years, but after this tour, I’m heading home to find the only person who knows my deepest, darkest secret, and beg for forgiveness.Ten years ago, I kissed my best friend, and his name is Alejandro Barerra. My Ali.He may never forgive me for the broken promises or for breaking his heart, and I’m afraid he’ll never want to talk to me again, but he’s the only one who knows the real me, and I’m determined to win him back. Even if it means risking it all.*Can be read as a standalone",
