  "description": "This is kind of a sequel to \"Just Friends\", except it's really just a bunch of one-shots. They're not in order. Some are before JF, some after, some during, and they switch point of view in every chapter. Still Bob Marley songs, though.Ah, and because someone will notice and ask, no, \"Johnny Was\" has nothing to do with anything. It's just another Bob Marley song that reminds me of Just Friends...Chapter Notes: Eleven years after Just Friends. Friday and Adrian central.",
