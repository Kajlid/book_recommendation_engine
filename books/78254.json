  "description": "Neetah, Pocahontas's Pamunkey friend and servant, could hear the words princess and My Lady whispered from the lips of the white men who had settled in the colony they called Jamestown.Pocahontas, the daughter of the Supreme Chief of the Confederacy, was important in their eyes, and Neetah, too, could see something special within her bold friend.She accompanied Pocahontas to Jamestown regularly, to this fort of smelly, hairy men whose food supply was slowly disappearing. The girls' mission was clear: to protect the Confederacy by finding out as much as they could about these strangers and report back to the Supreme Chief. But the daring Pocahontas, led by visions, had other intentions as well. My Lady Pocahontas tells an important early chapter of America's history from the Pamunkey viewpoint as the drama of two clashing cultures unfolds. Author's note and bibliography included.",
