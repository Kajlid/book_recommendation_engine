  "description": "Star basketball player Chelsea \"Nitro\" Keyes had the promise of a full ride to college―and everyone's admiration in her hometown. But everything changed senior year, when she took a horrible fall during a game. Now a metal plate holds her together and she feels like a stranger in her own family. As a graduation present, Chelsea's dad springs for a three-week summer \"boot camp\" program at a northern Minnesota lake resort. There, she's immediately drawn to her trainer, Clint, a nineteen-year-old ex-hockey player who's haunted by his own traumatic past. As they grow close, Chelsea is torn between her feelings for Clint and her loyalty to her devoted boyfriend back home. Will an unexpected romance just end up causing Chelsea and Clint more pain―or finally heal their heartbreak? \"PLAYING HURT is a delicious, tantalizing love story that will captivate you until the final, satisfying sigh.\"―Kristin Walker, author of A MATCH MADE IN HIGH SCHOOL",
