  "description": "Two high school seniors with family trauma keeping them up at night fall in love over a series of secret late-night driving lessons.“An achingly beautiful coming-of-age story…Midnights With You is everything I’ve ever wanted in a book.” —Ann Liang, New York Times best-selling author of I Hope This Doesn’t Find You***“Where were you thinking of going?”“Nowhere.”“Great,” he says lightly, putting the car in gear. “Then we’ll go there.”Seventeen-year-old Deedee’s life is full of family ghosts and questions she can’t ask. She longs for an escape, but guilt holds her back—that, and the fact that her strict Filipino single mom won’t let her learn to drive. But one sleepless night leads Deedee down a road she never thought possible: secret driving lessons with the new boy next door, Jay, whose turbulent family life also keeps him up until sunrise.As midnights stretch into days, Jay helps Deedee begin to unravel her past, and as shared secrets blossom into love, Deedee starts to imagine a life where happiness is possible. But the deeper she digs into the trauma that has shaped her, the more that trauma threatens to tear Deedee and Jay apart. Together, these two must decide if the pain they’ve both inherited has the power to choose their fate, or if they have the power to choose for themselves.",
