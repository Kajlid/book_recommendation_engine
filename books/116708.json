  "description": "\"...Author McClure has produced a real page-turner of a read in \"Listen to the Ghost.\" Reader interest is maintained from the opening lines when we meet Jade puzzling over the music she hears coming from somewhere in the house. Connection is held fast as we encounter the lighthearted ghost, and is continued past the insistence of the stalker ex-boyfriend who just will not take no for an answer and right down to the last paragraphs as we all attend Jade's eighteenth birthday party. \"Listen to the Ghost\" is not only tense or high-strung activity. Phoebe the ghost is a delight who 'borrows' the girls' jewelry and clothing, paints a mustache and beard on the portrait of the ex boyfriend and lobs veggies and patties at the young people. Writer McClure creates a nicely honed work filled with spine tingling action, clever scenarios, and well fleshed characters in this deftly written narrative. Forceful motivations, precarious twists of story line, first class conversation fill the pages in this exciting read. Sure to please the target audience \"Listen to the Ghost\" has a place in the home pleasure reading library.--Molly Martin.\"...I am always looking for a book which will ignite and delight the imaginations of my adolescent nieces and nephews. \"Listen to the Ghost\" fits the bill. McClure does a fine job of sparking the reader's imagination and creating suspense. She takes you on a roller coaster ride from her opening lines when Jade hears the voice of the ghost through the tense confrontation with Jade's ex-boyfriend, and ends in a successful conclusion of solving Phoebe's mystery of her missing wedding rings and a new romance for Jade. \"Listen to the Ghost\" should delight the younger adolescent readers.\"--Deb Watson, \"Blue Iris Journal.\"",
