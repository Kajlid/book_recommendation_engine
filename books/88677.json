  "description": "A Gift in the Dark is a compilation of short works, predominantly written in the Paranormal, Fantasy and Horror genres. Many of the stories are based around old Westcountry myths and legends, and the collection starts with a tale of a miner's descent into madness, history and legend as the Knockers move from the shadows. Others works include a story about hellâ€™s own gameshow, a re-write of an old fairy tale, a drabble, death appearing as an unwelcome guest at a wedding, and various other stories of imps, trolls, sprites and a teddy bear called Mr Tumnus. Gavin has had many of his short works published by online magazines including Spinetinglers, Interstellar Fiction and Sanitarium, and was shortlisted for the Strictly Writing website best short story award in 2011 for A Little Bit of Soul which is included in the compilation.",
