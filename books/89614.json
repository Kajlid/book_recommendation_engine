  "description": "Kallie Masters has spent the past seven years becoming a renowned reviewer, foregoing any romantic entanglements for the sake of her job. Good or bad, she is highly respected by her readers and peers. But when an arrogant author sends death threats in response to Kallie’s scathing review of his latest novel, her boss sends her on a weekend getaway.Kallie’s mountaintop respite is shattered when she runs into Hank Fogle with his drop-dead gorgeous eyes and frat-boy attitude. Denying the unmistakable chemistry between them, Kallie steels herself against the attraction, determined to remain aloof and free of the mess this man would surely bring into her life.Can the magic of the Smokies allow her to let things flow naturally between them or will she fall into a lustful trap that will only break her heart in the end?",
