  "description": "Every princess needs her prince, right?  Well, I’ve got four of them.  And let me tell you, more is not merrier.  I’m just an ordinary girl in an ordinary world until my brother reveals our family’s little (big) secret: We’re Fae.  And not just that—Fae royalty.  But after my brother is murdered on the eve of his wedding, I’m forced to take the throne and pick up the pieces.  But I have no friends here. The four nations sworn to protect me bicker over who will win my hand in marriage and secure the position of High King, ignoring the assassin hiding among us.  All I want is to find whoever is responsible for my brother’s death and tear them apart. But in a castle crowded with the elite, the suspects are endless, the motives murky, and my time is running out to choose a spouse before the decision is ripped from me.  And if I don’t figure out who to trust and who not to, I won’t even live long enough to hear my (dreaded) wedding bells.",
