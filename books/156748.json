  "description": "How on earth did I end up in this strange and vulnerable position? A year ago, I didn’t know such a thing even existed. Six months ago, I would have said “Oh, my god! Do people really do that?” One month ago, I might have admitted the idea was intriguing and maybe even mildly titillating, but that I could never actually do it. No how. No way. You’d have to be crazy to do anything like that. And yet, here I am. I’m not crazy—at least, I don’t think I am. So now I’m standing with my feet spread far apart and my arms stretched up over my head, wrists together, wondering how I could have let myself end up like this. I’m sorry I can’t describe any of this for you in more precise detail, but I’m blindfolded. And did I mention that I’m naked?",
