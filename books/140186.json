  "description": "This isn’t your regular love story. My Prince Charming didn’t ride up on a white horse and come and save me. In fact, he warned me to stay away from him. Of course, I didn’t listen. Why would I? There’s something so exciting about going after someone you shouldn’t have.However, I never thought it would be like this. I’ve never felt so conflicted in my life. No one told me that being bad could feel so good. No one told me that when the big bad wolf tells you to run away and hide, you should listen.If I’d only known just how far from charming my prince was, I would have ignored the invitation.",
