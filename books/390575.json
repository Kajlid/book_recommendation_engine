  "description": "\"We must be bound to one another, then. Bound by hell-forged chains and fate-haunted circumstance. Well, then - let it be thus so - and men will have cause to tremble and flee when they hear the names of Elric of Melnibon√© and Stormbringer, his sword. We are two of a kind - produced by an age which has deserted us. Let us give this age cause to hate us...\"Imrryr, the dreaming city; Yyrkoon, the hatred usurper; Cymoril, the beloved - all had fallen to the fury and unearthly power of the albino prince and his terrible sword. And Elric faced at last the fate that was to be his in this haunted era: that he must go forth, sword and man as one, and havoc and horror would be forever at his forefront until he found the Purpose tag was as yet obscured to him...Contents:'The Dream of Earl Aubec'.'The Dreaming City'.'While the Gods Laugh'.'The Singing Citadel'.",
