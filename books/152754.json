A simple quest for sexual education ended up a lesson in heartbreak, an immersion into submission, and a headlong run into danger as one seemingly kind, and handsome Dutchman hid deep, dark secrets while a New York City photographer and notorious womanizer threatened to steal her heart. Meanwhile, in the shadows, a predator stalks her best friend's little brother. Can Sarah survive the evil that awaits as she seeks out pleasure or will pleasure be the death of her?",
