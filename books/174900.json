  "description": "When Sophie goes to a charity hockey game at her alma mater, she knows without a doubt that goalie Pete Williams will be there. Her unrequited desire goes back to their college days, when she admired him from afar and he had no idea she even existed. Until she took his picture, and for one brief moment she met the man behind the jock persona, and her desire intensified. For him, however, she knew the meeting was entirely forgettable. Now, in a hotel lobby, a tap on the shoulder may change all that.Pete hears Sophie Denton admit her longtime crush on him and he’s intrigued. She’s not the type of woman he usually goes for….curvy, lush, and lacking self-confidence. Over the course of the weekend, he places himself in her path time and time again to find she’s smart, sassy, funny….and she boils his blood, sexually and emotionally. They share a drunken night of passion and begin an affair that Sophie runs from and Pete chases, yet neither can stop. Each touch, each kiss sinks them deeper and deeper into their forbidden desire. Pete and Sophie play a dangerous game with their spouses where they may be tripped, boarded or hit from behind at every turn. Keeping their secret is a penalty that may be called out, but when one spouse finds out, one of the lovers may be ejected from the game….permanently.",
