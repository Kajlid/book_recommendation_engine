Then Lachlan \"The Wily\" Maclean, a Highland warrior with a network of spies that keeps him the most well-informed man in the kingdom, joins the Court of the Isles. He passionately wants Mairi, and although she scorns his impudent ways, she gasps at his touch...Accustomed to fighting for what he wants, Lachlan forms a daring plan to win her, only to ignite the jealousy of a powerful, implacable enemy who expects to win not only Mairi but the entire Kingdom of the Isles.",
