  "description": "Tyranny. Desperation. Rebellion.  While Tristan may be the heir to the House of Listar, at heart he’s more a lad than a lord.  Mad with power, the ruthless and scheming Baron of Belnair will stop at nothing to gain the crown. In the dead of night, the Baron massacres Tristan’s family and burns their home to the ground. Desperate and alone, Tristan must fight for his life and his people.  With everything at stake, Tristan must unite the unlikeliest of allies to block the Baron's ascent. For the first time in his life, he must become the leader he was born to be.  The Baron’s armies grow as an ancient magic stirs in the mountains. If Tristan fails, the throne, his freedom, and the love of his life will be lost forever.  A Coronation of Kings is the first book in this exciting new fantasy series. If you like fast-paced adventures, spellbinding sorcery, and wondrous new worlds, you will love Samuel Stokes' A Coronation of Kings.  Grab your copy and enter this exhilarating new world today!",
