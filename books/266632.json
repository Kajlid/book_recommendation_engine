  "description": "His mistletoe ain't for kissing...  Matchmaker Rowan Hooligan has helped Fate pair up many shifter couples, but he still hasn't found his fated mate. This werebear's meddling has gotten his furry butt on The Naughty List. Because Rowan put off his own search for a mate, he loses his mate mark and his shift. To get them back, he's going to have to get off of The Naughty List and claim his fated mate by Christmas. Oh, and he has to pull Santa Claus' sleigh on Christmas Eve. The only problem is, Rowan's a bad boy matchmaker. If he doesn't listen to Cupid -- Santa Claus' flying reindeer -- Rowan might end up losing his true love forever. Get ready for a very Merry Christmas.  Rowan and Holly go together like candy canes and cocoa...  When curvy baker Holly meets Rowan, she feels as if she's been shot by Cupid's arrow. It may be the Christmas season, but every day spent with Rowan feels like Valentine's Day. The only problem is, Rowan has a secret he's keeping from this BBW -- and he's doing things all wrong. The only thing that could possibly make things more complicated is one of Rowan's trademark singles mixers. Singles aren't the only thing mixing. When Fate and Christmas magic get mixed together like gingerbread dough in a mixing bowl, anything can happen.  Has the matchmaker met his match?  When Holly hears Rowan say something horrible, she assumes the worst. Will Rowan win back his true love in time for Christmas? And will he claim her before he loses his shift forever? There's only one book with the answer, and that's 'Cupid Claws.'  This story, featuring a bad boy werebear and a BBW baker, is loosely based on The Ugly Duckling.",
