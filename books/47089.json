  "title": "The Scar",
  "description": "Reaching far beyond sword and sorcery, The Scar is a story of two people torn by disaster, their descent into despair, and their reemergence through love and courage. Egert is a brash, confident member of the elite guards and an egotistical philanderer. But after he kills an innocent student in a duel, a mysterious man known as \"The Wanderer\" challenges Egert and slashes his face with his sword, leaving Egert with a terrible scar â€“ and a curse of cowardice. Egert embarks on an odyssey to undo the blight, and his painful journey leads him down a dangerous path. Stylistically reminiscent of Robin Hobb, and with a haunting and ominous imagination similar to a Michael Moorcock's, The Scar tells a story that cannot be forgotten.",
