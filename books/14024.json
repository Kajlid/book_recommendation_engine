  "description": "Brilliantly funny, teenage angst author Louise Rennison's fifth book about the confessions of crazy but lovable Georgia Nicolson. Louise is a star on the HarperCollins teenage list. 11.20 a.m. This is my fabulous the Sex God left for Whakatane last month and he has taken my heart with him. 11.25 a.m. Not literally of course otherwise there would be a big hole in my nunga-nungas. 11.28 a.m. And also I would be dead. Which quite frankly would be a blessing in disguise. 12.00 p.m. It is soooo boring being brokenhearted! !but Georgia doesn't remain brokenhearted for frequent snogging extravaganzas with old flame, Dave the Laugh, and the arrival of jelloid-knee-inducing Italian Stallion, Masimo, mean that Georgia has her work cut out to be the composed sex-kitten that she aspires to be. Follow Georgia's hilarious antics as she desperately muddles her way through teenage life and all that it make-up disasters, rapidly expanding nunga-nungas, school -- urgh, unsympathetic friends, highly embarrassing family (and pets) and, of course, BOYS.",
