  "description": "Joanna was running, mile after endless mile of running. Panting. Screaming. The black-robed man was behind her, gaining with every step! It seemed the faster she tried to run the slower her legs moved. She was now running in slow motion, agonizing minutes passing between each step, and the man was gaining, until he was only a step behind her! Then his evil hand grabbed her hair, which was blowing behind her in the wind. She heard herself screaming, and it was for real, not just a dream now. Hands were clawing at her face tearing her flesh! She jerked away and opened her eyes. She was alone. It was a dream.But something was wrong............terribly wrong",
