  "title": "A Dominant Salvation",
  "description": "When beautiful and strong-willed Gabrielle Hyde met the enigmatic and dominant Damian Hunt, gorgeous and confident, he was impossible to resist, no matter how much she tried. Like Elle, Hunt was tormented by his past, obsessed with controlling himself and her. He introduced her to a world of sex, travel, and power. And, in turn, she showed him everything he’d been missing, love, trust, and understanding. Though their road has had its share of bumps and detours, they've managed to fight whatever came their way. The future seems bright and full of possibilities. But things aren’t always as they seem. With Dante lurking in the shadows and secrets still threatening to ruin everything they’ve worked for, will they remain bound to the chains of the past? Or will they finally find Salvation?",
