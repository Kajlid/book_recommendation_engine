  "description": "Time heals all wounds…Yeah, I call bullshit. My grief still bleeds out each and every day no matter how much time passes.I’ve managed to make a new life for myself by helping my bestie run TheOmegasGuide—our viral social media account. We support freedom of choice for all designations.Though I’m starting to wonder if having a choice is really all that great. Locke’s up my ass more than usual, acting weird, and…is my hulking Beta friend flirting? I’d be lying if I said I didn’t secretly hope he’d ignore that whole friend-zone thing. Then there’s Cohen—the commanding, broody Alpha who wants nothing to do with me, but that I can’t stop thinking about. Of course, I can’t forget Bastian—the sexy stranger I ran into—literally. With his big, warm, mouthwateringly gorgeous body and haunted brown eyes, I’d love the chance to get to know him better.The intensity of our chemistry is explosive, but they’re not a pack, and I’m not looking for another forever….right? No. It hurts too much and goes against everything I believe now.No relationships. No commitments. This Omega needs to rediscover just who she is and can’t fall into anything serious.Nope. Knot a chance.",
