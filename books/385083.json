  "description": "Badly burned in a household accident when she was a child, Finch Nobles grows into a courageous and feisty loner who eschews the pity of her hometown and discovers that she can hear the voices of the people buried in her father's cemetery. Finally, when she speaks to them, they answer, telling their stories in a remarkable chorus of regrets, expla-nations, and insights.   A Gracious Plenty is like an extraordinary amalgam of Steinbeck and Faulkner,   Spoon River Anthology and Our Town . It is a reading experience that you will not soon forget.",
