  "description": "Saying Earl Kiddering is rich is like saying Babe Ruth hit a couple of home runs, but saying he's dead is more accurate. A month after the billionaire drowns in his own swimming pool, Earl's great-niece hires private investigator Chase Michael DeBarlo to find Kiddering's missing will while other family members squabble over the fortune. Dark family secrets are uncovered during Chase's investigation, including adultery, and tax evasion -- and Earl's death continues to look less like an accident. In the meantime, Chase feels obligated to help his mother's friend, a lounge singer who fears she is being stalked. He reluctantly takes the case, fearing it may infringe on his time with the Kiddering case -- and it does. Deadly Heirs explores the loyalties (and disloyalties) of family bonds, exposes a private investigator's time-management crisis, and uncovers the corruption of a mysterious art market. (Second Edition, revised with extended scenes.)",
