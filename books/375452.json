  "description": "There's never been another dog as delightful—or dirty—as Harry.Whether he's a white dog with black spots, or a black dog with white spots, Harry is sure to steal your heart (and your scrub brush, too, if you're not careful).First published in 1956, this beloved classic is a collaboration between Gene Zion and two-time Caldecott Honor winner Margaret Bloy Graham. The artist has added splashes of color to the cheerful scenes for this welcome new edition.\nGene Zion\n and \nMargaret Bloy Graham\n collaborated on four picture books featuring the enormously popular white dog with black spots. Harry the Dirty Dog was followed by No Roses for Harry!, Harry and the Lady Next Door, and Harry by the Sea. Gene Zion, who died in 1975, will always be remembered for his playful children's stories. Margaret Bloy Graham has illustrated two Caldecott Honor Books: Gene Zion's \nAll Falling Down (1952)\n and Charlotte Zolotow's The Storm Book (1953). She also wrote and illustrated such favorites as Be Nice to Spiders. Margaret Bloy Graham completed the artwork for this new edition of Harry the Dirty Dog at her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
