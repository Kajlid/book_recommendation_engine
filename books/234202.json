  "description": "The New York Times bestseller from the author of Slaughterhouse-Five —a “gripping” posthumous collection of Kurt Vonnegut’s previously unpublished work on the subject of war and peace.A fitting tribute to a literary legend and a profoundly humane humorist, Armageddon in Retrospect is a collection of twelve previously unpublished writings. Imbued with Vonnegut's trademark rueful humor and outraged moral sense, the pieces range from a letter written by Vonnegut to his family in 1945, informing them that he'd been taken prisoner by the Germans, to his last speech, delivered after his death by his son Mark, who provides a warmly personal introduction to the collection. Taken together, these pieces provide fresh insight into Vonnegut's enduring literary genius and reinforce his ongoing moral relevance in today’s world.Includes an Introduction by Mark Vonnegut",
