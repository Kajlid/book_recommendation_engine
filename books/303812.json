  "description": "Here Lives a Corpse is book one of a five-book series. You do have to read all to understand. Each one ends on a cliffhanger.We all have demons, some of us know how to befriend them rather than defy them.They always speak of me… whispers of a devil with a charming smile.But they don’t know me, what truly lies beneath.I’m a monster with the face of a boy, married to the darkness, harvested by the past, and saved by none.My intentions aren’t clear, but the murky water my hopes died in is.I’ll save her since no one else can.She’ll hate the process.They’ll run for their salvation.The Vestige won’t take any prisoners.Taking away her choices wasn’t intentional, tying her hands wasn’t permanent, but stealing every part of her that matters was always my goal.In the end, I’ll demolish the meek castle they’ve built, proving that the fixer will always outwin the weak.Screw princes and kingdoms.The devil always played harder and smarter.She’s mine, they’ve only forgotten their place.",
