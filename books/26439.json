  "description": "Comedy and tragedy are combined in this tale of blackmail, arson, fraud and murder. Her late husband left his company to a former mistress and now Daffodil Portly wants revenge. Never mind that Serena is the most capable person to run the business, Daffodil plots to get rid of her and install her naive and timid son as managing director. She’ll stop at nothing to regain what she believes is rightfully hers. But Serena finds herself having to deal with a lot more than Daffodil’s vindictiveness. First a blackmail attempt, then an unexplained multi million pound deficit in the accounts and suddenly the company is verging on insolvency. Can Serena persuade Daffodil’s son to work with her to save the business? Or will Daffodil keep Bobby tied to her apron strings and ensure that Serena is no longer a threat to what should have been their inheritance?",
