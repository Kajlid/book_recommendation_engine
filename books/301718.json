She is happy to play the role of a drudge so long as it keeps anyone from discovering her ties to the temple and the dark secret of her past.But when Malini bears witness to Priya's true nature, their destinies become irrevocably tangled. One is a vengeful princess seeking to steal a throne. The other is a powerful priestess seeking to find her family. Together, they will set an empire ablaze.Also by Tasha Suri:Empire of SandRealm of Ash",
