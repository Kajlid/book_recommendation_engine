  "description": "I lucked into the perfect roommate this year: pretty to look at, eager to please, happy to do any and every damn thing I want, sometimes even before I know I want it. And even though I'm here on a football scholarship, not some kind of brainiac academic one like he is, I'm still smart enough to know I shouldn't mess with a good thing.  It's why I gave myself one rule: hands off pretty little Sean Cabot.  I mean, shouldn't be too hard, right? There are plenty of other willing twinks available to keep me happy this year, so there's no need to obsess about the only one I told myself I can't touch...   CANâ€™T TOUCH is a 54,000 word gay college romance between a cocky jock and the sweet, sheltered boy who just wants to be good for him. Read it if you like bossy jocks, boys who like it that way, unapologetic power imbalances, and a hefty dose of praise kink. Pass if that's not your jam or you're looking for something deep, dark, or angsty.   Trigger Warning:",
