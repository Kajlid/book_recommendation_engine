  "description": "After eight years in the American Furniture Department at renowned auction house Christie’s, twenty-nine-year-old Carolyn Everett’s star is on the rise. But one bad decision leads to a huge scandal, leaving her unemployed and broken. Desperate to piece her life back together, Carolyn escapes New York City to work in a tiny antiques store in Newport, Rhode Island. Her new job takes her to a county auction, where she purchases a piece of Middle Eastern pottery for twenty dollars, on the hunch that it could be worth much more. Hoping to win back her spot in the rarefied art world, Carolyn sets out to uncover its provenance, and soon finds herself entangled with its prior owner, Marine Captain Tyler Ford, a notorious womanizer. Though they are from two different worlds, Tyler and Carolyn become increasingly obsessed with the mysterious relic, and each other, until the origin of the artifact starts to reveal Tyler’s dark past. Suddenly, what seemed like the key to Carolyn’s comeback could instead be her downfall—and the man she thought she loved may prove to be someone else entirely.Set against a vibrantly drawn backdrop of gilded Newport society and the secret, dangerous world of black market art crime, The Price of Inheritance explores one woman’s decision to gamble her greatest asset: her heart.",
