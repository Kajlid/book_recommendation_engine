  "title": "The Man I Need",
  "description": "There are things that women want, and things that women need. I know deep down, with every fiber in my body, that I need Mr. Ward.  He started out as my landscape designer, but became so much more. Now, my life is on the line while living with the devil himself. I have been torn down and broken, and I don’t think I can take anymore.  The man I need was never the one I married. No, the man I need is the one I was never supposed to have. He’s the one who showed me gentleness, kindness, and true love.  Ward would put up a fight for me at any cost. I know for a fact, I could be so much happier with him… But when I come face-to-face with reality, I’m not sure if I’m brave enough to risk it all for someone I’ve just met, even if it seems like Mr. Ward and I are a match made in heaven.",
