The football team he quarterbacks for just won their first district championship.Marc doesn't show it, but he is being haunted. Orphaned at the early age of two, he has ghostly memories of a past that makes his flawless model life feel out of place. And then there are the illusive dreams. Visions of someone that relentlessly possess his nights. What does it all mean? Where will it all lead? This time, he’s not the one that is at the top of the game.This is the fifth and final installment in the Crescent Bound series. My intention wasn't to fully duplicate Crescent Bound, but to truly bring you Marc’s story. Hopefully, you've already read Crescent Bound. And yes, there will be magick, the elements, and entirely new scenes... I hope you enjoy.",
