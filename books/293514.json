  "description": "In this rousing conclusion to The Saga of Roland Inness, King Richard has called up Roland and the legendary Invalid Company to serve in his grinding war against King Philip of France. It's a conflict where brutal mercenaries ravage the land and take no prisoners and where a king's favour is for sale. As Roland leads the Invalid Company into harm's way, his old enemy buys his way out of exile and threatens all that Roland holds dear back in England. Can Roland and the Invalids survive the war in France with their reputations intact? It's A Question of Honour!",
