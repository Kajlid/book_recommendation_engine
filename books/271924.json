  "description": "Arestella, a nymph unlike any other, is cast out at seventeen from the only home she’s ever known—a tribe of barbaric centaurs. Alone in the world for the first time - armed only with a bow of her own making, the skills and knowledge acquired from the willows and watching the fighters - she must find her father and a place where she’s accepted. Yet the only clue she has is the name of the city her father’s from. However, before she can search for him, someone needs her help. She goes to The Forgotten Castle and meets a handsome, roguish elf on a mission of vengeance. Together they set out to complete her part in his quest before she can proceed with her own, facing a hostile world she’s been defensively hidden from. Vagabonds, goblins, and a mist shrouding certain death are only part of the dangers she faces. Can a sheltered, innocent nymph hope to survive a perilous journey and find what she’s looking for?",
