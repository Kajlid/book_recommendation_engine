  "description": "Reluctant first-time cop is forced to embrace his darkest desires...During the day, I do everything expected of me. I have a smart flat, new car and a string of girlfriends calling. They tell me I’m the perfect gent. I’m a strong policeman who upholds the law, using force where necessary. Even handcuffs. But at night, I dream about those cuffs around my own wrists.I don’t want to, but I dream about men.When I visit the confession box, the priest says I’m a serious case and have to learn my lesson. But his rules are so hard!All I can do is submit to his regime. Using my body like this is so wrong.But so good!",
