No one knows that better than Candace Chang.After being widowed with three young children to care for, it was all she could do to keep her household functioning, and herself in one piece. In the two years since her husband’s death, never once has she considered getting remarried. Candace is fine with her books, her tea, and her memories, despite her friends’ and family’s growing concern.When handsome, twenty-six year old cop, Mason Ledger, buys the house next door, Candace is quickly reminded of just how alone she is. Her kids are gone with grandma for the summer, and other than her attempts at restarting the career she abandoned to become a wife and mother, she's got nothing but spare time. What starts off as friendly neighbors simply sharing a fence line, takes no time to evolve into an attraction neither expected. Before she knows it, Candace is feeling more than just a need for distraction. The problem is, Mason sees a future between the two of them, and Candace is trying desperately to keep things casual.Can Candace keep her meddling family at bay while she figures out this unexpected romantic conundrum? Will this almost-cougar and her young neighbor find some sort of middle ground? Or will Candace discover that love is every bit as sweet the second time around?",
