Ashley Stockingdale, the charming but always-in-over-her-head patent attorney from What a Girl Wants , has finally found the man she wants to marry. But after nine months of dating, it seems her commitment-phobe boyfriend will never use the \"M\" word. And just when she thinks she's got it all together, Ashley is having trouble knowing where to put it. A massive remodeling project, a hyperactive puppy, and an ex-boyfriend who wants to be part of her life again all keep Ashley's world spinning.
