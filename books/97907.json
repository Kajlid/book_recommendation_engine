  "title": "Caught On The Equator; Finding The Fire Within",
  "description": "In 1983, Heather Shreve---an American student who struggled against the odds to see Africa---arrives on the heels of the 1982 Coup Attempt unaware that it has set up the perfect storm for corruption at the highest levels. Based on a true story, Caught on the Equator is an amazing, and often dangerous, trek through East Africa in 1983 seen through the eyes of a nineteen-year-old who is caught in the savage beauty but also in a savage business--the illegal ivory trade.Targeted, and eventually kidnapped, Heather is arrested by rogue police in an off-the-grid jail as political fallout from what really is tearing Kenya apart at zero degrees latitude, appalling corruption and duplicitous conduct.Authentic, moving, and beautifully written, this story shows us that becoming who we were meant to be is the essence of life, an often adversity is the source of true strength.",
