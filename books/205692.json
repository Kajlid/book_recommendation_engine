  "description": "The Year is 2190. China has once again become a  world unto itself and this time its only boundary  is space . . . The world is City Earth, ruled by  the Seven, China's new kings. Beautiful, controlled,  sensual, this high-tech society is rushing toward  war between the forces of West and East, between  the rebels who hunger for change and the overlords  who demand stability, between the very powers of  darkness and light. It will be an era of violent  conflagration destined to expose the basest elements  of human nature . . . and the highest dreams. An  epic that draws us into an alternative world so  real, so complete that we become denizens of the new  Middle Kingdom, touched by longings we never  imagined. . . driven by forces as ancient as man's first  breath. Not since Asminov's  Foundation books and Herbert's Dune  has there been such a majestic and powerful  vision of a believable other world. . . seductive,  chilling, unforge",
