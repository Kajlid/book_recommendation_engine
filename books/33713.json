  "description": "The wildfire success of THE BRAVE THE BOLD team-ups made it a showcase for characters deserving of wider recognition and artists showcasing their work to readers. It gave birth to characters such as the Viking Prince and Silent Knight, and later to the Justice League of America and Silver Age Hawkman. In this first volume of eight stories from 1963- 1965, the bravest of heroes meet, often for the first time, with the boldest of compatriots.",
