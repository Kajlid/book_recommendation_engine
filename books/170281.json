  "description": "What’s worse than a bully? A bully who’s the hottest guy in school.  Wade Johnson is a fucking jerk. A pretty boy quarterback who thinks he can get away with anything. He started calling me a “queer” freshman year, and his football player goons have been making my life hell ever since.  But now Wade’s about to lose everything: his place on the team, his cheerleader girlfriend, his college scholarship. His whole golden boy jock status. And I’m the only one who can save his ass.  Wade needs my help. And he says he’ll do anything to get it.  It’s time to find out just how far he’ll go to settle the score.",
