  "description": "She’s angry that I left. I’m angry that I died. It’s the trouble with our two lives: we don’t only have one past to work through, but two. Double the pain, twice the betrayal. A million times the tragedy.***The Moon is the story of Merlin and Nimue from the New Camelot trilogy. It’s recommended that you read the trilogy first, as there are American King spoilers in The Moon.***",
