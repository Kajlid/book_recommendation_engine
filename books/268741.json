  "description": "Long before “going green” was mainstream, Dr. Seuss's Lorax spoke for the trees and warned of the dangers of disrespecting the environment.In this cautionary rhyming tale, we learn of the Once-ler, who came across a valley of Truffula Trees and Brown Bar-ba-loots (“frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits as they played in the shade and ate Truffula Fruits”), and how his harvesting of the tufted trees changed the landscape forever.The Lorax and his classic tale have educated a generations of young readers not only about the importance of seeing the beauty in the world around us, but also about our responsibility to protect it. It is a story beloved by readers young and old alike, which inspires individual responsibility and courage to tackle the challenges that life may bring.\nDr. Seuss\n and his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, have been delighting young children and helping them learn to read for over fifty years. Creator of the wonderfully anarchic 'Cat in the Hat', and ranked among the world's top children's authors, Dr. Seuss is a global best-seller, with nearly half a billion books sold worldwide.",
