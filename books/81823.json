  "description": "It's so easy to be a bad boy when you no longer have to be good. Sebastian Behr used to be a good boy. Hot shot, high flying call centre executive, he had a little piece of respect, a huge paycheck, beautiful wife, high-end cars, and a big house. The only things left to get were a couple of nice kids and that happy coast to a comfortable retirement. Nothing was supposed to get in his way. Instead, his wife got a boyfriend, his job got downsized and he's taken in some new roommates. And now, with nothing else to do, it's all boobs, booze, and rejection letters. Sebastian knows what it takes to be good, but does he have what it really takes to be bad? Ever wonder what a man thinks when he picks a woman out of a crowd and convinces her to sleep with him? Ever wonder what he thinks about himself when he does it? Sebastian Behr can tell you. Riotously funny, refreshingly honest, and deceptively insightful, Ten Toes Down is a spirited personal odyssey that follows Sebastian Behr as he searches for his place in the world in the wake of an unexpected divorce, countless hangovers and endless available women. Venturing boldly into the heart of the contemporary male, Ten Toes Down wallows just long enough in the libidinous antics and bad boy manners of Sebastianâ€™s post-divorce regression to deliver the reader a boisterous ride to the dirty side of town.",
