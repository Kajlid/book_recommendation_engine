  "description": "Broadway is undeniably a graveyard, but more often of men's hopes than men's bodies. And it is almost inconceivable that anyone could have it in for an angel. But inconceivable or not, the wealthy backer of the play was neatly skewered during dress rehersal and, with her customary flair for murder that turns eccentric, Pam North appeared abruptly on the scene. Their friend, Lieutenant Bill Weigland, found the Norths ready to help, with illogical logic and tengential suggestions, when he arrived.Thus, with unscheduled drama, the curtain rises on what is unquestioningly the Norths' most thrilling and diverting excursion into crime. The dramatis personae, in addition to those made familiar through the earlier North mysteries, are gilded people of the stage, including the glamorous young actress Alberta James. And, in the wings, alwasy ready for its cue, death waits.Containing more action than any of the previous books in the series, rich as ever in expert deduction and irresistable humor, Death On the Aisle surpasses anything the skillful Lockridges have yet done. The intimate knowledge of Broadway which Richard Lockridge has gained as a veteran drama critic adds conviction and color to this story of murder in the theatre.",
