  "description": "From debut author, Daniele Rae, comes a new Dark Romance that is part of BLAIRE’S WORLD. Anita Gray is proud to announce that Daniele has written a BLAIRE original character!   About DEMETRIUS:   There are many different versions of beauty; an exquisite painting, meaningful lines in a melancholy song, gazing at a fire blazed sky just after the sun has set.  I find beauty in the crimson hue of blood, the last breath from suffocating lungs, anguish filled eyes losing their life.  I find beauty in death…and Olivia.  She’s my sanctuary, the warmth to my cold heart – and someone dared to take her.  Even though there are quiet whispers about me, Olivia has never seen my rendition of beauty. Now, it's time she witnesses the truth. I’ll paint a masterpiece with that familiar shade of red. Bodies will drop, and all of France will burn until I have my Olivia back.  No one is safe until I find her.",
