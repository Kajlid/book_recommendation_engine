  "description": "He Loved Women - But He Loved His Master More! He explains his feelings this \"Mistress gave me to him. She wanted to teach me a lesson, but when Master was done with me, I didn't want to go back. I forgot to breathe when he entered the room. He was tall, well built with rippling muscles under his tight, black t-shirt. The sizable bulge in his black jeans hinted that he was well endowed, or else he was packing. His skin was dark, a natural dark, not one created in a tanning booth. His close-cropped, brown hair was barely an inch long and stood up like the bristles of a brush. His jaw was strong, and his cheekbones sharp. He radiated danger as he removed his leather jacket and walked in a circle around me, exposed before this stranger.\"",
