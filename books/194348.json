  "description": "When she ran, she didn’t think he’d follow…  Pack princess Alyssa Clare was trying to come up with ways to get out of her arranged mating to alpha wolf Reece O’Shea—until she meets the powerful male. After getting to know him, mating doesn’t seem like such a bad idea anymore. But when he makes it clear she’s just a business arrangement for him and his pack, she calls off the mating and heads south to stay with a friend to lick her wounds in private.  But he’s not willing to let her go without a fight.  Reece can’t let Alyssa go, not when he’s completely fallen for the sweet, sexy female. He doesn’t care about the arranged mating deal, he just wants her and has no idea why she ran. To win her back he infiltrates another alpha’s territory, knowing it could mean his death. Luckily Grant Kincaid allows him in his domain—as long as Alyssa is okay with it. Convincing her that she’s all he wants is a bigger challenge than he imagined. But he’s not giving up, because he knows she’s the one he’s meant to be with forever.   NOVELLA  Author all novellas in the series can easily be read as individual titles.
