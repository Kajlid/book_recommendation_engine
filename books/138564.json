  "title": "A Darker Shade of Pale: A Backdrop to Bob Dylan",
  "description": "With the Beatles, Bob Dylan is one of the most talented performers to emerge from the sixties. For more than twenty years Dylan has been a spokesman for the young--a representative of a generation and a way of life. While Dylan's originality is his strength, his art has roots in Amercan folk, country and pop music. In this exciting new book, Wilfrid Mellers, author of the acclaimed study of the Beatles, Twilight of the Gods, examines Dylan's musical heritage, from the British folk ballads that influenced his lyrics to the American folk-singers who influence his music. Mellers looks at how Dylan's vocal and instrumental style was affected by such greats as the Carter family, Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, Elvis Presley and Woody Guthrie. He goes on to consider what Dylan did with this musical legacy, and how he made these musical forms his own.Mellers offers illuminating commentary on virtually every song recorded by Dylan, and shows why his individual contribution has spoken so powerfully to millions of people.",
