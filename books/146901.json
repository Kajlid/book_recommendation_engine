  "description": "Novel (72,000 words)Genre(s): Contemporary, Gay, Sports, EroticaDorian has been working his whole life to make the Olympic gymnastics team and win that elusive all-around gold medal. Just because he's the youngest, shortest and not the most socially savvy team member shouldn't warrant all the teasing—bullying, really—he has to endure, especially from Jules Gardner, the former Olympic bronze medalist and current teammate. He’s had a crush on Jules for years, but Dorian isn’t going to let Jules get in the way of his goals, no matter what.Jules, on the other hand, loves to mess with Dorian’s head. It’s fun, like a cat playing with a mouse. Seducing him is even more entertaining. But Jules’ personal coach, Coach Harper, doesn’t believe in pulling any punches when it comes to Jules winning. When Coach Harper begins pushing Jules past the boundaries of good sportsmanship, Dorian realizes something more sinister is going on. And Dorian is the only one who can rescue Jules’ gymnastic career from utter destruction. (M/M - For content labels and excerpt, see details on publisher's site.)",
