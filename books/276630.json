  "description": "The cease-fire between Earth and Mars has failed. Caught in a deadly missile strike, Major Tor Savan and the crew of the Orion IV put their lives on the line, attempting to save as many people as possible as they defend the Earth.  But as the dust settles after the attack, it becomes clear that human lives were not the only casualties. The laboratories that manufacture omegas’ hormonal suppressants have been destroyed, which means that over the course of the next three months, every single omega on the planet will be forced to go through a heat.  Unwilling to abandon his fellow soldiers to twelve hours of agony, and with a level of knowledge about the heats that few alphas could match, Tor puts together a plan to help them through it – a plan so risky and unlawful that it could end not only his career, but also destroy the reputations of every single person involved in the reckless scheme.  But only a fool expects such daring plans to go smoothly, and when Azure, Tor’s omega lover, gets dragged into the middle of the storm, Tor finds himself having to re-evaluate every social custom and moral value he believes in.  Note: It is recommended that you read Hurricane (The Elements Book 1) before reading Deluge.",
