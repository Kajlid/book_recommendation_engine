  "description": "Two perennial classics--William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and the Broadway musical  West Side Story --in a single volume!The tragedy of love thwarted by fate has always intrigued writers.  In the sixteenth century, William Shakespeare took this theme and fashioned one of the world's great Romeo And Juliet . In our own time, Shakespeare's drama has been used as a basis for the overwhelmingly successful musical play West Side Story . Though one of these works is set among the nobility of Verona, and the other among immigrant families of New York's West Side, both tell the story of the plight of young star-crossed lovers.",
