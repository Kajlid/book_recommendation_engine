  "description": "I know the feeling.  The competition is ferocious, the readers are the leaders . It’s a grim time to be an author , but it’s also the perfect time. I am here to tell that your dream is possible … if you work hard and never give up . To build these, you need time, determination, and self-discipline. Perhaps you already are a storyteller . Been there, done that. This book is for you.  For a person with a huge dream , like you and me, there is no writer’s block . For us there is fatigue, frustration, hopefulness & disappointment. Make no mistake, the universe will return what you give.",
