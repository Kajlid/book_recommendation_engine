  "title": "If Not Now, When?: Writings in Defense of Europe",
  "description": "This book is an assorted collection of articles and essays written between 2015 and 2018. They cover themes of urbanization, identity, diversity, and the future of Western civilization.The author believes that the supporters of open borders have turned the West, its territories and its nations, into a Ponzi scheme. The scheme requires a continuous flow of goods and people from elsewhere in the world, the sources, to Western nations, the sinks. In so doing, the West has absorbed the brightest minds it could not produce itself. It has employed a foreign-born labor force to fuel its low-cost industries because white women, keen on luxury lifestyles, have failed to produce the babies needed to populate the underclasses. And letâ€™s not ignore the vast resources procured through a colonial legacy of theft and oppression, both in the past and in the present. In short, immigration to the West is a scam.",
