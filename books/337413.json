  "title": "The Mevrouw Who Saved Manhattan: A Novel of New Amsterdam",
  "description": "When Mevrouw Jackie Lambert opens her New Amsterdam tavern in 1626, she jumps aboard a madcap ride through New York history. With a razor-sharp tongue and the tastiest beer on either side of the Atlantic, Jackie spurs the tiny Manhattan settlement toward a head-on collision with the tyrannical Dutchmen who rule it. Poison, blackmail, murder, all are fair game as she fends off threats to the family she yearned for growing up as an orphan. And when pegleg Peter Stuyvesant would rather destroy the town than surrender his honor, Jackie must take history into her own hands or lose everything she has spent a lifetime building. “A very authentic ring … like etchings of Everybodies by van Eyck.” – Charles Wendell, Ph.D., President of the New Netherland Institute.",
