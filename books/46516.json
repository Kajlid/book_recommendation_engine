Of course she thinks it’s crazy but who wouldn’t. Lily also learns that her grandmother is a witch and she may well be one too. She befriends a feisty little faerie who tags along with Lily on her journey. The two come across thieving dwarves, murderous centaurs and mysterious dragonfolk that live in a hidden colony on one of Evandra’s many mountains. It’s because of her quest that she find out who she is truly meant to be and how exceptionally mystical Evandra actually is. Will she survive her quest? Does she have enough courage to kill the Queen? The fate of pretty much everything lies in Lily’s hands…",
