  "description": "The High Plains of Wyoming's open range are a chance for men to make a killing--or just to kill. Rourke, a bounty hunter with a trail of graves and gunfights behind him, is drawn into a high-stakes game where the greedy and powerful want to exploit the West for their own gain, regardless of the rules. In a time and place where death and violence are as much a part of life as untamed herds of buffalo and the wild freedom of the raging winds, Rourke has to choose between drifting through life and taking a stand, knowing it could be his last. Battling unseen enemies as well as audacious rustlers, Rourke rides with a blacksmith whose best years are long past him, and Caledonia MacReynolds --a girl as free and wild as the Wyoming sunsets--to stand up against the odds. As the dark side of progress spills greed across the Plains, drifters and grifters must make their choices, and take their stands. As the final showdown nears, Rourke must decide which friends are still true, which ones are betraying him, and who--if anyone--can be trusted. The powerful forces of change spreading from the East meet the free spirits of the West in a confrontation that forces Cal and Rourke to stand tall and shoot straight.",
