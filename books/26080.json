  "title": "From The Pen Of An Aquarian: Love, hope and darker moments",
  "description": "'From the Pen of an Aquarian', is selection of poems that have been written based on personal experiences. As the cover indicates, there is love, hope and darker moments. These poems express the many and varied emotions love can deliver in our human form. There is love for the sea and the unrivaled contentment single handed sailing can bring. Hope is visited in the survival of a Twin Flame relationship, with all of its twists and turns and eventual outcome. Conquering alcohol and bouts of debilitating depression, bring out those darker moments. Should the reader find that association, between the verse and their own journey in life, then I would feel I had accomplished something.",
