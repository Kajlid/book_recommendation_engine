  "description": "In the words of her schoolmaster, Kiarra is an erratic disaster. In the well-ordered and balanced society of the kingdom of Megreria, she is a failure. Every person in Megreria has an occupation in a specific House and a designated Soul Match.  Not Kiarra. She has delayed her exams until the last allowable minute, but her mind refuses to focus on one House. When she meets one man from each of the five Houses, her inability to choose extends to her heart. The rules demand she choose though, one House and one man.  What happens when she feels drawn to all five Houses and all five men who have captured her attention, and possibly her heart? Will she be doomed to a life of a Commoner? Will society and the kingdom shun her? Or have the Fates already chosen her destiny?  ***A reverse harem fantasy.",
