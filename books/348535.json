  "description": "\"It's perhaps revealing that believe and na√Øve should rhyme so well...\"The fourth volume in the bestselling 50 Reasons series finds Mark about to embark on the project of a lifetime, the purchase of a hilltop gite in a remote French village with partner Tom.But with shady dealings making the purchase unexpectedly complex, Mark finds himself with time on his hands - time to consider not only if this is the right project but whether Tom is the right man.A chance meeting with a seductive Latino threatens to destroy every other relationship Mark holds dear, and as he navigates a seemingly endless ocean of untruths, Mark is forced to question whether any worthwhile destination remains.Better Than Easy combines a tense tale of betrayal and a warming exploration of the mix of courage and naivety required if we are to choose love and happiness - if we are to continue to believe against seemingly impossible odds.",
