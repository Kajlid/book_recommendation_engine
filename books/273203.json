  "description": "“One of our great visionaries.” —Dr. Wayne W. Dyer“A rare blend of scientist, visionary, and scholar. ” —Deepak ChopraA scholar and New York Times –bestselling author shares his shocking theory of an ancient language — found in the decoded elements of our DNA—that shines new light on the mysteries of existence.What would it mean to discover an ancient language—a literal message—hidden within the DNA of life itself? What we once believed of our past is about to change. A coded message has been found within the molecules of life, deep within the DNA in each cell of our bodies. Through a remarkable discovery linking Biblical alphabets to our genetic code, the “language of life” may now be read as the ancient letters of a timeless message. Regardless of race, religion, heritage, or lifestyle, the message is the same in each cell of every woman, child, and man, past and present. Sharing all-new, fascinating research, Gregg Braden discusses the life-changing discovery that led him from a successful career in the aerospace and defense industries to an extensive 12-year study of the most sacred and honored traditions of humankind.",
