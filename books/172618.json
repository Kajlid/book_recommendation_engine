  "description": "Stand alone. Not a cliff-hanger. HEA. M/F, Mild D/s themes.Successful, sophisticated, 36 year old, Chase Tanner is a Dom who has everything…except love. When he meets the woman of his dreams - a submissive beauty who’d rather be alone than with the wrong man - Chase knows convincing her that he’s the “right” one, won’t be easy. It’s the courtship of his life—and he’ll have to put his life on the line to protect her.“You’re just not good enough, Kali.” Her ex-husband’s hurtful words echoed in Kali Benson’s memory as she moved to small-town Washington State to rebuild her life. It hasn’t been easy, but finally at 39, she’s happy, self-sufficient, and emotionally armored. But her strength and resolve are tested when a sweet-talking hunk, who drives an old Dodge truck and makes her feel nineteen again, comes to town.",
