  "description": "The year is 2243. Mankind has reached  for the stars, creating colonies on Titan  and the cold, distant Nereid. Where  man goes, war follows, and now two  factions warring on Earth have taken  their cultural and religious war into space  in hopes of dominating Earth’s global  government, the Assembly.   On one side stands the Moral League,  a loose grouping of religious nations and moral conservatives whose aim is to  destroy the Freedom Alliance,  a group of progressive nations who they  claim are leading the human race  towards destruction. Rejected by his family for his  homosexuality, Samuel Walden finds  himself joining the Alliance’s Space Force.  Posted to the fleet’s flagship, the  Northampton, Sam meets the ship’s  crew officer, Major Tom Averay, and the  two embark on a relationship that will  change their lives. Love, war, humanity, friendship, sacrifice  and death weave through this action-packed  romantic novel. Will Sam and Tom work out  their feelings in the midst of darkness and  uncertainty? Will the Alliance survive against  crushing odds to preserve the human rights  it stands for?",
