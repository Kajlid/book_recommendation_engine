Everything has been prepared for the town’s annual tradition—a lottery in which every family must participate, and no one wants to win.  “The Lottery” stands out as one of the most famous short stories in American literary history. Originally published in The New Yorker, the author immediately began receiving letters from readers who demanded an explanation of the story’s meaning. “The Lottery” has been adapted for stage, television, radio and film.",
