  "description": "Oscar winner Meridan Marks has just learned how disapproving critics can be when she takes the leap from America's most beloved actress to burgeoning director. When her first attempt to direct and lead fails miserably, Meridan concocts a duplicitous scheme to deflect a storm of bad press. Exploiting an ardent fan as a stalker, the story is \"leaked,\" and Meridan finds herself once again in the adoring and sympathetic arms of her fans and public instead of being harangued by critics. The press grabs hold of Meridan Marks's \"stalking\" and projects a far more ominous picture of reality, setting in motion a maelstrom that transcends her intentions. When details of her peril reach the ears of Dallas food critic Lynden Hatcher, they hit home with powerful emotional force. Having outrun her past for more than a decade, Lynden is horrified to recognize the demons of her past threatening Meridan's present. Her certainty of the danger in store for the actress leads Lynden to a moral precipice: In preserving herself, she could jeopardize another. In order to garner the strength and conviction it will take to offer her help, Lynden sifts through the annals of her past, when she managed to escape the machinations of the two nefarious men who have set Meridan Marks in their sights.",
