  "description": "She may be an ordinary girl, but she's the key to saving them all... Quincy Harris's life is anything but charmed. She's a fifteen-year-old living in a state-run children's home, her mother is lost in a probably permanent coma, and her unique Talent still hasn't surfaced like everybody else's has. But when she receives news that an anonymous donor has paid her way into the prestigious Oakley Academy, Quincy must give everything she thought she knew a second glance. Even a beloved family heirloom-a small metal key of her mother's-is more than what it seems, possessing the power to open any door, including the portal between the different timelines in her universe. Quincy soon learns that she-and her key-are at Oakley for a very specific reason: her timeline is in danger of disintegrating, and she's the only one who can stop it. Now, with the help of a cranky talking raven, Quincy must embark on a journey to save time itself-without erasing anything, or anyone, in the process.",
