  "description": "“Should I save her?” asked four year-old Brady. “No one can save her, sweetheart,” I answered. “Only she can save herself.” My daughter, Jaime, who thought she was going to be spared from her methamphetamine addiction because she gave birth to a child and would devote her life to him; was back on drugs. We can fool ourselves into thinking we have our lives well planned out. It was that way for me, being a product of the 1950’s. I’d go to college, meet my prince, marry, have children and live happily ever after. Losing my daughter to addiction and raising her young son turned my world upside down. This is the story about one family's devastating consequences and triumphant recovery.",
