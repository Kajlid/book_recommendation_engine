He is Faunos Phinneas Aeson, still dangerously young -- and he has one the witchfinders of Vayal, who are charged with the hunting of those like himself.Twenty years, Faunos has hidden and learned, until the gods of sea, storm and earth destroy Zeheft --and one night destiny brings Vayal's young witchfinder to the camps of the water gypsies, where a youth like Faunos should never have been. Galen lies dying; the City of the Sun is celebrating the coming of age of Soran -- althlete, hunter, beautiful as the night, Vayal's heir and greatest witchfinder ...The Empire of the Atlantan has one slender chance to survive, and its struggle will begin on this night.",
