  "description": "It’s been six years since I escaped the horror I called life. I was raised in a cult that had forced me to marry a sadistic and evil man. It was absolute hell, but I was finally given a second chance. I’ve had time to heal and finally find myself, but the last thing I ever wanted or expected was to fall in love. I figured it wasn’t in the cards for me and you can’t miss something you’ve never had or experienced. But the second I met Konrad, he owned my heart. It was as if I learned to breathe for the very first time. He came into my life, pushed my barriers, and made it known that I was his. With him, I found my home, my everything.Until my ex-husband decided that he wanted me back.",
