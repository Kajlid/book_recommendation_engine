  "title": "Growing Up Barefoot in the South: Essays from a Southern Writer",
  "description": "Most everyone has fond remembrances of growing up whether it be in a large city, on a farm or in a small town. Barbara Deming takes the reader to a time and place in the South when life was simple, to small towns where the only rule of law was that everyone knew what you were doing—just the place for a tomboy who loved to get into mischief as well as climb mulberry trees to write. In Growing Up Barefoot in the South, take a trip back to those “good old days” when love for family, church and country, and a good day’s work for a good day’s pay, were part of the values learned.",
