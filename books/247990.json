  "description": "WE ARE OUR ANCESTORSâ€™ KEEPERS is the Living Legacy of our Ancestors. We are the gatekeepers for the Black Children that are born into a world of confusion and disarray. The sole purpose of this book is to correct the shambles left behind by those who hid in the shadows and controlled the many stifled voices with the power of money and greed. It allows Black People the opportunity to bridge the gap of the continents due to the African Diaspora. Black people are one. Whether you are of Latin descent, Caribbean, or Native, your duty is to carry the torch. As our legacies are watched over by our Ancestors, their stories will forever live on as they pierce the ears of our Black youth with hope, unity, and the realization of our higher selves, which is nothing shorter or greater than Black Excellence.",
