  "description": "He'd been mine—until I made the biggest mistake of my life. I thought if I put enough time and distance between us, my heart could forget him. I thought wrong. Drake Foster owns my heart, my entire being. He always will. As the pieces of what happened to us begin to fall into place, I realize our relationship had been sabotaged. We'd​ been pawn​s​ in a game neither of us knew we were playing, and our relationship was the​ ​price we paid. Now, we must find our way together ​before it's too late.",
