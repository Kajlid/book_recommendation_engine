Their only hope lies in a man that lives in a different world- the present.Jack O'Shea, the crown prince of Gammalon takes refuge in the present world upon directions by the General of the Gammalonian Army as they seek to reinforce soldiers and weapons after a gruesome battle with the Dark Vale army. Stuck in the present world for eighteen years, he has never spoken of his heritage to his children. So when he is recalled to save Gammalon, he least expects that his four children will be journeying with him to the World of Spassenia. As they cross the gates of dimensions, the children enter a world unlike they've ever known-one where magic and power prevail over all who live in it. With perils at every turn they take, they must seek the alliance of the mythical and fabled shadow warriors of the Tsez Xian to win the war against Dravidor. But do they even exist?Available now at:amazon- http://www.amazon.com/Dynasty-OShea-T...barnes & noble: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dynas...smashwords: https://www.smashwords.com/books/view...",
