The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (I. S. I. L.) breaks into the airport in a spectacular fashion and kills the passengers after a collapse of Lebanon. Dunya manages to escape with the help of a delightful teen girl. Her friend finds out that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (I. S. I. L.) is holding some hostages from the airport in Damascus, Syria. Now Dunya and her new friends must go to Damascus to find out if her brother Hakeem is a hostage in Syria. Dunya meets a lonely fighter who wants to leave the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (I. S. I. L.) after a disappointing few loathsome years. He offers to help Dunya on her quest. Dunya and her friends debate whether trusting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (I. S. I. L.) member is a good idea. Dunya will take a few risks in search of her brother Hakeem. A new problem leads to a change in her plans.",
