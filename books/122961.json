  "description": "I've hated spoiled, cocky Patrick Whitt since the first time I saw him at football camp when we were kids.Once we made it to the NFL, of course, he landed on the LA Royals, the biggest rivals of my team, the Denver Rush. Everything about him rubs me the wrong way...until one unexpected night, we happen to rub each other the right way, and suddenly I can't get enough of him.And Patrick can't get enough of me either.I'm his secret, and he's mine, stealing moments together where he comes undone for me.There's more to Patrick than I thought, and now one thing is clear to me.Despite all of the obstacles in our way, Patrick Whitt is mine. I don't know what it is about Malik Tucker that gets under my skin, but he irritates the hell out of me. Maybe it's that he was drafted instead of me to my dream NFL team, the Denver Rush. Or maybe it's that he's a force to be reckoned with on the field and adored by fans and his family off the field. He seems to be living the perfect life while I live the perfect lie.And then we have a chance encounter that changes everything.We keep it professional on the field, but off the field, there's all kinds of illegal contact happening between us. Every time we're together, I'm drawn in deeper, intoxicated by the way Malik makes me feel, the things we do to each other in the bedroom.At some point, we're going to have to let go, but I'm not sure I'll be able to.",
