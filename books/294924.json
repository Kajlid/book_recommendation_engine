  "description": "The year is 2230 and young Violet MacRae is already obsolete. In a world where war is a distant memory and only brilliant minds are valued, she's emerging into adulthood with more brawn than brains and a hell of a temper. That might come in handy though as someone's coming to kill her.Violet will discover that her peaceful world is more fragile than anyone thought, and only an underground of outcasts like her maintain the balance. She'll enter a tangled web of secrets and slaughter, technology and genetics gone insane, super-advanced spycraft and no shortage of ultra-violence. It should suit her just fine, if she can survive.Valhalla is a hard science fiction novel that blends epic action and unparalleled vision into a future as beautiful as it is brutal.",
