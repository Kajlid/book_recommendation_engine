  "description": "Who stole our summer? We didn't ask to be chosen to defeat ruthless, terrifying, part-human forces who manipulate climate change to destroy our planet. Jenny knows she has some magical powers, but they are quite quirky. Branch knows he has lots of tech smarts, but he's just a kid, and this is a treacherous game simulation. Jenny's jokes and Branch's boasts help them battle for balance as they fight to save their parents. Are they already too late? Who should they trust? What will their score be? Will this be Earth's final round?",
