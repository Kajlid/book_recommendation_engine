  "description": "\"Of all the forms of water the tiny six-pointed crystals of ice called snow are incomparably the most beautiful and varied.\" — Wilson Bentley (1865–1931)Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt. Why would anyone want to photograph it? But from the time he was a small boy, Wilson Bentley thinks of the icy crystals as small miracles, and he determines that one day his camera will capture for others their extraordinary beauty.Often misunderstood in his time, Wilson Bentley took pictures that even today reveal two important truths about snowflakes: first, that no two are alike, and second, that each one is startlingly beautiful. His story, gracefully told by Jacqueline Briggs Martin and brought to life in Mary Azarian's lovely woodcuts, gives children insight into a soul who had not only a scientist's vision and perseverance, but a clear passion for the wonders of nature.Snowflake Bentley won the 1999 Caldecott Medal.Edition ISBN: 9780395861622Edition MSRP: $16⁰⁰ USD",
