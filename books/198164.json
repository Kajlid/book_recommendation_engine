  "description": "This addition to the series starts before Book 1 and ends after Book 3.For Gerry Sanders, a python shifter and director at the Supernatural Enforcers Agency, work was the most important thing in his life. Right up until an adorable little squirrel shifter runs right into his life equipped with mistletoe and a singing reindeer sweater. He wants her, his beast wants her more. But there’s one problem – other than the huge age gap and the fact that he is technically her boss – he’s married. He’s stuck in an arranged marriage to a python shifter who can’t stand him. But with an expiration date on their unhappily married life, can he hold onto his squirrel shifter before she realizes that she can do better than a miserable, middle-aged snake shifter?  While the SEA encounters cases of revenge killings, and Gerry deals with his wife and a crazy brother-in-law, can he solve the cases before someone decides to take vengeance on him and he loses his mate for good?  And caution! This does contain swearing (there’s a lot of use of the f word!), as well as scenes of a sexual nature with m/f interaction intended for mature readers 8+.",
