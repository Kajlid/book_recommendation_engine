  "description": "NaomiI can't understand why – out of the four hockey players I'm sharing a house with this semester – Finn Howard's the one who catches my eye.The guy never smiles. He doesn't say much and disapproves plenty.But, something about him feels familiar. Something about him feels safe.I'm not falling for Finn, I'm just curious. Could I make him smile? It wouldn't hurt to try. I love a good challenge. And who knows, maybe it'll distract me from pining over a guy I meet online.FinnI don't get nervous unless I'm on the ice. So why does my chest feel tight whenever Naomi Lewis looks in my direction?She's witty, kind, and happy. How is someone that happy all the time?If her sunny disposition isn't enough to distract me, the fact that her voice sounds exactly like the streamer I anonymously moderate for will.If Naomi is her, she's in for a huge disappointment. I'm not the guy she thinks I am...not anymore, at least. And for that reason alone, I should stay away from her. I should stop trying to get closer. I should stop wanting her because she fell for someone else. Someone I will never be again.__Sunny Disposition is a slow burn, hidden identity romance featuring a grumpy, amnesic hockey player and sunshine cozy game streamer.",
