  "description": "Will a first love get a second chance? \n\n \n Zane Cates has fallen in love twice--once with flying, and once with Tori Rollins, the girl who stole his heart in high school. For a brief, shining moment, their future looked bright. Then the offer of a place at the Air Force Academy got between Zane and his beautiful young wife, and he found his marriage over as abruptly as a wave washing back to sea. After taking comfort in the wide open skies, he's ready to return to the sunlit beach town of Barefoot William--and the woman he never wanted to leave behind. Starting over with Tori is the plan--if only his stubborn ex will have him . . .A vagabond childhood left Tori shy and withdrawn, but after her family arrived in the pretty resort town, she made the first real friend she ever had--Zane. Opening up to him was a risk she didn't regret taking, but she never looked back once she decided to end their brief marriage. Seeing him again now is a startling shock--and an irresistible temptation. Can she let him back into her life--and finally find joy in their love?",
