  "description": "Individuals from Vastly Different Political Perspectives Agree That There Is a Crisis in EducationEducation is the foundation of every nation's success or failure; it produces upstanding citizens, lifts people out of poverty, and catalyzes change. Crisis in the Classroom is full of captivating, insightful essays by renowned Civil Rights attorney Ben Crump; neurosurgeon and former Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Dr. Ben Carson; and serial entrepreneur and media personality Armstrong Williams that expose the harsh realities of the current state of education in the United States and its repercussions on underserved and marginalized communities. Crisis in the Classroom presents the unvarnished realities of poor educational outcomes, a topic that is frequently missing from the headlines, and how these have led communities and generations of future leaders to descend into poverty and devastation.  Crisis in the Classroom demonstrates that when the education of our children is jeopardized, so are our families, communities, and nation.  Despite the grim realities depicted in Crisis in the Classroom , the authors show us that faith and unity, paired with an apolitical, solution-based approached to the education crisis, can provide hope for a brighter future.",
