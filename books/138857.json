  "description": "I’d always dreamed of my wedding day. But not like this. Not looking into the eyes of the man who betrayed me.But when my nephew’s guardianship is contested, I decide I’ll do whatever it takes to keep him in Rose Hill. Even if it means marrying the enemy.Rhys Dupris.A man who is secretive, broody, and completely infuriating. A man whose work takes him away for weeks on end and brings him back covered in mysterious bruises—ones he won’t talk about. In fact, we barely talk at all.Which would be fine, except when he’s not talking, he’s staring. And the way he looks at me is borderline indecent.The tension between us has always been palpable. But living under the same roof is a dangerous temptation.I swore I would never forgive him. But that was before I knew the man behind the mask. The one who’s fierce and protective. The one who’s gentle and patient. The one who shows up for us when we need him most.He’s not at all who I thought he was.And that makes hating my husband so much harder… and loving him just a little too easy.",
