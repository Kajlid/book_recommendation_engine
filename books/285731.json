  "description": "Buried secrets never stay hidden in the South.  Olivia When you find out that your fiancé is arrested for swindling over ten million dollars from his clients, you do what any sane woman would do. You escape reality and go undercover, trading in your city-girl Louboutins for country-pumpkin cowboy boots.  It wasn’t a forever change—it was temporary. I only had to stay here until things back home got straightened out, or so I thought.  Casey  I was riding horses before I was walking, or at least that was what they told me. I always knew I would take over the family farm. It’s in my blood.  Country boy at heart, the minute I saw her dragging her luggage up the gravel driveway I knew she was out of my league.  I shouldn’t have started anything with her, because I knew she was just passing through.  I couldn’t stop it, I fell in love with her. Even though I knew, in the end, she would leave me.",
