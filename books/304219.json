One event led to another starting with moving in with her grandparents, after her father split, and ultimately being raised by her grandfather, Barry Flynn, a fun-loving Irishman.Kerrieâ€™s sophomore year was marked by a growing drug dependency. As her drug use increased in frequency, her attendance became occasional, at best. This got her placed in a rehab program, during summer break, where she found an interest in reading and her knack for writing. After graduation, she attended a writers' workshop led by retired local author Devlin Scott. A book is born and with Devlin's help, it gets published. A movie deal followed the success of the book and relocation to Los Angeles.Life is good again with the added bonus of an encounter with a hometown neighbor, which sparks good time memories and inspires a neighborhood reunion. The reunion was a great success, but events the next day and beyond threaten to unravel all Kerrie has become.",
