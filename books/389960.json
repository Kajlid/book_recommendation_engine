  "title": "A Friend for Einstein, the Smallest Stallion",
  "description": "When he came into the world, Einstein weighed less than a cat and was no taller than a cereal box. He was a miniature minature horse. Too small to run with the herd, Einstein had to look outside his world of horses to find the perfect playmate. Featuring full-color photographs of the spirited little stallion and a series of adorable creatures, this inspiring story about finding a true friend will bring joy to nature lovers of all ages. A portion of the authors' proceeds will be donated to the ASPCA's Equine Fund.",
