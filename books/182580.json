  "description": "Tensions are rising among the world’s superpowers, reaching dangerous levels not seen since the Cold War. Almost fifty bankers have been killed in less than a year – but why? As rumours abound of the USA being involved in a ‘gold conspiracy’ and Russia granting asylum to a wanted American whistleblower, international relations are in danger of falling apart. It falls to a young German journalist held hostage by the CIA and a retired SEAL to restore balance. As the two embark on the most treacherous mission of their lives, dodging bullets and uncovering secrets at every turn, every move has the potential to send the world spiralling towards war. The Third Age is a gripping, fast-paced thriller about corruption, betrayal, and the impossible search for truth.",
