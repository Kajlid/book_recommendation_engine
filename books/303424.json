  "description": "Lucifer comes as an Angel of Light, promising Enlightenment, Unbounded Love, and Divine Light to all who seek his spiritual secrets, to all who hunger for his spiritual wisdom and mystical insights. He is there to take you in his arms and teach you all things magical and grand, to inspire you with spiritual technologies and Gnostic, Kabbalistic, and Hermetic (The Emerald Tablets) practices of spiritual exaltation, self-empowerment, and about the cleansing of your Soul. He promises Enlightenment, and Eternal Life through your devotion to learning all you can about how to purify yourself and become the same Light Filled Being that he claims to be.And at the end of your life, you die a mere mortal, unenlightened, in spite of all your efforts, because no human being has ever conquered his/her own sin though his own power, though many have claimed to have done so. You are not a God, and you never will be. You are God's CREATION, and you will live and die as such. It is the Original Lie that you might become a God if you would only partake of that secret mystery school of knowledge laid out for you by this Angel of Light of Infinite Deception, only to be Tricked by the Light, again.",
