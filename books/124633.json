  "description": "In a place far away, there is a strange and frightening world of trolls and liches and other horrible creatures. Two adventurers, Ragnar and Ahmad, have found themselves mysteriously transported into this dangerous jungle world. Ragnar Olafson is a Viking who must find a way to conquer the Lich King. Ahmad Ibn Fazzat is an Arab who has literally been snatched from the jungle, but he must return because it is his destiny to help a new acquaintance, the Gryffon Master. Ragnar, aided by two dwarves, Karlo and his young apprentice, Kerr, seeks to reclaim a magical crystal sword in order to destroy the evil beings that threaten peace-loving creatures who live in the jungle. Karlo has been ordered by the Dwarf King to destroy a piece of jewelry, a necklace unusually obsessed by Queen Valona. This piece of jewelry has a haunting effect on the original owner, Traven the Fallen. Finally the companions come face to face with the greatest danger of all, the evil black dragon, Barrel. Can Ahmad and the Gryffon Riders return in time to save them? A remarkable work from five authors, Gryffon Master brings you a creative story packed with action and thrills. No doubt it will leave an incredible understanding that there is a warrior in all of us.",
