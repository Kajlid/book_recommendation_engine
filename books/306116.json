  "description": "I kept my silence for twenty years. I worked hard to become a woman everyone respects. I’ve earned my medical degree, established my practice, and did so under the scrutiny of a town that will not forget I had a baby out of wedlock. In all that time, the name of my daughter’s father has never slipped out. It wasn’t to protect him but to give her the security she deserves. I never wanted her blindsided with the same emotions I was every time she walked into a grocery store to find his face splashed on the cover of yet another magazine.Beckett Miller – the reason my heart beat under the Texas sun. And the reason I had a purpose of getting up every morning these last twenty years. I’m not surprised he composed a life without me. I always believed he could do it once he was no longer tied down.I guess that included me.What shocks me is the forbidden sense of longing that wells up inside me when we come face-to-face. I don’t know how I managed to get a word out, how I managed to blink. After all, the last day I saw him, we made plans to leave. I was just left behind.He loved me – or so he said. I spent years thinking this gorgeous, tattooed rock god was a monster. The problem is, I just found out he isn’t. But there’s one that threatens my family. And I’ll have to confront it because my daughter needs her dad. Now that he knows.",
