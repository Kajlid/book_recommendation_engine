  "title": "The Collected Stories of Isaac Babel",
  "description": "\"A book that will last, that you will reread all your life and then pass on to your grandchildren. Or ask to be buried with.\"―Michael Dirda, Washington Post Following the historic publication of Norton's The Complete Works of Isaac Babel in the fall of 2001, The Collected Stories of Isaac Babel appears as the most authoritative and complete edition of his fiction ever published in paperback. Babel was best known for his mastery of the short story form―in which he ranks alongside Kafka and Hemingway―but his career was tragically cut short when he was murdered by Stalin's secret police. Edited by his daughter Nathalie Babel and translated by award-winner Peter Constantine, this paperback edition includes the stunning Red Cavalry Stories; The Odessa Tales , featuring the legendary gangster Benya Krik; and the tragic later stories, including \"Guy de Maupassant.\" This will be the standard edition of Babel's stories for years to come.
