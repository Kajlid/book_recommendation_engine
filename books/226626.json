  "description": "Tae Rames life is officially a mess. Not only has she insulted the gods, but she’s just escaped their trap by putting a hole in Zeus’ flagship, the Olympus. All in all, things aren’t looking to good for her.  Join Tae as she travels through the vast wilds of the legendary Tartarise, where once again, she must risk it all to save the life of a god. Whilst there, Tae must also learn to deal with some its most frightening inhabitants, like the Minotaur, Harpies and Medusa.  And always, creeping ever nearer, is the looming threat of the Titans. With time quickly running out, can Tae and her dreadnaught Brightmoon find a way to save the realms of the gods? Or will she stumble at the final hurdle and lose everything she has come to love?",
