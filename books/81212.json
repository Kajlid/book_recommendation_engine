  "description": "I had the pleasure of knowing Robert Ryan for many years. I read \"The Search\" shortly after it was written. While he was writing the book, I ask Robert, why call it \"The Search\"? He responded, \"I want people to discover the meaning of their life and relationship to God\". At first I didn't understand what he was talking about. As I read \"The Search\", I began to understand. The book shows you our beginning, and why we are here, where we are going, and how to improve our time here on earth. The book offers proof of a supreme being. It shows how science and religion can work together to show how a \"Creator\" formed the universe we all live in. It doesn't matter what your faith or belief in God is. \"The Search\" will help guide you as a believer in God and make your belief stronger. If you are not sure, it will help you decide. If you are a nonbeliever in God, it will make you reconsider your stance. Charles Robillard Relator Fall Brook, California Robert Ryan was born on Sept. 30th 1948 in Norfolk Virginia.
