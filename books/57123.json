  "title": "The First Christmas: What the Gospels Really Teach About Jesus's Birth",
  "description": "The perfect follow-up to The Last Week, Borg and Crossan's The First Christmas is an account of the two nativity narratives in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. Borg and Crossan focus on discovering the actual literary story that the Gospels tell. Borg and Crossan feel that history has biased our readings of these texts; we are all so familiar with the nativity story that we don't really hear it anymore. The First Christmas will help us see the nativity story afresh and be able to appreciate the powerful message the Gospels contain.",
