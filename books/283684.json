  "description": "A Rita Award Winner by USA Today bestselling author Pamela Morsi. \n\nMiss Gertrude Barkley, local spinster, takes pride in shocking the locals now and then. Her latest scandal is the decision to get her hair bobbed. Her brother blames such behavior on her career as a novelist, giving her wild ideas. But brickyards owner, Mikolai Stefanski likes the look. He's liked a lot of things about Gertrude for a very long time. But Venice Missouri in 1916 is not like his homeland, Poland. The rules of the old world don't work in this new one, especially not in matters of love. When two teenagers, Gertrude's niece and Mikolai's son discover what seems to be Aunt Gertrude's diary, they believe they have unearthed a scandal for real. Moonlight dances, steetcar rides and the early days of high school athletics evoke a time gone by in a small town America.  “Her stories are gently humorous, wise and wonderful.” -- Susan Elizabeth Phillips, New York Times Bestselling Author",
