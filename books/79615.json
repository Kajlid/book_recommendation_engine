  "description": "Animals talk...if you know how to listen.\"Bloody things got me to sleepwalking the quickest, sometimes whether I wanted them to or not, so I pictured what my brother mighta looked like dead. Skull shattered into puzzle pieces, eyes clouded like milk glass, blue lips cracked in a last breath. I shivered, letting my insides go damp with the details.\"Robin Calloway has always been \"special\"--a misfit who lives more in her own head than the real world. Some, including her father, even think she's crazy. So when her brother is found murdered, Robin's father suspects her of the crime and sends her to a mental institution for observation. With the help of Dr. G, Robin begins to untangle memories of the killing, but admits a terrible truth about herself in the she can both hear and speak to animals, and this cursed ability forces her to \"sleepwalk\"--or blank out--for most of her day.Fearing both the local sheriff and the label of \"schizophrenic,\" Robin escapes the hospital and flees into the Texas Hill Country. To survive hunting season in the woods, however, she must accept her unique senses and gain the help of a whitetail deer herd. But Robin soon finds herself in the path of a killer desperate to hide the truth.",
