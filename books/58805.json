  "title": "The Art of Being Kind",
  "description": "Being kind in a genuine and positive way truly is an art, and it is an art that can be learned. Stefan Einhorn believes it is the single most important factor in achieving success and satisfaction in life-being a good person can make you happier, richer, more successful, and fulfilled. But being kind is not always easy to put into practice, although it inevitably plays a part in our everyday actions. In all of life's dilemmas we calculate, whether consciously or subconsciously, what the consequences of our behavior-good or bad-is likely to be. It is this ethical intelligence that Stefan Einhorn believes demonstrates our ability to be a good person. Partially inherited and developed in childhood, ethical intelligence continues to grow throughout our lives. In this groundbreaking book, Einhorn reveals the five life-altering tools we all need to focus on if we are to become better people. He also identifies the common stumbling blocks to be avoided in the process of achieving goodness. Offering both immediate and long-term solutions to readers who want to be better human beings, this unique book holds a special key to the advantages to being kind. Stefan Einhorn, MD, PhD , is a chairman of the department of oncology-pathology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. The author of several books in the fields of popular medicine and the philosophy of religion, including A Concealed Religion, Science, and the Search for Truth , he is also a prominent lecturer in both Sweden and the United States.",
