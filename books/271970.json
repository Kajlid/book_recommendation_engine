  "description": "Listening Length: 4 hours and 40 minutes Marlene's not like the other humans. They weep while she smiles. They look at us with fear, while she entices me with a come-hither look. I... have no idea why such a bold female resonated to a male like me. I am the most reticent of all the sa-khui tribe, a hunter that never expected to have a family of my own. But resonance chooses, and it has chosen her for me. And Marlene is quite determined to seduce me...and who can say no to such a woman?",
