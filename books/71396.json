  "description": "I'm Grace O’Neal, the sixteen-year-old girl who attempted suicide in the sea. If you’re wondering what happened to me, I didn't die that night. Adam wouldn't let me. At first, I didn't want his help. A strange new islander with no shoes and a retro haircut. Who did he think he was? My hero? But when he pushed me to accept my mom’s drowning, to heal, I realized I needed a friend. I should have known someone so weird and wonderful wasn't a normal teenage guy. I should have known my complicated life was going to get a lot more complicated when I fell in love with him ... and discovered his dark secret.",
