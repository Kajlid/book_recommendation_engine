  "description": "THE KISS OF DEATH. The notorious Gallagher gang has been a burr in Longarm's saddle blanket for far too long. So when a lonely -- and lovely -- ranch widow offers him a hot lead on the bandits, Longarm is eager for the news. But that's no all Lily Gail Wharton wants to share with Longarm... Distracted by Miss Lily Gail's talent, Longarm doesn't know she's a lethal lure who's seduced him into a Gallagher man-trap -- until he wakes up in her barn, chained and hungry as an unwanted dog. Her outlaw in-laws baited their trap just right. And Longarm is their guest of honor.",
