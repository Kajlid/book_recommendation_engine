  "description": "From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Laurelin Paige comes a new story in her Man In Charge series…Brett Sebastian is the very best kind of friend.Who else would get me a job at one of the biggest corporations in America?And hook me up with his uber-rich cousin to boot?And let me cry on his shoulder every time said cousin blows me off?Okay, it’s pretty obvious that Brett cares about me in a different way than I do for him, but he seems fine with how things are, and our friendship works.Until one fateful night when I'm mooning over his cousin, and Brett utters four words that should make me happy for him, should make me relieved, should balance out our uneven relationship:“I met a girl.”Suddenly my world is crashing down around me, and I’m forced to ask myself—am I only interested in Brett now that he’s taken?Or have I been looking at the wrong man all along?**Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**",
