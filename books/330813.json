  "description": "I woke up in the middle of the night to find a dark figure standing at the foot of my bed. He claimed to be my soul mate, but Iâ€™m calling BS.When I told him to get out, he sprouted tentacles.I tried to run, of course, but he caught me around the waist and gagged me with one of his slippery appendages.One thing led to another, and now I have a tentacle beast in my room who knows exactly how to make me moan.He prefers the dark, claiming that he'll become wicked if I so much as turn on the light.But now I'm tempted to call his bluff.",
