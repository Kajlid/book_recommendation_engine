  "description": "Secretly dating Coach Parker’s daughter was never part of the plan. Neither was becoming her dealer… ADAMReturning to my drug-dealing past wasn’t on the agenda when I accepted the full ride to play ball at Cypress U. But Mom lost her job. And my sister’s medical bills are mounting. So, I’ve no choice but to change the playbook.When Emily walks into my life, like a fallen goddess with the ultimate power to destroy me, I know I’m screwed. I should steer clear, but I’m the one supplying her poison of choice. Falling for her is a complication I don’t need, but the more she’s around, the harder it gets to walk away. She needs me, and I crave her more than the sport I love.Now, it’s all on the line. Including the NFL career that’s tantalizingly close. The stakes are high, but family means everything, so I’ll take my chances.EMILYIt’s only a problem if it’s out of control. And I have it in hand.Except a certain a-hole discovers I’m using again, and he threatens to rat me out to my folks. Mom’s president of Cypress U, and Dad’s the illustrious football coach. Appearances mean everything to them, and I’m a continuous disappointment. They told me I’d be out on my ass if I fell off the wagon, so keeping it a secret is my number one priority.Until the super-hot all-star QB takes more than a passing interest in me. Adam gets me, in a way no guy ever has, filling my head with ideas of forever—and now, I want more.Dating my dealer is a recipe for disaster, especially when it’s forbidden, but I can’t help myself.Because I’ve fallen too deep. And the hole is too large to crawl out of.",
