In a search for normalcy, the Healer finds more than a new home down south in Lee as the hard to resist Addie steals his heart. He faces a momentous decision between abiding by his Clanâ€™s laws or allowing a Grim to kill Addie and her daughter. Either way he will end up alone and must decide which is harder: living next to Addie without her love, or not having her around at all?",
