  "description": "Five years. \nThat’s how long it took me to find her.Five years after my world shattered, leaving me a scarred and broken man. By then, the girl I knew was gone. In her place stood a woman. One who looked like an angel. An impossible, beautiful angel.I killed for her. Soaked my hands in the blood of those who hurt her and rescued her from hell. But hell has a way of following you. Becoming a part of you. Maybe the only part you recognize. I had every intention of bringing her home. Setting her free. I swear I did. But the men who kidnapped her all those years ago weren’t done with her yet. They’d stop at nothing to get her back. And I’d kill any man who tried to take her from me. She calls me her avenging angel. But I know the truth. \nI’m no angel. \nBecause even as I tell myself I’m protecting her I know one thing for sure. I am a monster, too. No better than them.Because just like them, \nI’ll never let her go\n.Author's note: Stolen is Dante Grigori's story and although a standalone, would be better enjoyed after reading With This Ring and I Thee Take.",
