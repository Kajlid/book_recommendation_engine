  "description": "With just one night and one stupid party, the trajectory of my future altered forever…Until my senior year, I had everything going for me: excellent grades, a supportive and loving family, not to mention the hottest boyfriend in school. Everything was perfect—until the arrival of Zach Anderson, a parkour loving, school skipping, bad boy delinquent that seemed to bring with him a lot of bad karma. It can’t be a coincidence that his arrival marks a significant change in my life, can it?Now, everything has changed. I no longer know who I can trust. And the threatening notes I’m receiving, well it appears those are just the start of my problems… Note: Free Falling is book two in the Best Friend series; however, it is a standalone novel with different characters so there is no requirement to read Always You first.",
