  "title": "The Courage of Truth: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1983-1984",
  "description": "The Courage of the Truth is the last course that Michel Foucault delivered at the Collège de France. Here, he continues the theme of the previous year's lectures in exploring the notion of \"truth-telling\" in politics to establish a number of ethically irreducible conditions based on courage and conviction. His death, on June 25th, 1984, tempts us to detect the philosophical testament in these lectures, especially in view of the prominence they give to the themes of life and death.",
