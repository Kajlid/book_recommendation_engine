  "description": "United States Senator John Stockwall of Texas is kidnaped on the doorstep of his house in McLean, Virginia. That's just the beginning of a conspiracy that will shake America to its very foundations. The trail of the kidnapers leads Nick McQueen, who is a CIA hit man and a fugitive from the authorities, to a brutal murder on the casino-lined, neon playgrounds of Las Vegas. The al-Qaeda kidnapers plan to broadcast live on national TV a show stage-managed to humiliate and terrorize the American public. Publicized on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media on the Internet, the kidnapers' final horrific act performed for their \"Theater of Terrorism\" aims to wreak havoc, kill thousands of Americans, and precipitate economic collapse in the United States.",
