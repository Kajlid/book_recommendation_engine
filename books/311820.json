  "description": "Forrest:Half a year ago I put out a want ad for a PA. The first person to respond showed up at my door with everything he owned and never left. I knew I’d hired the right person immediately. Since then, Blake has become my best and closest friend. I trust him completely because Blake never lies to me. I have no qualms asking him to help me find a casual hook-up so I can explore my preferences. We didn’t expect a rendezvous for sex would turn into a nightmare. I don’t know how I’ll ever recover, but I know I can’t do it without Blake. Blake:I didn’t know until I met Forrest how good a structured life could be. He lives and works by his schedule, and I keep it for him. When he asks me to put a hook-up in his schedule, I take care of it. I don’t think twice. I’ve never had any problem with any dating app, why would I expect one now?I should have been more careful. I should have vetted his hook-up before I let him go off by himself. I should have done anything other than what I did. I don’t know how Forrest can stand the sight of me, but he needs me now, and I won’t let myself fail him again.Forrest’s #Win is a 60k Contemporary MM, Bestfriends to Lovers Romance with a well-earned Happily Ever After. Triggers include: on-page descriptive (non-erotic) rape, and stalking.",
