  "title": "Feral Hearts",
  "description": "Six young people from different walks of life embark on a singles’ tour in Derosso, Italy, only to encounter a strip club in town that preys upon the men. Warned to stay away by their guide, two of the tourists give in to their curiosity and encounter the undead exotic dancers within. Lured by promises of untold carnal pleasures, these lonely hearts invite disaster on their group and the rest of the town. Wild and erotic, manipulative and vicious, these feral vampires are not at all romantic…they’re predators. Six different characters and six different endings, this tale is not for the faint of heart. It is only for Feral Hearts.",
