  "description": "“We'll give you everything. We'll train harder than the hardest trainer. Off the track, we're just sportspeople trying to live normal lives.”Jerome Kremers#11, Wests Football ClubTEAM MATES is your ticket to the behind-the-scenes lives of Australia's elite athletes. Once you connect with the sport stars fatiguing training dynamics and hectic fixtures, you'll be invited within-the-sheets of their equally unique relationships. This year-long, exhausting sporting season is told, first-hand, by Jerome Kremers, the youngest of four close-knit teammates, as he struggles to bring his physical prowess and emotional intelligence into equilibrium. Everyone considers him superbly masculine, yet he's simply not considered a great footballer.An inspiration for change comes not from his intense training regime, but from the captivating surf life saving champion Chelsea Leigh, who has an innate knack for unnerving the obsessed performer. Everyone seems to want a piece of the superbly built player, except the sensual woman who inspired him in the first place. Its no wonder as she too is busy aiming for her own slice of sporting gold.TEAM MATES starts you on an erotically-charged series on high-performance sport. If you choose to join the Australian team, don't expect it to be an easy ride. In sport, you've got to be prepared to work for a win even if that win's not guaranteed. If you support the TEAM, these private players will support you back, inviting you deeper into their behind-closed-doors behaviour in the season to follow.",
