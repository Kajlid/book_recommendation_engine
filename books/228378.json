  "description": "Can't wait to read Honestly Ben, which Jay Asher called \"hilarious\" and \"touching\"? Dive into the world of Rafe and Ben with an all new ebook that picks up right where the award-winning Openly Straight left off! Rafe Goldberg was planning to spend winter break at home in Colorado openly mourning what he almost had with Ben. He wasn't expecting his best friend, Claire Olivia, to kidnap him. And he definitely wasn't expecting what she has planned to cheer him up... Ben Carver was honestly planning to spend winter break at home in New Hampshire not thinking about Rafe. But he wasn't expecting to run into his ex-girlfriend, who's still interested in him. And he wasn't expecting to find himself still attracted to her... Openly, Honestly tells two funny, sad, beautiful stories that were made for anyone who has longed for one person to see you, to understand you, and to love you exactly as you are.",
