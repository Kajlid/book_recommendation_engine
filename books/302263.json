  "description": "In the dark, cold reaches of the north lives a storyteller and his daughter. He told his daughter, Satu, many stories--romances like the girl who loved a star and changed herself into a nightingale so she could always see him shining--but the most important story he told her was his own. This storyteller was once the formidable North Wind, but he lost his power by trading it away in exchange for mortality--he loved her mother too much to live without her. The loss of his magic impacted more than just their family, however, and now the world is unraveling in the wake of this imbalance.To save the North, Satu embarks on a perilous journey to reclaim her father's magic, but she isn't the only one searching for it. In the snow-laden mountains, she finds herself in a deadly race with the Winter Lord who wants the North Wind's destructive powers for himself.Satu has the chance to be the heroine of her own fairy tale, only this one has an ending she never could have imagined.A hauntingly beautiful fairy tale about love and loss, this Echo North companion novel is perfect for fans of the Winternight Trilogy.",
