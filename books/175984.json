  "title": "Religion: A Discovery in Comics",
  "description": "Dealing with religion often means walking on eggshells - that is what comic artist Margreet de Heer finds out in this book in which she presents the five major religions and modern spirituality in a colorful, personal yet serious manner. She explores religious history and practices with tact and an open mind, but canâ€™t prevent a few eggs from breaking. Why is religion such a sensitive subject?This comic book is fun and informative for believers, non-believers and everyone in between. It offers a fresh look from different perspectives on the phenomenon of religion, the backgrounds and history of the five major world religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism) and makes the point that religion is something that should unite us, not drive us apart.",
