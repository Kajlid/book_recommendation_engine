  "description": "On the eve of the Coronation, aspiring newspaper columnist Penelope Beaumont is assigned the story of a lifetime-revealing the Crown Prince isn't the rightful heir to Loirehall's throne. Desperate to leave her dysfunctional step-family, and tempted by the chance to fulfill her deepest wish and claim her late father's former column in The Loirehall Times, Penelope accepts the job. But a fateful encounter with Crown Prince Nicholas Garcon brings their shared history into question, and together, they uncover darker secrets about the Royal Family and the Yorkson Tragedy-the event that claimed the lives of both of their parents.Will the connection between Nicholas and Penelope be strong enough to overcome the story between them, or will lies and rumors upend the long-awaited Coronation Ball and change the future of the Royal Family forever?",
