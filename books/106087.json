  "title": "Pets by Royal Appointment: The Royal Family and their Animals",
  "description": "The Royals say they can do without many things, but not their animals. They are suspicious of practically everyone outside their own family, so the only creatures they really trust are not of the human variety. For countless monarchs and their consorts, cats, dogs, horses, even the occasional parrot, have acted as constant, faithful companions, unquestioning allies, and surrogate children for generations. The only time the Queen and Princess Anne have been known to shed tears in public was when one of their favorite horses died. And Her Majesty's corgis, the most disliked creatures at Court, even have their own \"royal\" cemeteries in all the royal residences and each has its own \"mini-palace\" immediately outside their mistress's sitting room in Buckingham Palace. Members of the royal family, from the Queen to her youngest grandchild, are taught to ride almost as soon as they can walk and, even at the age of eighty-six, Her Majesty still rides every weekend at Windsor—and refuses to wear a hard hat. This engrossing book traces the fascination of the royals with their animals—including intimate details of each of the present and early members of the family's favorite pets, with anecdotes relating to each of them and their idiosyncrasies. Pets by Royal Appointment makes essential reading for royal watchers and pet lovers alike.",
