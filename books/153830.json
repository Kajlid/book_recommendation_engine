  "description": "Can a summer fling turn into real love?From leaping a raging river to driving collegiate opponents into the boards, there is no physical challenge Kelly Tanaka won't take. But when it comes to love, she's running scared. Luckily for her, a job at a summer hockey camp is the last place she would expect to meet Mr. Right. Sure enough, from an overconfident ladies man to a tongue-tied nerd, all the guys here are Mr. Wrong. And there's no way she could be interested in a tall, muscular centreman who looks young and acts even younger. James Frechette has just been selected near the top of the NHL draft. He's completely confident about his hockey abilities, but when it comes to women, he's wiping out. The summer is his chance to hone his social skills. The problem is that there's only one girl at his hockey camp, and he really likes herâ€”but so does every other instructor there. Can he overcome his awkwardness and convince Kelly to take a chance on him?This is the second book in the trilogy about Kelly's personal journey on and off the ice.",
