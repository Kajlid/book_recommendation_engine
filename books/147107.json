  "description": "Friends, partners, and professionals... So just why is this case coming between them? In a Victorian London ruled by the blood-drinking elite, Perry Lowell is a logical and accomplished Nighthawk: a rogue blue blood who tracks murderers and thieves for the Guild. So when she and her charming-but-reckless partner, Garrett, are charged with finding a missing theatre starlet, it should be a simple solve. But with an entire theatre of suspects, including a flirtatious understudy and whispers of a Clockwork Menace haunting the place, tension is brewing between the pair of them. Can they come together to solve the case - or will it be too late, when the murderer turns his gaze on Perry herself? Warning: This is not a traditional HEA. Set three years before Forged By Desire (available Sept 2014), it's a pre-romance novella featuring Perry and Garrett. Heads will butt, tempers will flare - and perhaps one of them might come to realise just what the other truly means to them?",
