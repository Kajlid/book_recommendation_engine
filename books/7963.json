  "description": "Ten-year-old Angelica is sure her mother didn't drown by accident. But no one will listen to her -- especially not her father and his greedy girlfriend. How can she uncover the truth and expose her mother's murderer? Mirabel Townes has her share of enemies. But when the wealthy heiress and lapsed Scientologist drowns in her backyard hot tub one August night, the police pronounce it a tragic accident. Her daughters, who suspect murder, refuse to accept that ruling. Determined to unmask their mother's killer, they beg grief therapist Cleo Sims, to accept them into her Contact Project that helps people communicate with dead loved ones. Cleo is a capable mental-health professional who is reluctant to involve herself in another possible murder investigation. But she can't resist the pleas of ten-year-old Angelica Townes, a spiritually gifted Indigo child, or the demands of Tyler, her quirky spirit guide, so she agrees to help solve Mirabel's murder. Too Far Under is a   story filled with complex characters, lots of intrigue, and multiple plot twists that will keep you reading and guessing to the end. Too Far Under is the second book in the Cleo Sims series, but it can also be read as a stand-alone book.The Cleo Sims series is set in Boulder, Colorado, where the author lives. She uses the high-tech, New Age, outdoorsy health-related aspects of Boulder to develop themes such as reality vs. illusion; good vs. evil uses of technology; and use vs. misuse of drugs and herbs. She also uses real settings from Boulder to give the stories a rich sense of place.",
