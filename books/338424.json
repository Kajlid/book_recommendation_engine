  "description": "I was blackmailed into spying on the kingpin.\n\nNow I’m falling for his right hand man.\n\nI’m a maid, not a secret agent. I don’t belong in this world, and I definitely have no business snooping around the De Rossi compound. Each day could be my last, and I’ll be lucky to make it through Christmas—especially with the way the kingpin’s right hand man stares at me.Because the enforcer is gruff. Brutal. He’s scarred and brawny, and he watches me like a hawk. How will I ever survive this with his eyes on me all the time?And… this is so messed up…Why don’t I want him to look away?\nHolly & The Henchman is a short and steamy instalove story, starring a reluctant spy and the mobster who’s watching her every move.\n\n*Each book has an HEA, but the Very Merry Mob series is best read in order.*",
