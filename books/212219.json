  "description": "In 1921, the tiny farming town of Harmony, Kansas, reeling from grief and desperate for comfort, places their faith in the daughter of a poor dirt farmer. But Esta Macphee is no ordinary girl. She speaks of being touched by God. And she possesses knowledge only the Lord could have bestowed upon her. But is she Godâ€™s handmaiden or a clever con-artist? The local pastor believes she is something more sinister, and he will stop at nothing to expose her evil.The Dust Prophet is a story of unyielding ground, the limits of human suffering, and the desperate need for faith. At a time when even the earth rose up against them, a unique family of hardscrabble, yet gifted women, forged a path through the clouds of dust.",
