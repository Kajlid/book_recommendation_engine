  "description": "My name is King Henry Price.  I'm tired of the lies I have to tell to others. Lies that I haven't walked through another Realm separate from this Earth. Lies I don't have in my possession a World-Breaker that can make any city on this globe go crack.  My name is King Henry Price.  I'm tired of the lies I tell myself. Lies I don't miss my mentor's advice. Lies I don't love a woman named Valentine. Lies about how I can do this all alone.  My name is King Henry Price.  I'm tired of the lies they tell us all. Lies that this world ain't run by blood gods. Lies about how dragons have gone extinct. Lies to make us weak. Lies to cover up a great war. Lies, lies, too many lies to count.  My name is King Henry Price and I am the Foul Mouth. I am the Dirt King. I am the Glassbreaker.  What I ain't . . . is lying no more.  It's time to steal some truth.  It's time for the Pit of No Return.",
