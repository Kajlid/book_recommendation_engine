  "title": "The Dire Wolf's Mate",
  "description": "Rain is a wanderer, searching for a place and a people to belong to. She wanders right into an Appalachian eco village - or at least, that's what she assumes it is. The villagers are surprised she can even see it, because their little settlement is actually a home for the magical - the fey, the dragons, the shifters. One dire werewolf, in particular. Rain finds herself inexplicably drawn to Jamie, even though she hasn't the faintest idea of who and what he is. There's just one problem: Jamie hasn't left his wolf form in years. His traumatic past means that he's not even certain he wants to. This is a sweet romance short story of approximately 9,000 words (36 book pages).",
