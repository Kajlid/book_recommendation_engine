  "description": "Page Four asks: Which Palm Springs party girl has been caught canoodling with an out-of-town \"Adam\"? Eve Caruso keeps her finger on the pulse of Palm Springs and reports every spicy celebrity tidbit to her loyal readers. She knows everyone in this town— except that mysterious hunk who just strolled into the exclusive spa where she's conferring with hot new starlet Jemima Cargill. Nash Cargill—nicknamed \"The Preacher\" by all his rowdy friends—is here to protect his flighty sister from a stalker, not fall for a sexy society columnist. But Eve has the perfect name—she's wildly tempting. Nash should resist; after all, her luscious lips speak trouble, her two sisters are too interested in their affair, and the rest of her family defines \"notorious.\" But Eve is more vulnerable than she seems, and Nash has never said \"no\" to a lady in distress . . .",
