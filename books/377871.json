  "title": "Confessions of a Slacker Mom",
  "description": "Parents who are fed up with the pressure to turn their children into star athletes, concert violinists, and merit scholars-all at once!-finally have an alternative: the world of Slacker Moms, where kids learn to do things for themselves and parents can cut themselves some slack; where it's perfectly all right to do less, have less, and spend less. Slacker moms say \"No\" to parenting philosophies that undermine parents'-and children's-ability to think for themselves. They say \"Yes\" to saving their money and time by opting out of the parenting competition. And they say \"Hell, Yes!\" to having a life of their own, knowing it makes them better parents.In this witty and insightful book, author Muffy Mead-Ferro reflects on her experience of growing up on a ranch in Wyoming, where parenting-by necessity-was more hands-off, people \"made do\" with what they had, and common sense and generational wisdom prevailed. We should all take her sane lead!",
