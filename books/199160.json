  "description": "Tension is mounting in the rift. With the situation dire, Wil is tasked to train a group of twenty young men to serve as his officers—collectively, the Primus Elites. He has five years to raise them to full Agents, and he’ll need every minute. Training alongside them, Wil still needs to master simultaneous observation. But, the closer he gets to achieving the feat, the more likely the Aesir will come to test him—to see if he’s worthy of the Cadicle title bestowed on him at conception. If he can survive their test, he’ll finally uncover the truth the Priesthood has gone to such great lengths to hide.  Web of Truth is the fourth installment in the Cadicle series. This fact-paced novel with action, romance, and intrigue reveals the true nature of the war as Wil learns the secrets behind the Bakzen’s origins.",
