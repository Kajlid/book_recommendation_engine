  "description": "Bush materialised in the prehistoric shore... and the drama began.For Bush was a mind-traveller, moving through time like a phantom... and haunted by a phantom, The Dark Woman. Was she a ghost from his future, or the product of a mind strained beyond endurance? Bush had other problems: emerging from the Devonian past into a totalitarian future he was trained to kill, sent back in time to assassinate a man who threatened the future.This brilliant examination of the relationship between men and time is simultaneously a serious novel on that fascinating subject and a tense psychosexual thriller.",
