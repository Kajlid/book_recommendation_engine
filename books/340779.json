  "description": "After being passed over for a junior partnership and getting relegated to a branch office in the middle of nowhere, Leslie Knotts vows that she won't let budget cuts, corporate upheaval, or meddlesome ladies distract her from turning the new branch around and showing she has the savvy for the upper echelons of the company. Organizing and advertising his new construction business has been harder than Mark Shultz expected. Having his Aunt Minnie and her friends from the Ladies' Night Out group throwing women in his path isn't helping matters. When his aunt's outrageous schemes start to spell trouble, Mark teams up with Leslie to outsmart the ladies. Mark introduces Leslie to his friends and she discovers genuine friendships as well as a love with Mark like she has never known. When a competing company offers her the big city partnership she has always dreamed of, Leslie must decide if she will risk her future as a top executive to stay where her heart has found a home.",
