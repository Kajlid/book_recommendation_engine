  "description": "The Gallic campaigns firmly established Julius Caesar (100 B.C.â€“44 B.C.) as one of the greatest commanders of all time. After success there, Caesar turned his loyal army back toward Rome. Crossing the Rubicon, he initiated a civil war, marched triumphally to the capital, besieged Pompey at Brundisium, and pacified Spain. With a tiny army he routed Pompey's far larger forces at Pharsalus, pursued him to his death in Egypt, and established Cleopatra on her throne.Though Caesar's Commentaries are among the most exact and picturesque of historical writings, it is only through knowledge of the geography and weaponry of his campaigns that one can properly understand them. In this history, T. A. Dodge, one of the only military historians to have visited every one of the great general's known battlefields, makes full use of other chroniclers and critics and supplements them with his clear, insightful descriptions of the battles. As a fully illustrated and complete military history of one of history's greatest generals, Caesar is unparalleled.",
