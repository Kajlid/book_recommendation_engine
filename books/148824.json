I believe I was given another chance to change peopleâ€™s lives and bring them closer to God. Once people see what a big role God played in my life, maybe they will see the role He is already playing in theirs. Some of the things you are about to read might be shocking, but I want people to know the truth. Come with me friends, as I take you on a ride you will never forget.",
