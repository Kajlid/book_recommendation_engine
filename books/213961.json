  "description": "Mother at Seven is the shocking, inspirational true story of a little girl’s tragic childhood, and how she endured and overcame a decade of unspeakable abuse at the hands of her cruel and sadistic family. Set in Sochi, Russia, near the banks of the majestic Black Sea, Mother at Seven tells of those critical moments in a child’s life when the only thing standing between the life and death itself was a pure and innocent belief that better days lie ahead. It teaches that by fighting through hardship and pain, miracles can still happen, and that life can still be amazing as long as hope is never lost.",
