A royal wedding turns into beheading, a nation at risk of annihilation, and a battle for survival is on the horizon.Two vikings – one of whom is the formidable former Varangian Guard whose name is carved on a marble slab in Constantinople's Hagia Sophia – settle down in Kurdland. Though defined by the different opportunities and challenges imposed on them, Ivar and Halvdan are both desperate for recognition and affection. As their lives intertwine with the enchanting and virtuous doctor, Vesta, the successful Palace manager, Zara, and the newly coronated Kurdish King, Saaid, they try to deal with the inevitable trials of love and loss at a time when uncertainty continues to cloud their future. Well-researched and seductively charming, The Viking's Kurdish Love spans across continents, cultures, religions and decades of tumultuous regional and global history. Widad's lyrical prose sensuously wraps the readers in the story of how the people of the era refuse to be trapped by their past experiences.",
