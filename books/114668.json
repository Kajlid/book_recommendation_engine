Faced with a new and unfamiliar economy, they find new friends and learn to cherish the community around them. From food to self defense, there is no one to rely on but their neighbors and themselves. Ordinary World is more than a dystopian novel. It's a story about family, love, loss, and joy. \"An intelligent, believable, relevant masterpiece...\" --Scott Pollak",
