  "title": "Bridges with Spirit",
  "description": "Fiction. Voith's book is a collection of stories which opens in Pennsylvania at a Beatles concert in 1960-something and ends with a cross-country trip to the optimism of the second gold rush in California. A collection of tiny rock shows and rare records, best friend's funerals, skipped classes, girlfriends dumping their boys and imaginary superhero friends, this loose narrative style takes readers to familiar roadside stops, down dreary university hallways into dirty rock and roll clubs, and through the hearts of relationships doomed or otherwise broken, but lovely. Voith lives in Seattle, Washington, where he works booking tours across America for dysfunctional rock and roll bands.",
