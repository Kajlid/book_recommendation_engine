  "description": "My name is Karma Gallo. If you’ve heard of me, I am sure you're remembering a story about a police raid, missing person report, or an FBI probe into my family. My father is a Chicago mob boss, and I’m his little principessa—the heir apparent with no life of my own. But in twelve days my life will change. College will do that to a girl. So will the frat boy and the bad boy—two panty-dampening guys throwing around the testosterone. They both want to help me with my panties, but what else do they want? And do I care?This is book one in a three part series.",
