  "description": "Book 2 of the multi-episode series The Cage Sessions  Things are heating up in Miami.  Annika is at rock star Damien Cage's Friday night party, a decadent affair full of body-painted girls dancing naked to mad beats. She and her friend Isabella attend the \"private show\" during which a transsexual dominatrix teaches submission to the \"Cage Girls\" in front of a live audience.  When Annika has a panic attack, she runs and finds Damien Cage. Peering into her soul during an erotic encounter in a secret garden, he challenges her to let go of her inner fears and enjoy her sexuality.  A foursome of lusty delight begins to form at Annika's first \"Cage Session.\" Damien prompts her to indulge in certain deviant urges she has felt for years. After a nasty spat with her mother, Annika finally allows herself to experiment in a way she never thought she could... finally tasting sweet sexual freedom.  Approximate length: 20,000 words (a novella)  This is the second title in a series. There IS a cliffhanger ending. You have now been warned about that too.  There is also a heavy emphasis on pansexuality, including a passionate F/F scene. Do not read if this offends you.  Themes: Erotic romance, new adult, BDSM, transsexual, pansexual, rock star, alpha male, tattoos, body piercings, body paint, controlling parent, sex positive, sexual freedom.",
