  "description": "A powerful and ambiguous body of water lies at the heart of these poems, with shoals and channels that change with the forty-foot tide. Philip Gross's meditations move with subtle steps between these shifting grounds and those of the man-made world, the ageing body, and that ever-present mystery, the self. Admirers of his work know each new collection is a new stage; this one marks a crossing new clarity and depth. \"\"Varied and thought provoking work.\"\" -The Midwest Book Review",
