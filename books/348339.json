  "title": "Rose: Love in Violent Times",
  "description": "Rose breaks new ground in answering a fundamental question in most feminist and anti-racist writing: how do we identify, witness, and then recover from traumaâ€”as individuals, as families, as communities, and as a country? Muscio's ability to address dire topics with a unique freshness and bravery allows her readers to come face to face with the true brutality of a violent culture, and then react powerfully with righteous rage and hopeful determination.",
