  "description": "Recently Retired investigative reporter Quentin Thomas is dealing with another relationship breakup when the bigwigs at his former paper call in markers to get him back. There's a blockbuster story waiting to be written. An astrologically inspired killer targeting lawyers has eluded the FBI for months and they aren't happy when Quentin starts poking around. A romance soon blossoms with an astrology club member, prompting an attack by the apparent killer who's fatally shot when he takes on the police. The Feds close the case- but Quentin knows better. After he recovers, the celestial symbol clues left at each homicide are decoded. Only Quentin believes they point to the real murderer's identity. Now, he must prove he's right. As he navigates through a complicated and treacherous investigation, Quentin also discovers the reason for the phobia that explains his romantic frustrations.Derived from French, the word \"potpourri\" is defined as a scented combination of petals and spice or a literary mixture. The Sky Tells No Lies fits both definitions; a story with a pleasant aroma of a satisfactory read and a dazzling blend of astrology, love, hate, revenge, murder, legal disgust, and, most of all, self-realization. Take a deep breath and enjoy the literary fragrance emanating from this fast paced book.",
