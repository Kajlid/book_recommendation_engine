Her father is the protector of the land, keeping the people safe from Mandarin and Likman, the creatures who today are called vampires and werewolves. Eclipse falls in love with a man named Jonas, but she soon discovers he is a werewolf. She decides to have him turn her into a werewolf too, so they can always be together. One day they are attacked by Mandarins and Jonas dies. Eclipse discovers she is pregnant with a child, one foretold in a prophecy.
