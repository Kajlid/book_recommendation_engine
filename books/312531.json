  "description": "Notorious ladies' man and hockey hotshot Luca Pandatelli broke his own rules when he tangled up with me. Not only did we spend an entire weekend in bed together, but he confided in me, sharing painful truths about his past. With a kiss good-bye and a promise to call, something sparked between us. Something that broke through my walls. Except he didn't call. And I re-enforced my walls with steel and barbed wire. Now, I've accepted a job with the Boston Hawks franchise, making it inevitable that I see the last man I want to cross paths with. I'm prepared to dismiss him and pretend like our weekend together never happened. But the regret in Luca's eyes and the apology in his voice catches me off-guard. The harder I push him away, the harder he pulls me in. Until the one thing I can't accept, can't forgive, comes to light. And I'm left wondering, is Luca only interested in the chase? Or is he really playing for keeps?",
