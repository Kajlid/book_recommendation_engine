  "description": "A HINT OF SCANDAL  Miss Temperance Lindwell is the worst thing a lady can be according to British Society: an opinionated American in search of a titled husband. Her social-climbing parents are determined to return to New York with the news their scandal-ridden daughter has married a Lord of the Realm. But Temperance, burned once before, has no use for marriage.  James Harrow, Marquess of Ridgemont, has always put others’ interests ahead of his own. But the time has come to do his duty and find a proper English bride. His plan goes awry, however, when he is tricked into waltzing with an American heiress. Her brashness stretches his gentlemanly manners past their breaking point until he finds himself on the receiving end of Miss Lindwell’s well placed slap.  Determined to apologize for his part in the very public debacle, James pursues Temperance, only to stumble upon her kidnapping! Soon the two are caught up in a dangerous plot, forced to set aside their differences and trust each other if they are to survive.  But can past heartbreaks be mended and trust restored, or will the hint of scandal from their misadventure ruin any chance for future happiness?",
