You get killed by Truck-kun, get transported to a fantasy world by a sentient Fae coin, and become the first gay holy maiden.Jake Alexander is Not Happy to be sure. Fortunately in Jake’s case, part of the trope tree includes the gorgeous Duke of the North, Theon. And starting a business from scratch, which he’s always wanted to do. And revitalizing his new country which is on the verge of collapse.He could do without the killer miasma and corrupted kings and the singing magic and a sentient coin that doesn’t shut up, however.Jake’s not sure if he should thank or melt the Fae coin into *ahem* something more useful.Fell on the trope tree and hit every branch going down, truck-kun, fae duke of the north, holy maiden, miasma threat, Jakes needs singing lessons, duke needs to take a business course, magic coin is about to be melted into a cock ring, bingo card for tropes, dragons, contracts are Jake’s love language, potato soup cures all, potatoes are friends, fourth wall who, basically I took all of the webtoon tropes and crammed them in",
