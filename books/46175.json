When newly widowed Kate Huntington agrees to help her closest friend’s elderly aunt with a problem, the “problem” ends up dead and Kate ends up in the middle of a police investigation. To clear Aunt Betty of suspicion, Kate and her cohorts must wade through a brimming pool of suspects–some of whom have secrets they would prefer stay buried.As the investigation progresses, she is finding it hard to deny her attraction to one of the parties involved. But it’s too soon; she’s still grieving for her beloved Eddie. Then her friend Rob surprises everyone when his reaction to this potential romance is both intense and negative. Is he only concerned that his friend will get hurt, or could he be jealous? Meanwhile, the residents of the Lancaster retirement community continue to die off, and not from natural causes. Soon the question becomes not just whether they’ll find the killer, but at what cost…her friendship with Rob? Or one of their lives?",
