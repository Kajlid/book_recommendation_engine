  "description": "The West Australian, a newspaper from Perth, Australia, on Saturday, 14 May, 1932 had this to say about Mad-Doctor \"One cannot say very much for Mr. Brooks’s fantastic and inherently improbable story of Dr. Merciful, who conducts weird experiments on the brains and other anatomical parts of living persons and summons spirits from the vague Beyond, in the seclusion of his converted farmhouse on the coast of Lancashire.\" The newspaper goes on to fill space with more blather about the supposed lackings of the book. But the Daily Standard, out of Brisbane on Saturday, 23 April, 1932 \"His experiments are hair-raising, and Mr. Brooks is to be congratulated on achieving something new in thrillers.” What do you think?",
