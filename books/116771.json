  "description": "MEET JANE DAY. She's a twenty-something temp-by-day, detective-by-night... and sometimes also by-day. Jane lives inside her head as much as outside of it. To fight the mundane (and even not so mundane), she retreats to a fantasy world in her mind wehre the pop-culture references are plentiful and comforting. Follow Jane in her private detective salad days surveilling Lindelof & Lindelof heir, Chad Lindelof, Jr. She'll learn the ropes working undercover to bust the shady, bootlegging Li'l Susie Bees, and solving the mystery at the roller derby. Then she takes a breather and reads about her favorite comic strip, PIE V. CAKE. Come for the comic, stick around for ALL the commentaries, pencils & inks, sketches, scripts and pop-culture glossaries! P.I. SERIAL, BUT BY NO MEANS SERIOUS.",
