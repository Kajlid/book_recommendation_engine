  "description": "New York City is always in need of miracles...And this Christmas is no exception. Thank heavens the divinely inspired, if somewhat ditsy, angelic trio -- Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy -- is available to answer three heartfelt prayers this sacred holiday season... and to impart important lessons along the way. And Goodness knows (as do Mercy and Shirley) that the three lonely women to whom they've been assigned have a lot to learn:A dedicated inner-city school teacher, Brynn needs to teach her troubled students how to dream...Shy and dutiful Hannah must learn to follow her own heart...And frustrated small-town-girl-turned-Broadway-wannabe Jenny needs to discover that home is where love truly lies.It's time for the angels to shine.. and to prove once again that when you wish upon a star, you get much more than just a pretty song!",
