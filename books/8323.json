  "description": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewFor sex crimes prosecutor Alexandra Cooper, even a night out can be murder. Already troubled by the return of the Silk Stocking Rapist (back in business after a four-year break), Alex is further burdened when the seminar she's attending at NYU Law School is interrupted by the discovery of a skeleton bricked up behind the wall in the basement of a Manhattan brownstone that was once the residence of Edgar Allan Poe! Although the tabloids have a field day with the Poe connection, this corpse is no relic from the poet's era. Forensics estimates that the body was entombed sometime after 1979 -- ancient history only from the perspective of leads gone cold. Meanwhile, someone is mimicking the M.O. of the Silk Stocking Rapist -- with one notable distinction: He leaves his victim dead. As that investigation unfolds, Alex wonders if the copycat's victim might have had information about the body in the basement . Suddenly the cold case turns red-hot, and it's up to Alex to ensure that no one else gets burned. Linda Fairstein's inside knowledge of police procedure and legal work (she spent 25 years in the Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit of the Manhattan D.A.'s Office) provides Entombed with intriguing realistic touches; her craft as a writer turns it into an atmospheric, fast-paced tale that rivals Poe.
