  "description": "All Ben Vecchio wanted was a quiet summer before his last semester of university. Was that too much to ask? All Tenzin wanted was a cache of priceless medieval coins that had been missing for several hundred years. And some company. Phrases like “never again” don’t mean much when you’ve been a vampire for several thousand years. And promises made in the heat of anger don’t outweigh the lure of gold. Ben Vecchio thought he knew everything there was to know about the immortals of Italy. But when Tenzin tempts him into another adventure finding a cache of rare gold coins missing since the nineteenth century, he’ll discover that familiar places can hold the most delicious secrets. And possibly, the key to his future.",
