  "description": "Chad Langer was always running. Running from his past, afraid of letting himself be happy and free. College was going to be his new start. New city, new school, new people. Scarlett would be his undoing. He knew it the moment he saw her. Something in her eyes called to him. She was just as broken as he was. Sometimes the past doesnâ€™t stay in the past. Will they be able to overcome the obstacles set in their path?",
