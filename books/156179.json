  "description": "The one lesson that Trav's learned with the band's return to Tyson is that it should be hard to say good-bye.Mackey, Kell, Jefferson, and Stevie have to say good-bye to the person who helped make them and break them. They have to say good-bye to their bitterness and anger, and they have to say good-bye to lingering hope that one of the best parts of their childhood can be with them always.But in the last two years they've grown a lotâ€”and maybe they've grown enough to say good-bye to the past without forgetting it, and to embrace a future that they won't regret.",
