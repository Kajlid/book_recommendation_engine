  "description": "Lacey has fame and fortune. That's everything she's ever wanted. Right?  When she becomes tabloid fodder, she's had enough. Escaping to a guest ranch in Bridgewater is the perfect place to hide. But when two hot cowboys make her theirs, is it for fifteen minutes of fame or because they want forever?  Warning: Panty melting! Make Me Yours is a wildly dirty romance with a movie star heroine who wants to hide herself from the world and two obsessed alpha cowboys who've found her. Claimed her. Made her theirs. This HEA is all about her - no m/m.",
