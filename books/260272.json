For more than a decade, Nick Kismet has traveled the world protecting priceless relics and cultural heritage sites from looters, while searching for answers to the mystery that has haunted him since the first Gulf War-a mystery that has defined his life. Now, a new war has brought him back to the bloody battlefield where his search began.
