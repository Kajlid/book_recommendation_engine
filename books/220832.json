  "description": "Meet Julian Rodriguez, an extra-terrestrial genius trapped in the body of an eight-year-old human boy. A hilarious, fully illustrated series for young chapter-book readers that's out of this world!Julian Rodriguez is on a mission for the Mothership. He's been sent to Earth to study human lifeforms and their bizarre habits--from their disgusting diet (orange sticks named carrots, flavorless liquid called water, and the revolting substance known as veggie-dogs) to their repressive treatment of their young (forcing them to carry out menial tasks known as chores, withholding access to the great cultural masterpieces called cartoons). When Julian's Maternal Unit assigns a hideous task, it's nearly too much for the hardened space veteran to bear--but he finds his courage at last.",
