  "description": "Seven ships and seven families, led by Fer and Gar, come from across the sea to find a new homeland. These people feel mysteriously drawn towards a land they do not know, but will recognize when they arrive. On the way their first disaster occurs when Gar's family is washed overboard and drowned. Is this a bad omen? Farmers of the New Stone Age, they brought their animals with them and settled at Knockadoon, Lough Gur, south of the Shannon estuary. This was a land of dense forest, difficult for farmers, but full of promise. The memory of these first Lough Gur dwellers lives on in the physical remains, exposed by archaeologists.",
