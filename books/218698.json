Full of stories, exercises and resources, Engage is a workbook to learn, study and practice the nonviolent options available to us. It offers a guide for groups on how to strengthen and deepen their action for justice and peace in the midst of war, injustice, and our threatened environment. Engage is ideal for advocacy organizations, citizen action leagues, campus networks and any group seeking to work together to create a society committed to justice, democracy, peace, sustainability and equality. Engage is based on 500 workshops Pace e Bene has led with people throughout the US and around the world working for change.",
