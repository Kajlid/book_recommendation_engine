  "description": "Mr. Marling, of Marling Hall, realizes he will probably never be able to hold onto his wonderful old estate and to pass it down to his children. World War II is bringing an end to so many things, but the Marlings carry on as best they can in the face of rationing and changed living conditions. Into their world erupt Geoffrey Harvey and his sister Frances, bombed out of their London home. Bohemian and sophisticated, they rent a local house and it is not long before they begin to have an effect on their neighbors. Geoffrey begins to court Lettice, the Marlings' older widowed daughter, but he finds he has rivals for her affections in her cousin David Lindsey and Captain Barclay. Observing everything and quietly keeping events on an even keel is Miss Bunting. Observing everything and quietly keeping events on an even keel is Miss Bunting.",
