  "description": "When a school field trip to the local museum coincides with coming-of-age angst and an overly inquisitive friend (a cute goth girl named Pandora), Junior releases something terrible on the world... and its up to him to fix it. Featuring an awesome cast of back-up characters including Stigmartha whose hands bleed when she gets nervous; Smith & Weston, two twins conjoined at the head and The Seep, a foul-mouthed, armless, legless fetus in a tube. He's your average, everyday, happy-go-lucky middle-school student... who just happens to be the son of the grim reaper.",
