  "title": "Never Let Go",
  "description": "Will McLaren and Ethan Gallagher first met in high school. Ethan--sophisticated, cocky, and full of wild daring--was everything bookish and quiet Will was not. Yet they'd instantly connected and forged an unlikely friendship that had carried them through their teens and well into adulthood. Even as teenagers, though, they'd always kept secrets from one another...hidden bits about their lives and desires they feared could destroy their friendship. As adults, the secrets have become heavy burdens to bear, forcing them to keep their distance from one another and make up stories to hide the truth. Then, in an unguarded moment, Will lets his secret slip. His revelation explodes into a night of unexpected passion that stuns them both. When Ethan disappears the next morning, Will blames himself, and as the months pass with no word, he's convinced he's driven away his best friend. He forces himself to move on with his life and try to forget. But three years later, Ethan shows up again, only a shell of the vibrant man Will once knew, and mysteriously evasive about where he's been. When Ethan makes a confession of his own, can the two men recapture the friendship they'd once shared, and maybe even build something more powerful? Or will the hurts and deceptions of the past tear them apart for good? Note: Don't miss the exciting sequel, Hearts & Bones... Genres: Gay / Contemporary / BDSM / Series",
