Please read all the way through.]  Before world war two could reach its conclusion, the world suffered what could only be defined as a cataclysm. Now, Yosemite city stands as the gateway between two worlds. The empire of humanity to the west, and the wild wastes to the east.  Standing at the helm for Yosemite is Vince, a Ranger turned city state ruler. Supporting him in his endeavors is his inner circle.  Vince has begun to maneuver through the intricacies of ruling. At the same time he must balance his expanding foundation and fend off external threats.  Thankfully, every single citizen of Yosemite is united to the cause. To make their home, permanent. To dig out their place in the world and make a stand.  Things are starting to spiral out of control. Almost as quickly as he can put it all back together something else falls apart.  And with Yosemite rapidly rising into prominence, Vince finds that it really means just putting a bulls-eye on your back.  Warning: This novel contains adult themes and moral ambiguities. The main character is written as a real person in an apocalypse, and will not make choices that line up with society and cultural norms.  This story contains a harem and is an Adult Fantasy novel.",
