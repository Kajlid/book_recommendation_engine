As he launches into an adventure-filled journey through strange lands, meeting fantastic creatures along the way.Tiya comes to terms with his strengths and weaknesses.He discovers that no one int his universe is ordinary, and that life is a series of experiences that ultimately unshackle you from your own narrow existence.It is up to you to take on this adventure and come out of it as a free spirit.The delightful fable is written by a monk with several years of learning and experience as a teacher.It is an imaginative rendering of Vedantic and Yogic philosophy and yet you will find no serious sermons - only the story of a simple parrot and his formless mentor Hans.Deep and thought provoking - it is a MUST read.",
