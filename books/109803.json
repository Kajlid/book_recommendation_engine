  "description": "One day. One party. One motto: you only live once. In the tradition of wtf and fml, a crazy story of three friends and a road trip gone wrong right.Emily and her best friends, Ana and Brandon, know it should only take half a day to get to the mountains, where the Stein twins are hosting a massive Spring Break party at their parents’ mansion. The road trip should be a breeze; the driving itinerary even includes several stops along the way, the first being a bite to eat at a real, classic roadside diner.And that’s where everything falls apart.Throw in a couple of criminals, an accidental thief, and a miniature drug lord, and suddenly the half-day trip is gonna take a little longer. Add a Chihuahua, some crazy grandparents, and a hot pool-hall boy named Chris...and maybe the journey to the party will end up being better than the party itself…",
