  "description": "Trace is out to find a murderer, not an unusual task for a Private Eye. There's just one problem...he was the victim. Now he wanders the streets looking for his killer, his only help from Rollins, an emissary sent from above to help him in his quest. But that help comes the additional task of guiding a young Hispanic girl out of a life of drugs and prostitution. This he tends to--grudgingly--but his true desire is to be with his wife and son and be the husband and father in death that he couldn't be in life. As the search for his killer intensifies, he finds the safe world of his family and the violent one of the streets begin to slide closer together, and there's nothing he can do to stop it.",
