She’s got a job that is made to measure and the perfect boyfriend but all it takes is a few shocking minutes for everything to start falling apart. Hurt and upset, Lexi takes off on an undercover job on a nearby military base. Charged with finding evidence that the man indicted with the murder of a young civilian employee isn’t the real killer, Lexi just wants to lose herself in the case, put the past behind her, and heal her broken heart. But when Maddox keeps popping up during her investigation, and her boss, the mysterious Solomon, is the perfect tonic for heartache, Lexi finds it hard to keep her mind on the job. As clues start to point towards the victim’s dangerous double life and secrets mount, time is running out. And when Maddox’s betrayal might not be quite what it seems, it’s up to Lexi to speak some home truths and put a murderer behind bars.",
