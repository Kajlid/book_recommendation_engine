  "description": "At seventeen, strong-willed Harmony Jones had made it to Cripple Creek all by herself. Now all she needed to reach her inherited claim was a guide -- but the only one she could find was the devastatingly handsome Buck Hanner. His blue eyes seemed to rip away her clothes and gaze upon her untouched flesh; his powerful body promised to conquer any of her maidenly protests. The determined lovely didn't have enough cash to leave her remote mountain spot unminded a whole winter, and even though she knew she should never consider spending three weeks on the trail absolutely alone with such a man, Harmony had no choice but to put her fate in his hands.",
