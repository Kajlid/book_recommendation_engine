Now he’s a corporate spook chasing down the information traffickers who’ve turned business into all-out war.But beneath the surface skirmishes lurks something darker—rumors of a biological supercomputer that threatens to shift the balance of power between man and machine. Now Cray is caught in the cross fire between the corporate Collective and a shadowy fanatical anti-tech cult called Inru . With an assassin on his trail and a devastating secret locked in his mind, Cray must turn to the hammerjack who’s been his most dangerous, most elusive quarry. Together they are on the deadliest mission of Cray’s life–-to destroy the god that man made.",
