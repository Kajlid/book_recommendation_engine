  "description": "Keith O'Leary thought his dreams had come true. He went from aspiring actor to celebrity thanks to his starring role as one half of a gay couple on a top cable television drama. And while playing lover on screen to Carl Bronson, Keith discovered an attraction that grew into a loving, trusting relationship with his co-star. Carl Bronson knows that image and perception are everything in Hollywood and although life would be easier if they did admit they are a couple as his lover Keith wants, Carl knows that for either of them have any chance of becoming leading men in motion pictures they must pretend, at least in public, to be straight. Now more than ever, as someone on the inside feeds details of their personal life to the tabloids, secrecy is even more crucial. Will Carl have to choose between love and career? Book two in G.A. Hauser's Action! series, featuring the scorching return of the charismatic and devastatingly handsome Mark Richfield and friends, drags Hollywood's hypocrisy regarding homosexuality out of the closet and shows that, sometimes, the only way to survive in the game is by Playing Dirty.",
