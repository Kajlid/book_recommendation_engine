  "description": "David Berman is a young Virginian poet with a sly,intense regard for the past. He comes on like a prankster, restocking the imperial orations of Wallace Stevens and the byzantine monologues of John Ashbery with the pop- cultural bric-a-brac of a new generation: \"I am not cub scout seduced by Iron Maiden's mirror worlds.\" But his words have an easy, eloquent gait; each line needs to be a line. The landscapes are crisply American, and history, especially Southern history, casts a shadow. —\nThe New Yorker\nDavid Berman's poems are beautiful, strange, intelligent and funny. They are narratives that freeze life in impossible contortions. They take the familiar and make it new, so new the reader is stunned and will not soon forget. I found much to savor on every page of\n Actual Air. \nIt's a book for everyone. —\nJames Tate",
