One Wife. A secret that will tear them apart. Tia thinks running from her husbands will keep them safe - but she never expected to have a gun in her hand, or to pull the trigger.

Giles sacrificed everything by coming to her rescue...now he's paying the ultimate price. The Lottery brought them together but lies threaten to tear them apart. Love may be the answer, but in this brave new world, it might not be enough. The Wife Protectors is book 2 in a six book dystopian romance series.
