  "title": "The Unseen Partner: Love & Longing in the Unconscious",
  "description": "For three years, Diane Croft had access to a hidden, animated realm described by C.G. Jung as \"the collective unconscious,\" where she took part in an initiatory process of death and rebirth, as told by countless others -- from Dante's journey to the underworld to Rumi's ecstatic encounter with the Beloved. Her beautifully illustrated book of Eros-awareness speaks the metaphoric language of symbol, art, and poetry. Follow Croft's uniquely embodied experience of a universal reality outside the boundaries of time and space, and discover the source of our longing for a wholly Other.Silver Winner, 2016 Nautilus Book AwardFirst Place, 2016-2017 Reader Views Literary Book AwardWinner, 60th New England Book Show AwardWinner, 2017 Next Generation Indie Book AwardFinalist, 2018 Eric Hoffer Book Award\"The true poet is the guardian of the archetypes of the culture's collective unconscious - not to invent, but to rediscover and animate.\" -- Heinrich Zimmer, IndologistIncludes 65 full-color images",
