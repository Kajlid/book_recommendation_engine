It's all there in \"The Vinyl Dialogues,\" as told by the artists who lived and made Rock and Roll history throughout the decade.Throw in a little political intrigue - The Guess Who being asked not to play its biggest hit, \"American Woman,\" at a White House appearance and Brewer and Shipley being called political subversives and making President Nixon's infamous \"enemies list\" - and \"The Vinyl Dialogues offers a first-hand snapshot of a country in transition, hung over from the massive cultural changes of the 1960s and ready to dress outrageously and to shake its collective booty. All seen through the eyes, recollections and perspectives of the artists who lived it and made all that great music on all those great albums.",
