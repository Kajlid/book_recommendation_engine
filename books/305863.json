Or the next love of her life. Either works. But a chance encounter leads her to discover that Garrett isn’t who he made himself out to be, and he’s more interested in hustling her kindly old boss out of his family business—and using her to do it.Furious at being fooled by yet another man and itching for retribution, Justine enlists the help of unlikely townsfolk to battle Harrington Group’s big-city development plans for Polson Falls. It’s all going to plan … until Justine finds herself crossing enemy lines.The Hustler Next Door is set in the Polson Falls world. Books in this series can be read in any order.",
