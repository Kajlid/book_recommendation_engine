While Trưng Trắc is disciplined and wise, always excelling in her duty, Trưng Nhi is fierce and free spirited, more concerned with spending time in the gardens and with lovers.But these sisters' lives—and the lives of their people—are shadowed by the oppressive rule of the Han Chinese. They are forced to adopt Confucian teachings, secure marriages, and pay ever‑increasing taxes. As the peoples' frustration boils over, the country comes ever closer to the edge of war.",
