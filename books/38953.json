  "title": "Evolution in a Toxic World: How Life Responds to Chemical Threats",
  "description": "With BPA in baby bottles, mercury in fish, and lead in computer monitors, the world has become a toxic place. But as Emily Monosson demonstrates in her groundbreaking new book, it has always been toxic. When oxygen first developed in Earth's atmosphere, it threatened the very existence of life: now we literally can't live without it. According to Monosson, examining how life adapted to such early threats can teach us a great deal about today's (and tomorrow's) most dangerous contaminants. While the study of evolution has advanced many other sciences, from conservation biology to medicine, the field of toxicology has yet to embrace this critical approach.In Evolution in a Toxic World, Monosson seeks to change that. She traces the development of life's defense systemsbetter management and preventative measures, but possibly treatment of current diseases. Development of that knowledge starts with this pioneering book.",
