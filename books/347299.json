  "title": "Black Skin, White Masks",
  "description": "Few modern voices have had as profound an impact on the black identity and critical race theory as Frantz Fanon, and  represents some of his most important work. Fanon’s masterwork is now available in a new translation that updates its language for a new generation of readers.A major influence on civil rights, anti-colonial, and black consciousness movements around the world, is the unsurpassed study of the black psyche in a white world. Hailed for its scientific analysis and poetic grace when it was first published in 1952, the book remains a vital force today from one of the most important theorists of revolutionary struggle, colonialism, and racial difference in history.",
