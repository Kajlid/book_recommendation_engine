  "title": "The Case of the Half-Wakened Wife",
  "description": "Widow Jane Keller is owner of an island in the middle of a river near Los Angeles. She is selling the island to millionaire Parker Benton, to build his new home. The island had an oil lease against it, which had apparently expired for non-payment. Promoter Scott Shelby tries to pay the back lease payments to reinstate the lease, but there is a legal question whether he can do so. Parker Benton would prefer to buy the island free and clear, so invites all the parties - including Perry Mason, representing Jane - for a cruise on his yacht to sit down and try to come to a friendly agreement. Due to fog, the yacht anchors for the night. A commotion is heard, and a MAN OVERBOARD alarm is raised. A shot had been heard at the same time, and Scott's wife Marion Shelby is found holding a gun. Scott is missing and assumed the one overboard. A search fails to find his body. Mason is suspicious he staged the incident and is now running off with his girlfriend, real estate agent Ellen Cushing - leaving his wife suspected of his \"murder\". - RM",
