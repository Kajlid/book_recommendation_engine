  "title": "The Apprenticeship of Big Toe P",
  "description": "The Apprenticeship of Big Toe P is a highly acclaimed work of fiction that won Japans most prestigious literary prize for women writers. A provocative, picaresque spin on a coming-of-age story, the novel tells of a young Japanese woman who wakes up one afternoon to discover that her big toe has turned into a penis. In learning to adjust to her new sexual organ, the heroine is forced to reconsider her body, her sexuality and her life. After fleeing from her homophobic fianc√©, she falls in love with a bisexual blind pianist who accepts her for whom she is, and together they join a troupeof performers--all sexually deformed and emotionally twisted men and women. Thus begins her apprenticeship.There are few novels that are equally praised by literary critics and scholars alike, and fewer yet that actually go on to become bestsellers, but The Apprenticeship of Big Toe P is both. It is a highly imaginative, intelligent work--first-rate as literature, as entertainment, and as a lovestory.",
