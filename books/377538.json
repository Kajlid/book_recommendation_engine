  "description": "This hybrid has enough Freudian fertilizer to swamp any Eden which in this case happens to be Flora, \"the Planet of Flowers.\" Freda Caron's fiance, Paul, has been seduced by a garden of giant orchids on Flora so instead of returning to earth, he sends her some singing tulips for her experimentation as well as young Hal Polino. Originally frigid, Freda blossoms while tiptoeing through the tulips with Hal. Through circumstances too bizarre to go into, Freda ends up with an orchid on Flora, gets pregnant and gives birth to a little seedling. A sorry transplant indeed.--Kirkus",
