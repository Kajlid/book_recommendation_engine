  "title": "Elvis Aaron Presley: Revelations from the Memphis Mafia",
  "description": "A monumental oral biography, Elvis Aaron Presley is the first book to capture Elvis Presley - the man and the phenomenon - in his full complexity.Elvis Aaron Presley is the product of more than five years of interviews with the three individuals who knew him Billy Smith - Elvis's first cousin and the person Elvis reputedly loved most after his own mother; the man who slept at the foot of Elvis's bed during his bouts of horrific nightmares; and, at the end, one of the few who continued to see the pop icon on a daily basis.Marty Lacker - the best man at Elvis's wedding and foreman of the famed \"Memphis Mafia,\" the handpicked group of gatekeepers and confidants who formed Presley's entourage.Lamar Fike - decades-long member of the \"Memphis Mafia\"; touring crew member; and the man who accompanied Elvis to his army posting in Germany.Together, these three were with Elvis from his teens to his last day on earth, and the story they have to tell - most of it never before on the record - is as complete a psychological portrait of the pop icon as we're ever likely to get.",
