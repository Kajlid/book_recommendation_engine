Simon, thirteen, is drawn by surprise into America's greatest magic New York City's School of the Ages. When the evil spirit of a bitter and scheming heretic from ancient Alexandria attacks, he must risk everything in order to save his soul. Kids and adults won't stop reading -- The Ghost in the Crystal. This is the first book of a multi-volume series. Three more novels and two short collections are available, with more to come. Revised and expanded second edition issued 2/28/16 features a new cover, various editorial corrections, and several pages of new content, including new characters and new scenes. Editorial \"There is a strong Jewish and biblical current, but it's about magic rather than religion, and the magic is impressive. I got the feeling I was attending the school by correspondence, and that the magic was authentic. A seemingly dull curriculum turns out to be otherwise. Simon has friends and enemies and aspires to romance as he struggles to make his way. This is good reading.\" -- Piers Anthony, world-famous fantasy author Feel free to contact Matt (that's me) for reader to author conversation via my Facebook fan page. twitter @schoolofthages Matt Posner is the author of School of the Ages series, of How to Write Dialogue (a fun manual for writers) a very adult novel, Squared Circle Blues (about professional wrestling in the 1980s) and, with Jess C.
