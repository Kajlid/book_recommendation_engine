But he only has three days to convince her of his devotion because he stupidly proposes a wager - he'll convince Sidony to marry him by Christmas or he'll leave her alone forever. When Hale sets out to seduce her, the stakes are raised by a passion so intense that Sidony must risk her heart no matter the odds. * Previously published in A Very Scandalous Holiday Anthology",
