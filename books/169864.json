  "title": "Dear Lover,",
  "description": "Dear Lover, is a poetry collection about hope and heartbreak, about love in its short, long, and temporary forms, about how love can be cloaked in abuse, how love can build us or break us, the hard and soft of it, the good, the bad, and the completely atrocious.Written in letter format, the poetry includes a couple sonnets, a villanelle, and a pantoum among the formal verse poetry, but a lot of it is an experimentation with prose poetry, though it includes lots of free verse also.",
