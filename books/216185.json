  "description": "The war pulled them apart; their deaths brought them back together. Will Henry and Olivia’s love be strong enough to reach beyond death to bring Annie and John together? Can they hold onto trust, faith, and each other to reach their happily ever after? They must act—and soon, but first, Henry and Olivia must witness their own funerals. For 45 years, psychic medium Tobie Hewitt has helped the bereaved to reach out to their loved ones on the other side of the veil, providing verifiable details from the “deceased” and comfort to her clients. In Passing presents these ideas in the form of a paranormal romance.",
