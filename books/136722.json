  "description": "Two extraterrestrials transform the consciousness of a depressed male human and accidentally set up earth and humanity for total annihilation.Just how far would you go to escape your cubicle?Would you risk your life and break Intergalactic Federation laws to do so?N and his clone N2 work in cubicles on a space station run by the intergalactic corporation, Zycorp. Along with other planetary interests, Zycorp holds the patent on human DNA. Similar to the way that humans experiment on animals, Zycorp experiments on humans... and has done so for a very long time.There is an ongoing dispute among many alien races concerning such experimentation and the overall treatment of humans by their alien patent-registered owners. Whether humans have an evolved consciousness or not is hotly debated, especially as Zycorp now has plans to eradicate humanity entirely.In an attempt to stave off boredom, our two bumbling cublicle workers interfere with a human subject (using a stolen technology that they don't understand). What they don't know is that their actions have major repercussions—not just for Zycorp— but for the entire galaxy and all life in the universe. You do not have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this romp through the known universe and beyond.",
