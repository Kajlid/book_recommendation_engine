  "title": "The Tale of Kore",
  "description": "In the heart of academia, Corey, an ambitious master’s student, yearns for a life beyond the confines of dusty books and lectures. After making a fateful wish, Corey becomes a key player in a cosmic drama that unfolds following a re-enactment of an Ancient Greek mystery cult dedicated to Demeter and Persephone. Whisked away to the shadowy depths of the Underworld, Corey discovers a world teetering on the brink of chaos. Dark forces stir, with ancient gods either missing or perishing. To restore balance, Corey must brave the labyrinthine passages of the Underworld, confront mythical beasts, and uncover long-buried truths to revive the goddesses of justice, memory, and spring—before true darkness takes hold.",
