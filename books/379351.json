  "description": "Sometimes the only way to find yourself is to leave behind everything you’ve ever known…When Doran Seeger suddenly faces loss of family, friends, job, and confidence he decides to take a little break from the life he has known working in the Defense Industry designing guidance systems for ‘Smart’ bombs with an extended trip to Europe. Traveling light with just two changes of clothing and a pocketful of traveler’s checks, he is free to wander wherever his instincts lead him. From an encounter with anarchists in Amsterdam to a love affair in the Swiss Alps to the land the gods chose as their home, the itinerant is gradually drawn out of reticence by an unlikely love affair and by a culture that still embraces real Greece.",
