  "description": "Suzy (Carol Denise Brown) was the 6th child out of 16 children. Her father seldom lived at the home. From the day she was born her mother seemed to hate her more than any of the other children. Their older brother was in charge of the kids when their mother was at work. He was very abusive at times, more so than their mother. Suzy was abused, not only by her family, but by her classmates as well. It's a sobering novel overall about survival. Unfortunately, it's a timely subject written to heal.",
