  "description": "Unnamed – without a name; nameless. Not indicated or mentioned by name; unidentified, unknown.Many people feel lost in a sea of humanity, just another unknown face in the crowd. We all have our stories of feeling nameless. The world can be such a lonely place, yet there is One who knows your name and loves you forever.Inside these pages, each devotion is written to help you along the journey, to know God better, and know how very loved you are by God. No matter how alone you feel and how unnoticed, God knows your name. He loves you. He knew you before you were even born. He knit you together in your mother’s womb and knows you so intimately he knows the number of hairs on your head. You are so very known and so very loved.",
