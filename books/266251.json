  "description": "Have you ever had that one guy that you shouldn’t have had such a crush on, but still did? Matthew Hawkins was that man for me. First, he was off-limits, and second, I was just a gangly teenager the last time he saw me. But a lot can change in ten years.As one of the best defensive players in the league, he just came out of retirement to sign with the team that I work for. And as the publicist for the Washington Wolves, he’s so good, it makes my job easy peasy.In the years since I’ve seen Matthew, he’s bigger, better looking, and best of all—completely single. And despite our strange history, the attraction between us definitely isn’t one-sided anymore.The chemistry between us is complicated—and hot. Hot enough to burn down the entire city of Seattle, which is why keeping it a secret from the press—and my family—is the only way we can be together.But the truth always comes out. And when it does, there’s no predicting the ending.",
