  "description": "HOME TO OBLIVION is a story about friendship and survival, a supernatural adventure filled with mystery and suspense, and a tale of a boy who is forced to forge his way to a new reality under the most unreal circumstances.The story leads the reader from a pivotal Revolutionary War sea battle to a mysterious island where time seems irrelevant. Narrator Prescott Fielding, a 12-year-old boy from the 18th century, is washed ashore onto a volcanic island, where he befriends Caleb Thompson, a seventeen-year-old Vietnam War era U. S. Marine. How can two people born 200 years apart exist together at one time? Are they living in a time warp? Outside of time? Or is it the afterlife?Just as they work through their differences in perspectives, and as their friendship begins to flourish, a young World War I British Army code-breaker suddenly appears and upsets the balance.A series of events--both natural and unnatural--convince the characters to travel inland to seek answers about the mysteries of the island. Prescott soon discovers the function of the island is far more dangerous than he ever could have imagined, and standing between him and his dream to go home is a powerful and evil force.",
