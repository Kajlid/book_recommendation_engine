  "description": "He thinks that he is a god, he wants to be treated like a god, but really he doesn't have a clue. Aten never thought that a simple mistake like forgetting to fill up at the last intergalactic service station could lead to such a mess. He is now stuck in one of the hottest, dustiest parts of an obscure planet called Earth trying to find a large quantity of the precious commodity that he needs to make enough fuel to get him across the galaxy to join his wicked Uncle Lucie in conquering the Universe.But the gold that he so desperately requires is kept securely locked away in the depths of the great temple of Karnak in ancient Thebes and is protected by scores of priests, guards and powerful magic spells. So will Aten be able to outwit the powerful high priest Neferhotep and get into the temple? Will his ‘abilities’ be enough to cut through the obstacles in his path or will the travelling companions that he has picked up along the way let him down as usual?Suitable for young adults and fantasy readers of all ages ‘Pharaoh’s Gold’ is the first part of the Aten Sequence that follows the adventures of an immortal called Aten and his companions, Druitt the half man/half dog, Luke a teenager from the 21st century, Tuy a fiery Galasian Cocktail Waitress and an irrepressible computer that calls itself Zoom in their search for fuel an freedom. But as Aten plots and tries to manipulate his way around the glittering royal court of the mighty Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, he underestimates the powerful forces that are ranged against him. This is one quest that just might not be as easy as he thought and he is faced with the prospect of being stuck in this technology free hell forever.",
