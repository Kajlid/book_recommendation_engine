  "description": "It's a Christmas wedding for Daddy William and his little, Haley.  The final chapter in their story is one with a little pink, lots of bows, and lots of Daddy's attention.  Warning: Their happily ever after is filled with full-time DD/lg play as William and Haley embrace their lifestyle with open arms. If being innocent at Christmas is a dream come true, then this is the novella for you!  NOTE: Innocent Christmas can be read as a standalone but might be more enjoyable after reading Owning Her Innocence & Innocent Getaway.",
