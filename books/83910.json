  "description": "Gwendolyn Braxton was born in the wrong century. She submerges her life into the study of the Renaissance Era. She is the resident expert on all things Arthurian in the DC Metro area, maybe even the U.S. Unfortunately, none of her knowledge helps her to find her own Knight in Shining Armor. Actually, as a Black woman in Washington D.C., it runs men off like the plague. To make things worse, her mother has stepped in to fix her before she plunged into spinsterhood.Morien Knight is far from home in search of an artifact lost in history, a history he longs to emerge himself back into. His small sabbatical from his mission to participate in the Kentland Castle Resort Renaissance Faire might lead him to exactly where he belongs. Morien learns when dealing with the poetic lessons of his old friend, Merlin, things may not always exist as you expect.",
