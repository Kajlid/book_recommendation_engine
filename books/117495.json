  "title": "Dante's Divine Comedy: Boxed Set",
  "description": "Hailed by the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" as \"a work of profound satiric fury\" and by \"Bookpage\" as \"funny and deeply affecting,\" Birk and Sanders' masterwork is now available for the first time in a substantial and sumptuous slipcased set. The pair's innovative and authentic adaptation of Dante's epic, coupled with Birk's striking play on Gustave Dor's classic illustrations, make this a \"Divine Comedy\" for the 21st century. Acclaimed by both the literary and art worlds; rife with contemporary turns of phrase and slang (just as the original poem was written in the vernacular of its day) and pointed visions of the afterlife as contemporary cities; and rich with bold allusion, cultural critique, and witthis is the must-have collection of modern classics.",
