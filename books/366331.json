  "description": "What if the Japanese had developed an atomic bomb at the end of World War II? And one was still around? It was born five decades ago in war. It has been launched from the heart of foreign power. And it has been primed by betrayal and fanaticism. While America sleeps, while homegrown terrorists are unwittingly manipulated by an unknown master, a hyper-weapon approaches San Francisco Bay. And only one man has any chance of stopping it. Trained to kill with any weapon-- from his fists to a Hush Puppy silenced pistol-- the man called Lake has the green light to penetrate domestic militia cells and make his own calls, anywhere, any time. But when Lake intercepts an act of terror on the Golden Gate Bridge, he ignites an incredible hunt; a race against time, betrayal and an enemy more dangerous than Lake or his handlers could guess.",
