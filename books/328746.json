  "title": "The Life and Times Of....: Researching and Writing American Local History",
  "description": "Local History and family history have become the fastest growing segment of historical research and writing over the last thirty years. Even with this newfound popularity, there are still almost no books available that offer a solid, hands-on approach to the application of professional historical techniques and processes to 'doing local history' in the United States. The Life and Times of...Researching and Writing American Local History is a practical guide to developing a local history of a neighborhood, town or a county, or drawing the history of a family using nuts-and-bolts instruction in methods, resources and techniques used by professional historians to recreate the past and bring dry facts and figures to life.",
