  "description": "From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Eden Bradley~the stunning conclusion of her tale of ultimate surrender found in Book One of The Training House Series, GIRL and Book Two BOY!  Being broken has never been such beautiful torture… I am no longer the Master, but simply Damon. I am reeling with shock. Love. The urgent desire to please the only man who could ever Master me—the wickedly beautiful Christopher. I know this because he once belonged to me. How do I cope with this unexpected, yet inevitable turn of events? How can I give myself over in the way I must? Perhaps because it is the only way for me to have him. And it is the only way to be with our sweet Aimée.She is our love, and her heart belongs to us both. My new Master claims to love me, but I doubt him. Even more, I doubt myself. I must find a way, and the path leads me there only through complete and utter yielding, in handing over my soul. If I fail, I lose them both. A more cruel torture has never been devised. My heart breaks already, and it’s only just begun.~THE TRAINING HOUSE Series is Eden’s darkest BDSM story yet! More ‘erotica’ than ‘erotic romance’, there will nevertheless be a love story woven throughout the pages.WARNING:: These books contain very dark material that may be difficult for some readers. Do NOT try this at home!",
