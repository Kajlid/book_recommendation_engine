  "description": "“American Spaz The Novel” is a coming-of-age story with girls and love and death – fists and knives and guns. After going through double tragedies as a child Henry Kreiser grows into a teenager he does not want to be. It starts in 1978 in a suburb of Philadelphia and continues on the farms of a rural boarding school for disadvantaged children. It ends on the tough streets of Trenton, New Jersey in 1988.American Spaz is auto-biographical fiction by Greg Kieser and chronicles a decade of his life – from 7 to 17 years old - during which time he lost both parents, moved from place to place, and did whatever he needed to do to survive. As the youngest of six children he had many opportunities, during that decade, to rely on, and sometimes reject, the love of family.A newspaper article about Kieser’s late father speaks to “The Truth” behind the fiction. And, in the short film “How I Became a Spaz (and you can too)” Kieser himself attempts to explain his unique approach to achieving social and financial success, while summarizing the steps others can take. An interview with the author further allows him to elaborate on these subjects and share his outlook on storytelling. All three - the article, the film and the interview - can be found at www.americanspaz.com",
