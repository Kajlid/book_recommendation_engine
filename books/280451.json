  "description": "Charlotte Two years ago, my life changed. All it took was a lot of alcohol - mainly tequila - and my friend’s fortune-telling grandmother reading my future. Apparently, my life was going to change when I turned twenty-one, but she never said how exactly. Just so that I have no regrets, I’m working through my bucket list, and I’m adamant I’ll get through it all. And then I meet Levi Townsend, the man who tests my limits. That bucket list is now spinning out of control, and he’s making me wonder what if… Does it even matter though? Not with the big day apparently coming soon. But finding out that it’s all been one big huge lie, and that I was betrayed by someone I trusted? How do you recover from that?LeviWho the hell believes in that fortune telling stuff? Oh, she does!It’s just my luck that the woman I keep bumping into and can’t get out of my head is convinced she’s jinxed, and measures every minute of her day like it’s her last. Then again, maybe it is? Being a Townsend, I’m going to test her self-control, push her boundaries, drive her crazy… and I can’t wait.But, what happens when it turns from ‘just fun between friends’ to ‘this isn’t friendship, it’s freaking love’? I’ll repeat – I’m a Townsend. We’re determined, we’re loyal, we’re honest, we love deeply and we’ll drive you out of your ever-loving mind until you say yes.She says the betrayal hurts so bad that she’ll never trust anyone ever again. So, I’ll just have to change her mind!",
