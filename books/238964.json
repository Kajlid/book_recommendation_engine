  "description": "Nerd Queen, Aliya Grey, has been picked on her entire life for being different. She is done with shifter society. When the chance comes to leave the pack, she jumps for joy. But she didn’t expect that during the exchange of power ceremony, the super-hot and totally lickable, incoming Alpha would tell her he wants her. That doesn’t happen to Ali. Nope. Never.  Marcus and his wolf know Aliya is the one. Giving up his playboy lifestyle attests to how badly he wants her. Ali might be a half-breed, but that doesn’t matter. No way is he letting her leave. A little stalking, a bit of seduction and a whole lot of time together will get her to change her mind. He’s confident.  Unfortunately, it’s not as simple as romancing her. Ali’s done with the pack from hell and no matter how sexy Marcus is, she’s out of there. But first she needs to see him naked. He’s so big and strong and that grin…but she’s not staying. It takes an attack on Ali’s life for Marcus to see his pack has big issues he needs to fix or lose Ali for good.",
