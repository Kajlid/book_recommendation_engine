In the spirit of new adventures, she allows her best friend to talk her into taking part in the beta test of Sexperience’s new dating service pairing participants based on sexual compatibility.The experiment is only supposed to help Amerie get out of her comfort zone and earn some extra money, but when she finds out she's been paired with a man she despises, things get infinitely more complicated.",
