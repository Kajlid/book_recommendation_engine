  "description": "THE SOUND OF TWO HEARTS BEATING, JOINED BY A LOVE MADE STRONGER BY STRUGGLE, CAN BE AS LOUD AS ... THUNDER ON THE PLAINSLovely young heiress Sunny Landers was utterly devoted to her father's great dream --- a transcontinental railroad that would run from Chicago across the Great Plains to the Pacific. Accompanying Bo Landers on a wagon train west, she discovered for herself the glories of the unsettled country --- and met the rugged frontiersman who would be her destiny.Half Cherokee but raised by whites, Colt Travis was like the land of his birth: handsome to gaze upon, yet wild, imposing, dangerous. When he first saw the spirited, passionate daughter of Bo Landers, the man who'd hired him to scout the western territories, he knew she was everything he'd ever wanted in a woman --- but believed he never could have.Beneath a starlit sky, against an endless horizon, Colt opened Sunny's eyes to the majestic beauty of the land, then awakened her body and soul to an ecstasy she'd never dreamed possible. Together they would fight to settle an untamed country, uniting a nation that war had shattered --- but could they brave the perils that threatened to drive them apart?",
