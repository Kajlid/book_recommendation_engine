  "description": "Bianca wants to escape.She's been uprooted from her small hometown and enrolled at Evernight Academy, an eerie Gothic boarding school where the students are somehow too perfect: smart, sleek, and almost predatory. Bianca knows she doesn't fit in.Then she meets Lucas. He's not the 'Evernight type' either, and he likes it that way. Lucas ignores the rules, stands up to the snobs and warns Bianca to be careful - even when it comes to caring about him.'I couldn't stand it if they took it out on you,' He tells Bianca, 'and eventually they would.'But the connection between Bianca and Lucas can't be denied. Bianca will risk anything to be with Lucas, but dark secrets are fated to tear them both apart... and to make Bianca question everything she's ever believed.Praise from the USA for Evernight:'Stephenie Meyer fans will find similar rewards in the flashes of humour; the terrifying battle between ancient, supernatural societies; and the steamy romance in which love bites aren't just a euphemism.' - Booklist'Gray's writing hooks readers from the first page and reels them in with surprising plot twists and turns... A must-have for fans of Amelia Arwater-Rhodes, Stephenie Meyer, and the like.' - School Library Journal'Teenage love, ancient hatred and a Romeo and Juliet-style feud fuel the fires in this compelling first person drama.' - Romantic Times Bookclub",
