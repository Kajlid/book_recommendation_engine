  "description": "The Tim LaHaye Prophecy Study Bible (New Kings James Version in Hardcover and Genuine Leather) Under the direction of Tim LaHaye (co-author of the Left Behind series) comes a library of wisdom and insight from over 48 leading Bible experts of prophecy. Prophecy is history written in advance. It is God's way of telling us what will happen in the future. Considered the culmination of his life's work, Dr. LaHaye enlisted key contributors such John Ankerberg, Tony Evans, Edward Hindson, David Jeremiah, Zola Levitt, Erwin Lutzer, Josh McDowell, Adrian Rodgers, And dozens more. The Bible contains over one thousand predictions of future events. Many of these have already been fulfilled in special detail. The Tim LaHaye Prophecy Study Bible covers both aspects of prophecy and eschatology. It has been prepared by a team of biblical scholars committed to the belief that the Bible is the inerrant Word of God (the \"prophetic word confirmed\"-2 Pet. 1:19). The theological position of the editorial team is both premillennial and pretribulational. In other words, we confidently believe the rapture of the Church will precede the Tribulation period and the Millennial Kingdom of Christ on earth. Also - Full-color overview charts - Center-column references - Timelines of biblical events - More than 70 articles related to Bible Prophecy - Book introductions - 83 charts and tables - Bible concordance - Textual notations on key passages related to Bible prophecy Tim LaHaye, Edward Hindson Thomas Ice, James Combs Editors",
