  "description": "EVE has always played by the rules, afraid to take chances. HOLDEN wants to change that. She's certain they've never met before...or have they? Holden seems so familiar, but who is he? What is he? Yesterday her biggest challenge was trying not to bomb on her SATs. Today, paranormal forces have transformed an ordinary high school dance into a test of fate vs. free will and loving Holden could be Eve's end.*Author note: Since Fated Hearts is a novella, it is intended to be a complete story which is much shorter than a full-length novel. Therefore, it can be enjoyed and finished in one sitting. An excerpt of my full-length urban fantasy/paranormal romance, Entanglements, is included at the end of the ebook.",
