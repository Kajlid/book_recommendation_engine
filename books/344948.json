  "description": "A delightful story about a girl named Isabel who loves coffee, punky stuff, her pet iguana, and hates going to ballet class. There are fairies to lend a helping hand and a dark sorcerer Rashkai to battle. Will she complete the Fairy Book in time for... An amazing story-poem written by a mother-daughter duo in a new \"combination poetry\" style invented by a homeschooling parent Svetlana Kovalkova-McKenna, while teaching a poetry seminar one summer. In this book good old quatrains are blended with haiku, cinquains, senryu and a few other styles. You and your child can have lots of fun identifying different styles of poetry through out the story.The story and all the characters in it are very cool, especially since one of the authors is just 9 years old exactly like Isabel. Here is just a taste of what great lines you can find in a book: \"...They both dive for the bag. After an extra large cappuccino, Isabel has an unfair advantage. There are some things in our world that rival fairy dust.\"",
