Caretaker of the museum by day, by night he enjoys the sound of silence, broken by the occasional crunch of a spider between his blackened teeth. The Old Man, the respectable Doctor Ernst Frohlicher, his greedy dog Hans, and a cast of grotesque and hilarious townsfolk all find their lives thrown together as they uncover a crime so outrageous that it will shock the world. From its sinister opening to its explosive denouement, this dark tale blends lavishly entertaining storytelling with Rhodes's macabre imagination, entrancing originality, and magical touch.",
