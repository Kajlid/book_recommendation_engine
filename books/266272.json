Can Arthur Curry find the hero within in order to reclaim his throne?The tides turn for the Sea King as superstar scribe Kelly Sue DeConnick (Captain Marvel, Pretty Deadly) and red-hot artist Robson Rocha (Teen Titans, Supergirl) take the rudder to steer Aquaman into uncharted waters.

And as a lifetime of horror movies has taught us, there's something strange going on in this island village. Aquaman needs to come to his senses quickly...or he might wind up sleeping with the fishes instead of chatting with them.Collects Aquaman #43-47",
