  "description": "Fiction. Latinx Studies. Jewish Studies. LGBTQIA Studies. Women's Studies. In America, we're good at dividing ourselves into tribes--into \"insiders\" and \"outsiders\"--based on race, background and beliefs. But what happens when a person is an outsider within her own tribe? Serach Gottesman, the mathematically-gifted eldest daughter of a rigidly Orthodox Jewish Boro Park family and Paloma Rodriguez, the street-smart Bronx-bred daughter of a neglectful Latina immigrant mother, seek broader vistas within a relationship that is forbidden by both their communities. Love provides them ballast, but they find that some cultural bonds grip tight and some wounds run deep.",
