She’s a kid nuisance. A pity case he played catch with after her parents died in an accident. Dane Rockwell is a Rockwell—of the felons, frauds, and cheats Rockwells in town. How can he possibly ask Brooke Chadwick—of the upstanding, reputable Chadwicks in town—to consider him worthy? Now Dane is back in town with three things: a ring in his pocket, a kiss burning on his mouth for her, and a law degree to prove his worthiness. Brooke is about to say yes to a proposal, but not Dane’s. Disappointment looms. But when Brooke gets notice to attend a reading of a stranger’s will with her legal counsel, Dane is her only option for a lawyer, and it might be Dane’s only chance to earn her trust. With themes of love, loss, second chances, an inheritance from a stranger, beautiful beach scenes on the Chesapeake Bay, baseball games, Babe Ruth, antique collectibles, a gripping court case, betrayals, and lots of romantic kisses and chemistry, this book's plot twists and turns through Dane and Brooke's lives--as Brooke learns to trust, and Dane learns about self-will. Wills & Trust is a new standalone romance in the bestselling Legally in Love Collection by Jennifer Griffith.",
