  "description": "A standalone gripping mystery which can also be read as a sequel to `The Messiah Stone`As usual,the brilliant Civil War surviving duo based on the real-life Catriona and Kate are sent against a familiar cult so destructive it could be responsible for everything up to and including World War2 and all of our economic problems today.As usual,they have to defeat it with no crimelab facilities and along the way save numerous victims from the grisly doom which befalls so many others.As always,everything which at first seems supernatural turns out to have a perfectly logical explanation.",
