Not that Roxane has fallen in love but the one man she found interesting has crossed from her personal life into her professional one which makes life complicated.Parker Williams doesn’t take no for an answer, not that Roxane would deny him anyway.He has his own set of rules that must be followed while hers are being crossed through like a to-do list.When a person falls in love, it’s supposed to be easy but it’s much more complex than either realized it could be.Roxane’s control is slipping along with every opinion she had about love. This time, it feels different. This time, it finally feels right.Slowly she realizes how much is at stake, but she is only concerned about losing one thing—her heart.",
