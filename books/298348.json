  "description": "For all of you who couldn’t get enough of Xander and Greer of ‘The Light of Xander,’ this novelette follows the two of them in a new love story. Xander has tried desperately for years to avoid the radiant girl with the fiery curls. When he is subjected to her presence, the light within her shines so brightly that it threatens to tear down the stone wall that has long since been guarding his heart. If only he can make it to graduation just a couple short months away, then he’ll be free of her forever, and safe on the other side of the world at university. But it takes just one strict professor to ruin all his plans. And when Xander is forced to maintain contact with the very female he has so fervently striven to avoid, to his dismay, his resolve slowly weakens, and he finds himself at the mercy of his own traitorous heart.",
