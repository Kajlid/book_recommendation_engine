  "description": "Patton Jones has been deceiving Chase, Slade, and Devin Davis, but she's tired of playing the sweet, innocent, sisterly figure. When the brothers confront her with her lies, she decides it's time for the Davis brothers to see her as the woman she really is. Patton isn't the only one keeping secrets and the brothers fear that their own hidden lifestyle might be more than their little woman can handle. The brothers are unaware that Patton knows about their dark desires and is not the least bit intimidated. Knowing and experiencing are two different things. As Patton tastes small samples of the forbidden fruit, she becomes even more reckless in her enthusiasm to get the three brothers into her bed. Patton's wild schemes go too far and the brothers have to make a decision that will seal all their fates.",
