  "description": "When Rundy Purdy was twenty-four he began caring for his grandfather who was sick with Alzheimer's. This started a three year battle against inevitable decline, a journey across confused days and long nights. With compassion, hope, and a strong dose of gritty realism, The Sea is A Memoir of Caregiving tells the story of how a grandfather and his grandson crossed the wide sea of Alzheimer's. It is a tale of losses, but even more of things found in spite of what is lost. It is about giving bedtime stories, hugs, and a lot of coffee. It is a story of laughter even in the presence of sadness. The sea of Alzheimer's is wide, but it can be crossed. In writing that is by turns uplifting and poignant, Rundy shares his journey of perseverance and love. \"I laughed and cried my way through [...] it echoed things I went through with my mother and her dementia.\" - Alice Janice, Caregiver",
