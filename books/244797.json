  "description": "Join the Marcellos as they celebrate the holidays …  Cecelia wants one thing for Christmas, and Antony thinks he can make the impossible happen for her. Never underestimate a man who loves his wife.  Lucian and Jordyn struggle to make this Christmas perfect for their kids when life gets in the way. Someone waiting in the wings is willing to play Santa to make it all happen.  Dante and Catrina battle the stress of managing work and family through the holidays. Sometimes it takes the right kind of reminder from those who matter most to make it all work.  Giovanni and Kim have to keep everything together—from business to party planning. Not to mention, they still have to find something that will satisfy little Andino’s one Christmas wish.  A little family spirit, and a bit of Christmas magic come together for all the Marcellos to make these holidays the best one yet.  Merry Christmas from the Marcellos. It’s the only time of the year when they dust off the filth.  ~ Broken into small novellas for each Marcello couple, take a trip through the holidays with everyone from the Filthy Marcellos series. This novella is meant to be read as an add-on to the Filthy Marcellos series, and is not standalone.",
