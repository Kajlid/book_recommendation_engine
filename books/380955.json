Those who have taken her believe that nobody cares about her, and that no one will come looking for her. They are wrong.She is 'blood' to the killer Louis, the man who stands at the right hand of private detective Charlie Parker, and Louis will tear apart anyone who stands in the way of his attempts to find her.

It is conscious. It dreams. It is alive.And men are not the only creatures that seek it...",
