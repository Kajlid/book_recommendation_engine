  "description": "A narrative of penetrating beauty and deep introspection, Twelve Little Boats to God follows the journey of Benjamin Forrester after the sudden death of his brother, Sam. With nowhere left to turn, Benjamin reaches out to a God he is unsure of and asks for help through a series of letters. As he questions God and ponders the meaning of his existence, his Spirit Guide Andreas and his Guardian Angel Elyce look on and help us to understand the inner processes that inspire and carry a person forward. We are invited to discover for ourselves the avenues of prayer, mysticism, and the inner light and sound that reside in all of us. Both touching and inspiring, Twelve Little Boats to God is a prayerful exploration of how great adversity may open a Soul to the light that sustains it and aid in the search for meaning, hope, and ultimate joy.",
