HOW TO TAME A RAKEViscount Dangerfield had no desire to tie himself down at all, let alone to Wilhelmina-a skinny urchin, barely out of the schoolroom, with mousy hair, no bosom, and a hoydenish disposition.It was plain to see from the moment Wilhelmina Corbet arrived at his country estate that the devastatingly handsome Blake, Viscount Dangerfield disapproved of almost everything about her.STIRRING PASSIONSLord Laurence, Katherine Kilgarth's childhood best friend, has grown up into a very stuffy young man! Time was when he would've been intrigued by the strange goings on at Broughton Hall as she was, but she had no intention, whatever he said, of simply ignoring the intriguing mystery.LOVE AND WAR Selena Wakefield couldn't accuse Lord Devereux of paying her Spanish coin! Gyles had made it clear he had no wish to marry at all, but was constrained by his circumstances. She could not be expected to keep refusing Lord Devereux, she thought crossly. She was only flesh and blood after all. What woman on earth could resist the pleas of a man such as Devereux?",
