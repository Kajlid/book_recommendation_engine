  "description": "Reach for the scars... \nRemember me? Aeron Lore: happy and humble. A people person. All around nice guy.Even I can't say that with a straight face. But seriously, things are going great. Leo's behaving herself; I'm enjoying making sure she behaves. We're a great team. SilentWitn3ss, our live-streaming news project, has launched to my favorite things ever: controversy and profit. So when the FBI comes to me and wants to use SilentWitn3ss footage to trace a serial killer named Blood Honey, I'm only too happy to be superior—I mean, to help. And if Leo thinks the brutal Blood Honey and I have a few things in common, I guess that's to be expected, given my rather unique preferences in the bedroom. My...condition.But I'm not like him. I can't stand that she would even think it. If his actions threaten my relationship with Leo, I'll hunt that fucker down myself.If he gets too close for comfort, I will make him bleed—and trust me, he's closer than I ever anticipated. There's a food chain, grasshoppers. The buck doesn't stop with him. It stops with me. Blood Honey is a nasty son of a bitch, but I can be a lot worse. Question is...do I want to be?Note: LEGACY is a sequel and is not meant to be read as a standalone.WARNING: This book contains abuse triggers and some scenes that readers may find disturbing.",
