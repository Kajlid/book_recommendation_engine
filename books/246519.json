  "description": "What if George Armstrong Custer didn't die at the Battle of the Little Bighorn?What if \"Custer's Last Stand\" was actually just the beginning of a wild, gritty, Western adventure?In this vivid alternate history, George Armstrong Custer—the ruthless ex-Civil War general and cavalry commander—secretly survives the bloody Battle of the Little Bighorn and becomes a gun for hire in the West. Written as a long letter back home to his wife Libbie, Custer's story begins with his escape from Little Big Horn, a disastrous slaughter he suspects was engineered by a traitor under his command. After stumbling into a fatal brawl with a cowboy who insults the 7th Calvalry, Custer goes on the run under the name \"Armstrong,\" joins up with a traveling troupe of showgirls, and finds himself in the town of Bloody Gulch, Montana, whose desperate residents are suffering under the thumb of a tyrannical, renegade Indian trader.",
