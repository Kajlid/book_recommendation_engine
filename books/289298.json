  "description": "Two decades of running his own fishing boat taught John Michaud to expect anything. However when a family emergency leaves him desperate, he goes farther than he ever expected. If Clive Davidson wants to pretend John is an untamed stallion in need of a firm hand, the pay is too much to pass up. Clive Davidson has enjoyed the company of any number of submissives, but he’s never found one that can fight and still crave control. It’s intoxicating to find someone whose kinks line up so well. But just as Clive begins to hope that he has found love or at the very least sexually compatible lust, his enemies try to take it all away. Clive must give up something he holds dear or lose the man he hopes to tame to his saddle.",
