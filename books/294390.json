  "description": "A young woman's sacred journey of self-discovery set against the backdrop of two contrasting inter-dimensional worlds. One is Dystopian—in which humans ignore the repercussions of excessive industrialisation on Nature, and the other Utopian—where humans live in Harmony with Nature and each other.Planet Earth has been depleted, and natural disasters have wiped the land bare in a final attempt to restore balance and survive. All remaining life is contained in one City. A City of iron and technology where the citizens are safe but they are not free.Until recently, MAYA lived there in hiding, painting visions of a vibrant valley where nature still thrives. She's a Sëer, a Mystic, a Feeler... and a Rebel.Life imitates art when she sees the man she paints—a young, bright-eyed German officer, BJÖRN—who tells her the world she's been painting is real, and he's determined to find it.In a race against the Control and a quest for truth and freedom, they escape the City and cross dimensions to seek the help of a sophisticated race of beings — keepers of the Earth's sacred mysteries — to save it from total self-destruction... Only to discover they don't believe it is worth saving.",
