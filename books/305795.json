  "description": "Inspired by the Super Outbreak of tornados on April 27, 2011, this “opposite attracts” story of love, loss, and recovery will appeal to fans of The Sky Is Everywhere.The worst part about the tornado isn’t the car on Savannah Young’s roof. It’s not her missing mom or her missing cat. It’s not the news that the power might not be restored for ten days or the fact that she’s stranded with the neighbors.She’s out of pain pills. And she doesn’t have any way to reach Toby to get more.And when withdrawal sets in, she’s going to get very, very sick.As residents in Savannah’s subdivision come together in the aftermath of this historic severe weather event, Savannah wrestles with her opioid addiction, her grief for surviving the car crash that killed her brother, and her guilt for being The One Who Survived—twice.Falling in love with the boy next door has never happened under quite such stormy conditions.",
