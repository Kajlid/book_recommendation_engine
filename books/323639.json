  "description": "An Art, a Craft, a Mystery is a novel-in-poems which tells the stories of two historical women, Lydea Gilbert and Katherine (Kate) Harrison, who lived along the frontier of the Connecticut River in the mid 1600s. They were healers, midwives, farmers and ordinary women who faced the struggles and joys of life in a wild new land. They were women in a puritan culture, women of intuitive genius and healing powers, who lived through times where feminine power and the value of womenâ€™s lives was suspect and condemned. These persona poems create a tangible portrait of the lives of women living on the edge of a frontier, women with a love for the natural world and an appreciation of the feminine powers of creation, love, healing. Characters with steadfast endurance who find themselves betrayed by the abusive face of patriarchal power.",
