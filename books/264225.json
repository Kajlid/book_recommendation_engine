Until he involved himself in her family's affairs, Louise had really considered Aldo as nothing but a work colleague. Now that she had lost her job, she had plenty of time to think about him. She knew she was the last woman on earth Aldo would propose to, but she couldn't help wondering what it would be like to be Mrs. van der Linden.",
