So that she has to tear off her normal-person mask the second she gets home from school, and listen to her favorite pop song on repeat, trying to recharge. Selah feels like a dragon stuck in a world of humans, but she knows how to hide it.Until the day she explodes and hits a fellow student.Selah's friends pull away from her, her school threatens expulsion, and her comfortable, familiar world starts to crumble.But as Selah starts to figure out more about who she is, she comes to understand that different doesn’t mean damaged.
