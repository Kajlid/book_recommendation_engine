  "title": "The Wump World",
  "description": "The Wump World was a small world, very much smaller than our world. There were no great oceans, lofty mountains, giant forests, or broad sandy deserts. The Wump World was mostly grassy meadows and clumps of leafy green trees with a few winding rivers and lakes.But the Wump World was just perfect for the Wumps. They had no enemies and no worries and always had plenty of tender grass to eat and a bumbershoot tree or two for shelter from the dew. They lived a simple contented life.Then suddenly, smash bang from outer space zoomed a myriad of huge iron and steel monsters. Puffing fire and spitting smoke, they swooped down to land. Metal legs sprang from their bulging sides, doors flew open, and ramps shot to the ground. Down the ramps came hordes of tiny strange busy creatures. These were the people from the planet Pollutus. The Wump World would never be the same again.Bill Peet, through his uniquely humorous pictures and words, here tells a deceptively straightforward story about the lovely Wump creatures and how they became victims of persons and events beyond their control. The message is a simple one that will appeal to young and old alike for each of us to share to some extent the problems of the Wumps.",
