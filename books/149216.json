Identical twins Megara and Amara were separated by a demon attack when they were fourteen. Eight years later, Amara is down on her luck in the worst way. Between a stalker ex-boyfriend, a house fire and losing her job, it seems like her life will never take a turn for the better. Enter Tristan: a sweetheart who seems to show up wherever Amara is, right when she needs him. Though she is innately suspicious of him, he manages to succeed in gaining her trust. With his kindness and support, he teaches her to fight back when life tries to strike her down. But when she uncovers the true reason Tristan is so determined to help her, it will shake the core of everything she’s ever believed in and open her eyes to a supernatural world she never knew existed. A world that never quite let go of her in the first place.Meanwhile, Megara wakes up in a dark holding cell with no memory of the last eight years.

Why are Heaven and Hell so determined to keep her and Amara apart? The answer is more terrible than she ever could’ve imagined. When these two forces collide, which will prevail: sisterhood or fate?",
