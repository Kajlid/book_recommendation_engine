  "title": "Love and Betrayal",
  "description": "After years of waiting in the wings, Senator Brian Aaron makes a claim for the heart of Dr. Ashleigh Hamilton. This is to her pleasant surprise and to the anguish of Brian's best friend, Aramis Gravier. Upon his return from active duty, Marine Colonel, Aramis Gravier, can no longer deny his forbidden desires for Ashleigh, his god-sister. The guise of brotherly concern becomes uncovered. There is also one other force that Brian and Ashleigh must face together. It comes in the form of Ian Hamilton, Ashleigh's estranged brother. Ian is determined to find out if Brian was the cause that Ashleigh distanced herself from her family for years. Ian's digging causes all of their lives to turn upside down. ~~~~ Love and Betrayal is the second work of the Aaron Family series. Twisting the Script is the first. These works represent an offshoot of the now published Gravier Family Where Loyalties Lie and Like Falling Rain. A casting call has gone out for the feature length movie based upon, Where Loyalties Lie. My goal as a writer is to bring to both reading and viewing audiences upscale tales designed with romance, intrigue and mystery. The focal point of each work of fiction is to portray strong, yet fallible male characters in both the Gravier and Aaron Series. The ambiance of Louisiana can be found in all of my works.",
