  "description": "The Corsican Empire is rapidly expanding as all allied countries of Brogden are seized in unspeakable bloodshed. Their soldiers are described as creatures, forms wielding blazing swords and unknown magical weapons. The only mercy shown is to Corsican prisoner brides claimed on the battle field as trophies of war. Brogden's fate seems sealed as Elara, a serf's daughter, finds herself ambushed while unwillingly escorting a noblewoman to the capital for safety. Suddenly pulled onto a Corsican soldiers horse, she confronts the childhood tales of 'better to die than be a prisoner bride\" as a terrifying reality.",
