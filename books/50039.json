  "description": "Allison Ross is a twenty nine year old gallery owner in Chelsea who has life all figured out. That is until her father dies unexpectedly in a car accident. She is called in as interim CEO of his luxury jet company, RossAir and she must choose a new candidate for the position. Enter Alex Coventry, a brilliant southerner who would love the opportunity to show Allison exactly what position he has in mind for her. She questions his motives, but reluctantly accepts his help to look for her father's murderer. Alex challenges her in a way that opens raw wounds and forces her to examine a past tragedy she'd be happy to leave in the past. Allison pushes back and these two dance around each other as they jockey for power and try not to fall in love.",
