  "description": "There was once a prince who wished only to be left alone. Naturally, fate made him king! Quad, a bookish and backward prince, has been named king of the troubled kingdom of Redaemus over his brother, the heroic warrior-prince Gregor. Encouraged by his counselor and closest friend, a talking rat named Friend Rat, he reluctantly accepts the throne--only to find himself overthrown the very day he takes it. Now Quad is on the run from the villainous Solofaust, from rebellious armies, spies, and dreadful spirit-things... while the dark lord Demio plots an invasion from the frozen north. With only the help of a handful of loyal warriors, Friend Rat and a mysterious wizardess, he begins a quest to find the fabled Oneprince who, alone, can save the land.",
