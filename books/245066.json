A Loverâ€™s Pinch tells the story of consensual sadomasochism, from a controversial religious practice to a secretive sexuality branded a perversion.

Here, Peter Tupper reveals the true story of sadism and masochism, dominance and submission.From the ancient Christian flagellants to the Fifty Shades trilogy, the history of consensual sadomasochism is a story of fascinating individuals, unlikely connections and strange twists and turns. Meet Arthur Munby, the Victorian gentleman who secretly married Hannah Cullwick, his maid of all work, and called her his slave; and Jack McGeorge, the UN weapons inspector who was outed as a BDSM club leader just before the Iraq war. Explore the links between Robinson Crusoe,Uncle Tom's Cabin and modern BDSM pornography, and between fetish fashion and anti-Catholic propaganda. Learn how the 19th century middle-class household nurtured dominant-submissive sexuality. Discover the secret history of a hidden world.Winner, 2019 Geoff Mains Non-Fiction Book Award, NLA-International",
