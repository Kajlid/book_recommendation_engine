  "description": "More than a year after her ordeal, Emily McPhee finally feels safe…  Emily’s psychological scars are healing. Things are great between her and OPD Officer Seth Connors, and her biggest problem is the X-rated Halloween decorations her best friend Pete has placed all around her house.  If only it would stay that way…  Seth senses something isn’t right, but he doesn’t know where the danger is coming from…or why. He’s sure Emily’s neighbor, Travis McKay, is hiding something, and the man pays way too much attention to Emily.  To make things even more complicated, a new female officer appears to have her sights set on Seth, and fellow officer Alexander Avery has some sort of connection to a mysterious brothel employee. Seth has a feeling all these odd things are somehow connected—but he knows he’s missing a huge piece of the puzzle.  Pull at a thread and everything unravels.  Emily’s mother shows up with a surprise and a dirty plan to force her to sell the family home…and Seth’s father is proven to be the deceitful monster he always believed him to be. Lasko’s tainted past and twisted family ties turn out to be more complex than they ever imagined.  Every lie has a consequence, and Seth and Emily need the truth.  In order to escape with their lives and their love intact, they must answer one critical question…  Who is the real target in this deadly game?",
