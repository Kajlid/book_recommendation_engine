  "description": "Have you been attacked by a great white shark? Gone over Niagara Falls in a barrel? Been exposed to anthrax? No, you haven't, or you'd be dead. This Will Kill YouÂ reveals the intriguing facts behind the many ways humans bite the dust in encounters with deadly bugs, hungry predators, natural disasters, and freak occurrences. Thoroughly researched and illustrated, not to mention thoroughly hilarious, this book describes in deathly detail what happens to the body when itâ€™s struck by lightning, slimed by a dart frog, or flung from a mountaintop.\nNo other book has ever peaked under the Grim Reaper's robe in such a straightforward and irreverent way. WithÂ a foreword by a physician at the Mayo Clinic, an afterword by a funeral director, lists of historyâ€™s most notable deaths, and a unique death rating system,Â everything you need to know about the ways in which we go are included in these pages.",
