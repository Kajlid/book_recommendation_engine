  "description": "Pearson, Alpha of the Bound and Bonded Pack, had always wanted to find his mate. But as an Alpha he had always assumed the man he would be paired with would be a submissive. But when Dante appears in his office hoping to be accepted into the pack, he is anything but the submissive Pearson had believed was his Fated lover. Dante has a past of his own, and while he didn't try to hide it from his Fated Mate, he should have known it was going to cause problems. If Dante's pride didn't stop this mating from happening, then events outside of the Bound and Bonded pack just might. Getting the promise of a HEA was going to be a lot more difficult for these two men, than it should have been. This book is about male gay wolf shifters. Although set in a BDSM club there are no actual scenes of BDSM in this particular title. However there are scenes of M/M sex. If this is not something you are into then this book is not for you.",
