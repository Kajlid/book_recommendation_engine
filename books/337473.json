But she’s nothing like the women he dates—glamorous, exciting, spotlight-ready. Instead, she’s stuck in the best-friend role and can’t seem to find a way out of it. Until a scheduling mix-up finds her enrolled in a strip-aerobics class. Now this buttoned-down wallflower is finding her wicked side—and liking it! Carter can’t understand what’s happened to his best bud. She’s gone from sweet to sexy in ten seconds flat—and Carter’s lucky enough to be around for the ride of a lifetime. But he knows from past experience that relationships don’t last. He’s got to get things back on track before the most important friendship in his life is damaged forever. Problem is, Dani has no intention of going back to being just friends. It’s about time someone challenged Carter’s assumptions about love and friendship—and Dani’s just the woman to do it! Warning: This title contains the following: explicit sex, graphic language. \nThis book has been previously published and repackaged.",
