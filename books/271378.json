  "description": "Peter Clancy is in the US to see Stella Reimers receive a Pulitzer for the story he uncovered. As the newly-appointed news editor at her hometown newspaper, the San Francisco Daily, Stella convinces Peter to become its chief crime reporter. But Peter is tired of crime reporting, and wants to do more serious investigative journalism—hoping to earn a Pulitzer in his own name.Using crime reporting to open doors, Peter is soon using his new informants and SFPD contacts to investigate multiple leads that might result in that big story—will it be the unsolved serial killings, the hate crimes against San Fran’s gay population, or the dodgy goings-on at a new evangelist church?As his boss, Stella wants Peter to leave some stories in the past—including her own past. When the death threats start coming in from ‘the Flamekeeper’, Peter is more determined than ever to join the dots. There will indeed be a day of reckoning, but not the one the Flamekeeper has planned—not if Peter Clancy has anything to do with it.",
