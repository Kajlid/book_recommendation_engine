With each nocturnal visit, he became less a mystery man -- and more Kellen's very own fantasy prince. She longed to be held in his arms....One night, Kellen was sure her dreams were coming true. Strong arms encircled her in the darkness. But they didn't belong to her prince! Another man was kidnapping her......and taking her to Dominic Hunter. Kellen's \"night prince\" was as majestic as she'd imagined, and his emerald eyes made her feel safe -- until he revealed who he was, who was after him and why Kellen could never leave....",
