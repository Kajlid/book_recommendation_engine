  "description": "Deep in the suburbs, mystics walk among us careful to hide their unique psychic powers. They call themselves Sensers, and this is the story of one of them....THE SENSERS SECRET SOCIETY, Short #1Xavi has never acted against his powerful Sense before until it brands Lily guilty of a brutal murder in his courtroom in Radnor, PA, and he can’t or won’t convict her.The Radnor Sensers Secret Society is full of members with supernatural ability, and Xavi’s is to see sudden verdicts appear on people’s foreheads—a useful skill when you’re a judge.Until now, he’s never let matters of the heart impede his magical or legal duty to defend the law, but he also considers Lily the one, which is strange considering they’ve never even talked when passing in the coffee shop every morning.Is he losing his way? Should he follow the law or the truth? Do all guilty people belong in prison? Is it just the shock of seeing Lily in court that set his Sense off?Convinced he should conduct his own investigation into what really happened, he soon discovers the truth may be far more elaborate than he had imagined and it may also have set his human and magical duties on a collision course.",
