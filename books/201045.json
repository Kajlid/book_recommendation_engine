  "description": "Who will survive the war in Hagwood? The war in Hagwood has begun. Rhiannon Rigantonan, the ruthless High Queen of Faerie, fights not only for her own immortality and her iron rule over Hagwood, but also to serve her most far-reaching to conquer every corner of the known world. While the enchanted casket that holds the High Lady’s mortal heart has been found, the golden key that can unlock it—and put an end to her reign of terror—has been lost. And if the queen gains possession of the key, no one will be able to oppose her. Meanwhile, the queen’s long-exiled sister, Princess Clarisant, joins together with the diminutive werlings to combat the forces of evil. Vastly outnumbered, their only hope is a miracle. Always the reluctant hero, Gamaliel Tumpin is chosen for a special destiny, but it will come at a cost. As lives are lost and a bloody battle rages, the fate of Hagwood will be decided once and for all.",
