  "description": "Resistance is no longer an option... Faced with the annual family reunion in Lake Tahoe, Amanda Harding cringes inwardly like the awkward teenager she used to be, not the successful bookstore owner she is now. Once again she'll be bombarded by questions about her dreadful status as a single woman. And, like always, she'll feel the weight of her parents' disappointment that their only child isn't happily married and pregnant with their first grandchild.  As she relates her troubles to her good friend Leo, she's shocked to the core by his offer to pose as her soon-to-be fiancé. Then all she can think about is getting tangled up in the sheets--and with Leo's deliciously hard body.  Leo Prentice has always wondered what his quiet, bookish Amanda looked like beneath the conservative suits, but the prospect of wrecking their friendship has kept his dirty mind in check. Until their first fake kiss. Playing Amanda's lover seemed like a win-win. But the little bookworm stirs a fire in him unlike any other woman.  Soon, the teasing touches and sensual looks are all too real...and not nearly enough. Warning: this title contains a yummy construction man, a shy bookstore owner and a very naughty weekend filled with sizzling friends-turned-lovers sex.",
