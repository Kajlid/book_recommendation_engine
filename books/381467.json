  "title": "To the Slaughterhouse",
  "description": "Written in chilling detail, this novel describes the effect of World War I on a small community in Provence. In some of the most fiercely realistic and horrifying scenes of war ever recreated in literature, this story evokes the harsh, primitive conditions in the trenches as well as the loneliness and anxiety experienced by those left at home. The gradual disintegration of normal life and morals in areas far from the fighting grimly parallels the wholesale destruction of men, land, and animals at the front.",
