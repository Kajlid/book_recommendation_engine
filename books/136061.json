  "description": "Say Uncle\nA bratty middle meets his match in his strict step-uncle when he pushes all the wrong buttons.SamsonThere were other ways I could’ve spent my summer, but my sister’s stepson needed a swift kick in the rear and she thought I was the perfect man for the job. I’m no brat tamer, so being saddled with one wasn't my idea of a good time, but I can see the appeal when my… less-than-conventional methods prove fruitful.MatteoSam is an egotistical, cocky, rude, impatient jerk. He’s also my boss for the summer… and my stepmom’s brother—did I mention he’s hot AF? He’s supposed to be teaching me a lesson about becoming a man and respecting authority, but his methods probably aren’t what my parents had in mind.Say Uncle is an MM taboo tropical romance with MM+ play with no cheating. Features an age gap, a bratty sub, and a Dom who likes having his buttons pushed. Set sail aboard the Harlowe Two for a wild scorching summer adventure.",
