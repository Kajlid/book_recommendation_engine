  "description": "The price of secrets can be too highâ€¦ Amy is starting the internship of her life for a prestigious antiques dealer. She knew it would look good on a resume, but a surprise trip to Paris and an assistant who is determined to keep her around make her want more. She could make this into a permanent job. If it weren't for Caleb. He's returned to his grandfather's for a new job, even though he doesn't need the money after selling his company. She's up to the competition to prove herself, but soon it's hard to ignore the sizzling tension between them. Neither are willing to give in if it means losing the chance at the job, but their attraction may be too strong. They risk everything if they're found out -- and Amy has been keeping secrets since she arrived, ones that could separate them forever.",
