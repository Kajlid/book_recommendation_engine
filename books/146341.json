  "description": "How can anyone resist temptation when it's right next door?Riley County North Carolina has a lot to coastal views as far as the eye can see, and men in uniform who are even more gorgeous. Home to the most notorious prison in the state, Alicia's new hometown is crawling with men who carry their own handcuffs and know how to use them - like Officer Liam Alexander, her one and only neighbor. After catching him out of uniform, she can't resist pausing to enjoy the show. When Liam's Southern charm drives him across the property line, life gets hotter than the Carolina summer could possibly account for. Unfortunately, there's a dark side to life in the coastal haven, even with an officer next door.Coordinating special events at a historic - and supposedly haunted - plantation is enough to have Alicia questioning her senses and her sanity, but the spirits of the past take a backseat to a pair of escaped convicts who blaze a trail of mayhem across Riley County. Not even the most intense chemistry can survive the perils that make a sunny seaside town a dangerous place to be after dark ... can it?LOCK AND KEY SERIES Men in uniform, suspense and Southern heat. Complete series available Officer Next Door (Book 1) Officer out of Uniform (Book 2) Officer in Pursuit (Book 3) Officer on Duty (Book 4)",
