  "description": "Bella adores her sweet, patient and gentle husband Tae. She would do anything to keep him happy—even pretend to be something she’s not. She acts as if she’s content with their vanilla marriage but she secretly yearns for something more. Something darker. When Tae discovers Bella’s secret desires, he’s determined to fulfill her every fantasy. He devises a wicked coupon book full of naughty commands and fiendish challenges. From spankings to bondage to erotic play with household implements, he tests her limits. With each coupon Tae redeems, Bella sinks deeper and deeper into the lifestyle she’s always craved but never had the courage to demand. Now if they can just find a way for her to be the strong, independent woman Tae fell in love with and the quivering sub she is at her core… Reader Advisory: Tae and Bella find some very inventive—and erotic—uses for everything from carrots to home-improvement tools. Be forewarned—you’ll never look at candy canes or duct tape the same way again.",
