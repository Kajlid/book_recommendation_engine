  "description": "Van Gogh’s madness has found her. While attending a prestigious summer art school in New York City, seventeen-year-old Aya’s red paint attacks her skin, tattoos her, and enables her to manipulate the color red. The red takes over Aya’s passionate emotions, making her volatile. Color stole Van Gogh's sanity, now it's come for hers if she can't gain control. Aya is thrown into the dangerous world of Aolians, people like her who can manipulate the world and people around them. Dune, a glass-wielding Aolian, threatens to kill Aya if she doesn’t lead her to the Aveum, an ancient and dangerous artifact that Dune thinks Van Gogh hid. The Aveum could save Aya's sanity, or, if Dune finds it, could destroy humans and Aolians alike. On top of all that, she's crushing hard on a thoroughly human boy who can't know her secret.  Aya must choose between retaining her sanity, or saving the world from Dune.",
