When 57-year old Jane finds herself abandoned by her husband, she turns to her son for the companionship she so desperately craves. No one would suspect the twisted and unnatural events unfolding behind the closed curtains of her middle-class, middle-American home. No one would come to rescue her prey.Even as young Jack tries to fend off his seductive, manipulative and emotionally-starved mother, he finds his body betraying him time and time again. Trying to make sense of the senseless, Jack's physical and emotional health unravels as violence and lust hijack his world.",
