  "description": "Leland was sixty-seven years old when he informed a family confidante and colleague that he had stumbled upon all the principal deities of the Etruscans still existing as spirits or folletti in the Romagna area of Italy.Leland had already published five books on gypsy lore and language but when the present Etruscan book was finished, Leland regarded it as his greatest work, ten times more remarkable than Gypsy Sorcery and Fortune-telling, his unique collection, published a few years before. EvenHe stated that that Aradia, or The Gospel of the Witches, as I have given it, is in reality only the initial chapter of the collection of ceremonies, `cantrips,' incantations, and traditions current in the fraternity or sisterhood, the whole of which are in the main to be found in my Etruscan Roman Remains. First published in 1892.",
