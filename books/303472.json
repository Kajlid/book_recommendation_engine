  "description": "A sinking cruise ship, a salvaged portion of an experimental time machine resting in a life raft, and a lightning strike during a violent thunderstorm. That’s all it takes to tear Jamaal from 2021 His mother used to pay him an allowance to study his Bible and during those studies, he never dreamt the day would come when he'd wish to have a physical copy of that book again. Because one day, Jamaal finds himself permanently trapped sometime, somewhere in the distant past. He’s taken in by a community, educated, and put to work while growing to love his new family. There’s just one problem… he learns that he is in the distant past and that his loved ones are Canaanites living on the wrong side of the Jordan river. While he doesn’t have access to his Bible anymore, he recalls that he’s been living in a land “flowing with milk and honey” which God promised to the Israelites. They’re coming for his people and he already knows who wins all the upcoming battles. Brought to you by the international bestselling author of other time travel novels like The Mystic Saga, Saving Brooksie, Wildwood Shadows, Dominion, Erinyes, and Manifesto. Over 300,000 of his books have been downloaded worldwide.",
