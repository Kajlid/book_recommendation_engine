  "description": "The Baxter family once ran airboat tours in the Florida Everglades; life was simple and good. Everything changed with the black rain. It tainted the Earth, setting in motion a true zombie apocalypse. Most dogs died after the pitch fell from the sky. So did the alligators and crocodiles, but the ancient reptiles did not rest for long. Instead, they awoke hungry, falling in to feed beside the hordes of reanimated humanity. Now Cole Baxter, his sister, Lilly, and Dr. Georgina Lake are avoiding the predators on shore, instead traveling on a small yacht off the coast of Florida. Their only hope is to follow the voice of Micky Rode, a former classic rock disc jockey. They’ve suffered losses and have seen terrible, impossible things. Rode’s plan is to gather survivors in Lebanon Kansas, before embarking on a search for the chief of the Henomawi Tribe, Climbing Fox Wattana. They must force him to reverse the curse he claims to have set in motion. Hundreds of miles of dangerous ocean and unprotected roadways lay before CB and his family and friends on their journey to Kansas. The trip will be treacherous; the outcome, uncertain. No matter. To find out if Rode’s plan stands a chance, they must get there first. Alive.",
