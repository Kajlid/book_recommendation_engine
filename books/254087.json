  "description": "The Girl on the Train meets Before I Go to Sleep with a dash of Bridget Jones in this chilling tale of love gone horribly wrong …‘Some love affairs change you forever. Someone comes into your orbit and swivels you on your axis, like the wind working on a rooftop weather vane. And when they leave, as the wind always does, you are different; you have a new direction. And it’s not always north.’Any woman who’s ever been involved with a bad, bad man and been dumped will understand what it feels like to be broken, broken-hearted and bent on revenge.Taylor Bishop is hurt, angry and wants to destroy Angus Hollingsworth in the way he destroyed ‘Insidiously. Irreparably. Like a puzzle he’d slowly dissembled … stolen a couple of pieces from, and then discarded, knowing that nobody would ever be able to put it back together ever again.’So Taylor consulted The Art of War and made a plan. Then she took the next step – one that would change her life forever.Then things get really out of control – and The Sunday Girl becomes impossible to put down.",
