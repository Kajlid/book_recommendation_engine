  "title": "Great American Hypocrites: Toppling the Big Myths of Republican Politics",
  "description": "A takedown of the GOP’s deceitful propaganda machine from the blogger of Salon’s Unclaimed Territory and the author of the  New York Times  bestsellers  How Would a Patriot Act?  and  A Tragic Legacy.Ever since the cowboy image of Ronald Reagan was sold to Americans, the Republican Party has used the same John Wayne imagery to support its candidates and take elections. We all know how they govern, but the right-wing propaganda machine is very adept at hijacking debate and marketing their candidates as effectively as the Marlboro Man. For  The Republican nominee is an upstanding, regular guy who shares the values of the common man. He divorced his first wife in order to marry a young multimillionaire heiress whose family then funded his political career. Republicans are strong on defense and will keep us safe. They prey on fears, and their endless wars make America far less secure. Republicans are the party of fiscal restraint and small, limited government. Soaring deficits, unchecked presidential power, and an increasingly invasive surveillance state are par for their course.The ﬁrst book to dissect the Republican Cult of Personality and leave it openly exposed in its unabashed, shameful depravity,  Great American Hypocrites  is a deeply necessary call-out to Democrats to attack the GOP with their competitor’s very own weapons.Praise for Great American Hypocrites“Intelligent, insightful.” —Daily Kos“Glenn Greenwald has done it again.” —Alan Colmes“Glenn Greenwald is a treasure.” —BuzzFlash",
