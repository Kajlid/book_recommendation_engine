She’s pursued by an ambitious and ruthless Fae lord--marriage to her will help him become emperor. Rianne sees only one escape, to flee her home for the world of humans and Shifters. But for that, she’ll need a guide and a protector.Ben just happens to be handy, using his skills to help other enemies of the Fae. Lady Aisling asks him for the favor of his life—to take Rianne to a Shiftertown and look out for her, even if it means putting him in the most danger he’s faced since his final battle with the Fae. Rianne is reluctant to trust her fate to the unknown Ben, but she soon finds the human world, the Shifters, and most of all Ben, have captured her fascination, and possibly her heart.",
