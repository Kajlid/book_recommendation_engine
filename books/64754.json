  "description": "In effect the personal notebook of a distinguished and highly individualistic novelist and writer, this is an eclectic collection of more than 1,000 short quotations that have struck a chord with the author in the course of her life and work. Drawing on the works of writers and commentators from many eras, this beautifully designed book displays not only its author's wide reading, but also great sensibility, profound good sense, and fine, if understated, wit. A writer's book for anyone who wishes to live a fulfilling life.",
