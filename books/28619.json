  "title": "Joey Green's Amazing Pet Cures",
  "description": "From the man who knows how to fertilize houseplants with Jell-O and give someone a dry shampoo with Quaker Oats comes the first book of pet care tips that tackles everyday pet illnesses, quirky behaviors, and animal smells and stains by tapping into the power of brand-name products. The ever-inventive Joey Green presents fun and offbeat remedies for a wide range of pet troubles,from bad breath and skunks to hot spots and ticks. Who would have guessed that ChapStik stops a nail bleed or that Listerine can quell itching? Why not forego expensive and toxic flea sprays and use Dawn dishwashing liquid or Johnson’s Baby Powder as a treatment instead? Even though these tips sound quirky (use Smirnoff vodka to clean your pet’s ears?), they really do work because many brand-name products contain soaps, degreasers, emollients, and moisturizers to soothe, clean, dissolve, and heal quickly and safely. This fun-to-read book makes a great gift for pet lovers and is a practical guide for anyone looking for simple and easy shortcuts to live the good life with a pet.",
