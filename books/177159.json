  "description": "Trigger warnings: Vampire erotica. Explicit sex scenes. Copious amounts of blood. Some dubious consent, an ending that could be troubling to those who are squeamish about blood. If you don't love vampire alpha males who are also sweet and swoony nymphomaniacs, maybe you should give this one a miss...Kyla Spencer refuses to feel. Feelings are messy; they're painful; they hold you back. Due to a painful past and secrets she wants to stay buried she keeps everyone at arm's length. But then when she is abducted and presented as a gift to Tristan, a bored vampire prince who is destined to become a king, she has to face a few facts. Beyond facing that vampires are real Kyla has to face emotions that Tristan won't let her run from. Tristan is a vampire with a ravenous but insatiable appetite. For ten years he hasn't once had his hunger sated. He feeds constantly, looking for satisfaction, and because his favourite way to feed is to feed during sex he goes through a lot of women. But then Kyla is brought to him as a gift to celebrate a promotion and from the second their eyes lock he knows there's something different about her. After he gets a taste of Kyla neither of them will ever be the same.“Between the taste of you, the taste of your blood, and the way you look at me, I haven’t felt this… alive… in… maybe ever.”This book is book 1 in a trilogy and it does end on a cliffhanger. Book #2 has a release ETA of early Autumn 2015.",
