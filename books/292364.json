  "description": "In this fascinating study of the ways in which our ideas about sex and gender are shaped, Jamake Highwater shows that far from being the most natural force of our lives, sexuality is the one most susceptible to cultural influences. Each culture designates various practices as appropriate or inappropriate, moral or immoral, healthy or unhealthy. Author's TV appearances include the PBS series Six Great Ideas and The Power of Myth.",
