  "description": "GIATCOM from destroying society once and for all. At the vortex of this futuristic struggle is twenty-first-century inventor Dr. Ben Richards, who created a way to harness wind power, a clean and renewable energy that could have changed the course of humanity if he hadn't died under mysterious circumstances. The UNA sends an enhanced human cyborg back to 2017 to prevent the assassination of Richards, after determining that he is key to saving the world from becoming a nuclear wasteland. Meanwhile, GIATCOM is sending android doppelgangers back to 2017, to thwart that effort and capture Richards for its own purposes, setting up an epic battle between future powers in the past. A gripping climax between; 'UNA & GIATCOM,' Protagonist & Main Antagonist,' and the 'Future & the Present.' This final part of the trilogy questions, \"What does the future behold for humans, artificial intelligence and the environment?\" It also questions, \"How could our mental health be impacted, from natural or manmade disasters?\"",
