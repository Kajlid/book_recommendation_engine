  "description": "Never Ever...  Go Backwards. It was just supposed to be one night. One party to remind her of the good ole days, to remember what it had been like to have a family. It was not supposed to turn into a one night stand, and it was definitely not supposed to involve the guy every woman within a hundred miles had taken a ride on, or turn into more than just a good time. But his eyes... His dirty mouth... One night couldn't hurt, right?  Never Ever...  Get involved. Never ever, commit. The only thing he was involved in, was the club. The only people he was committed to, were his brothers. He had a roof over his head, a job he liked, brothers to share the good times with. Plenty of women who came through the club if he needed to get off, women with no strings and no expectations. What else did he need? But her ass... The way she shot him down... That sass! That mouth...God, that mouth...     Book ONE in the Perdition MC series, NO CLIFFHANGERS! Meant for readers 18+",
