  "title": "Animals Crackers in My Bed",
  "description": "'Animal Crackers In My Bed' is a non-fictional account of the wonderful and wacky animals that have shared my life, not to mention, upon occasion, my bed. There was Mike, an original shaggy dog story; Rebel, a Tennessee Walker escape artist; Chops, a lamb with an identity crisis. There were scaly critters who thought they were lap dogs; and a cat named Flower who terrorized the neighborhood. None of them considered themselves as just a critter'- all of them were unique in their own way. Many of these stories will remind you of your very own special friends.",
