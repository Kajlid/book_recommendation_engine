  "description": "How many times can a girl hear, I think you re cute, but let s just be friends? Guys either think Jane Harris is Plain Jane or cute, and she never knows if by cute they mean cute like your little sister is cute or something else. Once people take the time to get to know her, they find out there are many layers to her. Jane is sarcastic, spunky, and a little bit on the obsessive side. She also makes you wonder how one person s hard wiring can be so messed up when it comes to relationships.",
