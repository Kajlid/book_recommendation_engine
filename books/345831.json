  "description": "He was hewn from cruelty and violence. He felt nothing, he was nothing. He was wild, untamed, a shadow, a hand of death, a law unto himself. He had never known love. He had never felt love. Except... For the amaranth flower. Perfect, undying, beautiful. The only soft thing in his hardened world. The only thing he had ever held in reverence, and the only thing to ever offer him solace. He had never faltered in his assignments. His hand had never wavered. But that was before he'd been ordered to kidnap her. A woman of unique disposition, undaunted in the face of her adversity. A woman bearing the same name as the immortal flower he so cherished. She could be his greatest downfall...or his greatest treasure. About the Brieanna Robertson I have been telling stories since I was able to comprehend words. While most kids in the first grade were playing tag, I was the one all by myself in the corner of the soccer field pretending it was a gateway to a different world. For as long as I can remember, there have always been people in my head begging to have their stories told. I write love stories. Contemporary and fantasy. The world we live in is greatly devoid of love and true friendship. I write stories that revolve around these themes, as well as the overall message to be true to yourself. We were created as individuals. We should strive to be just that.",
