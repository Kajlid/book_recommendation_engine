  "description": "It’s business as usual in Waresville. And that business is spooky.  In the town nicknamed “Wheresville”, cash is king, and cash is tragedy. With its spooky tour buses, magical themed stores, and odd happenings, this hub of supernatural activity profits off of what goes bump in the night. Meaning, those creatures have free reign of the town. For one new-coming creature, the allure of Waresville is too much to resist. Unfortunately, in a town this strange, it’s hard for a Banshee to stay out of trouble.  After a scant five minutes in Waresville, Cillian Finnegan, newcomer, Banshee, and felon, falls in with a bad crowd: Harper Beck. Notorious in Waresville for her curiosity and inability to let a mystery go, she secures the Banshee as her new sidekick just as things start to get hairy.  People are dying in Waresville. Groovy and witchy Harper stumbles across the first stabbing victim by accident, and the rest is fate. After following a sting of murders all the way back to Ireland, the new duo can only make one conclusion: everyone in their small town is in danger.  With treasure hunts, new friends, old enemies, and a lizard that likes to ride shotgun on Harper’s head, this might be the most dangerous case she’s had yet. For her and everyone around her. Because Harper’s not just battling a murderer and the clock, she’s finding her footing as an expectant mother.  Lucky Thirteen Volume of the Harper \"Foxxy\" Beck Mystery Series. Approx. 50,000 words in length. It is a standalone (reading prior or future volumes not required to enjoy the book, no cliffhanger).",
