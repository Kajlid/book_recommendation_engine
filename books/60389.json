  "description": "Is it possible to punish a bad cupid with oral sex? When Jeremy defies Venus, she becomes angry. Not only has he taken Coco out of her reach, he also refuses to take his job as a cupid serious. He is stubborn, but she had to make him understand that every one of his victims belong to her. As punishment, she forces him to endure her magic tongue. If that does not work, she might have to give him more. But sex was not a gift she gave her cupids. When Jeremy is assigned Victor as his next victim, he laughs. Venus believes he will not like what he has to do to provide the other man love. Little does she know how much he really does when he discovers Victor has two friends who are also in need of his arrows. Rachel and Ben are desperate for love. Only question now was with whom. Could he refuse the m√©nage a trois staring him in the face? Mount Rainer would definitely rumble tonight.",
