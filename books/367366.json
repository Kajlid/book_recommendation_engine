  "description": "Taking place in the midst of the Deviations series, Ratchet shows Tobias and Noah at their playing games, having fun, and loving each other. What is a Dom to do with a sub who actually works with such handy tools as handcuffs? While the answer may seem predictable, Tobias and Noah know how to make any such scene their very own, and Tobias finds that police training is an instinct almost as strong as Noah's need to submit.Originally published in Toy Handcuffs",
