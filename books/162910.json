  "title": "A Meeting with Medusa / Green Mars",
  "description": "Taking place partly on Earth and partly in the atmosphere of Jupiter, the story tells of Howard Falcon, the captain of a new and experimental giant-sized helium-filled airship. When an accident causes the ship to crash, Falcon is badly injured and takes over a year to fully recover.The story was the inspiration for The Medusa Encounter, the fourth novel in the Venus Prime series by Paul Preuss.The pilot episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, entitled \"Encounter at Farpoint\" (1987), features a large, sentient, space-dwelling jellyfish-like creature similar to the Medusa creature in Clarke's story.The concept of life on Jupiter was explored in the second episode of Carl Sagan's PBS series Cosmos, which featured lifeforms similar in concept to those in this story.Clarke himself revisited the notion of giant lifeforms in the atmosphere of Jupiter in his 1982 novel 2010: Odyssey Two.A sequel, The Medusa Chronicles, will be published in 2016 via a collaborative effort between Alastair Reynolds and Stephen Baxter.",
