  "description": "Jessica Reed, a vibrant type-A-psychologist, is the ultimate planner: Acceptance to the Ivy League school of her choice … (check!) Graduating Summa Cum Laude and securing the ultimate post, as a sought after psychologist at one of the most prestigious hospitals in the world…. (check!) Marrying Nolan, the man of her dreams (check!)All is going according to the plan, UNTIL... is it possible? She’s pregnant right after her honeymoon! But, that’s not part of the plan. There are so many more things that are supposed to happen before babies. Are her dreams to start a private practice or Nolan’s dream to work for the Philadelphia Flyers crushed?When Jess finally accepts the obvious, she starts to unravel. Hold on for a wild ride through Jess’ brilliant yet quirky mind as she obsesses about all things pregnancy - morning sickness, weight gain, proper nutrition, kegels, home baby-proofing, pure exhaustion and honing her sexiness (let’s just say it gets a bit awkward). Along the way Jess’s zany patients, friends, family members and colleagues, manage in ways, both big and small, to contribute to her pregnancy fixations. Does her obsession turn her into “psycho-mommy”? With incredible wit and amazing perception into the human psyche, Mira Harlon keeps you coming back for more. This ironic, feel-good read will have you laughing and crying and wondering if we don’t all have a little psycho-mommy in us!",
