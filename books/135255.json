  "title": "Isaac Newton: Philosophical Writings",
  "description": "Andrew Janiak examines Newton's philosophical positions and his relations to canonical figures in early modern philosophy through Newton's principal philosophical writings. Janiak's study includes excerpts from the Principia and the Opticks, Newton's famous correspondence with Boyle and with Bentley, and his equally significant correspondence with Leibniz, often ignored in favor of Leibniz's later debate with Samuel Clarke. (Newton's exchanges with Leibniz place their different understandings of natural philosophy in sharp relief.)",
