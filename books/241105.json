  "title": "Under Satan's Sun",
  "description": "This new translation marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of Georges Bernanos's first novel, Under Satan's Sun , a powerful account of intense spiritual struggle that reflects the author's deeply-felt religion. The work develops a theme that persistently inspired the existence of evil as a spiritual force and its dramatic role in human destiny.Â This haunting novel follows the fortunes of a young, gauche, and fervent Catholic priest who is a misfit in the world and in his church, creating scandal and disharmony wherever he turns. His insight into the inner lives of others and his perception of the workings of Satan in the everyday are gifts that fatefully come into play in the priest's chance encounter with a young murderess, whose life and emotions he can see with a dreadful clarity, and whose destiny inexorably becomes entangled with his own.",
