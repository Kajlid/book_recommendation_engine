  "description": "The year is 1903 and Miss Cyrilia Hathaway has traveled across half the globe from the narrow lanes of Oxfordshire, England to the shores of the Caribbean Sea. She has come to Central America to learn the secret her late grandfather discovered in the remote Mayan ruins of Copán, a secret he kept hidden even from her.But her grandfather was not the only one with secrets, and Lia Hathaway soon finds her expedition haunted by an unseen adversary determined that she will never reach the ruined city.Accompanied by a trio of unlikely adventurers; a former Pinkerton detective, a disgraced cavalry officer, and a local guide of obscure origins and questionable loyalties, Lia embarks from Belize Town in a battered coasting schooner with a disreputable captain and an unsavory crew. Their destination is the mouth of a jungle river that will lead them deep into the heart of an ancient mystery.Guided only by the words of Grandfather's journal, Lia leaves behind all that she has known to enter a world of startling beauty and unsuspected danger.“It was a damn good thing that he‘d come along on this little picnic, Haskel told himself. Miss H. was pretty capable for a young lady but most of what she had was book smarts and that didn’t always keep you alive in a place like this. If they got into a scrape out in the jungle, Haskel wasn’t betting they’d come out of it in one piece.”With the publication of Skaar, author Lee Brownell introduces us to a most remarkable young lady—the intelligent, obstinate and resourceful Cyrilia Hathaway. Its memorable heroine and richly drawn cast of characters make Skaar a delightful discovery for lovers of mystery, travel, adventure and archaeology.",
