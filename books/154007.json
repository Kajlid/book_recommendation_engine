  "description": "The second book in the Malice series. With the land ruled by the wicked, time quickly comes to an end for man and elf alike. Only the Orc thrive. Only darkness prevails. Kressara must turn the elf to war, a war not of their own. An effort which has cost her the lives of her parents and brother, an effort not popular among her people. The small bands of humans await a leader while the people of the wastes stand ready for a fight to the end. Paladin gifted warriors rise to take up arms but lack an army to turn the orc. Trama, a human with a soul damned to darkness, seeks vengeance not victory. His desire for blood driving him farther into darkness with only a lone elf maiden holding him to the light. Only a lone elf maiden holding the scales between the world of the living and a world of darkness.",
