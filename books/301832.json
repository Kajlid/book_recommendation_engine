  "description": "Party like it's 1999. Wake up like a rock star. Save the day and still fresh as a daisy. As if! Not this Fairy. Not this lifetime. Not any given Sunday. Life is not a Fairy Tale. If you lose your shoe at midnight, you're drunk.Blurry-eyed, no coffee in sight, and tryin' with all my might not to beat the scales off my sweet Dragon's twin. That's a day in the life of Frangelica Francesca Fairymayweather - aka Me - aka Frannie the Fae.Time to buckle up my sweet little buttercups, Fate is gunnin' for my happily ever after, and that just won't do. With a mighty swish of my wings and a twinkle in my eye, I'm gonna lay the Fairy Dust on as thick as I can and kick some goddess bootay like I'm gettin' paid.Over the sand dunes and through the waves, to free my true love we go! My name's Frannie the Fae and I'm gonna save the day!If you love nonstop laughs, a ‘punny’ good time, and a Fairy with sass and attitude, this slow burn, paranormal cozy romantic comedy is for you! And, if not careful, Frannie might just remind you of a certain author you know. ENJOY! XOXO Julia",
