  "description": "The piercing, iconic semi-autobiographical novel of a domineering father and ambitious son, from the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Prince of Tides Step into the powerhouse life of Bull Meecham. He’s all Marine—fighter pilot, king of the clouds, and absolute ruler of his family. Lillian is his wife—beautiful, southern-bred, with a core of velvet steel. Without her cool head, her kids would be in real trouble. Ben is the oldest, a born athlete whose best never satisfies the big man. Ben’s got to stand up, even fight back, against a father who doesn’t give in—not to his men, not to his wife, and certainly not to his son. Bull Meecham is undoubtedly Pat Conroy’s most explosive character—a man you should hate, but a man you will love. Praise for The Great Santini “Stinging authenticity . . . a book that won’t quit.” — The Atlanta Journal “[Pat] Conroy has captured a different slice of America in this funny, dramatic novel.” — Richmond News-Leader “Conroy takes aim at our darkest emotions, lets the arrow fly and hits the bull’s-eye almost every time.” — Milwaukee Journal Sentinel “Robust and vivid . . . full of feeling.”— Newsday “God preserve Pat Conroy.” — The Boston Globe",
