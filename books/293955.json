Normally gregarious and good-natured, his spirit takes a leave of absence after he’s returned to Rio’s side. He’s unharmed—or so it appears. He never thought he’d revisit the dark side of his temperament, but it slides back into place like his favorite worn-in jeans. And what do you know? The damn things still fit.Maybe a little too well.If Rio can conquer her demons, she just might be the guiding light Grant needs. But will it be enough for them to finally have their shot at happiness?",
