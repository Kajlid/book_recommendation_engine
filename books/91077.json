  "description": "Timothy lived a life only a psychopathic sociopath could enjoy and understand. When he was bitten on the first day of the zombie-apocalypse he turned the tides on a single-minded virus he affectionately called Hugh. Together they terrorized a city before seemingly meeting their untimely demise. Nobody could have foreseen his resurrection. Tim's close call with death has done nothing to temper his missions in life, to live, to eat and to rule the world. Tim is back and he's an asshole.",
