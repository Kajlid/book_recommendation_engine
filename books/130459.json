  "description": "The Desperate Crew is back with a romp through resort island, Avalon. Aphrodite convinces Artemis it’s past time for her to get her V-card punched. Artemis doesn’t want any messy entanglements, has a taste for bad boys, and the sexy Mordred Le Fey fits the bill. Too bad he’s cursed by the Lady of the Lake.Aphrodite has had her fill of Love being used as a curse and decides to give Vivienne her comeuppance. She ends up with trials of her own when all she wanted was a vacation.Secretly, Vivienne thinks she deserves to be punished because she’s been in love with Arthur since she handed him Excalibur and engineered the fall of Guinevere and Camelot.Gwen’s marriage to Lancelot has been in name only since 1912—a fact that’s only made Avalon’s resident evil enchantress, Morgan Le Fey, too happy.Come along for the ride as these goddesses take control of their Fate (or so they think) and find their Happily Ever Afters.",
