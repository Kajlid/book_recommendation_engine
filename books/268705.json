But will Jack Winterbourne tear up the rules for a woman who maddens his senses and thaws his heart?A sensual Regency Romance with warmth and wit, this tale also includes a fusty valet, Lord Byron, picnics, swordplay, peacocks and...piskies.This book can be read stand-alone, but to follow Jack's story, it is recommended to read Marquess to a Flame as part of the Rules of the Rogue series.",
