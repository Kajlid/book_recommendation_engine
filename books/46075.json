  "description": "If you never thought about shooting your no-good boyfriend, you probably ARE a boyfriend and should not read this book except for cautionary purposes. Cammy May Hunnicutt takes that impulse to its logical conclusion--and the results are hilarious. Unleashed from rewrites and editing, the rather terrifying Ms. Hunnicutt reveals a dark, cutting wit that will leave fellow-sufferers in stitches.Probably the definitive book on the rationale, reasoning, procedure, ramifications, and euphoria or shooting one's paramour in areas most responsible for getting him shot, \"Considerations Prior To Shooting Your Boyfriend Right In The Nuts\" is a bid for respectability for this under-utilized, but satisfactory of maintaining a woman's mental hygiene.No aspect of nutshots goes unexamined in this seminal work, including choice of proper weapons, a Hall of Fame of successful ballblasters, case studies of justifiable nuticide, and all things considered about this rather exciting, if often misunderstood, practice.Ms. Hunnicutt joins historical satirists with ideas whose time had come, such as Swift, Orwell, Carlin, the Unabomber.If you have a boyfriend, or recently got dumped by one, this book is certainly worth the money...and your \"consideration\".",
