As Xhosa, one of the many black tribes of South Africa, Ellen and Thembe suffer the social injustices of 'apartheid', the government policy to enforce racial segregation and discrimination. As a white child Kristi is born to the benefits of that same system but forms a deep and enduring bond with the infant Thembe and see each other as sisters and equals. Ellen, tragically separated from her first born, Joseph, by apartheid rules and knowing heartbreak already sees the danger of this friendship for both girls, but particularly her daughter.As Joseph pursues his seemingly impossible dream, Thembe shows amazing musical talent at an early age and with Kristis encouragement, embarks on a sometimes difficult journey none of them expected.Thembe's Cloth is the story of that friendship, tested by apartheid and the transition of South Africa to a free and equal 'Rainbow' nation.",
