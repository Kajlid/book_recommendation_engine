  "description": "Zara is your typical princess, blonde, gorgeous and awaiting her prince charming. Except for one little slap in the face. Princess Zara is cursed with super powers. You'd think flying, super strength, and the ability to attract small, fuzzy animals would be awesome right? Wrong! Everything Zara touches seems to self-combust. Not to mention the fact that no boy wants to come within a cow's length of her. This poses a problem for her match making mother, who is constantly setting her up with freaky guys.Fly with Zara as she encounters killer unicorns, mutant carrots, dragons, and evil mermaids that kidnap boys. Everything gets thrown into the air when a new boy named Gunner enrolls in her school and actually accepts her for who she is; monster magnet and all. Suddenly, magical eggs from monsters around her kingdom start to go missing. It's up to Zara to try and figure out who is stealing the monster eggs and why. A giant omelet perhaps? Or something more sinister? You'll laugh your guts out as Zara has some wack-a-do adventures and you'll bite your nails as she encounters one of the greatest battles of her life!",
