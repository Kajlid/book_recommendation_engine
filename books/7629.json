  "description": "Communion is the story of Whitley Strieber's attempt to deal with a shattering assault from the unknown. To all appearances, he and his family have had a series of elaborate personal encounters with intelligent nonhuman beings in his isolated cabin in upstate New York.At first he thought he was losing his mind. Unconcerned with the whole phenomenon of UFOs and extraterrestrials, he viewed them as a false unknown, easily explainable as misperceptions or hallucinations. But the visitors marched right into the middle of the life of this indifferent skeptic.Who are these visitors? Where do they come from? Do they represent some as-yet-unidentified aspect of the human mind – incredible, almost beyond comprehension, but essentially human – or are they what they seem to be, visitors of unknown origin?Whitley Strieber describes the stunning effects of his encounter in the most candid terms possible. Frightened but fascinated, he faces the unknown with clear and open curiosity as he struggles to understand these fierce little figures, whose eyes seem to stare into the deepest core of being, seeking the very depths of the soul – seeking communion.",
