  "title": "The Princess Bitchface Syndrome: Surviving Adolescent Girls",
  "description": "A follow-up to Michael Carr-Gregg's hugely popular Surviving Adolescents. This time he focuses on the special trials of raising adolescent what to do when your previously quiet, beautiful and loving girl-child morphs into a restless, rebellious stranger who behaves like a responsible adult one day and a spoiled brat the next. He also explains how and why the PBFS has come about - how adolescence today is complicated by new factors such as 'KGOY' (kids getting older younger), loss of community, rampant consumerism, obsession with sexuality and body image, confusing media messages and the power of cyberculture. But parents need not despair, because Carr-Gregg has lots of sensible and sanity-saving suggestions to offer.",
