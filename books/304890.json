  "description": "Winning her heart is the greatest treasure of all. Rowan's journey west is supposed to be golden, as in California gold. Instead, she's abandoned along the way by her brother and left to fend for herself. Sick and with barely two cents to her name, she is close to losing hope. Just when she needs it the most, her salvation comes in the form of two incredibly handsome strangers. Edward and Garret take one look at their damsel in distress and decide she will be theirs. But Rowan won't give up easily on her dreams of striking it rich, and the men will have to convince her that the greatest prize of all is to stay and be their Bridgewater Bride.",
