  "description": "An honest and compelling memoir, Girl in Need of a Tourniquet is Merri Lisa Johnsonâ€™s account of her borderline personality disorder and how it has affected her life and relationships. Johnson describes the feeling of \"bleeding out\", unable to tell where she stopped and where her partner began. A self-confessed \"psycho girlfriend,\" she was influenced by many emotional factors from her past. She recalls her path through a dysfunctional, destructive relationship, while recounting the experiences that brought her to her breaking point. In recognizing her struggle with borderline personality disorder, Johnson is ultimately able to seek help, embarking on a soul-searching healing process. It's a path that is painful, difficult, and at times heart-wrenching, but ultimately makes her more able to love and coexist in healthy relationships.",
