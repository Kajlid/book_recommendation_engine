  "title": "Smoke the Peace Pipe",
  "description": "Smoke the Peace Pipe, also available as an Ebook and PDF, is a collection of poems by Roz Weaver inspired by the author's experience of trauma and how this settled in her body, sometimes as her own worst enemy. She encourages the possibility that we all can find hope and healing by showing up in the present moment, in the environment and with people around us, and through a shared appreciation of nature, spiritual exploration, and sacred connection with the Earth. By sitting and sharing a peace pipe with ourselves, we have an opportunity to bear what we thought was unbearable and make space for the possibility of a bigger picture.The 26 included poems bring every reader on a journey, from pain, trauma, and separation, toward recovery in the form of transformation, healing, self-love, and spirituality. The cover art by Joanne Baker was inspired by Rozâ€™s poetry, the feeling of emotion, ideas and words, ebbing and flowing like an ocean. All-consuming but cleansing.",
