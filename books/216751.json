  "title": "The Misadventures of Two Reluctant Zombie Hunters: Hospitals are Hell",
  "description": "Follow our not so reluctant Zombie Hunters on an irreverent and satirical romp through the Zombie Apocalypse. Nothing is sacred, and everyone and everything is fair game when it comes to KL's blades and even sharper sense of humor. They already escaped the Con, but not without injury. A quick trip to the hospital is in order, but nothing is ever easy in a Post-Apocalyptic world, especially on day one. KL, Roxy and their crew end up on a rescue mission at the local Catholic Hospital...and you know what that means. Nuns...Zombie Nuns, and they've developed a couple of new bad habits. This is book 2 of the Series....and like the Apocalypse, we expect this to be a long, messy ride full of twists and turns and a few surprises you won't want to miss. Carol Ann says you are all invited, and you don't want to upset that little girl.",
