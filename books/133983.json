Tormenting. Death could come for me. I didn’t care. My life was nothing without my brothers. So, I did whatever it took to protect them. I waited. I watched. I tormented, tortured, and executed. And in the end, the trail of blood led me to her. She and her young daughter had fallen on hard times. I had a hand in that, so I offered them a place to stay. It was supposed to be temporary. But when they turned my world upside down, there was no going back.

Wilder's version of Beauty and the Beast. This is a full-length, standalone novel that is intended for mature audiences only. Contains no cheating and a swoon-worthy HEA.",
