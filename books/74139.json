  "description": "In \"Write Here Write Now (WHWN): Standing at Attention Before My Imaginary Style Dictator,\" published by National Book Store, Filipino writer, editor, speaker, teacher AA Patawaran shares with all writers—aspiring and established, amateurs and professionals—profound and practical tips on the craft of writing, from construction and punctuation to sentence length and variety, from rhythm and cadence to idioms and figures of speech, even how to tackle the blank page. Recognized by industry insiders in the Philippines as “the man perfect to write this book,” the author has been at the helm of various publications, from Manila Standard’s The Good Life, for which he was lifestyle editor for seven years, to Manila Bulletin’s Sense&Style, in which he is the current editor-in-chief. He began practically as the “other editor” of Lifestyle Asia back when it was blazing the trail for glossy magazines in the early nineties. Blurring the distinction between instruction and inspiration, WHWN boldly takes the reader along the author’s adventures and misadventures in the publishing world. With a foreword by ruthless editor and bestselling author Jullie Yap Daza and with vignettes from the country’s top editors and writers, never has any book on writing in the Philippines been such a pleasure to read that it makes you want to “write here write now.”",
