  "title": "Corona Man: A Fictional Verse Journal in the Plague Year",
  "description": "John Trenear, an 84 year old widower, lives alone in a bleak London tower block. He has turned away from a world he finds alien, its customs and beliefs so different from the Christian simplicities of his Cornish childhood. He tweets not, neither does he watch TV. Consequently, when the coronavirus strikes and lockdown is imposed, he has no idea what is happening; Corona to him means only the fizzy soft drink he enjoyed as a child. On VE Day there are no Corona bottles being opened with an explosion of fizz, as they had in the merry street party he remembers: indeed the streets below his flat are incomprehensibly empty. But the day brings him added confusion and distress, for it appears that something called a ‘hate crime’ has been committed. Corona Man, a study of old age, confusion and isolation, is both very poignant and very funny.D. M. Thomas is an internationally known poet and novelist. His third novel, The White Hotel, considered a modern classic, has been translated into more than thirty languages. His most recent work of fiction, Hunters in the Snow (2014) is also published by the Cornovia Press. He lives in his native Cornwall with his fourth wife Angela. Being incompetent at gardening, trying out new recipes or assembling giant jigsaw puzzles, he has spent the months of lockdown writing this fictional verse journal.",
