  "description": "Do you want to have healthier relationships? Do you strive to live with less anxiety and stress? Do you struggle with the eternal questions about God and where or how we originated? We all want to live an anxiety free life. We want all of our relationships to be healthy and we don't want to feel a loss of control in any of them. We also struggle in infinite ways to have God all figured out. This book is for those who identify with these basic human hurts, hopes, and questions. Anxious Disciple makes connections between psychological theory and various spiritual paths in understanding why life seems to work the way it does. Regardless of the spiritual path a person may have chosen, the principles covered in Anxious Disciple will be applicable. People feeling anxious in relationships, business or personal, or feeling that there is a dimension missing in life and there must be something more, may find that they are an anxious disciple. Through this book, you are welcome to join in learning how to become a non-anxious disciple.\"The creative power continues to be expressed through us because of the very nature of our existence. There is nothing we have to do to make that happen. We just have to be aware that it is already going on.\" P.19\"The True Vine is not about something exclusive to Christianity; it is about something exclusively spiritual that was the basis of Christianity.\" (p.26)\"Another way of looking at your quality world is to consider it to be the array of manifestations created by the condition of your soul in which you have managed to meet your needs.\"",
