  "title": "What DONCHA KNOW? about HENRY MILLER",
  "description": "Henry Miller was a larger-than-life all-American writer. His work was ground-breaking and breath-taking. But he could also talk. Until the day he died, he had what he called the “gift of the gab.” At his own table, laden with the food he loved and surrounded by famous writers, actors, painters, musicians and fans, Henry held forth on every topic imaginable. What he said was rollicking, open, honest, revealing of himself and the fabulous assortment of huge personalities he’d met in his long life, as well as ultimately showing a side of Henry few outside his circle ever saw. In this warm and charming memoir of her years under Miller’s Pacific Palisades roof, artist and model Twinka Thiebaud captures his table talk with an unerring ear…as well as penning her own intimate impressions of one of America’s greatest writers.",
