Griffin Amante's life changes forever when he makes contact with a woman who is no longer among the living. But the bad news doesn't stop there: his ability has put a target on his back.

Finally, she's found what she needs to accomplish her goal: a Seer. Drawn together against their will, they must join forces against an evil that will do whatever it takes to see them both dead. Can they survive long enough to see if their connection is real or if it should be buried six feet under?",
