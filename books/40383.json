  "description": "The possibly long-awaited sequel to The Fairy's Tale: Condemned to live out her days as a hideous Troll, a wicked ex-Fairy Princess leads her new companions to the City of Angels to wreak vengeance on her former consort and the unsuspecting mortals who love him.On a hunting foray into an Eastern land, five Trolls contentedly feast on the children of a city teeming with life. Their relatively serene complacency is shattered when a beastly hag is deposited into their midst. As is their custom, the Trolls join with the former Royal Sprite to share their universal Memory. To their surprise, they receive her Fairy experiences, as well. Buried within her memories is the identity of the Imp responsible for Troll-kind's fall from grace. At last, they have the opportunity for revenge!Will Silky gain control over the magic heart of stone in her companion's pocket and have her retribution? Will her unexpected baby be a Troll, a Fairy or some kind of hybrid? Can Frisque continue to keep the trust of both The Seelie Court and his beloved Dawn's skeptical father? And what, exactly, does Puck have to do with all that's been set in motion, anyway?Along the way, we meet gruff billy goats and fierce marauders in dragon ships. We hear the tales of a bereaved father who quests to destroy the hideous creatures who butchered his twin sons, and of a disheartened ex-convict whose life has been unexpectedly charmed and damned at the very same time. Underneath it all, there's a brave new virtual realm where our Troll Guide Dudley gets the chance to express his evil thoughts and observations more articulately than he had ever believed possible.",
