  "description": "The Sound of Us are supernovas in the sky and I’ve been following their light from the moment we met. It was easy to get wrapped in them, for me to feel like I wasn’t a real person unless I was in their presence, helping them, loving them.Since Gentry’s attack we haven’t been the same, and I’m afraid that the magic we had been working so hard to build may be gone forever. Addiction, jealousy, and fear fill our nights, replacing the spaces that our love used to live.When an opportunity of a lifetime arises for me to chase my dreams, I leap at the chance to do something for myself. But it’s harder than I thought to follow my own path, especially when it begins to divert from theirs.Growing up, I never thought a happy ending was in the cards for me...but a happily ever after with the boys from the Sound of Us has been my dream since I met them.But dreams change, and even though our love story is written across my soul, our path won’t be easy.I know their hearts though, and what’s there is the same as what you can find in mine.My name is Ariana Kent, and losing “us” is not an option.",
