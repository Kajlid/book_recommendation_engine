  "description": "With death circling me, this is my best shot. AlexaI thought my life was settling down, falling into a routine. Boy, was I ever wrong. It only took one disastrous selfie sent to the wrong number and I caught the attention of Vincent Goodman.Worse, I can’t let dear, sweet Vin find out that the scandalous photo sent to him was originally intended for his notorious older brother, Tristan Goodman. I also can’t let my older brother, Sam, discover I’m falling in love with his boss whom he is convinced will only bring me trouble.Trouble does come for me.Death has always circled me, forcing me to choose between the safe arms of family, or the man who is far more dangerous than any monsters. Vincent \tMeeting Tristan at the café turned into more than getting a cup of coffee. I didn’t expect to receive a sinfully hot photo from an unknown number, and I sure didn’t expect it to be from the shy barista. \tWhile we form a relationship, unfortunately, I also begin to connect her brother to crimes happening within the restaurant. My business partners, Tristan and Mark, want to punish her brother Sam to the extreme. But calling for her brother’s head would cause me to lose Alexa’s heart.Sam might be involved in more trouble than I am, and he’s endangering Alexa as well. I’m determined to keep Alexa alive and make her mine. I’m just not sure how, but I’m going to give it my best shot.",
