  "description": "Aoi and Aya are braving the crowds at the mall to do a little last minute shopping, but no one is harder to shop for than their beloved, foxy Itsuki. Every year, Aoi gets Itsuki something fun from The Velvet Toy Box, but this is the first year sweet little Aya has come along. It doesn't take long to find something that make Aya's eyes wide, in the good way, but Aoi is still stumped by Itsuki's gift. That's when Rayne, the hot shopkeeper, steps in with a suggestion for a very special gift, something made just for the three lovers. The only thing sexier than the gift might be the way it's made.",
