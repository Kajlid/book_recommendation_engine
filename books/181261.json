  "description": "\"Every child has dreams and aspirations to achieve success.\" However, making those dreams a reality can often seem far fetched and distant for some children due to the circumstances by which they were brought into this world. Due to what society deems as ideal or proper foundations for success many of today's youth are deterred from pursuing their goals. Faith, confidence, and support are all factors which are integral in the ability of a child to realize their potential and transform dreams into reality. \"Swift Enough to Endure\" delivers a compelling message to today's youth and adults alike that early less than favorable demographics have no determination on an individual's ability to pursue a destiny of success.",
