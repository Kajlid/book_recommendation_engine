  "description": "Mr. Pine lived on Vine Street in a little white house. \"A white house is fine,\" said Mr. Pine, \"but there are FIFTY white houses all in a line on Vine Street. How can I tell which house is mine?\"Mr. Pine had a big problem. But he solved that problem in his own special way. Mr. Pine's Purple House, first published in 1965, was a favorite children's book for many years. When it went out of print, fans requested the return of the intrepid Mr. Pine. Well, Mr. Pine is back again, with his dog and his cat, his brushes and ladders, and lots of purple paint!",
