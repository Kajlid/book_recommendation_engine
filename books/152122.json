  "description": "A trilogy of children's stories from the early 20th century: A Dog of Flanders and The Nurnberg Stove by Louisa de la Ramee and The King of the Golden River by John Ruskin. This is the 1927 edition, from family collection. Book and dust jacket both in very good condition for a book this age; minor wear along edge of dust jacket, and pages show usual yellowing of age. All pages still strongly bound to spine, no markings on pages. A summary of the stories from the jacket flap follows:A Dog of Flanders: The touching story of little Nello, his old grandfather, and their \"dog of Flanders\" is one that has lived for years, always a favorite.The Nurnberg Stove: Little August, one of ten children, so loves the \"stove of Nurnberg\"--the great porcelain stove of his father--that when it is sold he goes with it to its new owner, the King. August is a symbol of that faith which conquers everything.The King of the Golden River: Three brothers, two hateful and stingy, and a younger one kind and generous, live in a rich vale known as Treasure Valley. The older boys offend the Wind, and he transforms the fertile valley into a desert. One day the King of the Golden River appears and tells the young lads how to make the mountain stream turn to gold. Both older brothers try, fail because they are cruel, and are changed into black stones. The younger one succeeds, because he is merciful. And Treasure Valley is once again fruitful.",
