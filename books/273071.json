  "title": "Matching Configurations",
  "description": "Matching Configurations is the second sequel to Quantum Roots, a light Sci-Fi adventure story that features everyday Olan Chapman as a hero vigilante who defends the weak and helpless victims of today's society. Like the first two editions of Quantum Roots, Matching Configurations is based on a growing belief that creation forms from recycled energy, and people evolve from recycled quarks. The book contains more humor than science, as Chapman returns to Earth as someone he once was, and manages to elude Director of Paranormal Affairs, Lt General Alexis Grumman, who keeps both feet on the ground, while her young lover, Jeremy Wade goes cloud bound in a supersonic motor scooter that flies. Book has some content not suitable for readers under 18.",
