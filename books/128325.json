  "title": "Love: Enter",
  "description": "A romantic, computer-age love story set in Paris and New Orleans. Young Dan Shoenfeld, spending a year abroad after college, falls in love with Bou and Margot, two women who happen to be in love with each other. Winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for First Fiction, Paul Kafka's brilliant first novel is now available in paperback. Patricia Hampl writes, \"Paul Kafka's enchanting novel brings a new dimension to the epistolary romance and a fresh face to the American in Paris. The city gleams and winks, seduces and betrays as if for the first time in this deftly written love story. It's a beauty-a crazy, unexpected, entirely winning tale: Paris love remembered by a young doctor on the milky computer screen of a New Orleans maternity ward at night. When Paul Kafka hits the Enter key to \"save to memory,\" the story gets sent straight to the heart.\"",
