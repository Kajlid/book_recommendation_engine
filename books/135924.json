  "title": "Beowulf: The Legend of a Hero",
  "description": "The exhilarating epic blazes to life -- featuring illustrations by a lead artist on the LORD OF THE RINGS film trilogy. \"Look into the flames and let your minds empty. . . . For this is a tale of blood and heat and ashes.\" It is a tale that has been retold countless times through the centuries -- and here, in an enthralling edition illustrated by a noted Tolkien artist, the mighty Beowulf is well set to capture new legions of followers. This contemporary retelling of the ancient epic -- narrated with a touch of banter by the faithful Wiglaf and featuring vividly dramatic illustrations -- follows the mythic hero from his disarming of the gruesome Grendel to his sword battle with the monster's sea hag mother to his final, fiery showdown with an avenging dragon.",
