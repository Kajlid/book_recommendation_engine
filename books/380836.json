  "title": "Route Choice and Signal Control: The Potential for Integrated Route Guidance",
  "description": "This book investigates the mutual influence between route choice and signal control. Starting from a theoretical basis, a number of control strategies are developed, which are subsequently tested on real-life networks. The potential for an integration of route guidance and signal control offers benefits over other systems separately. A model framework for route guidance simulation is proposed, which is used to test the development strategies, in order to assess the potential of integrated route guidance for several examples derived from real-life situations.",
