  "description": "Judy lives in a tent with her family. Will they ever be able to afford a farm with a real house? Ten-year-old Judy and her family are migrants, moving from farm to farm with each new season. Starting in Alabama, they travel to Florida and up the East Coast all the way to New Jersey, always looking for steady work. Every time Judy feels as if they're beginning to put down roots, they have to move on. It's hard for her to catch up in school; it's hard to make and keep friends. Judy likes the people she meets along the way, but she longs for a real home. Will her family ever have a farm of their own? Judy's Journey is a realistic depiction of the life of migrant farm workers in the mid-1900s. \"[C]hildren will draw . . . a valuable revelation of the deprivation and poverty of these homeless American workers who pick most of the vegetables that we buy.\" -The Horn Book Magazine Born in Springfield, Ohio, in 1893, Lois Lenski achieved acclaim as both an author and illustrator of children's literature.
