  "description": "Olivia Walsh is sick of her friends and family telling her she needs a man in her life. After all, she's made it this far, right?After fabricating a whirlwind romance while she stays on campus over the summer, Olivia panics when it comes to revealing the hot guy she's supposedly been hooking up with to her friends.Of course, such a guy doesn't exist. At least, not in Olivia's world. Until she spots a gorgeous bartender at a local bar, and drags him into the mess she's created. Hunter Daniels doesn't do relationships. Working nights at the local bar catering for college students to keep his younger siblings off the street isn't the most glamorous of jobs, but it pays the bills - barely. So when a pretty blonde accosts him in the bar, pleading with him to pretend to be her boyfriend, he's not exactly convinced. But Olivia is desparate, and there's just something about this girl that makes him say yes...Olivia knows that this whole thing she's got with Hunter is fake. After all, a guy like him - super hot, dark secrets and an array of tattoos - would never be interested in a girl like her. And the longer their fake relationship grows, the more Olivia realizes that it's not just her friends she's convincing anymore, but herself, as well.",
