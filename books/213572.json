  "description": "Self-proclaimed “Queen of All Media” Perez Hilton makes his publishing debut with a hysterical pop-cultural satire about today’s insane celebrity-driven world.Perez Hilton—founder of PerezHilton.com, the country’s most popular celebrity blog, and “one of the most polarizing media figures since Howard Stern” (L.A. Weekly)—cuts loose with a book that’ll secure his reputation as “the most hated man in Hollywood” (Rolling Stone). Psycho celebrities dominate news, fashion, and trends, influencing how we speak, what we wear, and who we hang out with. We’re obsessed! Our gossip-driven world has set the barometer of what’s in or out. So, who are we trying to become and how do we become them? Post a grainy sex video online, drive high and wasted against oncoming traffic, flash for the cameras, and if that doesn’t work, attempt suicide and you’re bound to become a “Hilton.” Now the man behind Hollywood’s most hated website—infamous for breaking raw superstar dish and jaw-dropping commentary—lends his fearless voice, notorious sense of humor, and outrageous sensibility to Red Carpet Suicide, the book celebrities have been looking forward to as much as their next DUI. Making sense of the madness and celebrity addiction that consumes us, Perez twists this irresistible and delicious guilty pleasure into a hysterically funny, shockingly true, and generation-defining survival guide.",
