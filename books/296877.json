  "description": "Coed Evee Salazar’s life is back on track: She’s assumed control of her powers, shined in her new internship, and stepped into a loving relationship. But a blizzard of trouble is about to blow into town. Three evil witches surface, still conspiring to control the AI technology that will shape their dark vision of the future. To complicate matters, the mystical force guiding Evee’s coven instructs her to perform what seems like an unthinkably wicked act. If she can’t follow this gut-wrenching path, she may fail to thwart the horrific plans of the dark-magic witches.[Author’s Note: Book 3 in the Savage Spells series contains spoilers for Book 1 and Book 2 in the Savage Spells series. The author strongly recommends reading Book 1, Everyone Leaves This Place, and Book 2, Love’s Heavy Spell, prior to reading Book 3]",
