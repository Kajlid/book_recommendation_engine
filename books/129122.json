  "description": "Amity and Kylar travel into Hell where they then have to manipulate the laws of the underworld into their favour. After meeting with Gabriel, the Archangel who fathered Amity, Kylar and Amity set out to complete the task she was born for. After allowing herself to meet her Nephilim self, Amity struggles with the desire to give into the sins surrounding her while trying not to lose her muted Angelic side. When Hell's treasured souls begin to taste her light, will the two make it out of the fiery pit unscathed - or will they spend an eternity trapped in Lucifer's sardonic world of Limbo?",
