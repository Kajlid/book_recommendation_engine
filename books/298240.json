I learned that the hard way. I got out with my life, barely.Welcome to Wet Waterfalls, a minuscule magical municipality hidden in the Wind River Range of Wyoming.

I learned that the hard way. I got out with my life, barely.I rescued myself from one danger, only to throw myself into another. I would have never survived a night in the woods on the side of a mountain if Doggo hadn’t shown up and brought his friends.Now I’m in protective custody, and for some reason, these crazy hot men are my self-appointed bodyguards. I’d like the tall one, Gage, to do a bit more than just guard my body, but Doggo—his real name is Max—might have something to say about that. Apparently, he has claimed me.The only explanation Gage will give me is, “Monsters are real, and love is magic.” I have to wait for the new moon to find out the rest.Stealing Joy is the sexy hot menage beginning to the Wolves of Wet Waterfalls, a why choose/ poly romance trilogy.Finding HomeEverything is changing so fast, except my rate of healing. I would really like to be able to walk around in regular clothes. These open-back hospital gowns are a little too cold up the back side. I’d give my left pinkie toe for some warm cotton panties. Oh, wait I have, so where are my panties?The guys keep repeating, “We are pack,” like some kind of cult mantra. It tickles when they say it against my skin.The FBI wants to use me as some kind of fishing lure to catch the bad guy. I’m game if it means I can finally ditch the whole hospitalized patient get-up. I’m really tired of being hooked up to an IV. Also, I really want the good guys to catch the evil known as my ex-boyfriend. I can’t believe I thought I was in love with him.Max has gone AWOL and Gage has promised to keep me safe. I’m counting on him.Welcome to Wet Waterfalls, Wyoming, my new hometown.

The day is finally here and I’m far from being ready. I still don’t have everything I need, including something to wear.Preparations would be a lot easier if Kathleen, Gage’s ex, wasn’t going around town telling everyone I’m harassing her. She even took out a restraining order against me.Despite her attempt to get me in trouble with the local sheriff’s department, I’m going to stay here, and I’m marrying Gage.",
