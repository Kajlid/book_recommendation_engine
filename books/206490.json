Suffering Traumatic Brain Injury from a roadside bomb in Iraq Tommy had severe mobility issues until a new medical breakthrough. A radical new treatment for anyone with a disease or injury that interrupted the flow of information though nerve pathways was giving patients a new lease on life by genetically altering the zombie ant fungus (Ophinocordyceps unilateralis). But, nature has a way of evolving…His brother Mike Mills was newly home from what had been a promising military career. After too many back to back deployments the life of an Airborne Ranger Paratrooper lost its appeal. Mike moved home to work the family farm and be in his local National Guard unit.Then the sun rose on a new day and a new world. Sergeant First Class Mike Mills and local Sheriff's Deputy Jan Temple will be facing a rapidly multiplying horde of ravenous zombies while trying to save as many innocent people as possible.As Mike stands looking at the breaking dawn he can’t help but think, “If we just finished ‘the war on terror’ then what the hell do you call a war on the living dead?”",
