  "description": "Sico is a callous man; no feelings, and no love for himself nor for others. That is until a certain woman spikes a surge of possessiveness inside him. Enough to claim her as his ol’lady on the spot without knowing her background. Realizing she’s not whom she appears to be, he finds himself feeling unworthy and works hard to become the very man she deserves.Simi lives behind a mask. Events from her past have pressured her into labeling herself to prevent more damage in the future. For her it is easier to hide behind a lie; because people, no matter if they are close or not, will always judge. When a club enemy strikes, retaliation draws blood and fighting is no longer an option but a necessity. The choice to do what’s right may lead to clearing a path for the future or create one where the fire of hell will take away everything that’s innocent and pure. Lives are lost, hearts will merge, but will there be a future left or will the need for blood and revenge drown everyone in its path?Sico can be read as a standalone.
