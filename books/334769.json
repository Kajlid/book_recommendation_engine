  "description": "No one suspects Zelia is a sorcerer, and that's exactly how she likes it. Even better, no one suspects she's human. Masquerading as a goblin Traveler, she roams Reality in her glittering van pulled by her two trusty world-walking birds, Warp and Weft.But when a storm of cosmic chaos strands her in an outer thread, the only refuge in sight is the legendary Darkhouse of Doom. Goblin legend says it is cursed; that after the death of the sorcerer who created it, the appearance of the wandering darkhouse foretells the appearance of world-devouring monsters and the death of all who see it.So, Zelia knocks on the door....Any House in a Storm is a beauty and the beast tale set in an otherworldly, space-traveling darkhouse where nothing is as it seems and no one who enters remains unchanged.While evil exists, there will always be those who fight it.***Any House in a Storm is a standalone novel set in the universe introduced in The House That Walked Between Worlds. For fans of Howl's Moving Castle, space goblins, magic, and authors like Naomi Novik, Lindsay Buroker, KM Shea and Ilona Andrews.",
