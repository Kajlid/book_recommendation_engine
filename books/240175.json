A dare was a dare, she mustered all her courage and tried to convince herself she was brave enough. She took a deep breath, as she climbed the steps up to the Menacing House.  You know the type. There is one in every neighborhood. The home, where it looks like, the occupants left in the middle of the night in a hurried rush. From the street, you peer into its dark dirty windows and you can see the silhouette of the ripped and lopsided curtains. The rustic old curtains trying their best to shield its interior from any spying onlookers. The type of house, whenever you walk by, it seems to give you an electrocuting chill. Instantly, filling you with a foreboding need to hurry past. The house you eyeball, year after year. Watching as it seems to almost vanish, with the passing of time.",
