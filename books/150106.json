  "description": "Jason Powers came into Jacksonville, and Sophia's life, without any warning, but now Sophia must make a decision that will either cost her the respect of her family or her heart... If you liked Bared to You or Fifty Shades, you will enjoy this story! Working a full-time job as a veterinarian and a part-time job as a dog-walker to help her mother during tough economic times, Sophia can't help but lament the fact that she has no time for a social life. While out walking some dogs, Sophia gets tangled up with a charming man who is not only extremely sexy, but also really into Sophia. There's just one problem: he's Jason Powers, the billionaire and CEO of Powers Corporation, the same corporation that destroyed the community's economy and took Sophia's mother's job. Sophia must make a choice, ignore the man who destroyed her mother's dreams, or face him and make him aware of the damage he has caused. No matter what decision she makes, Jason's passion and persistence makes her actions that much more difficult... Will Sophia side with her family's decision to disown Powers Corp? Or will she follow her heart and find out who Jason Powers, the seductive bachelor billionaire, really is? **This 13k word new adult erotic romance contains strong language and explicit scenes, including steamy hot sex between two characters.
