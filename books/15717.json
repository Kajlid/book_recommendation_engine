  "description": "Nineteen side-splitting stories from Sri LankaTo begin this chronicle of the funny things that have happened to him, Muller goes back to his days as a recruit in the Royal Ceylon Navy when the Queen of England came a-visiting: the saucy sailors decide to tip her a wink! The second story takes us back to Muller’s childhood in Anuradhapura where two visiting rat snakes turn out to be a railway linesman’s grandparents. There are further hilarious adventures in the Navy, encounters with more snakes of different sizes and lineage, graphic descriptions of jam-making factories, and hazardous days in the Gulf. Effortlessly, Muller creates caricatures that leave you helpless with laughter as they highlight the follies and foibles of the human race.",
