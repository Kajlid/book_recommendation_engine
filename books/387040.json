  "title": "The Dark Prince",
  "description": "Elizabeth Loraine brings us the third book in her series of Royal Blood Chronicles. Katrina having lost the love of her life embarks on a new journey, to the new world. New evil stalks the Five and endangers not only their mission but the very existence of all the peaceful races of the world. The Vampire Examiner writes: The Dark Prince, is as fast paced, mysterious, and adventurous as the first two books. It continues with the story of Katrina and the chosen Five as they leave the old world and travel to America. The descriptions of the scenes combined with a strong story line makes the reader feel as if they are walking the streets of the New World with them. It is a true example of the continued stong female vampire leads in this series. Katrina's continuing story of relationships among family, friends and lovers makes the reader hold their breath until the very last page.",
