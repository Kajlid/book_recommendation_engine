  "description": "No one ever said coming back to life would be easy.Clair Maxwell didn’t ask to be resurrected, or to inherit the mind, body, and superpowers of her parallel self, but she’s not about to question such a miraculous gift. Even if it means carrying around memories that aren’t hers, even if it means living on a world not quite what she’s used to, even if it means learning how to be a superhero. She has her childhood sweetheart-turned-wife back, and a second chance at living. She has no intention of wasting it.But just as she’s walking down the aisle again, setting the last thing back the way it should be, her world is up-ended once more. An attack on her life throws everything into chaos. Surrounded by old foes and new secrets, suddenly everything Clair thought she knew about her past is in question. And now she’s forced to wonder just where Clair ends… and Amy begins.",
