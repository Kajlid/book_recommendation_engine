  "description": "Dementor's a grizzly bear shifter. In human form, he's a huge mountain of a man who works as a bouncer for the MC’s strip club. The decimated Birmingham RTMC is struggling after most of their members died during the battle between good and evil, but the small group of brothers who survived form a tight group. Ember is a swan shifter who was owned by the Owl King for years — a princess given in tribute, but she grew to love him despite the fact it wasn’t a healthy relationship. When he was killed in the battle, she found herself alone and adrift.  Worlds collide when a grizzly bear and a swan from opposite worlds find common ground. This is about more than princess and biker, it’s about a monogamous creature in a relationship with one who isn’t, it’s about a protective personality versus a woman who hasn’t been free to be herself for years. Is she even capable of having a normal relationship? Because now, anything short of total freedom feels a bit like having her wings clipped all over again. But she’s going to transition to a dragon soon, and clipping a swan’s wings is one thing, while clipping a dragon’s wings is an entirely different matter.",
