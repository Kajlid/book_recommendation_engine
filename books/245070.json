  "description": "Forward is a life-affirming LGBTQ graphic novel about two women, both of whom are unable to move \"forward\" and put the pieces of their lives back together. Still smarting years after a horrible breakup, Rayanne diligently buries herself in her work. Aside from work, she has her cat. And other than her cat, she has her crushes: crushes that she prides herself on being able to resist. Unexpectedly, however, one of her crushes beings to affect her more than the others, and threatens to upset the delicate balance of her carefully controlled life. Ali is still feeling lost and numb almost a year after the death of her wife. Then one ordinary day something extraordinary happens: she is ambushed by her attraction to another woman that is both invigorating and fantastically inappropriate. Whether she's ready for it or not, it stirs up feelings Ali didn't think she was capable of having anymore. Funny, moving, and full of heart, Forward is a novel that explores the parameters of second chances and the tricky emotions of grief, fear, vulnerability, and desire.",
