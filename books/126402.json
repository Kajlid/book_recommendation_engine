  "description": "Stix is a young man who's just trying to make his way. Nearly five years ago he'd lost his first job when he was caught in the barn with the farmer's son. He counted himself fortunate to have found work at the Lazy E Dude Ranch and Winery in rural Westburg, Texas. What's more, Stix has always known he was different. Horses and leather are all he's ever known and loved but he craves something more. When opportunity comes knocking in the form of a dominant male, he is instantly attracted and can't fathom why, though one night, when he catches the man involved in a scene he'd only fantasized about, he knows this is what he's longed for all along. Finally faced with the truth about himself, all he can do is hope to find this type of love with a Dom of his own.",
