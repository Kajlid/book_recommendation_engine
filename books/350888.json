  "description": "IT WAS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST CONNIVING, LOWLIFE TRICK EVER PLAYED ON A MAN. BUT IT WAS FOR A GOOD CAUSE....Eulie Toby didn't like playing tricks, but the only way she could keep her younger orphaned siblings together was to get married--and Moss Collier was the perfect choice. Handsome and kind, he seemed so lonely living with his hermit uncle on that pretty sweep of Tennessee mountaintop. It didn't matter if their vows came at the end of a shotgun; Eulie promised Moss she'd make him the best wife in all of the Sweetwood.But a young bride and a ready-made family were the last things on Moss's mind. He had big dreams of going West and nothing was going to stop him--not Eulie's sweet innocence...not her deliciously kissable lips...and especially not that growing warmth deep inside his heart every time she came near. Moss had plans all right--but he hadn't planned on falling in love.Author Biography: Publishers Weekly calls national bestselling author Pamela Morsi \"the Garrison Keillor of romance.\" Her trademark wit and warmth enliven tightly written tales with down-home charm.
