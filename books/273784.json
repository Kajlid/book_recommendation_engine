  "title": "No Shitting in the Toilet: The Travel Guide for When You've Really Lost It",
  "description": "A travel guide with a difference, this title introduces a world where you are more likely to find a cockroach on your pillow than a complimentary mint, where you take your life in your own hands every time you get on a bus, where everything goes wrong, and you still end up loving every minute of it. Instead of practical hints, it gives you impractical ones (how to avoid jet lag - avoid jets) and rather than tell you the best places to stay, it tells you the worst. Instead of celebrating transcendental travel experiences, it revels in the most demeaning ones (on checking the hygiene in restaurants: there are two things you don't really want to see in life. The first is your parents having sex. The second is the state of the kitchen in restaurants catering for backpackers). But in that sense \"No Shitting In The Toilet\" is more in touch with the way things really are.",
