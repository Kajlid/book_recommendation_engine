  "description": "I’m a fraud. Or an imposter. I’m certainly a hypocrite.  I offer advice for a living. Encourage my patients to make wise decisions—help them help themselves to walk through life stronger, healthier, happier.  Isn’t that the goal? To live our best lives? If only I practiced what I preach. I wasn’t always like this. Every move I make lately is the opposite of smart. These questionable life choices are a new development.  They started the day a certain Vitale barged into my life.  Brand Vitale might look like a hero to the rest of the world, but looks can be deceiving.  I’m driven by obsession for a man who’s turning out to be dark, dangerous, and downright depraved.  And I don’t care. Because, sometimes, depraved, debauched—hell, or even deathly—is the only option.",
