  "description": "Marjorie Rawlings’s short story “A Mother in Mannville” was first published in 1936, and is considered by many to be her most autobiographical work of fiction. It was published in a book containing all of her short fiction in the aptly named collection, Short Stories, in 1994. Rawlings is most notably known for The Yearling, her 1938 novel for which she won the Pulitzer Prize in 1939. “A Mother in Mannville” is a touching, honest literary work that centers on two characters: the narrator, and a boy named Jerry. Through her vivid descriptions of both characters, in addition to the simple, yet revealing dialogue, Rawlings creates a story rich in characterization.",
