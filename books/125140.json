  "description": "Nneoma, a teenager growing up in a government-run Shelter in Nigeria, is forced by circumstances beyond her control to seek life elsewhere. A victim of gang rape, she resolves to flee both from her past and her indecisions. But does she have any affection left in her for a place where she experienced so much hurt? Will she risk her fledgling music career to come to the rescue of her friends when the Shelter is ambushed during an inter-community conflict? Will she be bold enough to do so by deriding an insensitive political elite?  A Wending Life is a novel that explores the themes of choice, fate, sacrifice, love and sexuality. The novel chronicles, to varying degrees, the experiences of three girls who are forced to come of age in an environment riddled with neglect and abuse, while also revealing the consequences of their actions and inactions. Nneoma, the embattled heroine, strives and by a stroke of chance, escapes the psychological restrictions imposed on her by a very trying time of her life. Yet, for one last time, she is required to cast her mind back to a place she would rather forget, for the sake of her loved ones.  In a Nigerian town rife with corruption and innate vileness, it eventually falls on a young Nneoma to confront authority in order to save people dear to her. Will she do that successfully? Will the risks be worth the trouble? Will Nneoma attain true fame?",
