  "description": "Myka Michaels has been a Healer specializing in obstetrics for years. Her assignment on Dremarai is one she both revels in and dreads. She wants to be the best Healer she can be, but riding a horse-beast from town-to-town isn't really her idea of a fun work environment. Elite D'hai Bosun has been selected as her escort through the countryside, his dragon tattoo proudly proclaiming his ability to summon magic. When Myka begins to feel an attraction to her escort she doesn't know how to tell him, then the custom of Hospitality raises its head. All Myka needs to do is to ask D'hai to fulfill his obligations to her as her host, to give her the Hospitality of his body. Will her Terran prudishness override her urge to ride the dragon accompanying her?",
