  "description": "They are two of the strongest men in the System, yet helpless against the submissive woman in need of their care, their love, and their mastery.Rescued from a lab where she was Created, Anin has had to learn a lot in little time. There's a death sentence on her head, and she's been ordered not to interfere with her two self-designated protectors - by her protectors themselves. Designed to submit, Anin craves submission the way she craves air. If only her protectors would understand. The Fas brothers like her, but they don't seem to understand how very much she longs to call them \"Master,\" both in and out of the bedroom.Nu and Set Fas are Raggas, from a planet where the strongest in the System are born. At first they fear hurting Anin with their desires. But Set soon realises that to give Anin what she needs is to accept what he wants, a true submissive. As he comes to know her, he senses that she might be the key to a true Ragga bonding, tying him, Nu and her together with a child. But Nu has been hurt before, and he refuses to allow Anin close enough to pierce his heart. It will take Set's skill and Anin's discovery of herself to help heal Nu's past hurts, and to defeat an old enemy bent on revenge. Only then can love join them all.",
