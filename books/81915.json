  "title": "A Moment With Each of My Lovers",
  "description": "Spend a moment with me as I recount my most memorable tales with each of my lovers. From hilarious sexual encounters to cheating to racy hookups and disappointments, I take you on a sexual journey. Easily read in an afternoon, I hope you will laugh and perhaps see a little bit of yourself as you follow my life in lovers. It all begins with my first boyfriend (in high school), Romeo, and ends with the man I eventually married, Mr. Right. In between, there are five other lovers who taught me how to love, what I wanted, and what I totally did not like. Some of them were sweet, some of them were sour, and some of them brief; but they all have a special place in my novella (if not my heart.)",
