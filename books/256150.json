  "description": "No Machine shall think. No Machine shall kill. No Man shall become as Machine. Archie Robledo is a hunted man. A veteran of the brutal anti-cybernetics wars, he awakens from a coma as the very thing he has fought against: a prototype super-soldier and walking nuclear weapon. His existence is a capital offense, punishable by dismantlement. Survival means living off the grid, using assumed identities and taking aid from underworld contacts. Offered work as an engineer at a beachfront park, he sees an opportunity to afford an expensive exit visa into friendlier nations. Yet a series of ill-fated gambles by the park's management threaten to uncover a hotbed of criminal activity, Archie's presence included. Pursued by the relentless detectives of the Tech-Crimes division, his escape and freedom on the line, Archie turns his unique abilities to a new trade: bank robbery.",
