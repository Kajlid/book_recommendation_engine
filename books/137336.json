  "title": "The Fade",
  "description": "A subterranean world of vast caverns, underground seas, crystalline forests. A civilization born of darkness, in darkness, protected by shadows. A city of merchants, whose eyes have turned upward to the surface, where the lethal light of day beats down on their world. A conspiracy so vast that it will swallow them all. A stunningly original fantasy from a multi-award winning author. With a beautiful baroque world, sharp characterization, and Chris Wooding's trademark insight into the fantasy genre, the dawning of Halflight is an event more than worth waiting for.",
