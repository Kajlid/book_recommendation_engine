  "description": "Horrified to learn that she’s not the only serial killer in Woodbrook—and insulted, frankly, by the rookie’s flare for the dramatic—Samantha hits the pavement to silence the competition before they ruin her quiet, perfectly curated life. But the insufferable latte-chugging local busybody Cherry Gherkins is poisoning the town with her own theories about the murder, and things are about to get messy. Grab a cup of cocoa and curl up with the second chapter of Patrick Horvath’s twisted tale of a cozy animal community in crisis!",
