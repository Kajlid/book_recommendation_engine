  "description": "I may not have special powers, but sometimes I think I'm invisible. No one in my high school seems to notice me at all. When they finally do it's because the popular Tripp Bauer accidently smacks me in the face with a wad of paper. Talk about humiliating. Only now he keeps talking to me. At first it was to apologize, and I figured once I forgave him he'd go away. But he doesn't, and now my feelings for him are starting to grow. And that scares me. Guys like Tripp Bauer don't fall for girls like me. Or do they?",
