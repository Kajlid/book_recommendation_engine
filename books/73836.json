  "description": "One Backpackers Epic Journey To Circle The GlobeUpon college graduation, at the age of 24, I freaked out. I had no desire to begin a career. I had no idea what my career even was. My two degrees were supposed to give me guidance. They were supposed to give me a life yet the passion for a career and everything society taught me about how to measure success was opposite of what I was feeling. I needed to break free. There was only one solution. I had to travel.Over the next couple of years I embarked on an epic journey to live and travel completely around the world. I awarded myself with a self-imposed exile and it was marvelous. I was running away from everything I had known. Soon I was swept up in the adventure of a lifetime: The book recounts the odyssey across the world, hitchhiking through rural Africa, on endless train rides through bustling India, on foot through the Himalaya, traveling by rickshaw in Thailand, by boat in Laos, and ferries in Vietnam.\"Allen taps his self-deprecating humor to convey the joys, perils and frustrations of prolonged travel.\"In the course of my epic and enlightening journey tramping the globe, I endured danger, delay, and dismaying circumstances. Setting out without a planned itinerary, I gauged human psyches by purposely placing myself in uncomfortable situations. Talking with local Africans, Indians, Nepalese, Thai, Laotians, and Vietnamese, as well as other travelers who are like me, I meticulously tell the tale of human psychology, history, politics, and beauty that exists in a developing world in the midst of globalization.\"Brimming with his signature humor and knack for observations, this engrossing chronicle is entertaining reading for both the ardent adventurer and the armchair traveler.\"",
