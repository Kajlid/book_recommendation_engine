  "description": "She broke the rules. Now he sets the consequences.  Lera crossed the line when she disobeyed River’s orders and went over the Academy wall. Now River wants Lera gone—and Coal is just the officer to make her quit.   For Coal, disciplining a wayward cadet is a matter of routine—--but he may be in over his head with this fiery student. Leralynn is far stronger than she looks, and with her eerily familiar chocolate eyes and maddening curves, she’s bringing demons to the surface... demons that Coal thought long buried.   But when a rainstorm threatens to destroy the Lera’s last hope for restoring her males’ memories, the battle of wills between her and Coal turns to war.   CRIME AND PUNISHMENT is the second episode in the GREAT FALLS ACADEMY novella series, featuring the same reverse-harem cast as Alex Lidell’s internationally bestselling POWER OF FIVE series. (Reading the POWER OF FIVE novels is not necessary to enjoy GREAT FALLS ACADEMY.)",
