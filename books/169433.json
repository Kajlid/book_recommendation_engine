  "description": "In Companion Piece, editors L.M. Myles (Chicks Unravel Time) and Liz Barr bring together a host of award-winning female writers, media professionals and more to examine the wide array of humans, aliens and tin dogs who have accompanied the Doctor in his adventures throughout time and space.Tansy Rayner Roberts (Ink Black Magic) finds the defining attribute of Sara Kingdom, while Amal El-Mohtar (The Honey Month) looks at the extent to which the Doctor himself is a companion, particularly to the Brigadier. Nina Allan (“Angelus”) rewatches – with some concern – Sarah Jane Smith’s debut for the first time in ages, and Seanan McGuire (Rosemary and Rue) addresses the ethics of using violence through the lens of Leela, Ace and Amy Pond.Other contributors include Karen Miller (The Innocent Mage), Deborah Stanish (Chicks Unravel Time), Lynne Thomas (Chicks Dig Time Lords), Joan Francis Turner (Dust), Mary Robinette Kowal (Shades of Milk and Honey) and Tehani Wessely (FableCroft Publishing).",
