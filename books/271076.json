  "description": "Like many stories from Spaceship Planet, our story begins on Spaceship Planet. Don't laugh, it's true. Most of the stories (not all) are about the journeys and explorations of 4 astronauts, sometimes referred to as \"The Astronauts\". The 4 astronauts live and play on the planet but they do not work there. They work in Outer Space and that is pretty great...most of the time. Their names are Sarzique, Miklo, Alan, and Xallowan. The Astronauts live in Spaceship City and are friends with a robot named X9-Hexasmith. X9-Hexasmith lives in Robot City and that is pretty great...most of the time. Inside you will find more information about Spaceship Planet, songs, stories, and the ongoing epic adventure of The Astronauts. Travel through the multiverse with 4 astronauts. Can you survive the madness of dimension zero? Will Alan the Astronaut ever learn?",
