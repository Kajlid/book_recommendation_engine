  "description": "Seeker, Morning Star, and the Wildman return in this gripping sequel to Seeker and discover that the mysterious warrior sect they were so desperate to join is not what it appeared to be from the outside. Deeply disillusioned, the three escape and head off on what they think are separate quests but that soon become intertwined--and desperately life threatening. Fortunately, they have acquired the remarkable physical skills of the Noble Warriors, for they are certainly going to need them. The mighty warlord of the Orlan nation is gathering his forces and has vowed to destroy Anacrea--and everything and everyone that crosses his path.With its riveting and deft handling of myriad themes including love, courage, friendship, desire, faith, and redemption, Jango will mesmerize every reader who dares to take the journey.",
