  "description": "Some fires warm you up. And some burn you down.  Kevin McNicholl may be a brutal force on the rugby field, but off the field, the star New Zealand All Black is a famously nice guy. His new tenant, though, arouses more than his protective side. She sets him on fire. Pity he’s evicting her.  Every woman deserves her dreams. Chloe Donaldson can’t afford dreams, so she's given them up. Marriage, her ballet career, and now, her beautiful tower apartment with its view of the sea. Her new landlord is kicking her out, along with her three-year-old son, Zavy.  She should hate him. But when a man looks at you like that, it’s so easy to lose your focus.  NOTE This STAND-ALONE romance, like New Zealand, contains a bit of steam. If that isn't your cuppa, maybe visit another country . . . er, book.",
