  "description": "Smiting the Bear is the journal of Archibald Brinsley Fox’s extraordinary adventures in the Russian wasteland of 1920-1921. Known in his day as a deserter, spy, forger, thief and womaniser, Brinsley Fox was always honest in his journals (though rarely at any other time).Here he bears witness to a land ravaged by years of revolution and civil war; a time of massed banditry in which elaborate torture, casual murder and gang rape were unremarkable.Fox is bent on staying in Russia to acquire a Faberge Egg and have his “wicked way with that mad bint, Inessa Armand,” meaning Lenin’s former mistress. Driven by desire, he blunders across a Russia which “Poe wouldn’t have dared to imagine.”In the countryside, he is forced to partake in the new cuisine; cannibalism.

He is press ganged into a Red Army unit, arrested by secret police and forced to wander the vast Russian steppes while the country is in uproar.With his desires thwarted, Fox stumbles into the legendary Kronstadt Rebellion, the last great uprising in Bolshevised Russia. And he knows it’s a surefire failure...",
