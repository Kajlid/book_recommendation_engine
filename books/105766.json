Only one person knows the answer to that question, but Reece Carson, nurse entrepreneur and owner of Text-A-Nurse, plans to be the second. Everyone but Reece believes Abigail Hamilton died of natural causes. They point to her age, chronic health conditions, and medications as evidence. Abigail's doctor called her a heart attack waiting to happen, and the police have determined she doesn't merit a crime scene investigation or even an autopsy. Reece is determined to prove that a blood pool isn't required to solve this murder mystery.Armed with her stethoscope, a handy-dandy murder-care plan, and her well-honed nursing instincts primed to interpret clues like symptoms, she becomes an amateur sleuth to find the answers.

Not only that, she uncovers other cases of death by natural causes connected to the same drowning victim in the distant past.She never counted on her investigation into Abigail's death, setting off a fatal chain reaction or an incoming hurricane to aid the killer's escape. Worse, she's beginning to suspect that the sweet fireman she's falling in love with may be guilty of murder.When the suspect turns on her, Reece learns that secrets fester like infections, and one day they'll come back and try to kill you.",
