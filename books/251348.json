  "title": "Jacks Are Wild",
  "description": "Hello. This is the part when I usually share a few lines from the book. I am doing things a little differently this time. The novel behind this letter was formerly known as Fangirl. Jacks Are Wild is an erotic paranormal short story that blossomed into this menagerie of sex, sadism, and lust. I am in no way attempting to pass this off as a romance novel. It is the dark journey into the mind of a nymphomaniac as she explores her sexual fantasies while pining for the affections of the elusive Jack J. Roberts. This novel is not for readers with triggers, or those searching for a fun read. This book contains every trigger on the spectrum and then some. This is erotica in its truest form. It is meant to be read for entertainment purposes only. The situations are shocking and the heat burns up the pages. You might find yourself feeling guilty for reading it, but unable to put it down. There will be some, who have to put it down because itâ€™s too much. This is a work of Untamed fiction. No humans were harmed during the writing of this novel. These are not real people folks. Happy reading.",
