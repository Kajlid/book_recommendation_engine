Now in the Third Age Oien returns to fulfil his ambition – world domination. He forges an alliance with the tyrant King Dewar to conquer the peaceful land of Bala in order to mine its othium, the first stage in his deadly plan. Only the brave dare resist the might of the Dewar’s forces, and only a power for good, gifted to one man, can hold back the red fire.White Light, Red Fire is a tale of a strong aggressor looking to conquer a smaller nation.",
