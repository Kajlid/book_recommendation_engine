  "description": "This stunning book introduces the world to some of the very special and gifted children who were described in Meg Blackburn Losey's The Children of Now. The Children of Now changed paradigms of how we raise, teach, and nurture our children, and created awareness that ADD, ADHD, and autism just might not be what we thought. The book touched parents, teachers, and caregivers all over the world.Now, in Conversations With the Children of Now, Dr. Meg goes even further to spotlight some of the Children of Now and others who have come forward since the first book was released. Intricately woven conversations with Indigo Children, Crystalline Children, Star Kids, and Transitional Kids reveal the hearts and souls of our future generation. These real children share their feelings and perceptions about themselves and our world. Hear, in their own words:*Who they really are.*Where they come from.*Why they are here, and what they have come to share with humanity.*What they know about God, and about Living and Dying.*What they know about the healing of hearts and souls, and of bodies and minds.*What will happen in the 2012 shift.These children speak about past lives, other worlds, forgotten gifts, and unconditional love as a way of being. They show how we can change our world with grace. They also reveal how we can guide them, nurture them, and allow them to become the great human beings they were destined to become!",
