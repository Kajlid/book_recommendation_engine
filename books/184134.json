  "description": "This is a dangerous combination, the demanding bad boy and curious good girl, but I think I can handle myself now. If not, I'm sure I'll enjoy what Ethan has in mind, so...  I seriously can't believe he's doing this.  Rule #10 â€“ I know you're a bad boy, but I want you to be my bad boy. I need you to promise that you'll only be with me and that you won't hurt me...  How do I explain this to Ashley?  I don't know. I'm not even sure I should try, because I'm pretty sure I'll say something dumb. Dating is hard, alright? Maybe you think it's hard to actually get someone to start dating you, but I think that's the easy part. It doesn't matter if you screw it up, because you can just move on to the next girl.  When you're actually dating, though, it's like... man, I can't screw this up. I can't say something stupid, because it's not as easy as just moving on to the next girl.  I don't want to move on to the next girl. I want to stay right here with Ashley.",
