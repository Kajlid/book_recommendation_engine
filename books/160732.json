  "title": "Roulette:  Love Is A Losing Game",
  "description": "Sex, love, and Las Vegas, Roulette will take you on a thrilling adventure you won’t be able to put down. I’m Samantha Drake, and you might call me a Domme, but really I’m just a very successful woman in my 30s looking for sexy role-play without the complications of a relationship. I NEED CONTROL Love has never been on my agenda. Until, of course, one day the much younger Thomas Hunt came into my life. He broke down my walls and taught me to let go; he made me feel alive for the first time. I might even be capable of loving him if lies and betrayals don’t tear us apart first. Is it possible to for me to let him in, or is love a losing game? The first book of The Thomas Hunt Series, Roulette is a modern, steamy erotic novel set in Las Vegas. It contains explicit sexual scenes, light BDSM, and frequent profanity. It is intended for adults only.",
