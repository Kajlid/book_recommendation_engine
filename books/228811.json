  "description": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away... Okay, maybe it's not a long time ago, or even very far away, but present day Chicago has it's fair share of heroes and villains. Unlike the tales of old, they don't wear shining armor, golden crowns or even dragon scales - they're human. Gloriously flawed and dangerous humans with an appetite for both blood and lust.A twist of fate brought Cole Ryan and Elle Laroux together in an orgasmic first encounter, but all too fast their futures became deeply entwined. Being forced together wouldn't be such a bad thing if a dark web wasn't being woven around Cole and Elle - simultaneously taut and tenuous - leaving their very lives to hold on by the thinnest of fate's strands. ****This book contains graphic sex, violence, uncomfortable sexual encounters as well as M/M/F, M/M and F/F sexual relationships. It's intended for mature audiences, over 18 only****",
