  "title": "Rereading America: Cultural Contexts for Critical Thinking and Writing, 9th Edition",
  "description": "Rereading America remains the most widely adopted book of its kind because of its unique approach to the issue of cultural diversity. Unlike other multicultural composition readers that settle for representing the plurality of American voices and cultures, Rereading America encourages students to grapple with the real differences in perspectives that arise in our complex society. With extensive editorial apparatus that puts readings from the mainstream into conversation with readings from the margins, Rereading America provokes students to explore the foundations and contradictions of our dominant cultural myths. The print text is now integrated with e-Pages for Rereading America, designed to take advantage of what the Web can do.",
