  "description": "“Where is The Wall?” I asked my father one night while he brushed my hair. “Somewhere east . . . And you’re going to find it one day, I know you are. I hear,” he whispered, “there’s an underground passageway that leads straight there.”\nJoy Montgomery’s life has never been as it seems. She knows this now. Her tragic journey has been a complex mirage of dreams and illusions set in place by her ancestors’ secrets and driven by the calculated genius of her late father, Zephyr the Magnificent. In the Greenleigh Tree Factory, under the wretched rule of the Superiors, he’d prepared her for this future as if he’d already known the outcome. He’d instilled into her the quest for truth, freedom, and love, and had given her the strength to guard with her life those she now protects, some of whom she must risk her life to save.Now, the treemakers and the saltminers are split over Bygonne. They must acquire the Seeker’s Keys with the help of Zephyr’s clues, which also must be found along the way. Stakes are high, war is coming, and now, Joy has everything to lose. Will they be triumphant, like Cheyenne said they’d be, and grasp the promised victory? Or will they face defeat at the hands of Lord Daumier, and lose the future waiting for them on the other side of The Wall? \n“What did you see in me?”“That you’re a hero. You’re my hero.”“I’m no hero, Joy. Don’t ever forget this, okay? You’re the light in the dark. You’re the love that conquers fear and evil. You’re the hero, Joy. You always have been, and you always will be.”",
