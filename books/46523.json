  "title": "Scoundrel!  The Secret Memoirs of General James Wilkinson",
  "description": "In the humorous, iconoclastic tradition of George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman novels, Gore Vidal’s BURR, and Thomas Berger’s LITTLE BIG MAN, meet real-life scoundrel James Wilkinson as he lies, schemes, back-stabs, and seduces his way through our nation’s early history. After experiencing Wilkinson’s irreverent spin, you’ll never view the American Revolution or the Founding Fathers the same way again. Cleverly weaving historical fact, fiction, and humor, SCOUNDREL! recounts Wilkinson’s misadventures during the momentous year of 1776, starting at the siege of Boston, following him through Benedict Arnold’s disastrous Canadian invasion, and ending with Washington’s attack on Trenton. Along the way he battles savage Indians, seduces beautiful women, fawns over egomaniacal generals, falls in with British spies, and betrays everyone who strays into his path.",
