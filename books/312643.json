  "description": "There are few things in life as wonderful as a good pair of overalls. As illustrated in this eye catching children’s book, Mr. Bear takes us through his unique collection of overalls and how he likes to wear them! He wears them to the zoo, while he sleeps, to the beach, to the park, to his school, and many other places. He even puts them on his dog and cat! Your child is sure to love his bold fashion statement and catchy rhymes!This book has a rhyme on every page, which is catchy for young children and enables memory through phonics. Phonics is a method of teaching people to read by correlating sounds with letters or groups of letters in an alphabetic writing system. Teaching phonics and rhyming to a child develops their phonological awareness skills – which play an important part of becoming a good reader.",
