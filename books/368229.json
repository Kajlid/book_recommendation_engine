  "description": "Maria Logven's short stories entwine daydream with desire, action with inner fantasy, and prose with verse in an enchanting vision. In her story Trapped in Love, Logven's narrator is thrown into the turmoil of lost relationship when memories of what once was bubble through daily ritual and make-believe. Created personalities are given to passengers on the train imbued with secret lives of the narrator's making. The text skips through perambulations of a mind rich in imagination the likes of which compares to Alice's trip down the rabbit hole. Logven's tales offer a most seductive opportunity to escape the daily grind. --Eve Rifkah, editor of Diner, a literary journal",
