  "description": "Sophie was the love of my life. Okay, we were twelve the last time I saw her but still. I've tried everything to move onâ€”whiskey, women, weed. Nothing seemed to fill the void. Now, ten years later, she shows up out of the blue. The problem, I'm not the boy she used to know. I have a reputation that could ruin everything. Still, I have to try. Even if nothing happens between us, having Sophie in my life as a friend is better than not having her at all.  Come A Little Closer is the second installment in the Georgia Boys series. It can be read as a standalone novel.",
