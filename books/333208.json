  "description": "He's back to hold her to a marriage pact they made ten years ago . . .Tabitha Winters, glamorous celebrity chef, loves her life and growing empire in New York. But when her best friends buy the old summer camp where they worked as counselors, she can't turn down their invitation to appear at the opening week fundraising gala . . . even if it means confronting the memories of her first love and its disastrous ending.But she soon discovers someone is playing an elaborate prank on her as she catches glimpses of Sawyer Reed, the heartbreaker who has no business being at Camp Oak Crest. When she uncovers the truth with a well-crafted counter prank campaign, it's wilder than she could have guessed: even though she hasn't seen Sawyer since he broke her heart, he's there to collect on a marriage pact they made when they were still dumb kids.Tabitha could never resist a dare, and when Sawyer double dares her to give him a week to prove that they still have their old magic, she's all in to prove that he's wrong: they've been over since the day he walked away ten years ago.Only she didn't count on him knowing her better than he has a right to, or having the perfect dates to wear down her resistance. And she definitely didn't plan on their attraction still burning hotter than the end-of-camp bonfire. In this summer camp setting, can Tabitha resist the pull of past memories while Sawyer's knee-buckling kisses try to convince her of their future?This swoony and hilarious new romcom from USA Today bestseller Melanie Jacobson references characters from other Creekville books but is written as a standalone.",
