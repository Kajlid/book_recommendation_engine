  "description": "The true gods of Earth existed long before our ancestors crawled mindless upon the shore: Yog-Sothoth, Shub-Niggurath, Nyarlathotep... insatiate, tenebrous monsters, whose ultimate throne is Chaos.Greatest of all is he called Cthulhu. Only in ancient, blasphemous manuscripts can that name be found... and those who decipher it are left pale and numb, aware that in the very act of decipherment they have become both pawn and prey of an ultra-worldly power that renders human existence both tenuous and trite.The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall remain... long after they have devoured us.Contents:\"Introduction\" by David Drake \"Arkham\" (poem) \"The Black Stone\" \"The Fire of Asshurbanipal\" \"The Thing on the Roof\" \"Dig Me No Grave\" \"Silence Falls on Mecca's Walls\" (poem) \"The Valley of the Worm\" \"The Shadow of the Beast\" \"Old Garfield's Heart\" \"People of the Dark\" \"Worms of the Earth\" \"Pigeons From Hell\" \"An Open Window\" (poem)",
