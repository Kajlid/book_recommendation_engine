  "description": "In Head Crusher, Johnny Rock makes his way to Times Square where he finds a mafia-run brothel and through a bit of dumb luck (there is an attack on the boss of the brothel and Johnny shoots everyone he sees, accidently saving the boss's life) he worms his way into a lieutenant position of a local high-ranking member of the family. It turns out an internecine mafia war is brewing, as the capo from Queens wants territory from the uber-boss of Manhattan. Johnny Rock, through his cold-blooded killing skill ends up playing a big role in helping the big boss win. He doesn't care as long as he is killing mafia goons. But when the war is over, he returns to his main goal and starts taking down the mafioso who have adopted him. - Olman Feelyus (Olman's Fifty Blog)As if the series couldn't delve into a sleazier territory, Rock finds himself the right hand man to a notorious 42nd street Mafia man who runs a brothel, porno-house, XXX film factory and a pedophile ring in this outrageous offering. Our Mafioso king-pin picks up Rock to work round the clock as his bodyguard, Rock sensing the opportunity takes full advantage. Gritty, nasty and brutal, this episode paints no pretty pictures and with its porno theatre etiquette is a takes-no-prisoners slice of pulp. - Rayo casablanca (Sick Hipster Blog)",
