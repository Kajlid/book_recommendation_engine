When life takes an unexpected detour, and Emma’s heart is laid bare, her best friend’s brother steps in to prove all is not lost in this emotional New York romance from bestselling and award-winning author Lydia Michaels.”I’ve dreamt of my wedding since I was a little girl. There was a big, fancy gown sewn of precious pearls. No one warned me that falling in love would be such a messy affair.As my best friend’s brother, Riley has always been a boy in the background of my life–effortlessly cute, entitled, and a total flirt. Thankfully–because his sister would kill him–he’s never crossed that line with me. But when he unexpectedly saves me in a crisis, I fall prey to his irresistible charm.I know Riley doesn’t do serious relationships. For the first time in my life, I try to keep things casual. But there is nothing casual about lying to a best friend, and when reality gets overly complicated, I know it’s time to let him go. I never expected Riley to be the one who refuses to go back to the way things were before. When the unthinkable happens, he insists that love isn’t a casual thing for him anymore. Will he truly do anything to stay by my side–even if that means walking through hell and back? Even if it means possibly losing everything? Am I worth that much to him?",
