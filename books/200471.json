  "description": "Her family's fortune can buy Tara Douglas anything--except more time. Determined to make peace with her fate, she's come to the house her great-grandfather built in the Smokey Mountains to spend the time she has left in peace. But for once Tara becomes the healer when she finds wreckage of an otherworldly vessel, and a badly injured man whose glowing eyes see right into her soul...When Ki'san volunteered to journey to Earth he never imagined he would find himself dying there. A physician from a vanishing race, he knows his people's law allows only a chosen few to hunt the females of this planet as mates. Ki'san's mere presence on Tara's world endangers them both, but the crash that leaves him clinging to life also brings him a female like none he could have imagined, one he cannot help but love.",
