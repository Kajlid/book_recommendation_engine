  "description": "One summer can change everything.At least, that’s what Naomi has heard. Personally, she’s not interested in changing anything. With the start of university looming like the Ghost of Adulthood Yet to Come, Naomi is ready to spend the most uneventful summer of her life house sitting for her dad’s boss.Her friends might be making epic summer bucket lists, but to Naomi, two months alone in a giant mansion sounds like just the escape she needs from the anxiety that’s spent her whole life telling her change can’t be anything but bad.Andrea is ready for a change. Sure, she might have taken things a little too far by dumping her boyfriend, quitting her job, and breaking into her dad’s seemingly empty house to spend the summer plotting her next move, but Andrea has never done anything by halves.When she discovers the house is not, in fact, empty, and that the mysterious house sitter with the biggest blue eyes she’s ever seen is hiding a secret summer bucket list, Andrea hatches a plan to tick the items off together.It’s the perfect trade: Naomi gets an accountability buddy, Andrea gets an excuse to avoid planning her own future for just a little longer, and once the list is complete, they go their separate ways.It’s simple, it’s effective, and it definitely doesn’t leave room for them to fall in love—no matter how many times they stay up all night talking, or how good it feels when their hands touch, or how much they both wish September would stay far, far away.One summer can change everything...for better or for worse.Bestselling author Katia Rose makes her young adult debut in this queer coming of age romance that will sweep you up into the magic of summer love.",
