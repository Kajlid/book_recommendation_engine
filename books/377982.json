  "description": "Four friends on the brink of graduation - and adulthood... It's senior year at California's Glenwood High for sexy Kit McCoy, athletic Alex Enomoto, brainy Elaine Gregory, and beautiful Lori Woodhouse. It is a time for discovery - and for falling in love. These four friends share everything: their dreams, fears, and deepest secrets. If one has a special date, she's sure to tell the other girls every delicious detail. If one of them is in trouble, her friends are the first to know - and help. So you can bet Elaine, Alex, and Lori are right by Kit's side when she confesses she's in love with Justin Kennerly. It's only natural that her flamboyant good looks have turned Justin's head. But her friends are concerned. They know that under her flirtatious exterior, Kit's terribly scared of love - and surprisingly inexperienced. But does Justin know the truth? Or does he expect TOO MUCH, TOO SOON?",
