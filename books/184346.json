With the East End community supporting her, and the return of her true love Danny, back to marry her at last, Lizzie dares to believe she has finally found happiness. But as their wedding day dawns, an unwelcome guest arrives, and Lizzie fears her life will never be the same again . . .'A gripping page turner' - LEAH FLEMING 'Brings the East End to life - family loyalties, warring characters and broken dreams.
