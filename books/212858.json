  "description": "In the town of Waresville, people survive off the weird and freaky. Without all the tour buses, haunted attractions, and magic shops, the little town would have collapsed into ruins long ago. But Waresville isn't the only place with things that go bump in the night. A typical Waresville mystery has popped up in the middle of steamy Miami-a city with all kinds of interesting faces, and each one of them may have a motive to kill someone important to the heroine. Enter Harper Beck, witch, amateur sleuth, and all around groove machine. Harper hasn't left Waresville in ten years, not since she was handed the lifeline of her inheritance and was able to rise from the slums of Miami. Now the cousin she hasn't talked to in years is dragging her back to the city where it all started, because someone is trying to do away with him. A newly formed gas station mogul, Connor Beck has enemies left and right-some of them too close for comfort. With a drinking ex-wife that stands to inherit the empire, and a jealous best friend who needs the money more than anyone, Harper has her hands full with trying to keep a telekinetic from introducing her cousin to the light at the end of the tunnel. Unfortunately, with Harper now on the case, the clock is ticking for both of them. If Harper can't find the witch amongst hundreds of suspects and overcome her old prejudices, neither of the Becks will make it out of this high school reunion alive. Novella (approx. 35,000 words). Fifth Volume of the Harper \"Foxxy\" Beck Mystery Series. It is a standalone (reading prior or future volumes not required to enjoy the book, no cliffhanger).",
