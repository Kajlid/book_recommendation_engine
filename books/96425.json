  "description": "Aaron Saturn, 16, is an emotional zombie—stuck in grief for his little brother, Isaac, who died. Aaron longs for an escape, and thinks he’s found one when he meets Kim, a girl living on the streets of New York City’s East Village. But the real upheaval in his life hits closer to home. When his parents reveal a startling plan to change their family, Aaron goes into a tailspin. He needs to learn that running away won’t heal him. For that to happen, Aaron must be willing to let love back into his life. Love that may lead him to a real adventure. \"Avra Wing is a remarkably astute writer. In After Isaac she handles the weightiest material—life and death, birth and loss—with the lightest of touches. Aaron Saturn and his lovely, heartbroken family will stay with you long after this novel's pitch-perfect ending.”—Ben Dolnick, author of I Know Who You Are and Zoology",
