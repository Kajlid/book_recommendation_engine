  "description": "“The long awaited sequel to TOO DEEP FOR TEARS spills from the pages with all the dark beauty and high drama of an ancient legend that winds its way around your heart.” --Romantic Times  All We Hold Dear is Book II in the Too Deep for Tears Trilogy. Full of suspense and haunting emotion, it follows Mairi, Ailsa and Alanna—three generations of Highland women--who must call on all their strength and the wisdom of the ancient Celtic gods, when strangers come to Glen Affric. The intruders bring greed, conflict and treachery, pitting brother against brother, father against son, husband against wife. Yet among them is a new love for Alanna. More mysteriously, and without intention, they reignite Ailsa’s old and precious memories… In the epic struggle of man against man, and man against nature, who will suffer and who will thrive?  Re-edited edition: now set entirely in 19th Century Glen Affric! “I couldn’t put the book down… ALL WE HOLD DEAR is beautiful, passionate and wild like the rugged Scottish Highlands. Excellent reading adventure.”  --Rendevous",
