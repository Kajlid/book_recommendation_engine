  "description": "When a fire ignites between two people, it’s almost impossible to put it out -- or to forget. In the hustle and bustle of New York City, Scarlett thought there was zero chance she’d run into her first love, Dev—her handsome ex who’s extraordinary financial success seemed to change him into a power-hungry womanizer. She was wrong. Forced to subject herself to one of his cruel, vindictive head games or lose her dream job, Scarlett has to figure out how to reconcile with their past in order to move on from him…and into the arms of “safe” and uncomplicated Eric. But when years of pent up emotion and unfinished business manifests itself into a night of extreme passion—bordering on violent—Scarlett knows what she must do. But is it too late?“Intense, addictive and compelling—just like Dev and Scarlett.” –Holly G.",
