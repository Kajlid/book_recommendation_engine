  "description": "Best Selling Author J.L. Beck brings you the final book in the compelling Kingpin Love Affair Series.  Reader Warning: Contains graphic violence, explict sex scenes, and mature themes, that may not be suitable to all readers.  Broken. Dead. Failure.  That’s what I felt every time I looked in the mirror.  Depression. Sadness. Anger.  That's what others saw if they were smart enough to see past my facade. Knowing what I felt inside, I would I have to agree. I was on a path of destruction. Some would I say I was my own downfall waiting to happen. A man drowning himself in alcohol and loose women. That's what I had become. After all, that's all I was good for.  Until Alzerro King f*cked up my day. One sentence completely altered my world. Hiding someone while working with the FBI was the last thing I wanted to do. Then I meet her.  Isabella Vincenzo.  Hurt. Beat. Fragile.  I wasn’t a victim. I wasn’t prey to the monsters that lurked in the dark— at least that’s what I told myself. Trouble had found me, I was sold to the mafia by my family. I was now property of the drug cartel ran by the Russian Mafia, and to be sold to the highest bidder. What happened was never to be expected.  Somewhere in the middle of the USA I’m being kept. Hidden. Held against my will from the monsters…. Little did I know, I traded one monster for another.  Will Jared and Isabella save each other or will the murkiness that has tainted their lives pull them deeper into the darkness?  Sometimes all we need is someone else to be our light in the moments of complete darkness.  Sometimes love can smother the injustice.",
