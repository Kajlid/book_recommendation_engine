  "title": "The Fatal Woman: Three Tales",
  "description": "John Glassco is a stylist of international reputation and has won the Governor-General’s award for both poetry and non-fiction. Readers who know his brilliant Memoirs of Montparnasse will be delighted to find the same sophistication, skill and power at work in these fictional pieces.The figure of the femme fatale - seductive, cruel, irresistible - dominates these three novellas. In The black helmet the fatal woman is disguised as a governess whose disciplinary force and ridged bathing cap entice a passive young dreamer to his awakening and apotheosis. In The Fulfilled Destiny of Electra two fatal women, a mother and daughter bound by passion to the same lover, slowly destroy the body and soul of their man. Lust in Action glances at the future: here, women rule the world, lesbian love is the norm, and imprisoned boys must rebel to prove their manhood only to meet nemesis in the beautiful Marian Hope, female detective extraordinaire.The fatal woman is a diverting and important book by one of Canada’s most distinguished writers.",
