  "description": "No longer availableWhen Mikhail Rossov and Gareth Gruffyd met Daisy Choe she was young, perfect in all ways and everything they both wanted in their lives. But they were soldiers, duty and honor above all. After a wild weekend they had to go back and serve their country, to keep everyone they knew and loved safe. But they never once stopped thinking about her or the emotions she alone could evoke within them both. Fiercely protective they would have done anything for her, but she seemed to just vanish without a trace.One weekend changed her life completely, turning it on it’s ear and showing her just who she could trust and believe in. The men she’d given everything to, including her heart, disappeared and never contacted her again. But she had someone very important depending on her so she did what she had to do. What she never expected was to come face to face with them ten years later. Not that way, not with them looking so good and not because her daughter went looking for her daddies.Word Count: 73,390",
