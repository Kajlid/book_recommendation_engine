  "description": "The story of Ronin Kassius, a male 1st year high school student living on the colonized world of Teloria, who finds himself an unwilling participant in the Gun Princess Royale Championship, where competitors known as Gun Princesses battle for the title of Gun Queen, and the right to compete for the vaunted rank of Gun Empress.  The sequel to \"Awakening the Princess\", and the continuation of Ronin Kassius's day from Hell.  The mysterious and untested Gun Princess, Mirai, has awakened and emerged from her Sarcophagus with Ronin's consciousness in control of her body. Now, Kassius learns of the circumstances surrounding the near death of his own human body, and his involvement in Mirai's creation due to his family's affiliation with House Elsis Novis.  But while one hurdle has been overcome, another props up as Ronin/Mirai and his companions with questionable motives and uncertain loyalties, are transported against their will to a desert locale and a perfect replica of Telos Academy that will serve as the setting for a duel between the recently awoken Mirai, whose full capabilities are as yet unknown, and the reigning Gun Queen of Ar Telica city who has twice fallen shy of earning the title of Gun Empress, and who now aims to use Mirai as a stepping stone to ultimate victory.  To win, Ronin will need to draw upon all that he can of Mirai's preternatural strength if he is to keep himself and his companions alive in a battle that will pull no punches, and where defeating the Gun Queen may earn him little more than a bittersweet victory.",
