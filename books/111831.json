  "title": "Operation Bourbon",
  "description": "\"Then he said the words that we’d all been dreading to hear, We’ve got a rat.\" Targeting the Rebels MC, at a staggering twenty-four years total length, Operation Bourbon was the longest running police undercover and infiltration mission ever conducted in the UK. Now for the first time the story of the operation can be told based on Iain Parke’s extensive conversations with the officer involved, together with extracts from police files and surveillance materials, as well as never before seen interviews with club members and associates, and sections of club documentation showing how the club was set up and run. The result is an astonishing tale of fundamental betrayals at every level, as both bikers and police are forced to ask themselves who they can really trust. As a result, Operation Bourbon opens the books both on club business, and on police undercover operations, in a way never before seen in the UK.",
