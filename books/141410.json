  "description": "And the Floor was Always Lava is a collection of memories (or essays, if you're into that kind of thing). The twenty-four year old narrator reflects back to her four year old self, placing her memories in the context of all she's learned since they occurred. The collection is a unique twist on the classic \"coming of age\" story, in which the narrator explores and sorts through the pieces of her life that have changed with time and growth, and the pieces that are different, but kind of the same.You can purchase it directly from www.michellejunot.com or you can purchase an ebook from all major ebook retailers, including Amazon, iTunes, Barnes and Noble, Sony, Smashwords, etc.",
