  "title": "Unhinged",
  "description": "There are unspoken societal rules that dictate who a person must be in order to fit in, but what happens when someone can't follow those rules? Elaina Beggs never had to face what society expected of her while growing up. The only thing she cared about was being happy and comfortable. But it was all about to change when she started her freshman year of high school. She changed herself piece by piece to become the hot, popular girl she thought people wanted, but she couldn't handle looking in mirrors and not seeing her face. When the world placed her on puppet strings, she had two put aside what she thought she was meant to be or find a way to end it all. Even if it meant ending her own life. Based off of a true story, Unhinged takes readers directly into the mind of a lost teenager to gain a unique perspective on what it means to come-of-age in modern society as a young woman.",
