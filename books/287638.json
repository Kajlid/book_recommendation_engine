  "description": "Harper Jessup is an avid reader, and when her parents become “migrants for God” she must keep her books secret. As Harper grows older and realizes how valuable reading is to her, she comes to understand that her parents’ radical efforts in favor of educational censorship are related to a quest for control within their own family. And so Harper finds she must make the hardest choice of all. “Sure to be controversial, prepare for a stimulating conversation.”-- The New Advocate",
