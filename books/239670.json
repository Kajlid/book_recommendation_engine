  "description": "Inflicted with amnesia, Yumiko Ume Moth has managed to discover the identity of the lost love whom she cannot remember. And she has learned the truth of her mother's murder. The party responsible for the absence of the one and the death of the other appears to be the same: the Supreme Council of Anarchists.  Now she hopes to rescue the brilliant young man who may or may not be her fiance while seeking vengeance for her mother, the Grail Queen. But her only allies are a scatter-brained fairy and the Last Crusade, which consists of a young knight and his dog. Nevertheless, the Foxmaiden will not turn from her path, though all the dark forces of Tartarus stand in her way.  John C. Wright is one of the living grandmasters of science fiction and the author of THE GOLDEN AGE, AWAKE IN THE NIGHT LAND, and IRON CHAMBER OF MEMORY, to name just three of his exceptional books. He has been nominated for both the Nebula and Hugo Awards, and his novel SOMEWHITHER won the 2016 Dragon Award for Best Science Fiction Novel at Dragoncon. The first book in the Moth & Cobweb series, SWAN KNIGHT'S SWORD, was a finalist for the 2017 Dragon Award for Best Young Adult Novel.",
