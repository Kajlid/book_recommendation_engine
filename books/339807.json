  "title": "The Final Oracle",
  "description": "For a thousand years the sacred Oracle of Delphi advised kings and warriors throughout the classical world. Silenced by Roman legions in 393 A.D., the divine prophet passed into legend, fated never to speak again. But did the priests of Delphi record a final message, a secret so powerful it lay buried in a hidden vault for over a millennium? Archaeologists Catherine and Steven Gordon dig up another ancient mystery as they race from one exotic location to another, chased by a ruthless killer whose destiny may have been foretold by the god Apollo himself!",
