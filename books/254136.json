  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B07CRLVC4B Never cross a Craft witch...  Christi Craft is the name and being witchy is my game!  I own a little shop in rural Salem, filled with all manner of fun things; priceless heirlooms, cursed artifacts, bath bombs, Spills (magically spelled pills, if you get my drift). You know, harmless things.  However, Milo James, a sexy AF Warlock Warden, disagrees. He's always giving me citations and fines for selling my cursed artifacts to humans who don't know any better. I’ve known him most of my life, and he sees me as a little sister – at least, that’s how he treats me. Dang it…  If that's not enough, Orrin, my Incubus lover, suddenly wants more from me than just an occasional roll in the sheets. On top of that, I have to deal with this poltergeist I unknowingly acquired with a recent purchase. He's demanding I solve his murder. What he doesn't seem to grasp is that I suck at being a witch.  But things aren't what they seem when it comes to this spirit, and I'm not sure I can help him on my own. With or without my power.  \n**This is a REVERSE HAREM romance filled with laughs, lust, and a whole lot of foul language. You’ve been warned.**",
