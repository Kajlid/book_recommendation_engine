But it seems that things have changed on the home front: her grandfather has dementia, their family farm house is on the market, and her high school sweetheart Brett Barrett, still looking as hot as ever, is the last thing she needs to complicate her life, especially since the ink on her divorce papers is still wet. No matter how much Poppy and Brett try to stay away from each other, they can’t deny the chemistry between them and continue to find themselves wrapped up in each other’s arms. After all, it’s just a quick fling. At least that’s what they tell themselves in order to keep their hearts guarded and other secrets buried. When the secrets are revealed, is their new bond strong enough to keep Poppy in Hudson Hollow? Or will she once again flee town leaving Brett’s heart in the wake of her dust once again?",
