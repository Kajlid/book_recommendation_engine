  "description": "Archaeologist, Dawn Kennedy, is sent to work at a Neolithic tomb in Ireland. The tomb, Newgrange, is famed for its history of reincarnation. Dawn is drawn to studfarm owner Evan O'Brien but their relationship seems thwarted from the start. The locals talk of The Legend of the Banshee, a harbinger of death and when Dawn is haunted by a strange spectre, she feels the past reach out to her. Soon she is living in fear, fear of love, the banshee and Ireland's fractured history and overlooking the river Boyne, Newgrange seems to be waiting, waiting for her love, waiting for her to die.",
