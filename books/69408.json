  "title": "Mind Amplifier: Can Our Digital Tools Make Us Smarter?",
  "description": "Is the human brain the pinnacle of evolution... or the starting point for innovation?\n\nInstead of asking whether the Web is making us stupid, Howard Rheingold (whom MIT calls \"the first citizen of the internet\") turns that question around and asks how designing and using digital media mindfully could make us smarter. What if humans could build tools that leverage our ability to think, communicate, and cooperate? Humans invented social learning, speech, writing, alphabets, printing, computers, and the Internet, which means we should be systematically directing the evolution of intellectual augmentation. Mind Amplifier: Can Our Digital Tools Make Us Smarter? examines the origins of digital mind-extending tools, and then lays out the foundations for their future. Rheingold proposes an applied, interdisciplinary science of mind amplification. He also unveils a new protocol for developing techno-cognitive-social technologies that embrace empathy, mindfulness, and compassion â€” elements lacking from existing digital mind-tools.",
