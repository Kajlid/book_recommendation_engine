  "description": "Useless. Brilliant. Sexy. Uncontrollable. From the childhood foster homes he was bounced around to, the one love he lost and hordes of nameless groupies, even his own bandmates—Your Toxic Sequel’s drummer, Sinjin Fields, has been called it all. That doesn't include the names he calls himself. He knows he’s an addict—knows he’s damaged goods. He doesn’t care, though; drowning out the world numbs him. And for Sin, that’s the closest he'll get to happiness. When a drug-fueled confrontation nearly costs him his closest friend and bandmate, Sinjin is faced with no other choice but to confront each screwed-up facet of who he is and how he got there. What he never expected to encounter was Zoe—an over-achieving, fresh-faced violin prodigy who can’t seem to stay away from him. Not that Sinjin wants her to. She reminds him of the undamaged part of himself. Makes him feel emotions he didn’t know he could feel. Possessive. Protective. Love? And Sinjin will battle every demon haunting him so he doesn’t have to let that go. This book contains adult content and language. Although this book features characters from the DEVOURED series and SAVOR YOU, it is a standalone and can be read without reading the other books.",
