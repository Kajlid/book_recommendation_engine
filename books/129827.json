  "description": "It is said that ‘A man is less than a man without a good woman behind him’. That may be true, but Wynn isn’t a man. Try as he might, Wynn could not be what he wanted to be, neither was he what others thought him to be … until he met his eternal mate. When Cambrie met Wynn, he spoke a simple word, placing a mystical claim on her. She was defeated by love once before and was dead set against it ever again. Every man she had ever known sucked. But then, could she really resist the Apex?",
