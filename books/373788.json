  "title": "Owlsight",
  "description": "Owlsight is the companion volume to Lackey & Dixon's most recent Valdemar novel, Owlflight, and follows the fortunes of Darien, who watched his mentor die as his own life was saved, and of the village he left, Errold's Grove—now safe from the barbarians under the watchful eyes of the Hawkbrothers—and of Keisha, a natural born healer, though not yet officially recognized for her gift. Though he fought long and hard to avoid his destiny, Darien is now gaining new skills as a mage, but a very particular mage with an affinity for the Hawk Owls which have become his closest companions. An imaginatively realized fantasy that brings to life a world rich in natural magic and wonder, beautifully illustrated with Larry Dixon's character portraits.",
