  "description": "Guess who's coming to Vegas?  When Ethan's parents announce that they are coming to Las Vegas to visit him, he's not sure if it's the end of the world or a chance to finally come clean about his sexuality. While his relationship with them has always been strong, coming out as gay might change how they feel about him forever. But the thought of telling his parents about Max and uniting the people he loves most in the world is tempting. It's a gamble he's seriously considering taking.  However, Max has his own thoughts about how much he's willing to let Ethan tell his parents. There's more at stake than just a personal outing; The Elite Poole itself is on the line. How much of the truth is Max willing to reveal in order to keep Ethan happy? And how much money would it take to keep them in the closet for good?
