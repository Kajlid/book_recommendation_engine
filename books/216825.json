  "description": "My Ántonia was originally published in 1918. The novel tells the stories of an orphaned boy from Virginia, Jim Burden, and the elder daughter in a family of Bohemian immigrants, Ántonia Shimerda, who are each brought as children to be pioneers in Nebraska towards the end of the 19th century. Both the pioneers, who first break the prairie sod for farming, as well as the harsh but fertile land itself, feature in this American novel. The first year in the very new place leaves strong lifelong impressions on both children.  This novel is considered Cather's first masterpiece. Cather was praised for bringing the American West to life and making it personally interesting.",
