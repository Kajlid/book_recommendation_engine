  "title": "White Hot Truth: Clarity for Keeping It Real on Your Spiritual Path - from One Seeker to Another",
  "description": "Like a wise girlfriend you can relate to, Danielle cheerleads seekers to take ownership of their spiritual wisdom and self-worth by having a good laugh (and maybe a good cry) at the ways they ve been trying to improve on their self-improvement. For those who love Brene Brown and Liz Gilbert s authentic inspiration, and Marianne Williamson s strong female spirit, White Hot Truth is an intimate and (hilariously) relatable account of self-help tales gone wrong, and very right. Rooted in compassion, feminism, and spiritual activism Danielle lays bare boundaries for spiritual people; the Discipleshit that happens when we give our power away; a Soul-perspective on suffering; over tolerance in relationships, sneaky self-loathing; spiritual glamour. And in her poetic and brazen way, she brings it home with the hottest truth of all: You are your own guru.\"",
