  "description": "Experience all the feels in this unforgettable, second chance, standalone romance from #1 New York Times bestseller Lauren Blakely! I didn't break her heart, and she didn't break mine -- we broke each other's. I never stopped loving her, but time and distance played its cruel role in ripping us apart three years ago when she moved halfway around the world. Now after all those endless miles away, she's returned . . . but I'm not the guy I was before. Beautiful, kind, and loving, she's the same -- my hope. The only one who can make a day better, who can make me feel again with one kiss, one touch, one night. There's so much I have to put back in place now that I'm alone and on my own. Things I never wanted at the age of twenty-five. When I receive an unexpected letter that might hold the clues to everything I desperately need to understand about my family, I'm sure I have to follow it. But that means leaving her once more. She says she'll come with me, and having her by my side will unbreak my heart . . . or destroy it. That's the chance I have to take.",
