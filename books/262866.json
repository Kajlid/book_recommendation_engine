Squirrel and family man, Dirkbell likes the easy life with his wife and young children. But Cooper, the brown terrier, is spending his days barking and disturbing all the neighbours in the woods. Dirkbell just can’t get any peace, so he decides to take matters into his own hands. After consulting with his neighbours – the mice who run the bakery - Dirkbell discovers that Cooper is distressed because his wild behaviour has driven his friend; Tom the cat away. Dirkbell decides to help Copper and himself, and all the other residents of the wood by persuading Tom to come home. By convincing Cooper to value friendship and to be considerate of others, he unites cat and dog again and peace reigns in the woods. Recommended for ages 2–9.",
