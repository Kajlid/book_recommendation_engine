  "description": "A brilliantly original book from one of the 20th century's most influential psychiatrists that goes beyond the usual theories of mental illness and alienation to make a convincing case for the \"madness of morality.\"R.D. Laing is at his most wickedly iconoclastic in this eloquent assault on conventional morality. Compelling, unsettling, consistently absorbing, The Politics of Experience is a classic of genuine importance that will \"excite, enthrall, and disturb. No one who reads it will remain unaffected.\" (Rollo May, Saturday Review )",
