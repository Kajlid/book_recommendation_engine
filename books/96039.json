  "description": "Snipers in the hills overlook half the intersections in Sarajevo. In the streets below, people strife to go about their daily lives, trying to second guess when and where the next bullet will strike. One man, a cellist, defies this game of \"Sarajevo Roulette. In memory of the city's dead, for two consecutive days, he becomes a sitting target as he plays Albinoni's 'Adagio' in the street outside his building. But he is unaware that one young woman observes his performances with unflinching attention...a counter-sniper, detailed to protect him from enemy marksmen.",
