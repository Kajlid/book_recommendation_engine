  "description": "Two women talk, and what they say is explosive. One woman writes, and each part of her becomes a fragment set down in a different notebook. Torn apart by marriage, love affairs, children, and a neurotic society, the one woman, Anna, is going to pieces, breaking down--and finally coming to terms with herself as a total, complete human being...a woman who truly understands herself.A brilliant, complex, compelling work...an artistic vision of the struggles and joys that mark every free woman.",
