  "description": "It’s my final day at Kensington School, and my exchange is coming to an end. My flight for New York leaves tomorrow, and I’m not ready to say goodbye to the boys I love. But then three key things happened at school. Noah told me to forget about him, Harry broke up with me, and I finally kissed Noah Williams. When I kissed him in the lunchroom in front of everyone, it was out of anger. I wanted to prove to Harry that I didn’t have feelings for Noah.But I was wrong. The kiss was incredible. But it was also a mistake. Harry watched it happen, Mohammad sat in shock, and Noah told me that he would never forgive me. I made a huge, public mess of things. But thankfully, it’s time for me to leave. I’m going to take Noah’s advice and cut all ties. No good-byes. No apologies. No more heartbreak.I’m going to leave the three boys I love in London, hoping that they’ll be able to pick up the pieces of their friendship. And maybe in the process, they’ll find the pieces of my broken heart. Because I know I’ll be going to New York without it.",
