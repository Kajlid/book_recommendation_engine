  "description": "This is the continuing story of James C. Patch and Jacob Masterson. The first book, The Books of James C. The Barrier chronicled the adventures of Jacob Masterson as he attempted to destroy the evil barrier that was preventing spirits from entering the Utopia on the other side. James C. Patch was an author living in the early 1900's when tragedy struck his family when he decided to write down what he found out about death and the afterlife. James C. Patch was a split-spirit. A spirit that could split from his body prior to death and was able to cross through the barrier and see through his spirit what was on the other side. While in his spirited state he noticed millions of spirits that were not able to penetrate the barrier. The majority of these spirits were children who had not had time to collect a lot of memories and those are the spirits that the barrier preyed upon. Jacob found out that memories were the key to the rapid penetration of the barrier and they were able to connect with loved ones that were already on the other side. This is the third and final installment.",
