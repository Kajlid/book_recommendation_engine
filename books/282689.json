  "title": "New Age Lies to Women",
  "description": "A startling book! The first to completely reveal the New Age campaign to deceive and seduce women. Satan knows that if he can capture the mind and body of a woman, he then can quickly move to conquer her husband, her children, her entire family and circle of friends. In New Age Lies to Women, Wanda Marrs thoroughly documents the almost incredible Plan of the New Age leadership to foster sexual immorality by inciting lust feelings and creating seductive imagery in women's minds. She also explains how the New Age has successfully been able to damage and hurt women psychologically, break up marriages, lure our children into Satanism, cults and the occult, kill unborn babies, and undermine women's faith in God. Must reading for every woman in America!",
