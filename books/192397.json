  "description": "When we feel that we aren’t enough, or that we aren’t good enough, we also fear that we’ll never have enough.Money. We love it. We hate it. If we don’t have enough, we’re struggling to get more. If we do have it, we’re fighting to hold on to it. Why does money have to be such a source of anxiety? Is it possible to find peace? Yes! According to master integrative coach Nancy Levin, the real key to creating financial freedom isn’t changing what we do, it’s changing our limiting beliefs about how we feel —and that requires more than just learning how to invest.In Worthy , Nancy makes an essential, eye-opening connection: the state of our net worth is a direct reflection of our self-worth . Then she shows us how to get to the root of the problem and do the internal work that’s needed to replace feelings of unworthiness with a solid sense of our own value. Filled with inspiring real-life stories and thought-provoking questions and answers, her 10-step plan helps us to:   • Get real about the money issues we face every day   • Examine the excuses we use to avoid creating the life we really want   • Be willing to see ourselves as worthy of abundance in all its forms   • Take back our financial power —and watch amazing things start to happenWhether we’re looking for financial ease or a new relationship with money and ourselves, Worthy will give us the tools to clear the path for wholeness, fulfillment, and richness in all areas of our lives, not just in our bank accounts.",
