  "title": "Juno & Juliet",
  "description": "With this irresistibly fresh debut about a set of twins in their first year of college in Ireland, Julian Gough (\"Roddy Doyle in an extremely good mood.\" â€” The Washington Post Book World ) has established himself as Ireland's most delightful new voice in fiction.Juno and Juliet Taylor are both beautiful blondes, but Juliet is convinced that Juno is the more beautiful, as well as the more intelligent, charming, worldly, and wise. Yet neither feels any sense of rivalry, which is good, given that their freshman year turns out to be more than either could handle alone. Juno has an erratic artist for a boyfriend and is stalked by a pervert who sends anonymous letters. And Juliet is in love with her grad-student tutor, who is stymied by her youth and preoccupied with his dying father. Hilarious and tender, ribald and smart, Juno & Juliet is a refreshing romp with two sisters whose love and devotion are infectious.",
