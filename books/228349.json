  "description": "She likes picking up her camera because it allows her to see things through a different lens. Like when she lost her job recently and instead of focusing on what she’s forced to leave behind, she zooms in on the new options opening up in front of her. Or when a dangerous looking silver fox comes rolling up her path on a FatBoy, and her digital output shows a deep loneliness, matching her own, in his ice-blue eyes. But when she's working on making her dreams come true, she inadvertently captures something in her viewfinder she can’t un-see.  He wasn’t supposed to be here, but he can’t seem to escape his old life. Stuck in an old trailer in the mountains, he walks a fine line between ruse and reality. With the arrival of a young-looking pixie—who turns out to be a full grown, hot-blooded woman—his balance is thrown. He tries to avoid her, but with the little pixel peeper snapping everything in sight, she unintentionally risks his exposure.  And his focus needs to be sharp to keep her from danger.",
