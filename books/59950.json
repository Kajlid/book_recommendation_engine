  "description": "As a writer, JJ Sprightly tries to create characters that jump off the page&151;figuratively, that is. She never expects that one day her characters would literally jump off the page and onto the couch of her home office. But that's what her hero and heroine, Blake Teesdale and Alex Zurich, do. They pop out of their novel to offer JJ some help in finding the man of her dreams.There's only one small snag in the plans . . . okay . . . two rather large snags. JJ wants nothing to do with the man her characters have chosen, Kennedy King Cooper. And the second snag? Alex and Blake can't return to their own book.Will JJ ever create her own personal romance story? And will Alex and Blake be able to return to the pages of their own book?\"Sensuality Level: sensual\"",
