The Blood Prince of Langkasuka is a reimagining of an ancient Southeast Asian vampire legend; the coming-of-age story of Raja Bersiong or the Fanged King.  The monster is not always who you expect it to be - seventeen-year-old Raja Perita Deria, a carefree, self-centred young prince who descends into despair, as he turns into an angst-ridden vampire, while confronted with a chilling series of murders in the palace of Langkasuka. Will he find the strength to save himself and his kingdom? Described by Gerakbudaya Bookshop, Penang as, 'A strongly told tale, reworking one of the earliest surviving legends of Nusantara (maritime Southeast Asia)... what follows is thwarted love, plots and deaths, the presence of the supernatural in everyday life, and a seemingly unstoppable path to doom and destruction.'

Colyard as one of 'The 35 Best Vampire Books to Read Now,' in the April 2022 issue of Bustle  magazine.  It was also picked by Emily Hughes of Nightfire Newsletter as the February pick in 'All The Horror Books We're Excited About in 2021' - A vampire novel set against the political landscape of 12th Century Southeast Asia, following a prince whose chance encounter with an irresistible woman leaves him craving blood.",
