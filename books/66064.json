Rayjan watches their Fae friend being accepted by his Life Mate the moment he approaches her, could he be so lucky with his?  Arazel, Arienne and Raina are three of the Dark King Liessen’s Elite Guards, the pride of his realm. Beautiful and deadly they are no man’s possession, until they meet their Life Mates. One will accept hers on sight. Another will entice hers to her side. The third will have to fight to escape the boundaries she has lived all her life with, to be able to take her place by her Life Mate’s side.",
