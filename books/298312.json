  "description": "Stonefort, Maine. It seems like forever that the Morgans have hidden their magical heritage. And for just as long, a witch has served as caretaker of the Haskell House, where no woman has ever been harmed. But when a drug lord and frighteningly powerful sorcerer covets the Morgan family's alliance with the magical being known as the Dragon, a youth will have to master the power of the Dragon-and, despite the historical tensions between the two families, he'll need the help of the Haskell witch to do it. The time has come to mend some fences-or see the town destroyed.",
