  "description": "Theodore Prudcomb was a no-nonsense kind of guy, proper, conventional, and just the facts. Those were the qualities that got him the office manager job at the ad agency. But right now, the facts were that he needed a place to rent and he needed it soon. The only decent apartment available in New Orleans was located above a voodoo shop. That meant the beautiful, vivacious Delphine Larieux, proprietor of the voodoo shop, would be his landlady. Delphine needs a tenant, and thinks the straight-laced but handsome Theodore just needs to loosen up. Luckily, she has just the voodoo spell to take care of that. It’s a game of opposites attract in this sexy romp through Bourbon Street and the French Quarter, filled with magic, mayhem, and colorful characters. Will Delphine’s spell work? Will Theodore learn to loosen up? Or will Delphine be a victim of her own magical meddlings?Now only .99 on Amazon!!",
