Stranded for the weekend, he meets a beautiful but mysterious woman and becomes embroiled in a double homicide. Now law enforcement and a hired assassin are in a race to find him - one to arrest him and the other to kill him. He must decide whether to trust the woman he is falling in love with, or come to the conclusion that she might have been involved in the homicides.
