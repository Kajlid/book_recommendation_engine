  "description": "I was a good girl. I was an academic over-achiever, a varsity all-star athelete and a straight-as-an-arrow all-American girl with ambition and a future that was all planned out. I had no time for friends, love, and romance. Then came the summer when Erika came to stay with us- and she turned everything upside down! Here's the story of one humorous, embarrassing, romantic and downright decadent week in which I did things I really didn't think I was capable of. It's all taken right from the pages of my personal diary so excuse me if there's a little TMI. Can you handle it? I dare you to try!",
