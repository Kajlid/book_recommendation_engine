  "title": "The Ultimate Religion",
  "description": "The Ultimate Religion is an exploration of a fundamentalist church, its members and their interpretation of the bible, via the story of one woman. This book will resonate in particular with those who have experience of such 'churches' or who wish to understand the mentality of people who lead and join such organisations. This is a fairly lengthy novel, inspired by real-life events, recounting true sentiments and experiences. The story follows the child, Megan, through a tumultuous upbringing and early religious experiences, into adulthood and the point when she falls into the company of a fundamentalist Christian group and becomes embroiled in their contradictory world of genuine miracles, fun and love; coupled with religious fanaticism, gross sexism and social control. With an open approach to some difficult topics, such as abuse, terminal illness and gender roles, some content may be contentious or painful to read. Eye-opening biblical scriptures are quoted to illustrate the basis for some of the characters' beliefs. This is a story of the making and breaking of precious friendships, of one woman's desire to find and understand her place in the world, healing for her past and a sense of self and purpose; and the price of that quest. Megan finds faith, loses it and rediscovers it, while experiencing the duality of others and eventually discovering the true source of miracles.",
