  "description": "What do you do when you have nowhere to go?  Meg's whole world has crumbled out from under her. Her only family, her father, has died, leaving her alone and destitute. She can only see one option-- driving away to wherever the road takes her.  Her road ends in Trinity, Newfoundland, a place of rare beauty, and the frigid sea all around. Meg has never seen the sea before, and is captivated by it, drawn to the ocean to the point of obsession.  When she meets Devin Horan, he completely shreds all the truths she thought she knew about herself and the world around her.  And opens up the possibility of knowing a mother who may not have drowned after all.",
