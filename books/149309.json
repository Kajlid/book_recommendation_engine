  "description": "This edition is no longer available.Diego Champagne, Sergeant in Arms for the Louisiana Banni motorcycle gang, has grown up tough—half French, half Creole, and all male. Diego loves men, but keeps his sex life on the down-low...until he meets Colby Young, that is.Colby carries his own baggage. He has his own reasons for not believing in love—reasons he doesn't share—and he sure as the devil doesn't like it when he's forced to accept help from anyone.When Diego intervenes in a bar brawl during a motorbike rally and saves Colby and his best friend, Spider McGraw, leader of the rival gang Death Proof, it begins to look as if Colby and Diego are going to be joined at the hip. Somebody puts a hit out on Colby, and Spider's up to his neck in mayhem. When the Banni offer their protection to advance their own game, Colby begins to wonder: is love like artificial moonlight, seductive yet false? Or is it powerful and true, something for which he might risk everything...maybe even his life?",
