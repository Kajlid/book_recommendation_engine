Never in her wildest dreams did she really believe that vampires were real. At least she didn't until the night she was abducted. Taken and held captive with four other women, they quickly learn the reason for their abduction. Due to a genetic fluke, their blood contains the v factor... And the vampires want them to repopulate their world. Expected to participate in a market and pick a mate, Keely is floored by her attraction to the sexy vampire that guards her. But he's not the only one that wants her. Keely realizes that all of the vampires are hot, horny, and ready to mate, but how can any female choose?",
