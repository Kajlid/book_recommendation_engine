  "title": "Captain Rum: A Wondrous Adventure",
  "description": "Captain Rum is a fascinating historical journal that records one of the most unique sea voyages ever undertaken. In 1821, Fintan McAdam - a.k.a. Captain Rum- sailed solo across the oceans. During his journey he made incredible discoveries that still fascinate historians, geologists and biologists to this day.McAdam’s journey was turbulent before he even departed as his unfortunate past envelops him. After finally setting sail, he encountered many problems and situations that arose not just from Mother Ocean, but also from demons within his own mind. In his final journal entries, McAdam confronts not only his greatest real-life fear, but his deepest, most painful memories as well.This amazing story was edited by semi-retired Oxford Professor H. D. Lampluck, who stumbled across the dusty, abandoned journal on a long-forgotten shelf in a university library. His well-researched preface and footnotes add extra detail and charm to the tale. Captain Rum, as told in McAdam’s own words, is a tale of discovery, despair and delight. It will keep you enthralled through many a stormy night.",
