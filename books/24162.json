  "title": "Atlanta Bones",
  "description": "A missing husband. A widow grieving--for lost cash. A reluctant adventurer pulled into the puzzle. Twists and turns and violent, ugly death. Atlanta Bones is a Florida thriller with hard-edged action, exotic locales, colorful characters, and a twist of wit, served very dry. Jim Dallas is an independent investigator in the mode of Travis McGee, and Atlanta Bones has a flavor reminiscent of John D. MacDonald, Carl Hiassen, and Randy Wayne White.",
