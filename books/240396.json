  "description": "A Lesbian Romance That Will Make You All Warm and Fuzzy Inside (Book 1 of Lesbian Short Story Series - No Cliffhanger)   Erin Hunter is sick of her life being the same thing day in and day out. Her stress levels are rising and nothing seems to work. Jessie, her friend since high school, suggests Yoga, a notion that Erin dismisses as being hipster/hippie nonsense, but she’s desperate for a solution. She goes to a free trial lesson, with mat provided, and finds that there’s quite a few things to like about yoga, number one being her completely drop-dead gorgeous instructor, Greece-born Dione Makos, which leads to entirely different problems.  Erin has never had feelings for a woman before. She wanted a change, and now she’s got one.",
