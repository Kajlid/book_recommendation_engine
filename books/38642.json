At first the relationship is like a dream come true but it quickly turns into a nightmare when Eric becomes abusive, controlling and sexually violates Jessica. Unable to understand how someone could say I love you and the next minute treats you like someone they hate, Jessica gets sucked into the abusive behavior and loses herself completely to it.",
