  "description": "The conclusion of the critically acclaimed DEADLAND SAGA:Winter has arrived. It has been nearly one year since the zombie hordes claimed the world. As the plague eats away at its victims’ bodies, the Fox survivors search for a safe place to rebuild what they have lost. But a dangerous new threat has risen, hunting them from every direction. To survive, Cash, Clutch, and their small band of refugees must put their faith in a group of strangers and a new government with radical plans. It will take all of the Fox survivors’ strength and courage to endure in this barren, hostile world. Even that might not be enough. (Deadland Rising is a journey through Dante Alighieri's “Paradiso”, the classic tale on the seven virtues… zombie apocalypse style!)Book 1: 100 Days in DeadlandBook 2: Deadland’s HarvestBook 3: Deadland Rising",
