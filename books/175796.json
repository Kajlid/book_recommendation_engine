But just as they embrace a future without any more cosmic lunacy: The Earth has started fluxing in and out of Existence; Theo's twin girls are teleporting; and Jason can't tell which version of his life is real.All because of Milo, the Universe's ultimate gremlin.Joined by the mysterious Jamie -- a down-and-out hotel clerk from Eternity -- Jason and Theo reunite on a frantic, cross-country chase across America, praying they can retrieve that radioactive jar, circumvent Milo, and save the Earth from irrevocable disaster.In author Russ Colchamiro's uproarious sequel to FINDERS KEEPERS, he finally confirms what we've long suspected ... that there's just no de Milo quite like a GENIUS DE MILO.",
