  "description": "For the first time ever, the Godmothers' League is allowing a student to be homeschooled--and that student just happens to be Lacey Unger-Ware. Fairy godmother training is tougher than it seems, though. Rhyming spells, magic dresses, and all those fairy-godmothering books are just the start of Lacey's troubles. When jetpack-obsessed Martin Shembly goes from unpopular to the biggest outcast in Lincoln Middle School history, Lacey tries to help with a little magic. Oops!Now she's caught in a serious spell bind! Martin is her new fairy godmother client! And if she fails to fix Martin's problems, Lacey and Katarina will be whooshed away to the South Pole. Worse: Martin's life will permanently stink--as in forever. Will Lacey's training be enough to save them all? Or is Katarina going to need to learn to speak penguin?",
