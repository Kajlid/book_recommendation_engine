  "title": "Zombie Crusade: Snapshot: Israel",
  "description": "When an unknown virus that turns humans into flesh-eating zombies begins to spread around the world, no one is safe. A few small communities in disparate locations manage to create at least temporary safe-havens, including the inhabitants of an Israeli kibbutz. As the global crisis tears apart the fabric of human civilization, survivors must learn how to defend themselves against a horrific enemy that turns friends and family into mindless cannibals who can survive seemingly fatal wounds. Zombie Crusade Snapshots are quick glimpses of critical locations around the world as the zombie pandemic detailed in the Zombie Crusade series begins to unfold. While the snapshots connect to the main storyline of the novels (some in obvious ways, others in ways that will become more apparent as the series continues), they may also be read as stand-alone stories.",
