  "description": "As a young graduate from Veterinary College, Hugh Lasgarn could not have made a worse impression when he fell over the doorstep on arriving at his first practice in the Welsh Borders. He came there for thirty he is still there today - and his memories of those early months make a heartwarming book. Faced with patients ranging in size from a giant champion Hereford bull with corns to a budgerigar with a swollen crop, Hugh Lasgarn conveys the joy and laughter, and sometimes the grief, that are part of a life devoted to the well-being of animals in all their variety.",
