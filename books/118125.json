  "description": "Orlando, Florida, dubbed by many in the press as \"the Seattle of Electronica,\" is home to Danny Boyle, self-proclaimed armchair radical and junior revolutionary. His story, 200 Beats per Minute, has been praised for its honest, unflinching portrayal of the 90's youth experience.  Danny asserts that it is the roots of the drug problem that society must address, not the manifestation. Through his personal struggle with drug abuse, violence, the system and his own sexual identity, 200 BPM espouses the power of change and the strength of the individual, and seeks to encourage others to resist being defined by their peers, their past, and their environment.",
