  "title": "The Late, Great U.S.A.: The Covert Creation of the North American Union",
  "description": "In The Late Great USA , Jerome Corsi argues that the benignly-named Security and Prosperity Partnership, created at a meeting between George W. Bush, Stephen Harper and Vincente Fox, is in fact the same kind of regional integration plan that led Europe to form the EU. According to Corsi, the elites in Europe behind the EU knew that it would be necessary to conceal from the peoples of Europe what was being done in their name until the process was so far advanced that it had become irreversible. Could the same thing be happening here? Is American sovereignty doomed? Â  Using dozens of documents secured through the Freedom of Information Act and his trademark hard-hitting interviews, Corsi sets out a chilling view of America's possible harmonized future - one being created covertly, without voter input or Congressional oversight. Could our government's unfathomable position on illegal immigration be tied to the prospect of an integrated North American Union?",
