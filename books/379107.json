  "description": "On their last assignment, GORGON agents Chris Gibson and his partner John Soong protected Russian mob lawyer Andrei Voronin rather than killing him. They covered Andrei’s tracks, forged a shaky relationship, and their international intelligence and paramilitary group staged Andrei’s death and took him into the fold. Nikita Kazakov, a Russian cop who had used Andrei as a source and promised him protection, plots to avenge his protégé. He soon tracks down Chris—the “killer”—only to find a man he desires, and Chris is just as intrigued. Amidst the danger of the unsolved mystery still lingering around Andrei, Chris and Nikita stalk each other, meet for heated sex, and try to work out who the other criminal, cop, hitman… or lover.",
