  "title": "A Halloween Treat & Edward Gorey’s Ghosts",
  "description": "In A Halloween Treat, kids and cats go trick or treating, and gather loot that might be tricks—or perhaps the best treat imaginable: their very own monsters. A short vignette, published in book form for the very first time, it will be an undiscovered delight for Gorey fanatics. Turn the book over to its back cover to read from the other direction, and you’ll delve into a collection of Edward Gorey’s Ghosts, curated from his extensive oeuvre. Charmingly spooky, these ghastly phantasms come in all shapes and sizes—the perfect thing to curl up with on a chilling Halloween night.",
