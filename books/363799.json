  "description": "Never, in all her days, had she imagined herself in a position like this. Vivid fantasies aside, Rachel had never considered acting on the impulses that invaded her thoughts throughout the day, until her session with Dr. Bass. They were private affairs stored only in some scurrilous alcove of her mind. Yet her mind interacted with other minds, and often, there were fragments of information to be had in decidedly ironic ways. Ren√© Bass, for instance, listened to her confession of the scandalous Jaguar masturbation, and fantasy bondage scenarios and produced a copy of the bondage magazine. While not something Professor Rachel Leeds believed would qualify as a \"literary device,\" it was nonetheless pivotal in the events in which she was now participating. Namely, being on her way to a hardware store to find something to use as a whip on the girl who was naked and bound in a hotel room number 66, the Mark-of-the-Almost-Beast.~Faith. To believe in things not yet seen, they say. Patrice was faithful a long time ago. Then she communed with the faithless, and their cloying demands. She needed evidence because it made her feel foolish. And faith was lost. But the bitterness left her cold, barefoot, detached from the warmth of love and connection. Then she discovered a different faith. One born of her own power, left untapped for eons, swirling, ebullient, joyful. And now, coming full circle, she found herself wholly unqualified, still, to manifest from faith alone. Yet, perfectly accustomed to crying alone, wishing alone. Hope did not float. It sat on the bottom of a vast sea of isolation, weighted by its own lie.",
