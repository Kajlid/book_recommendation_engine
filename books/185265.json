  "description": "Carry this book with you as a candle, and become part of the solution. A stubborn look at addiction and alcoholism based on 20 years of study and a keen ability to connect a vast amount of information. A Candle Lit is an easy-to-read solution-focused study of alcoholism and addiction, causes and cures, with open-mindedness and eye-opening detailed description. It's intended for therapists, professionals, caregivers and sufferers, and aims to connect the community by identifying common experience. This book is about pre-disease suffering; in other words, there's a lot of examination of \"real-world\" and \"real-people\" situations which are not full-blown alcoholism; the reason is to \"see it coming\" if possible. The book is extremely detailed, explaining how it \"feels\" to experience many of the feelings involved with addiction, cravings, alcoholism and denial, and what if feels like to \"watch it happen,\" from the point of view of a caregiver. The examination searches for similarities and patterns, while the text remains easy to read. Anyone will find it interesting, I think.Other key topics discussed are depression, mania, bi-polar, caregiving, hunger as it relates to cravings, pride-confusion, stubbornness, pre-denial, pre-disease suffering, curable aspects, choice, memory, cause, enabling, faith.New Concepts include:Tangentizing - Alcoholism has curable major causesHunger Theory - The addiction / hunger masquerade Alcoholic Malbehavior - A symptom of alcoholismThe Choice Question - The gateway to permanence 2nd Edition1st Electronic EditionISBN 9781633188853",
