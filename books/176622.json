  "description": "The is a  Stand Alone  novel with an unexpected twist. If you think you have the Hart Brothers figured out, this book will change everything. If you like your novels to have a smooth ride,  do not read this!This book contains sex and language and is not intended for younger readers.\"Hello, my name is Kade Hart and I’m a drug addict.\" Isn't that what recovering addicts are supposed to say? Hell if I know. I’m not sure about anything anymore. Not since I met her. Juliette. She's my game changer. I’ve lived on the streets, been in places no one ever wants to see, survived pure hell with the bastard who raised me. I thought I'd finally managed to put all that behind me, come to terms with who and what I am. Until she walked into my life. She’s running from the people who slaughtered her family, people who want her dead, too, and she makes me want to be the kind of man who can protect her, who can save her. But I'm not sure I’m that guy. I'm no one's hero.Or am I?If she asks me why I love her, I wouldn’t be able to tell her a single reason. Because there isn’t one. There are dozens. All wrapped and merged together to create my special love for her. I’ve often heard the phrase, “She stole my heart.” Something can’t be stolen which is freely given and I have not only given her mine, I have laid it at her feet.",
