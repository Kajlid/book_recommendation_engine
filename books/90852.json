But they are opposed by the minions of the Dark God, who seeks to possess the Tear for his own ends.A breathless race for a priceless treasure, against time, myriad sinister and competing evil forces, and ultimately against the fundamentals of nature, which in Midkemia can be as formidable as the Gods themselves...",
