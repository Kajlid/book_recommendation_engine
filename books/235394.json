  "description": "With just a few lines of code, one average man will change the world--and set in motion the adventure of a lifetime! When 20-year-old Nelson stumbles upon a secret and complex trick to coding, he finds himself anonymously helping people with the aid of his new app. The worldwide attention pushes him to launch a bold plan allowing free access of this life-changing app to anyone for a limited time. Fervor to upload the new app is at fever pitch as the world waits for the unveiling. However, secret government agencies are worried. Fearing what the effects of this app will do, they plan to stop the app from ever getting out before the world has a chance to enter the category of hero, even the category labelled Subhero. The race is on for the world's chance at change, where the new cool is being average and doing random accidents of kindness. Suddenly, the world can become a Subhero overnight and there's no stopping what Nelson has started!",
