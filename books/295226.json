  "description": "The three-volume Journeys of the Catechist is the quest of a hero who questions every person and animal he meets, in a world where the impossible is normal and virtue is the greatest weapon a champion can possess.Etjole Ehomba is a herdsman whose simple sense of honor demands that he fulfill the dying wish of a shipwrecked stranger. His promise means that Ehomba must walk the length of a world armed only with a bone knife and a sky-metal sword, crossing lands of unceasing peril, sailing an impassable ocean, vanquishing an unstoppable evil, and rescuing a woman he has never met for the sake of a dead man he did not know.No wizard or warrior would attempt such a mad quest. But a man who poses questions to everything he meets may find answers that no wizard could imagine. . . .",
