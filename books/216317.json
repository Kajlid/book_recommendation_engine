  "description": "For Mature Adult Audiences 18+. Contains language and actions some may deem offensive. Sexually explicit content. Ménage – MFM.Ioanna Jordan works her plushy butt to the bone. Bad job after worse job, scrambling to make ends meet. She is drowning in debt and her last life preserver is one covered with lies and poison. Why else would she be working as a cocktail server in an illegal fight club like Fortune Favors? Why does she stay? Why does she fight so hard to make a good life? For her sick daughter.Tameron Albro has seen it all and done it all in the fast paced and short careered life of MMA. How has one gone from Vegas lights to Boston underground? A lucky takedown, that's how. But he can’t stay away, the rush, the blood lust, the cheer of the crowd as he takes down his opponent still calls to him. Plus he has a ringer, a sure bet in the cage to rise to the top as long as he keeps the Moskiven Family from sinking their fangs into him.Mikhail Pashkov wants nothing more than to get his family out of Russia. Lucky for him Tameron ‘The Beast’ Albro found him on the street, patched him up, and gave him a job hanging drywall. But that's not going to get his family safe and if beating up some asshole in a cage gets him a better cash flow, then that's what he needs to be doing, as long as he can keep the mob off his back.Ioanna wasn't looking for handouts or love, she just wanted her daughter home from the hospital. Tameron and Mikhail wasn't expecting to meet anyone that easily tamed the raging beasts inside of them like Ioanna and her sweet little girl did. They would do whatever they needed to do to keep not only Ioanna in their arms, but to save her daughter, Savanah.",
