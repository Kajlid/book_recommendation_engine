  "description": "THE ROAD AWAY FROM HOME ALWAYS SEEMS TO LEAD BACK TO OUR MOTHERS.I am not, nor will I ever be, the kind of woman who wears pearls with her apron while cooking meat loaf for her husband. But when I was a kid, my mother, Babs, prepared me to be the next June Cleaver–teaching me lessons that belonged to another era. Another world, practically. My mother's world. I couldn't wait to leave home and get away from her. But now, well–let's just say life hasn't turned out quite as I'd planned. And heaven help me, I'm going home. Laney Hoffman–Cotton Queen, 1975.It's funny–all I ever wanted was to teach my daughter, Laney, how to be a lady so she could find a good husband and take her rightful place in our community. But Laney has always remained convinced that my life and my ideas are, well, pathetic. She has no idea–no idea!–what it is to lose a husband, to watch your dreams wither while keeping a smile on your face for the neighbors. Now, that is a talent. Laney is probably too smart for her own good, but being smart hasn't kept her out of trouble. Thank heavens I'm here to help pick up the pieces. Babs Hoffman–Cotton Queen First Runner-Up, 1956.",
