  "description": "“Bless me, Father, for I am about to sin.”  Those words should have tipped Father Elias off that his relationship with the intense Sebastian would not run smoothly.  Their very first confession he admits to killing several people. In self-defense. However, the longer they meet the more Elias suspects that this isn’t true. Nor is that the only problem he has with the handsome, blue-eyed killer.  The priest had always feared the struggle between purity of soul and weakness of flesh would come, but he hadn’t realized just how far he could fall.",
