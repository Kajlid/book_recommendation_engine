  "description": "The heart of this collection is a cycle of Chile poems by \"the Pablo Neruda of North American authors\" (Sandra Cisneros). In his eighth collection of poems, Martin Espada celebrates the power of poetry itself. The Republic of Poetry is a place of odes and elegies, collective memory and hidden history, miraculous happenings and redemptive justice. Here poets return from the dead, visit in dreams, even rent a helicopter to drop poems on bookmarks.",
