  "description": "Retired businessman Worthy McGuire knows he cannot put it off any longer. Time is not on the side of the gruff World War II veteran racing to fulfill a promise he made amid the horrors of the D-Day invasion. As he plans a pilgrimage from Michigan to the site of both his best and worst day, Worthy now must rely on the those he trusts the least-his family. With no one else to help him meet the physical demands of the trip, Worthy grudgingly includes his two grandchildren, David and Shannon, who are each battling their own insecurities. As his controlling son, Ted, and his manipulative daughter-in-law, Angela, follow Worthy and his grandkids to France, they have one to drag the aging man home where they hope to take command of his finances and place him in a nursing home. As Worthy searches for a family from his past, only time will tell if he can patch the crumbling relationships with his family before it is too late. In this historical tale, a World War II veteran takes a journey of honor and courage as he sets off to complete the most important mission of his long life.",
