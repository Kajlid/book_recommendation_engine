  "description": "Meet Shy yet precocious, charming though self-obsessed, privileged but sad, your otherwise typical nineteen-year-old Brown University student. About to start her second year of college, tragedy hits when her autistic brother falls seventy-two feet off a cliff to his death. Was it an accident? Was it murder? Fearing that she's losing her mind, Sophia turns to writing to deal with the pain of her brother's death, her mother's subsequent abandonment of the family for a much younger woman and the circus side-show insanity that goes along with being the daughter of semi-famous parents involved in the pop music industry. In a biting voice that conjures up something reminiscent of a postmodern Holden Caulfield meets Sylvia Plath, Sophia evokes our sympathy as well as our distrust as she begins to question her future place in a world she's not always certain actually exists. Sophia spares no one, least of all herself, while trying her best not to go off the deep-end balancing college and her tumultuous life at home, eventually discovering that only she can find the peace she seeks within.",
