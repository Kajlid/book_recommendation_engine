  "description": "Poppy Hotshot playboy and devilishly handsome hockey winger, Declan McAvoy, is a big man on campus and I’m just the nerdy little sister of his teammate... or I was until I let it slip I had never been kissed. With the NHL draft hanging over his head and my brother at his side—both on and off the ice—I’m afraid I’ll be stuck in the friend zone forever. The way I feel about Declan and his stormy gray eyes is anything but friendly. He has secrets to keep and I have a story to write…If we cross the line, complicated doesn’t even begin to cover it. He might be known as a callous player, but he’s one player I’m willing to gamble on.Declan This is my year to draft to the NHL and nothing can stand in my way… especially not a complication like kissing my teammate’s little sister.Poppy is beautiful, brilliant—and off-limits. For the first time in my life, I’ve found someone worth the risk, but she deserves better than keeping secrets and sneaking around behind her brother’s back. On the ice I have it all figured out, but when it comes to her... I’m all out of plays.The stakes are higher than ever... and my heart isn’t the only thing on the line. She has an article to finish, and I have a pro career to focus on. Falling for Poppy could mean game over for both of us, but that won’t stop me from wanting to make her mine.",
