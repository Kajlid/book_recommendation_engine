  "description": "Fear the unknown, or reach out and take it for all its worth. Meet Angel Michaels the first lady of the series. For Angel there has never been a question about going after what she wants, however it seemed everyone else around her had their own opinions on how exactly her life was supposed to be lived. Instead of living in the shadows and taken the safe road she decided to pack her bags and head for tropical waters. Taking on the unknown in a way even she never imagined everything couldnâ€™t have gotten any better. Until the curve ball of life decides love should actually be part of her mix. If there is anything to be said about just how she was going to handle it all she was planning to have all of the say so and maybe a little more. Get ready for Angel and all the flare she brings to The Ladies Series after all there is a distinction in being the first lady.",
