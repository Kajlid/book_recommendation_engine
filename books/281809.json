  "description": "They always say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but what happens when your brain is set on lying to you every time you look in the mirror?The thing about emotional pain is that it leaves invisible scars.No one sees them but you.No one feels them but you.But those scars can be traced by the gentlest of touch and I found that touch in the form of a man. He didn't heal me, but his love changed me.The start of our relationship was ... intense. Why? Well, because that same man rejected me years ago and he didn't even remember. I was invisible to him.Now his heart beats for me and mine for him. Our souls are entwined in a way that would never be separated, but this almost perfect man has a secret that could alter the course of our lives forever.",
