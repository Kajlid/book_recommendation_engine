  "title": "Midnight Girls",
  "description": "Everywhere Allegra goes, scandal follows, and in Allegra's shadow are her closest friends since school, the Midnight Girls—a glitzy, decadent page turner of high society passion and secrets. From the prestigious dormitories of Westfield to the irresistible socialite scene of present-day London, Allegra and her group are forever bound by secrets and scandal. Romily de Lisle—super rich, brilliant, bored, and as blessed as Allegra when it comes to looks—is a force to be reckoned with. Imogen Heath—pretty, timid, and hopelessly drawn to Allegra's reckless charm—longs to be a part of the glitzy high-society world where her friends move with such ease. Once free of the cloistered worlds of school and university, the Midnight Girls face new and different challenges, but they are forever bonded by a terrible secret they've sworn never to break. Bitter rivalries arise as their professional lives soon cross paths; greed, tragedy, and sinister passions threaten their allegiance; and each of them stands to lose what she loves most.",
