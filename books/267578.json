  "description": "The Rich Guy is a steamy romance set among the rich British, upper class. Rosalind’s family have fallen from grace and she is no longer one of the social elite. Reduced to serving canapes and Champagne at the weddings of her former peers she’d actually quite pleased she’s no longer one of them, until she meets Jay. Jay is handsome, very very rich and unable to tell Rosalind exactly who he is so that he can be sure that her love for him is because of who he is not what he’s worth. In a whirlwind romance, Rosalind comes up against those that would rather she would remember her new social place. Will she and Jay make it, or will their financial polar opposites drive them apart?",
