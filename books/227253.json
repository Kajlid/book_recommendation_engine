  "description": "Faustina Casanova is a beauty and a thief, not necessarily in that order. Surviving in the darkness beneath Venice’s glittering façade, she knows better than to believe in magic, or trust too much to luck.Benedetto Bellini was lucky once, but not anymore. Not since the curse. Now he’s got a second problem, one that’s washed up on his island and tried to steal his silverware. He finds Faustina intriguing and infuriating in equal measure. And, thanks to the curse, he’s stuck with her.Faustina doesn’t know what to make of her shy, gentle and deeply irritating captor, or his island garden. But, at the heart of it all, there’s the glass rose. Like love, it’s beautiful, fragile and dangerous – and finding it changes everything.A reimagining of Beauty and the Beast set in 18th Century Venice, perfect for fans of fairy tale romance. The Rose and the Mask is a standalone novel that can be read on its own or alongside the other book in the series, The Murano Glass Slipper.",
