  "description": "How To Join the Winners' Circle for Prose and Poetry Awards, NEW EXPANDED EDITIONJohn Howard Reid (a well-known author with over 50 years experience in writing and publishing) is Chief Judge of three annual literary events: The Tom Howard Short Story, Essay and Prose Contest, the Tom Howard Poetry Contest, and the Margaret Reid Prize for Traditional Verse. These long-established, prestigious writing competitions each offer cash prizes totally $5,350. In \"Write Ways to WIN WRITING CONTESTS\", John Reid tells every aspiring author how to achieve success. To research this book, he entered no less than eighty writing contests himself. His entries won prizes, or were short-listed, at least 27 times. That's better than a one-in-three success rate. \"I would easily have achieved a one-in-two success rate if I had only entered the RIGHT contests,\" Reid declares. \"I entered some of them merely to prove my theories or simply to obtain Judges' Reports.\" In this book, John Howard Reid will tell YOU how to select the RIGHT contests for YOUR essays, short stories and poems.",
