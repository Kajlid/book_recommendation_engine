  "description": "Chrysanthe is a sixteen-year-old nymph living in a hidden grove in Macedonia. After her father was murdered when she was twelve, things were never the same. Her mother is distant, her peers are indifferent, and with the exception of her best friend, Galene, Chrys feels utterly alone. When strangers enter the grove who turn out to be gypsies, things start getting even weirder. Chrys falls fast for the handsome Talon, but human-nymph relations are strictly forbidden, and Chrys' mother reminds her of this when she gives Chrys an ultimatum: stay with Talon and be exiled, or fulfill her duty to the grove and become the next Chief Supreme (leader). When the Chief Supreme of the grove becomes deathly ill, Chrys must race against time to catch a killer before it's too late.",
