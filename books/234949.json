  "description": "She's fierce, but he's never met a creature he couldn't tame. Audrey's never felt bad about using her magical gifts to survive, but apparently the witch council has a problem with it. Now she's trapped in their fortress and forced to study their rules or else lose her powers entirely. Escaping would be much simpler if the reclusive falconer assigned to be her mentor wasn't so disarmingly perceptive and distractingly sexy.Corvin would rather tend to his birds and keep out of council recruiting efforts, but when his sanctuary is threatened, he reluctantly takes on a novice to train. Only, Audrey is wilder and more broken than any of the animals he cares for. It will take all of his considerable patience and empathic powers to break down her walls, but the more time they spend together, the more danger he is in of losing his heart. With a young girl to rescue, a band of evil sorcerers hunting her, and the immortal guards of the council haunting her every move, Audrey's only choice is to betray the only person who's ever really seen her. She doesn't believe in happy endings... but what if she's wrong? This story features: a rogue witch, a brooding falconer, a nosy raven sidekick, an overbearing Oracle/mother, a fallen angel with his own agenda, and an epic battle with evil sorcerers.",
