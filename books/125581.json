  "title": "Wampus Springs - Mark of the Wolf",
  "description": "At sixteen years old, Lori Foster has seen a lifetime of pain and suffering. Four years earlier, she watched as her best friends were savagely mauled to death by a rogue wolf, then barely escaped with her own life. The scar on her neck is a constant reminder of just how lucky she was that stormy day in Wampus Springs. Four years and hundreds of miles from the attack, Lori still searches every shadow for the return of her tormentor. She finds ordinary life to be a struggle, but when she meets Josh Hughes, things appear to get on track. With her best friend Jessica Tanner and her new love in her life, Lori lets her guard down, but it may be premature. When her menstruation begins, her nights are ravaged with nightmares of the attack. The nightmares seem to be more than a coincidence, they seem to hint at an inevitable confrontation between Lori and the wolf that mauled her four years earlier.",
