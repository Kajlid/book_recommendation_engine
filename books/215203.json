  "description": "Baum dedicated the book to the otherwise-unknown \"Judith of Randolph, Massachusetts\" - most likely one of the child readers who corresponded with the author. In The Sea Fairies, the famous author of the Oz books takes us on an adventure to a fairyland -- one to be found deep below the rolling waves of the ocean! this isn't generally considered an Oz book, and you'd be hard pressed to find a mention of Oz in these pages. But in later books Baum wrote characters from this and other books into his Oz titles -- which makes these Oz series books, after a fashion.",
