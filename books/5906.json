  "title": "Parental Alienation Syndrome: An Instrument for Detection in High School Students",
  "description": "The purpose of this study was to compose an instrument that can be used by teachers to refer high school students being exposed to Parental Alienation Syndrome (PAS). PAS is a syndrome that is found mostly in high conflict divorce cases where one parent programs or brainwashes the child against the other parent. This is done by bashing the other parent, convincing the child of the worthlessness of the other parent, or even by making allegations of physical or sexual abuse. These actions are done with the intent to damage, if not destroy, the parent-child bond.;Most research shows that adults of this syndrome have been the main focus. Researchers have studied the parents that participate in this phenomenon or the adults who have been alienated against. Studies have even been done to look at how adults who were children of PAS are affected in their adult lives. Other than a list of symptoms that are exhibited by children in the PAS world, there is little else known about the children of this syndrome. They are the ones being most affected; we should be identifying them so they can get the help they so desperately need.;Through this study, I created an instrument to detect high school students of PAS, which was then evaluated by the instructors at Mohave High School. Through this evaluation, it was agreed that an effective instrument had been made that could be used in the high school classroom setting for the referral of students believed to be affected by PAS. With this instrument, the children that need help can get it.",
