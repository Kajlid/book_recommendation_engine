  "title": "Life & Times Of A St Mary Cray War Baby",
  "description": "The world I knew as a child was entirely a different one from the one we know today. Back then the pace of life seemed so much slower than compared to now. It is with this in mind and mainly for my grandchildren, I have attempted to record my memories. I hope it will help to remind them that we Old Fogies were also young once. We shared the same hopes and dreams for the future as they do today. Sadly, many technical advances though they improved the quality of life also caused many old trade skills to disappear. This, in turn, caused many a way of life to also disappear. Even sadder is that the number of people able to personally recall those times grow steadily smaller.I hope the following document brings back many sweet memories perhaps mixed with some bitter ones as well. I have tried to be as accurate in my recollections as I could be. Even so, I must admit that memories at my age can be somewhat hit and miss with details blurred by the passage of time. Nevertheless, the events I am committing to paper are as accurate as I can recall. Unfortunately, in old age memories often come that way. I will confess that I have used some poetic licence to flesh out some events in order to make them more readable. Leaving this to one side all the events in this document really did occur.",
