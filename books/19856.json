  "description": "Arthur C. Clarke is one of the greatest science fiction writers of the century, and surely the most celebrated science fiction author alive. He is -- with H. G. Wells, Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein -- one of the writers who define the genre. Now, at the dawn of the year 2001, Sir Arthur C. Clarke has cooperated in the preparation of a massive definitive edition of his collected shorter works, which will be made available on audio in four chronological volumes, followed by a 30 cassette gift set, the most ambitious science fiction audio project in history. Brief introductions place each story in the context of Clarke's career. Fantastic Audio has acquired exclusive audio rights to this collection. From early stories like \"Rescue Party\" and \"The Lion of Comarre,\" to classics like \"The Star,\" \"Earthlight,\" \"The Nine Billion Names of God,\" and \"The Sentinel\" (kernel of the later novel, and movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey), all the way to later works like \"A Meeting With Medusa\" and \"The Hammer of God,\" this immense volume encapsulates one of the great SF careers of all time.",
