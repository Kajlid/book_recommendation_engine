  "description": "Two Worlds. One Legend. \"I'm looking for maps of worlds that don't exist.\"Max Douglas would rather find adventure in his books than put in any effort at school. So when a stranger named Geoff wanders into the bookstore and starts talking about other worlds, Max can't help but be interested. Following a strange accident during a science experiment gone wrong, Max finds himself tossed into a world torn straight from the pages of his wildest imagination. Accused of wizardry by local knights, forced into a voyage across stomach churning oceans and made to argue with unhelpful dragons, Max desperately seeks a weapon that can fight the true threat to this new world he finds himself in: The Sorcerer Ansgar. With the help of his genius scientist best friend Heidi, and a flame spewing princess named Katherine, Max just might pull it off.",
