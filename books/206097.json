  "title": "The Radical Element",
  "description": "In an anthology of revolution and resistance, a sisterhood of YA writers shines a light on a century and a half of heroines on the margins and in the intersections.To respect yourself, to love yourself—should not have to be a radical decision. And yet it remains as challenging for an American girl to make today as it was in 1927 on the steps of the Supreme Court. It's a decision that must be faced whether you're balancing on the tightrope of neurodivergence, finding your way as a second-generation immigrant, or facing down American racism even while loving America. And it's the only decision when you've weighed society's expectations and found them wanting. In The Radical Element, twelve of the most talented writers working in young adult literature today tell the stories of the girls of all colors and creeds standing up for themselves and their beliefs—whether that means secretly learning Hebrew in early Savannah, using the family magic to pass as white in 1920s Hollywood, or singing in a feminist punk band in 1980s Boston. And they're asking you to join them.Daughter of the book / Dahlia Adler --You're a stranger here / Mackenzi Lee --The magician / Erin Bowman --Lady Firebrand / Megan Shepherd --Step right up / Jessica Spotswood --Glamour / Anna-Marie McLemore --Better for all the world / Marieke Nijkamp --When the moonlight isn't enough / Dhonielle Clayton --The belle of the ball / Sarvenaz Tash --Land of the sweet, home of the brave / Stacey Lee --The birth of Susi Go-Go / Meg Medina --Take me with U / Sara Farizan",
