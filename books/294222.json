  "description": "Nothing says home quite like the smell of baking.  The quiet, small town of Higbee is set in the perfect place for the upcoming northern lights. People from different parts of the country are flocking in droves to see the brilliant cosmic show as the town celebrates this unusual event.  Anthony Clarence has spent his entire life not only in Higbee but in the small bakery he runs from his home. A devastating attack in his teens has kept him terrified of the outside world, Anthony locks the world away, scared to step outside his front door. Only his cakes and cookies allow him to paint the vivid world that lives on in his mind.  Jax is a movie star on the run. Attempting to distance himself from his long-time manager, and the stress of being a Hollywood star, he comes to Higbee to see the northern lights. Upon arriving, however, he finds out he’s too late to see the celestial event.  Not knowing Jax’s true identity, Anthony pulls him into a scheme to win over the heart of a man he swears he’s destined to be with. Jax needs a safe place to hide his well-known face from the world and agrees to the idea of a fake relationship.  In the process, Jax will rediscover a love for his art, and a passion for the man who reignited it in him. For Anthony, the security and comfort of Jax’s presence will force him to face the world of fantasy and dreams he’s lived in for so long, and wonder if perhaps reality could be so much better.",
