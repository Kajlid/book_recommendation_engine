With details on what will happen on a continent-by-continent basis, readers will learn about the effect on the 2012 Olympics, the opening of cosmic portals, how individual lives as well as communities will be altered in the time following this momentous year, and forecasts for the year 2032—when the new Golden Age of Atlantis is said to come into being. Practical guidance to assist people in preparing for their role in this incredible transformational shift is also included.",
