  "title": "Medicine: Perspectives in History and Art",
  "description": "The history of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and quack medicine is told by physicians, patients, nurses, writers, poets, artists, and many others through their quotes, letters, and art in order to give readers a chance to understand what medicine was like from the beginning of recorded history. The great discoveries and controversies, as well as the blunders, deceptions, and tragedies are best appreciated in the words and illustrations of those who were there at the time. Included are 585 images of the finest medical art and instruments ever published, now in museums and collections around the world -- all in full-color, coffee table size. Medicine in literature as related by Shakespeare, Mark Twain, Voltaire, Oscar Wilde, Beethoven, and many others. The vast majority of these illustrations are previously unpublished.",
