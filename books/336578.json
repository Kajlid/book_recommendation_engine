  "description": "Now a major motion picture directed by Randall ParkAdrian Tomine’s beloved New York Times Notable book was adapted into a major motion picture. With the screenplay written by the cartoonist, Shortcomings debuted at Sundance and appeared at the Tribeca Festival, both to great acclaim.Ben Tanaka has problems. In addition to being rampantly critical, sarcastic, and insensitive, his long–term relationship is awash in turmoil. His girlfriend, Miko Hayashi, suspects that Ben has a wandering eye, and more to the point, it’s wandering in the direction of white women. This accusation (and its various implications) becomes the subject of heated, spiralling debate, setting in motion a story that pits California against New York, devotion against desire, and trust against truth.",
