  "description": "Dana’s life as a busy ad executive requires quick thinking and total control. Maybe it spills over into her private life, but that doesn’t mean she’s a control freak, does it? Her friends are not above giving her a few hints. They convince her to go out with them to have some fun and relax, if she meets someone, all the better. Then she meets Lance and learns that there are other ways to lose control and not be out of control. Can she release some of hers to Lance, or will she screw up this relationship like all the others? Dana wants the relationship to work, but she will have to trust Lance to take the reins.",
