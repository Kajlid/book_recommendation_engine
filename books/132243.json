  "description": "She'll risk everything for love...but can she tame his wild heart? Good girl Rowan Thomas is smart, determined--and about to take a walk on the wild side. Her little sister, Lacy, desperately needs a liver transplant. Without one, she has less than a year to live. So Rowan drops out of college, risking her scholarship and her ticket out of her destructive past, to head for Las Vegas...where she'll do anything to get enough money for a black-market operation. And then, she meets him. Bronson Ramsey. MMA fighter, bad ass outlaw biker, and womanizer extraordinaire. Bronson has his own financial problems--every cent he makes on his brutal, high-profile fights is going to pay off a vicious cartel that's at war with the biker club he calls family. He has no time for relationships, even if he wanted one. But something in Rowan calls out to his battered soul. When Bronson \"wins\" Rowan in a card game, she responds by trying to rob him--ineffectively, since her smarts are all books and no street. Bronson discovers that she's a virgin and makes a daring proposition: she works a high-end escort scam with him and the club, and they'll split the profits. No one will touch her. But at the end, she'll reward him with her virginity. What Bronson doesn't need is a relationship, and least of all love. He's convinced it's only for the money and sex. Rowan agrees, for Lacy's sake. And once it's over, she promises herself that she'll find a way to escape Bronson and his lawless MC--but she's already starting to fall for him hard. Can she save a man from himself...one who doesn't want to be saved? This Contemporary Biker Romance Novel contains graphic sexual content and violence. It is intended for mature readers. Full-length no Cliff-hanger",
