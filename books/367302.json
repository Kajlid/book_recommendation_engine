  "description": "Among methamphetamines, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect, a teenager sadistically explores his environment and conscience in an attempt to find meaning in his world, within this universe. Displaced and dispassionate, he embraces the attrocities of murder and necrophilia while coming to terms with his own ill conceived soul. Some things should never be born.",
