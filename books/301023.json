  "title": "Moth",
  "description": "In a teenager’s world, stress, rebellion, and aimlessness are common. Secret paramilitary training is not. Robert Matteau – code-named Moth – has trained from infancy to be an elite covert operator, part commando and part spy. But now the Academy is defunct and Robert and his peers are thrust into the foreign world of regular teenagers. Old habits die hard, however, and violence and betrayal threaten to boil over in their civilian lives. Can Robert sever the bonds to his past? Or is the shadowy Academy poised to retake its children? Moth is a story about an extraordinary teenager grappling with the ordinary, about coping with the aftermath of making the wrong choices, and about not allowing the grip of an oppressive past to define the path of the future.",
