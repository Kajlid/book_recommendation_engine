Looking to start over, Tara takes her cousin's advice and decides to move to Inferno, the quiet little town she already considers home. Ready to forge a new path for herself, Tara struggles to move on with her life and find a new job that she loves as much as she did being a cop. Inferno's sheriff, Blake Turner, is trying to figure out the unexplained occurrences that keep happening in his quiet menage town. Someone is deliberately trying their hardest to hurt the ones he cares about, and Blake won't rest until he discovers who it is and stops them. Inferno's fire chief, Logan Turner, can't help the instant spark he feels the minute he first lays eyes on Tara Mcintyre when she first comes into town. Logan and Blake are cousins who were starting to give up hope of ever finding the woman they wanted to spend the rest of their lives with, until they meet Tara. Blake and Logan Turner can't wait to claim the feisty wildcat Tara, but can she let her guard down and allow them into her heart? Note: There is no sexual relationship or touching for titillation between or among cousins. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
