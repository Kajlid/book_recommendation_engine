  "description": "Walker Oldham’s death is shocking and inexplicable. But it’s far from random.  Soon after the Crescent Creek, Colorado businessman is gunned down in his office, the FBI tells local authorities that the homicide is linked to killings in Georgia, Texas and California.  As the Crescent Creek Police Department works to identify Oldham’s killer, former private investigator Kate Reed agrees to consult on the case. The hunt for the truth leads to an odd assortment of evidence, including a smoky quartz pendant, counterfeit ID cards, a distinctive brand of cigarettes, threatening phone calls, pages from a decades-old diary and Flamin’ Hot Doritos.  The Birthday Murders, Book 26 in the Sky High Pies Cozy Mystery series, includes a tasty trio of Nana Reed’s Sky High recipes!",
