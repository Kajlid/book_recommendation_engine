  "description": "Streetwise but innocent and suffused with Catholic guilt, Rebecca and Debbie are scamps whose favorite game is playing in a abandoned house—which is how their lives come to take a terrible turn. Nine-year-old Sparra is running out of places to play. It’s no fun at home, what with her Mom and Dad always snapping at each other and Auntie Mo gossiping about everyone in town. The street, however, is no better; that’s where all her mortal enemies prowl—Uffo and Lippo, mad Harold and his skinny wife, psycho-killer Stabber and old ladies going \"tut tut tut.\" So Sparra and her best mate Debbie decide to make a bombed-out house on Piggy Monk Square their own special hideaway. When a policeman with a bad case of snuffles and a big set of handcuffs disturbs their games, he warns them to keep away from the house for good. But when they don't listen to him, they find that he’s at their mercy—and they're pitched into trouble deeper than they could ever imagine.",
