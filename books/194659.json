  "description": "We've all had our experiences with him. The Bad Boy. The one we admire from a distance, but never think of approaching. The one with the hard body, and perfect stubble, who's too handsome for his own good.For me it was Nate McKinney. We met when I joined his gym. He expressed an interest in me, but I didn't believe it. What would a man like him want with a nerd like me? Nate had to do a little persuading to convince me his attraction was real. He showed me how deep and hot his passion ran for me. Sometimes he was gentle. Sometimes he was rough. And I enjoyed it all.But can I trust what he says? All signs indicate he's using me for what I can do for his company. I can't fall for a man like that. I can resist him. Right?Kevin Roberts",
