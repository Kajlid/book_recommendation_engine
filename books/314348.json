  "title": "Mindful Eating: A Guide to Rediscovering a Healthy and Joyful Relationship with Food",
  "description": "How mindfulness can restore the healthy relationship with food we were meant to have--with striking effects on disorders such as overeating, anorexia, and bulimia--an extensively revised edition of this bestseller that includes important new data. Apply mindfulness to your relationship with food and you may be surprised to find that eating becomes a source of joy--instead an angst-ridden activity haunted by nutritionally based guilt, calorie-counting, and even more serious problems like eating disorders. For nearly a decade, Jan Bays's guide to eating mindfully has been transforming people's relationship with food--and based on her continued work with those people as well as new data emerging on the topic, she has created this significantly revised and refined version of the original, which contains even more essential information on mindful eating, as well as inspiring new examples from her workshop participants. She shows how to:  - Tune into your body's own wisdom about what, when, and how much to eat- Eat less while feeling fully satisfied- Identify your habits and patterns with food- Develop a more compassionate attitude toward your struggles with eating- Discover what you're really hungry for The 75-minute audio program of exercises from the original book has also been revised and will now be available as an audio download.",
