  "description": "Being pursued by five powerful men is the last thing I expected... As former marines, they're used to facing down formidable opponents and getting the job done no matter what stands in their way. Now, they run a prestigious tech firm together and they're at the top of their game—seductively handsome, dangerously smart, and extremely wealthy. But they're determined to win more than just the bid for my new program—they've set their sights on me.  The Code is a steamy reverse harem romance series with irresistible chemistry and a romantic suspense storyline that builds in intensity throughout the series.  Publisher's Note: The new anniversary edition of The Code has been redesigned as a five book series. It includes all the content of the original six novels as well as expanded scenes and additional content that was previously available only through limited-edition anthologies. Please be aware that the individual books cannot be mixed and matched between the original edition of the series and the anniversary edition, as there are significant content and chapter layout differences.",
