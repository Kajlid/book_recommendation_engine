  "description": "I lost my heart to a man who walked away without looking back. Over the years, I dealt with the hand life dealt me, slowly shutting down my soul. My heart, carefully protected by soft blankets, has been safely packed away.Until now.For twenty years, I’ve loved MMA fighter Nicholas Cain. He may be back but neither of us are the same people we were then. We’ve been polished, punished by life’s harshest seas. My heart is torn between what was and what could be, but I can’t turn away. And despite everything, the choice to love him both thrills and terrifies me. Just like my brother predicted it would years before it actually happened.",
