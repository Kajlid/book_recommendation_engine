  "title": "Where Is She Now?",
  "description": "It takes a twisted mind to commit murder. But imagine the perversion required if the callous act of killing were planned, even staged, so it unfolded like the acts of a play. Not random, nor accidental, but calculated and all for mere personal gratification. Vicki has a calculating mind. At first, she easily justifies the random acts of violence, until she sees her plan threatened. Now she must figure out how to best handle the cunning creature who hungers for more blood and cannot seem to be sated. The truth may never surface, which will cause all of the victim's to be robbed of their vindication. Justice cannot prevail. But seeking revenge for the life of a loved one would make you a murderer as well, wouldn't it?",
