  "description": "Sparked by her long search for inspiration in her life and work, Gail McMeekin has worked closely with some of today's most highly creative women for her one-of-a-kind guide to maximizing creative energy. \"For many women,\" she writes, \"breaking free of our societal and psychological chains is a prerequisite to truly creating a life that expresses our genuineness and uniqueness.\" The dynamic women sharing their secrets for the first time include Sarah Ban Breathnach, who channeled her creativity into the book she was \"born to write\" (the best-selling Simple Abundance); interior designer Chris Madden; and software tycoon Brenda Laurel. From interviews and conversations, McMeekin distilled the common themes in these innovators' lives and work into practices any woman can use.",
