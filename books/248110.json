  "description": "Alternative Cover Edition of ASIN: B071X9X17L  SEX, GAMES & MURDER ~ Want to play? It was munch night at the most elite underground BDSM club in the Rockies. Relaxed and informal, highlighted by the weekly Matchstick Challenge game.  Detective Sergeant Hunter Dane, reigning champion, looked forward to a relaxing evening to start his 3 days off. A few beers on the deck. An interlude with a sweet sub. Stumping a challenger with a new puzzle. Home early for a decent night's sleep.   Some people are SO deadly serious about their games.  Now Hunt has a fresh body and a new puzzle to solve in twenty-four hours if he wants to find a killer.   A 48k police procedural with a liberal dose of M/M hotness. Which means our fave full-metal Dom shows up to collect on Hunter's offer of his ... coffer. So to speak. There are puzzles for the reader and mysteries to be solved. Based on characters introduced in the short story On His Knees. For adults.",
