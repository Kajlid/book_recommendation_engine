  "description": "Emily Stafford has fallen into heat and needs it bad. Real bad. After one innocent run-in with her neighbor and his sexier-than-homemade-sin voice at the mailroom in her condominium complex, she had a toe curling… you know. When her second encounter with the object of her lust is just as innocent and has the same result, Emily decides to seize the moment and have herself a hot, no strings attached affair. Jake Grayden has a plan and it doesn't include 'wham-bam-thank you-sir's. He's made up his mind that Emily is the one for him and he's willing to take as many long, cold showers as is necessary to make her realize that she wants the same thing. But when she overpowers his self-control and her heart begins to beat for him and only him, the race is on for Jake to break down Emily's emotional barriers and show her the fine art of loving… and being loved. (A novel at ~60,000 words or ~240 pages)",
