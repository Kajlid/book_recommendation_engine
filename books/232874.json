  "title": "Man's Search for Meaning: An Introduction to Logotherapy",
  "description": "Few books in recent decades have had the continuing impact of Dr Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaningâ€”the classic best seller now considered to be one of the most important contributions to psychiatry since Freud. Frankl gives a moving account of his life amid the horrors of the Nazi death camps, chronicling the harrowing experience that led to his discovery of his theory of logotherapy. A profound revelation born out of his years as a prisoner in Auschwitz & other concentration camps, logotherapy is a modern & positive approach to the mentally or spiritually disturbed personality. Stressing the freedom to transcend suffering & find a meaning to life regardless of circumstances, it's a theory which, since its conception, has exercised a tremendous influence upon the entire field of psychiatry & psychology.Here, Frankl not only describes the genesis & development of logotherapy but also explains its basic concepts, & in this revised enlarged edition, has included a new chapter, entitled \"The Case for a Tragic Optimism,\" in which he updates theoretical conclusions of the book. The result is an invaluable work by one of the world's preeminent psychiatrists.(back cover)",
