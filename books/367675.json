  "description": "Lindsey Baker knows Clay Talbot's dirty little secret-he likes to watch, he likes to share, and he likes his sex a little on the rough side. So does she. Six years ago he was quick to brush her off for being too young and inexperienced. Now she's back in small-town Grayson, Texas, determined to show Clay she's all grown up and knows exactly what she wants-him.Clay doesn't play in his own backyard. His dark cravings are better fed at Silver House, a private fetish club where his identity is protected and his privacy respected. And where the women know the score. But Lindsey Baker pushes all the right buttons and he soon finds himself torn between keeping her at the edge of his world and dragging her into it.Saddle up for a smokin'-hot turn between two cowboys who like a little twist with their ride.",
