  "description": "In near-future USA, world-weary private eye Henry Thorner is charged with tracking down data thief Tanner Griffen. In a world where all data is owned by the multinational OraCorp and leveraged by its all encompassing social network Ora, off-grid Henry is a lone voice of stalwart independence.  When Ora shows Tanner at the scene of a murder hundreds of miles away from his hiding place, no one is more surprised than Tanner himself. Private eye and thief hook up with Jeopardy, a damaged and dangerous mercenary, in a race to find out who framed Tanner and why.  Mixing detective neo-noir, science fiction and a dash of social commentary, It Looks Like You're Writing a Letter cuts an exhilarating and darkly amusing swathe through the big questions of our increasingly connected world - just how comfortable should we be with the corporations that own our digital souls?",
