  "description": "Ben Ford is good at what he does, but his days as a professional gamer are numbered. His entire pro-team is moving on, and now it's time for Ben to do the same. But when a short gig for a voice-over brings this Chicago native to California, he finds a little more than what he bargained for. A chance meeting on the beaches of Hermosa soon has Ben falling head over lust for the animal-loving, wave crushing woman. Kelly Spencer is stuck in a job she hates and with a dating life as dull as the last series of dates she's been on. Fortunately, her best friend Aubrey has her back. With her prospects looking bleaker by the day, she throws caution to the wind in both her personal and professional life. Long-distance love with a cocky gamer was never on her radar, but Ben is flirty and fun - plus their chemistry together is off the charts. When a huge career opportunity threatens to put even more miles between them, Kelly may just have to let go of the one guy who's found a way inside her heart. Ben may have let her go once, but when a last-minute offer comes in that will land him right where his heart wants to be, he takes it and vows that this time - he'll prove to Kelly that they're meant to be.",
