  "description": "The second installment in the Falling Series. Gabriel Maddox: Victoria says she has to leave. But I need her to stay. She’s asleep. In my arms. And I’m holding her, stroking her, silently hating myself for what she’s turning me into. I never expected to feel this way about someone. I never expected that there was one thing that she would never submit to, and that’s a future with me. Things are getting too complicated between us. Too many secrets, too many lies. I know she’s hiding something, but the more I push, the farther she pulls away. I don’t know how much longer this tether between us can hold. So I’ve done something that I never do. I’ve opened myself up and bared my soul. I showed her my demons in a moment of weakness, and now I have to pay the price. Because if I’m wrong about her, she could destroy me.
