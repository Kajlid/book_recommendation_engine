  "description": "Who am I? Everyone has their opinion of who I am.  The Queen thinks I'm her favorite pet. Lochlaan Mortas thinks I'm his biggest mistake. The Queenâ€™s men think I'm their brother. The Carpe Noctem thinks I'm a useful tool.   Who do I think I am? Cast aside. Unwanted. Freak. Cursed. Full of sins.  But there are some things about me that I am certain of...  I am in love with Octavia, the Queen of Drishane. And my bastard father does not know what kind of vengeance I am about to bring down on him for the pain he has caused Octavia. He has no idea exactly what he allowed to live or what I am capable of.  But I do. Because I know who I am. I am unique...I am Hybrid.",
