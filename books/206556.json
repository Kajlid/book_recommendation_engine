  "description": "The Onerian government is in a race to find a solution for the Mare-folk, metal-hearted people who have been threatening their country for decades. To do so, they've created an agency known only as the Spӧken, whose members hunt down the Mare-folk to the best of their ability. But the Mare-folk look and act like everyone else, and distinguishing them from ordinary people proves harder than anyone could have imagined. When the Spӧken task their new ambassador, Matthew Caine, with getting rid of the Mare-folk using any means necessary, he agrees to do so in exchange for his young son's freedom, whom the government has taken from him for reasons that remain undisclosed. But the further that Caine goes to aid the Spӧken and destroy the Mare-folk, the more he begins to wonder: how can he eradicate a group of people who are outwardly no different than anyone else? And more importantly: are we all different, or are we all the same?A twisting, suspenseful story inundated with dark humor and depth, Beating Heart Cadavers examines how prejudice can overtake one's better judgement, and scrutinizes the formidable idea of what it means to be human.",
