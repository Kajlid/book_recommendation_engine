Lucius Valentine is a leader amongst his men who swore to fealty to his king, but tragedies set in and his fate is sealed, until he meets the beautiful Ivy. Together, can they dare to dream of true love? Can they survive why fate has thrown their way or will their relationship end in doom? A Grave Exchange will leave you breathless, shaking from head to toe, glowing, turned on, and giddy with excitement over such a rare find. **This book was previously published under a different name.",
