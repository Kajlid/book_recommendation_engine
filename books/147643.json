  "description": "In The Complete Peanuts 1995-1996 (Vol. 23), Charlie Brown starts taking dancing classes ... and is asked to the sweetheart ball! The World Famous Attorney handles some tough cases ... Rerun wants Snoopy to come out and play ... and Linus hears coyotes howling at night. Even the most devoted Peanuts fan will be surprised when they revisit Schulz s last decade of work on the most beloved comic strip of all time. Schulz s cartooning has never been more expressive, and his sense of humor never more unencumbered by formula or tradition.\"",
