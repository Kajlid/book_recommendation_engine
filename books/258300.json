  "description": "When Care-flight delivered a roughneck to Dr. Heather Hunter's trauma unit, it turned her world upside down. Heather found herself in love with someone her mother found socially unacceptable. Someone whose job was so dangerous Heather fought falling in love to avoid a broken heart. Little did she know that her loved one was courting danger far deadlier than working on an oil rig. In the fast-moving, hard-loving, world of Texas oil tycoons and terrorists hell bent on destroying the Texas oil industry Dr. Hunter finds love in the fast lane breath taking and indescribably satisfying. Trinidad Winfield was to women what the Silver Ghost was to the one-in-a-million and beyond gorgeous. “It was like wrapping my legs around a tornado; wild and raging and satisfying. Do you know you growl when you reach a certain point? It’s very animalistic and so damn sexy. I just wanted to clamp my legs around you and suck you in.”",
