  "description": "Cade. He had her love. Her devotion. He destroyed her with it! Years I loved Faye Avery from a distance, watched my brother have something he didnâ€™t deserve. She was always too good for him. Dante had a need for control and that grew with him from childhood, infecting her to bend to his whim. When Dante abandoned her, the girl who put his future and needs before her own, I rediscovered the girl who lost herself to the heartache. She blossomed and flourished in the light of the love she deserved - until he robbed me of her. Breaking her down, dimming the essence of the woman she had become. Dante had a darkness inside him that led him down a path of depravity. He was too far gone. He functioned on corruption, humiliation, power and retribution, and all for something that never happened. What he forgets is this! I not only wear his face, I carry the darkness inside of me too, and my wrath will coat him with it so thick he will drown under the rain of my reckoning. He wants Star, a memory of a girl he used to know. He stole Faye, a woman who owns my heart and is the cadence in mine. I will find him. I will find him. I will take her from him. And then I will kill him.",
