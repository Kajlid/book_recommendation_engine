With her country in turmoil, Thyrena must learn who is behind the attempts on her life - while on the run. Not even the walls of Midnight Castle have been successful in protecting her. Robbed of her father and her best friend at a young age, and abandoned by others who feared they were next; Thyrena has learned the hard way that people are not always there for you when you need them. She’ll need to not only defeat whoever is after her, but also face her past in order to become the Queen her people need.",
