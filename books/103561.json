You will meet Julian, who misplaces his internal map of the human body; Melody, a singer who risks losing her song when she undergoes brain surgery to cure her epilepsy; and Sophie, who has just enough time to put her house in order before Alzheimer â€™s dementia steals her insight.For the patients, the struggle to understand their disordered minds and disobedient bodies takes extraordinary courage and determination. For professionals and researchers working with these patients, the ethical and emotional challenges are demanding. Trouble in Mind is a book that will be enjoyed by general readers, students, and health professionals alike.",
