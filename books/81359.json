A NEW AGE OF DARKNESS WILL BEGIN.The Church of Satan is leaderless, and the Christian church seizes this opportunity to rise up and reclaim that which was taken from them.

After the nightmare at the Temple of the Dragon, Patric Bourdon finds himself a prisoner of the very people he despises. His courage and his faith are battered as he discovers that no one can be trusted. His heart is also torn between the anguish of betrayal and the possibility of a fresh start, although a horrific secret threatens any happiness he hopes to find. In his struggle against the world and against himself, he must learn that every choice has its price, and that every sin must be punished... The forces of Heaven and Hell prepare meet on a sacred battlefield, and an unquenchable darkness spreads throughout mankind. The world will know that righteousness can be infected with corruption and ruin, and that even the strongest hearts can fail. Every knee shall bow and every tongue confess: He who wields the power of the sun is Lord.",
