  "description": "Sink your teeth into Hollywood's hottest young actorAs the intense, brooding Angel on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, David Boreanaz is a 243-year-old vampire struggling with the forces of good and evil within himself. But in real life, other than his arresting good looks and rugged sexiness, David has little in common with Angel. Unlike Angel, David is not afraid of daylight, prefers sporty duds to Angel's all-black wardrobe, and-oh, yeah-David happens to be a friendly, normal laid-back guy. Find out what life is like behind the scenes for this hunky actor-how he gets along with his Buffy co-stars, the story on his new spinoff series Angel, how he spends his free time, and much, much more!",
