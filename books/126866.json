  "description": "It’s 2011. A record hot summer. Robby just graduated high school and is working again as a lifeguard at the town pool. Popular, a star athlete, Robby’s feeling cut loose and left dangling since his mother died. Then he receives a unexpected call from his old science teacher, Dr. Thompson. Dr. T. introduces Robby to Kate. She’s also a former student, but with a clear plan for her own success. Could they possible fall for each other? Will either fall sway to Dr. T’s dire predictions of climate disaster, or his shocking request that they be prepared to save the human race? How would it feel to wake up to a devastated planet? To leave a world of privilege for one in constant competition for scarce resources? To live under the crushing grip of survivors’s guilt?",
