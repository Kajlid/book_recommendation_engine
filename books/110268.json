  "description": "“Career Compass” is an integral career management guide for mid and early-career professionals, fresh graduates, and college students. Just like a compass in the hand of an explorer, this book will help you know what your “true north”, ideal career is, and will then guide you to pursue it. With no fluffing or too many buzzwords, this book offers you a step-by-step, hands-on approach to plan, develop, and lead a fulfilling career. The starting point is to assist you -via a complete self-assessment battery- to become aware of your interests, motivators, and strengths. Once you gain this valuable awareness about yourself, you will be shown how to craft a solid career plan that best matches you. After that, the book will illustrate how to work this plan out by offering practical recipes for handling every major step in your journey. This book strives to strike a balance between the need to grasp the big picture, and the need to nail down the nitty gritty details. While it gives you a strategic mindset on how to think about your professional life and career choices, it also advises you on matters like how to negotiate your salary, how to manage your boss, and how to impress other people, and it goes further down to discuss things like the best font type for your resume and the best suit colour for your job interview.",
