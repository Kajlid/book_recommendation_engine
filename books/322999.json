  "description": "KivaMothers are always right. If I’d listened to mine, I wouldn’t be here now, limping, starved, staring at the swollen banks of a river as my only hope of escape. “Mate for safety,” she’d said. “Wolves like us don’t get to mate for love.” I’d rejected the safe match, and oh, how I’d suffered for it. Love. Such a flimsy concept. There was no love for blessed wolves like me. Only packs that saw our value and wanted to horde our Goddess-given gifts for themselves. If I come out on the other side of this river, if I survive this, this I swear: no one will ever know about my gift, ever again. That way lies only bloodshed, and my paws are red enough.LiamIntruder. Interloper. Mate. But this half-starved excuse for a wolf is hiding something, something dangerous. I won’t risk my pack and their safety for some feral she-wolf, Moon Goddess’ plans be damned. Except the doctor confirms she’s a Blackmane by blood, one of us. I have to find something to charge her with, some reason I can keep her locked up until I figure out her secret. It doesn’t help that I’m inventing excuses to see her, to talk to her. This female is clouding my mind, my judgment, and it infuriates me like nothing else. And I want her like I’ve never wanted someone in my entire life.This series features one couple per book with a guaranteed HEA.",
