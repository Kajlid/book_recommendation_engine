  "description": "18-year-old Vincent has spent his entire life being shuffled from one foster home to the next. His grades sucked. Making friends? Out of the question thanks to his nervous breakdowns and unpredictable moods. Still, Vince thought when Maggie Atkins took him in, he might've finally found a place to get his life--and his issues--in order.When Maggie dies, it all falls apart.A year ago, Vince watched a girl leap to her death off a bridge. He's starting to think she had the right idea.Through a pro-suicide forum, Vince meets others with the same debate regarding death: cancer-ridden Casper would rather off herself than slowly waste away, and there's quiet, withdrawn Adam, whose mother wouldn't notice if he fell off the face of the planet.As they gravitate toward each other, Vince searches for a reason to live while coping without Maggie, coming to terms with Casper's imminent death, and falling in love with a boy who doesn't plan on sticking around.",
