Because if it does, he’s about to learn how stubborn she can be…Of all the things Tucker expected to deal with when the rain started to pour, a litter of stranded puppies and spitfire Kady, who’s determined to seduce him, sure didn’t make the list. Yet there he is, bachelor pad overflowing with furballs and Kady in his bedroom. He’s wanted her for years, but given her family’s prestige, he needs to know that she’s serious before he makes any further moves…but will his caution cost him everything?All author and agent proceeds from the book will go to the Animal Adoption Foundation.
