  "description": "Marshall's Park is a monthly series in 10 parts. Join Finn and Aiden as they meet and fall in love.Being Marshall's Park's resident mascot, Monty the Meerkat, wasn't exactly what Finn Thomas envisioned when he arrived in LA seeking fame and fortune. Although he did get to walk the red carpet every once in a while... when there was a parade. Finn loved his job but to say he wasn't used to being accused of kidnapping, wrestled to the ground by a maniacal father and locked in a cell with a hairy biker, would be an understatement. But that’s exactly where he finds himself when he meets a little girl with a grazed knee who's looking for her daddy.Aiden Reid came from money and privilege. He'd expected his parents’ reaction to the news that he was going to be a father. Although being thrown out on the street with a check in his back pocket when he refused to sign the adoption papers, shocked even him. In Santa Monica he moves in with his eccentric aunt and life is good. Good that is, until Aiden loses sight of Kayley at the local zoo, Marshall's Park. When he spots her being led away by a man mountain, one word flashes before his eyes... kidnap! Of course, the freak says he works at the park, but Aiden calls the cops and has the lying bastard arrested. The following day, he learns that the lying bastard was telling the truth and has grounds to have him arrested for assault. How the hell is Aiden going to convince Monty the Meerkat not to press charges?",
