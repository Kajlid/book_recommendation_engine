  "description": "It's two months into the zombie apocalypse. The mystery surrounding how the dead came back is officially unsolvable, but that won't stop two crusading truthers from paying a lethal price for their answers.Eric Matthews and Mia Muxworthy, the former a conspiratorial fanatic and the latter a hard-bitten realist, seek the origin of an undead scourge that has ravaged their hometown. Eric staunchly believes it began with a secret government project while Mia fights to remain open-minded, but their radical thinking is about to collide with a harsh reality: the abysmal fringes of human nature are far more insidious than any conspiracy theory they could have imagined.Bridging the gap between \n\n Life After: The Arising\n\n and its sequel \n\n Life After: The Void\n\n, \nLife After: The Basement\n presents the devastating backstory behind one of the most explosive moments in the series while calling into question whether ignoring the danger of digging for the truth is worth unearthing the horrifying realities buried beneath the surface of society.",
