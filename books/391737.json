  "title": "Tools of Critical Thinking: Metathoughts for Psychology",
  "description": "This innovative text is designed to improve thinking skills through the application of \"Metathoughts\" (literally, thoughts about thought). Metathoughts arise from critical analysis of the way we think. These specialized tools and techniques are useful for approaching all forms of inquiry, study, and problem solving. Levy applies Metathoughts to many large issues in contemporary social and clinical defining psychological phenomena, recognizing the strengths and weaknesses in various schools of psychological thought, evaluating the usefulness of psychological theories, and improving cognitive processes to explore new avenues of insight. For each Metathought, Levy offers practical examples, illustrations, anecdotes, clinical vignettes, and contemporary social problems and issues.",
