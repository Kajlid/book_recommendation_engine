  "description": "Dear Ida, Never in a million years did I think I’d turn to an advice column for help, but I’m stuck. Moving to New York is my dream come true, but the big city is a tough place to navigate for a small-town, southern girl like me. Luckily, fate sent me my very own knight in shining armor. Only Whitaker Aldrich didn’t ride in on his white steed to save me. He picked me up on his Harley Davidson, wearing a leather jacket and sporting a cocky smirk that doesn’t bode well for my man free diet. He screams one-night stand.But there’s so much more to him than that bad boy billionaire persona. He's thoughtful and kind and his six-year-old son is his entire world. That twinkle in his brilliant green eyes makes me weak in the knees and I’m terrified that I won’t be able to protect my already bruised heart. I should probably say no when he asks me to be his nanny, right?Yeah, getting involved with Whit would be a huge mistake. I should definitely say no. Maybe... Possibly? Help! Yours truly,The Billionaire's Babysitter",
