As he crosses state borders from North to South, he is hell bent on determining his own path, until circumstances continue to fuel his situation beyond his control. With each tacking pace of the train, he will eventually venture into the bayous of Louisiana where he is beaten and left for dead, until he is discovered by someone that can alter the course of his destiny forever, but not before many battles are waged against him.

He would rather die trying to get where he wants to go, than to live with the regrets of a life unlived…",
