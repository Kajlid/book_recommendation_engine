Stuffed like a Christmas goose, this book is packed with fun facts and merry myths about Santa himself, the tradition of Christmas stockings, the Red Nosed Reindeer’s original name (Rollo!), and where St. Nicholas’s fingers are on display (Antalya, Turkey). Those seeking relief from endless holiday festivities can revel in tales of rampaging Santas, the myth of “No assembly required,” Christmas disasters, and lutefisk. Articles include Why Do They Spell It X-mas?, Christmas World Records, Best Ways to Keep Your Christmas Politically Correct, Celebrity Christmas Present Wish List, and more.",
