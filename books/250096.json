  "description": "Fairy tales depict Vasilisa as beautiful, brave, and fair. But what if terrible was a better description? Baba Yaga has been called everything from a murderous witch to an ambivalent guardian between the living and the dead. But what if she was simply an observant, skeptical elderly woman who was cast out of society for being different? A small village is filled with fear after Vasilisa reports seeing a witch in the nearby cursed woods. Neighbors turn on each other, the land turns bone dry, and bodies begin to pile up. Baba Yaga quickly becomes the primary suspect. Meanwhile, Vasilisa uses her beauty and charisma to bewitch the minds and hearts of every other villager. But is she truly a witch or is something else responsible for all of this mayhem? This clever, dark reimagining of Vasilisa the Beautiful encourages readers to look beyond the attractive surface to find the ugly evil hidden within. Vasilisa the Terrible is not intended for children. This dark, reimagined fairy tale was created with adults in mind, although itâ€™s also suitable for most young adults. Vasilisa the Terrible: A Baba Yaga Story is the first Kindle Short Read in the Midnight Myths and Fairy Tales series. This story is 11,000+ words.",
