  "title": "The Sagas of Fridthjof the Bold",
  "description": "Popular in the 19th century for its sweeping, adventurous, romantic plot and tender love story, the Saga of Fridthjof the Bold was largely neglected in the 20th century. Now, a new and fresh translation of both versions of this Old Norse saga restores it to glory. Also included is the swashbuckling Saga of Thorstein Vikingsson, the father of the hero Fridthjof; the Tale of King Vikar, telling of Fridthjof's descendants; and plenty of notes and commentary giving the saga's historical and cultural background. These tales of adventure, war, magic, and love can still thrill the heart today, as they did centuries ago.",
