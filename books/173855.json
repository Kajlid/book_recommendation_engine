  "description": "Kurt Clausen has worked as a salad girl, a porn salesman, and -- perhaps most reluctantly -- a journalist. In this terminally irreverent (Richmond News-Leader) novel, he finds himself taking on everyone from his editor and his girlfriend to the fundamentalists and vegetarians covered on his beat -- and along the way, learns some surprising (and hilarious) lessons about life, love, and the press.",
