  "description": "Some men fight tooth and nail through life, others seem blessed by the Gods. A Rhodes Scholar with an MBA from Harvard, Jarrod Stryker is of the latter variety and the darling of banking world. Whatever he deigns to touch, obediently turns to gold. But beneath the fine suit is a man with a history. The ex-CIA operative was dishonourably dismissed after falling on his sword to protect the woman he loved. The memories stay vivid, but the days of daring affairs and desert storms are long behind him. Gulfstreams and caviar are now more his style. That is until he stumbles upon a conspiracy so great, it threatens to sever the threads of international diplomacy, and plunge the world into a dark age of chaos. Jarrod Stryker will soon learn that the Gods can be fickle friends.",
