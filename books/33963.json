  "description": "Liz Patrona never expected to lose her normal life completely. She never expected that people's memories of her would vanish or that all records of her existence would disappear. She never expected to be stolen away to a city beneath the desert. And she definitely didn't expect to be told she was the God-chosen barrier between the common man and paranormal threats. Liz is a teenager perfectly happy with her mediocrity, that is, before she's taken by a peculiar group of people and forced into a role she never imagined, - and definitely doesnâ€™t want. Distinguishing illusions from reality, realizing her abilities as a pyrokinetic, and keeping otherworldly objects from the hands of normal folk are only some of the things that await her. Prepared for this by her new mentor, a rude, possibly sadistic, but oddly attracting man, Liz braces herself for what is to come. But many an unknown thing lurks here, and what she doesn't know may just kill her.",
