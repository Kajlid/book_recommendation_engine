  "description": "A dark contemporary romanceADDYI thought the suffocating loneliness of the last two year were bad, but then I was sent to Lakeridge Psychiatric Facility.On the outside it’s disguised as helpful brochures and friendly doctors who have vowed to help, but the real truth is just below the surface, lurking in the shadows, and haunting my dreams.At night he comes—taunting and abusing me. Bending me to his will, and making sure no one believes me.That is until Dylan.I can touch him and see him, but if my mind is capable of creating such horrors like my nightmares, can I trust that he's real?DYLANI’m no stranger to breaking rules and living on the edge. I guess it kind of comes with the territory of being a rockstar. But when I’m forced to attend Lakeridge, to serve my time and get sober, I’m met with the one thing I know I can’t have.Addy.I know we don’t have a chance, not unless I want to get kicked out of here, and made to finish my sentence in a proper prison. Still, something about her calls to me.There is more to the marks on her pale skin than the doctors say, and her nightmares seem to be a little too real.Digging deeper into the madness, I’m left to question, can nightmares really leave scars? Or am I becoming mad too?",
