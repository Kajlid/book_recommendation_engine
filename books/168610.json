  "title": "Brooklyn in the 1920s",
  "description": "Now home to approximately 2.5 million people, Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs that make up the City of New York. It was during the 1920s that Brooklyn experienced some monumental changes in the early motorized world of cars, trucks, buses, and trains. In this decade, Brooklyn saw the construction of the world’s largest promenade, the Coney Island Boardwalk, as well as the construction of most of the homes that still exist in Brooklyn. The 1920s also brought Brooklyn’s sewers and paved roads. Slowly but surely, farms and gardens began to vanish in the name of progress. Brooklyn became a refuge for many. It offered the opportunity for peaceful living in a growing urban society. Discover the people and places of Brooklyn in a decade of growth and prosperity, and travel back to the beginnings of a diverse community with a rich ethnic heritage. Join Eric Ierardi in this celebration of a unique American city with a fascinating past. Brooklyn in the 1920s is sure to appeal to both residents and newcomers and will serve as a valuable tool in teaching the history of Brooklyn to future generations.",
