  "description": "To save Arcadia, I must fly into the heart of the stormThere's a prophecy that the white wolf will save Arcadia from the clutches of a terrible storm.I am the white wolf, but even I'm having trouble believing the prophecy.The former Prince Radulf is meant to be dead, but he's not. His spirit has taken possession of Prince Cillian's body, and if that wasn't bad enough, whatever soul bond the Prince and I had is gone.The only way to re-forge my bond with the Prince is to win the Royal Selection, but the city of Windhelm thinks I'm a murderer, and may outright kill me as soon as I walk through their gates.It's a chance I'm going to have to take, because if I fail, then it won't just be Arcadia that falls, but so will Earth once the armies of winter come crashing through portals like avalanches.",
