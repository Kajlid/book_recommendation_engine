  "description": "Gabriel Braven sees monsters, but he does not believe it.  As Gabriel struggles to cope with the three days he has left on land, a new complication arises. His grandmother’s lover, the enigmatic archaeology professor Johnson Tims seems to know more than he should about Gabriel’s transformation into a merman.  Gabriel’s lifeline is his own lover, Casillus Nerion, prince of the ocean-dwelling, immortal Mer. Life on land is becoming more and more difficult, but their loving mental connection grows with Gabriel’s trust in what he is becoming. Gabriel is even eager to get in the water if it is to be in Casillus’ strong arms.  However, Johnson is even more eager to lead Gabriel to the ancient temple his team has discovered that may have some tragic connection with the Mer. Not even Casillus can sustain him when Gabriel is plunged into visions of the terrible past between the Mer and the humans… but what Gabriel discovers about himself is even more shocking.",
