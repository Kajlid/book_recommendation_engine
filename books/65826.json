  "description": "This story focuses in a powerful moment in time, on an aching heart and an amazing experience that leads to a great insight. A strange phone call helps this lost soul into forgiveness. Excerpt:I am afraid, not sure of what though.I find myself hiding behind a massive wooden dresser, sitting on the floor, peeking out as terror crawls inside my skin. I do not remember how I got behind this unfamiliar piece of furniture. In fact, I cannot recognize it. It looks old, with intricate carving designs, something my grandma would own. I can't see the front, but it seems to have three long heavy drawers. For sure, it is not part of my room, not since yesterday. On the other hand, it doesn't really matter where it came from. For now, it is serving a great purpose.",
