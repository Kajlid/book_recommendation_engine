Teague knows he’ll be cursed forever—who would love someone who doesn’t want sex?Chris Holt does. The bear shifter tricked Teague into binding their souls together in hopes of ending the Holt family curse. He didn’t realize how that jeopardized Teague’s chances to find true love, except… Chris is pretty sure he might be it. Him and Frankie.Younger than the two other men, Frankie’s had a difficult life as an orphaned mountain lion shifter. He knows he belongs to both Teague and Chris, and Chris knows it too. But they’ll need to work a certain type of magic to convince the asexual gargoyle that there’s more to love than sex.When the dark, fae-like creature who’s been tormenting them for months resurfaces with a new plan to subjugate them, Frankie will do anything to protect his men.Anything.Stone Heart features a male/male/male triad relationship between an oblivious asexual gargoyle, a gay himbo bear shifter, and a fierce gay mountain lion shifter.
