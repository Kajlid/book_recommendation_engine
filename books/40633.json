  "title": "The Whale Rider",
  "description": "Eight-year-old Kahu craves her great-grandfather's love and attention. But he's focused on his duties as chief of the Maori in Whangara, New Zealand—a tribe that claims descent from the legendary \"whale rider.\" In every generation since the whale rider, a male has inherited the title of chief. But now there is no male heir—there's only Kahu. She should be next in line for the title, but her great-grandfather is blinded by tradition and sees no use for a girl. Kahu will not be ignored. And in her struggle she has a unique ally: the whale rider himself, from whom she has inherited the ability to communicate with whales. Once that sacred gift is revealed, Kahu may be able to reestablish her people's ancestral connections, earn her great-grandfather's attention—and lead her tribe to a bold new future.",
