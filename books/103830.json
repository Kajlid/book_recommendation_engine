  "description": "Rediscover the modern classic than launched the career of the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Mrs. Everything and Big Summer with this beautiful anniversary edition of her “contemporary Cinderella tale told with intelligence, wit, and style” (Susan Isaacs, New York Times bestselling author).For twenty-eight years, things have been tripping along nicely for Cannie Shapiro. Sure, her mother has come charging out of the closet, and her father has long since dropped out of her world. But she loves her friends, her rat terrier, and her job as pop culture reporter for The Philadelphia Examiner. She’s finally even made a tenuous peace with her plus-size body. But when she opens up a national women’s magazine and sees the words “Loving a Larger Woman” above her ex-boyfriend’s byline, Cannie is plunged into misery…and the most amazing year of her life. From Philadelphia to Hollywood and back home again, she charts a new course for herself: mourning her losses, facing her past, and figuring out who she is and who she can become. An unforgettable novel full of charm and heart, “Good In Bed offers a sensitive telling of a life familiar to many and a humorous take on how the struggle can end in joy” (Associated Press).",
