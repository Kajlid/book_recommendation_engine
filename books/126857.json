She wants to stop the world and get off. But she doesn’t know how.  Hunky Reno Gabrini is a man determined to do everything in his power to keep his family safe and together. But his enemies won’t cooperate. Threats are made, decisions enforced, and problems mount. But when his beloved wife Trina becomes the source of those problems, he has to summon all of his will and talent, not as a fierce leader, but as a lover, to hold onto his wife.  In the ninth installment of the popular Mob Boss Series, Reno and Trina must battle gangsters, women, fate, and each other, in their quest to stay together.",
