So, she packed up and moved to the beaches of the New Jersey shore. Years ago, Carter Downs made a vow to protect and serve his community. But in all his years as an officer, he never expected he’d have a citizen start complaining about the law after driving right into his patrol car. Learning she’s new in town and intrigued by her spitfire personality, Carter offers to show Lucy around. And it isn’t long before trips to the beach with Carter begin to cloud her mind. But criminals don’t play by the rules. So, when Lucy’s trouble follows her across state lines, Carter needs to figure out how to uphold the law while protecting her from their brand of justice.",
