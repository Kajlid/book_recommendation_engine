  "description": "The lyrical, illustrated retelling of the Chinese classic Xiyouji (The Journey to the West) continues in The Monkey King Book 2: The Great Sage. Sun Wukong the Monkey King is ordered to appear before the Imperial Court of Heaven to answer for his mischief. The bureaucrats who run Paradise attempt to end Sun Wukong's disruptive antics by offering him a job, a hard proposal to pass up in these tough economic times. But the stick-swinging simian sorcerer is determined to carve out his own place in the world without reference to existing hierarchies of power.An excellent introduction to Chinese mythology for children and adults alike, The Journey West adapts the themes of power, mortality and obedience to authority inherent in the story of the Monkey King for a contemporary Western audience.",
