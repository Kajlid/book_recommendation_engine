  "description": "After marrying into the wealthy Bellmont family, pianist Nathaniel Fye is nearly ruined by his aristocratic wife's relentless ambition and instability. His only solace is his deepening friendship with his gifted protege, Lydia Tyler.  For most of his life, Whitmore Bellmont has loved the brilliant Jeselle Thorton. But theirs is a love forbidden by society's rules for class as well as skin color.  When these four lives intertwine, they're set on a collision course. The only question is whether their destination is one of liberation from prejudice and fear or destruction at the hands of love.  Bestselling author Tess Thompson weaves a rich family saga together with an epic love story set in the depression-era American South, and this first installment in a new historical series will be a can't-miss for anyone who believes in the power of love.",
