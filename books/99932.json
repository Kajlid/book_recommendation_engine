  "title": "Into Exile",
  "description": "This memoir focuses on the experiences of an Estonian child who was forced into exile with her mother and grandmother during the German and Russian invasions beginning in 1944. Their travels took them from their family home in Haapsalu to a Displaced Persons Camp in Germany, then, finally, to working class Great Britain as permanent residents. Along the way, they met many kindnesses and deprivations, sought and found forgiveness, and fashioned a life for themselves very unlike the life they once envisioned. This is a story of alienation and belonging, of a sensitive, conscientious child who is finding her way in an unfamiliar world.",
