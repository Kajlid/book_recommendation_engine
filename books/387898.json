  "description": "It was in the 1930s that Gordon and Mary West decided to explore the land of palm groves and oases, mosques and muezzins, and the anceint walled cities of an old Empire - by bus.Setting off from Tilbury with two suitcases, a large painting box, and a roll of artist's canvas, they sailed to Tangier, and there entered the world of French Morocco, a world of sheiks and harems, the ancient Berber tribes of the Atlas mountains, of French Legionnaires drinking 'earthquakes' in seedy desert bars, of beautiful old Moorish palaces and mountain mud villages.Once they had trained across the hazardous territory of Spanish Morocco, still in the throes of fighting the Spanish Civil War, they began their real journey on native buses, racketing hundreds of miles across Morocco and packed in with Arabs, soldiers, sheep, chickens and every variety of baggage. Their route took them to the great romantic cities of the desert world - Rabat, Marrakech, Meknes - and also tiny oases villages that no one had ever heard of. They met and were befriended by fire-eaters, sorcerers, slave dealers, holy men,and descendents of The Prophet.",
