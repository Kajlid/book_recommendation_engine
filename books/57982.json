During the War, Antonito hears stories round the campfire of the wonderful black bull, who becomes a symbol of freedom for them all. Could this really be Paco? But no-one has ever seen him.

In the morning, he wakes to see hoof prints on the ground beside him…A delightful story, full of nostalgia and drama in the author's own inimitable style. Illustrated by Michael Foreman.",
