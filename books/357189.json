  "description": "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right? Unfortunately this isn't the case for recently married Chloe. She believes she's just left behind the biggest mistake she's ever made in her life in Sin City-her sexy as sin husband Tristan, who although a walking Adonis, is nuttier than her Grandma Violet's fruitcake. He seriously thinks he's a flesh-and-blood vampire and says she'll turn into one as well! However, after returning home, Chloe discovers that Tristan might not have been the loony she first assumed him to be. Stranger still, while she must come to terms with the extraordinary new changes in her life, she must also fend off an irresistible husband, who is hell-bent on winning her back. But happily-ever-after isn't so easy for these two when Chloe learns that Tristan hasn't exactly played the game of love fairly. \"Reader Advisory: This book contains one scene of multiple-partner sexual interaction.\"",
