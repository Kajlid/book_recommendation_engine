  "description": "I understand that sleeping with the boss is a bad idea.To be fair, I was already sleeping with my co-worker.And yeah, we all live in the same bunkhouse on a ranch in the middle of the Central Texas Hill Country, but we’re professionals. We can handle it.Besides, I’ve made it pretty darn clear that I am in no way a relationship guy.Am I trying to hide a mountain of pain after losing the unrequited love of my life? Sure…but we don’t say that part out loud.I’m just trying to figure out who gave Joaquin and Colt permission to go off and start something on their own. I thought our boss / co-worker arrangement was pretty good, especially after that impromptu three-way.But now they’re excluding me.It almost feels like they’re trying to make me jealous. Not that I’m jealous, or whatever.Besides, I could never love someone as much as I loved Renée. There isn’t a single person in the world who could take her place....Huh.Is it possible that I need two people to show me how to love again?Age gap, hurt-comfort, MMM",
