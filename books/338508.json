  "description": "What’s a white knight to do when his princess is causing utter havoc leading in mass murder? Go to the famous Black Sorcerer of Grimslock for help, apparently.What’s a black sorcerer to do when the white knight comes to him for help? Keep him, naturally.Devan does not approve of this payment plan. Tan does.(This compilation includes a bonus short story. It is utter crack. Please do not look for any plot or serious element. You won’t find it.)What’s Devan to do for his coronation? Hide.What’s Tan to do? Get a new crown.Everything goes about as poorly as expected.Tags:Black sorcerer, white knight, evil princess, oh my!, this whole story is crack, technically an enemies to lovers, with light angst, mostly as an excuse for cuddles, sharing a bed, who hurt you is basically a marriage proposal, being adopted by a black sorcerer is like being adopted by a cat, you get no say in the matter, Tan is a walking disaster, Devan needs a hug, Tan volunteers himself as tribute, I’m not saying baby adventurers are stupid, but if you put a candle next to their ears their eyes will shine, rule one when dealing with black sorcerers, don’t piss them off, rule two is don’t touch their knight, just a little killing, Serenity has successfully pissed Devan off for the last time, magical shenanigans shall now commence!",
