  "description": "TELEPATH, SENSE OF HUMOUR, OVERACTIVE CONSCIENCE, KNOWS HER OWN MIND – AND YOURS. PREFERS QUIET LIFE TO LIFE-THREATENING. HOW’S THAT WORKING OUT THEN?It’s tricky to know what’s normal if you’re not, But Stella’s north west London upbringing is average enough, and her eccentric, protective (paranoid?) family are not given to making a fuss. Only when she finds herself smack dab in the middle of a situation, face to face with the stark reality of medical experimentation and its horrifying consequences, does she realise how sure she is of one thing. This hero stuff just isn't her. Normal, or as near as damn it is what she wants for the future, and if that means smothering her instincts, so be it. At least she'll know, should she slip off the wagon occasionally, it'll be choice not chance.Isn't it a fact though, just when you think you've got yourself back on track, events can overtake and derail you.",
