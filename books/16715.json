  "title": "A Nanny for Nate",
  "description": "A year after his husband is killed in a hit and run, the only thing keeping Parker Adams going is his work and their son, Nate. When his regular child minder moves away, he hires a live in nanny to give Nate more stability. Due to a mix up with the envelopes, it isn't the petite Melanie that turns up on his doorstep. Opening the door and finding six feet six of Jake Walsh on the stoop fills Parker with panic. Not that Jake wasn't perfect for the job; he was. A little too perfect, with his dark brown eyes and easy going nature. Which is why Parker had purposely decided to give the job to the other candidate. In the half an hour of his interview, Jake Walsh had awoken feelings in Parker that he had thought were gone forever. How was he going to cope with the man under his roof twenty-four-seven?",
