  "title": "The Easiest",
  "description": "The author’s style is flavoured with elegant (self-)irony and cynicism, blackish humour and sad joy poetry. Blanka lives on the first floor of a wooden house that can only be reached by climbing a painted ladder. She thinks this must be the reason why she never has any visitors – who would be silly enough to “climb a ladder”?She spends most of her days in France. No, not the real France…If someone said he was falling in love with her, in Blanka’s eyes this wasonly due to the “lack of anything to say at all”. Normally she has the misfortune of stumbling on common household utensils or weird people.So weird that they look real… Blanka is filled with lives of different people – lovers, best friends, neighbours… As if she was searching for herself in their thoughts. As if she would recognize herself only in their eyes.\"",
