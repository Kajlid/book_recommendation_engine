  "title": "New York City's Chinese Community",
  "description": "Beginning in the late 19th century, Chinese immigrants arrived in New York City with hopes of more opportunity for better lives. Once confined to a few streets in downtown Manhattan, the Chinese people gradually moved throughout the city. Their rich cultural traditions contribute to New York's vibrant multicultural community. New York City's Chinese Community captures the people, culture, history, businesses, events, and neighborhoods that have defined this community from the early days to more recent times. Historic photographs highlight details from the life and experiences of the Chinese population in New York, including their deep-rooted heritage and their new American ways of life.",
