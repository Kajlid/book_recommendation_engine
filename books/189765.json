But a new case that strikes too close to home endangers more than just her love life.An unexpected call from her housekeeperâ€™s son hints that a recent hit-and-run may have been more than an accident. Roberto fears the victim, a local crusader for the rights of illegal immigrants, may have been silenced.

When Lavinia Smalls, longtime companion to Bayâ€™s crippled father, is caught up in one of these robberies, Bay finds herself enmeshed in yet another mystery.

Determined to protect those she regards as family, Bay struggles against the fear that she may be endangering the very people sheâ€™s come to love in order to bring a killer to justice. Almost too late, she discovers that tempers run hot and prejudices deep when it comes to the growing immigrant population of the sultry South Carolina Lowcountry.In Kathryn Wallâ€™s eighth captivating Southern mystery, Bay Tanner will pay a terrible price to uncover the secrets of the Mercy Oak.",
