  "description": "1962 Bramwell House hardcover, F printing. William S. Baring-Gould (The Book of Werewolves). William S. Baring-Gould (1913â€“67) was a devoted Sherlockian whose work on Sherlockian chronology and biography culminated, in 1967, in the publication of THE ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES. Prior to that, however, in 1962, he published the SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET, the first major biography of Sherlock Holmes, subtitled 'A Life of the World's First Consulting Detective. The biography has been unavailable in a modern edition for many years, and it is a great pleasure, therefore, to offer to modern-day Sherlockians. - Amazon",
