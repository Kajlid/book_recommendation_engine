  "description": "A restauranteur is faced with a choice he thought he’d left behind when his dying uncle, a Milwaukee crime lord, taps him to become the next Don.Successful restauranteur Charlie “Chance” McQueen has a host of problems: haunting memories of his fiancée’s death, blackout nights from drinking, affairs with two married women, and a high school buddy who’s an Assistant District Attorney tasked with taking down the Carmelo family.The favorite nephew and last surviving relative of Don Carmelo, Chance has managed to skirt the edges of organized crime. But his “family” comes with obligations he doesn’t want. Give in to a life of crime or risk the wrath of his vengeful uncle. Not sure he can rescue himself; Chance focuses on rescuing others, including the employees of his restaurant, especially Winnie. Awkward, sweet, and soulful, 19-year-old Winnie is suspended in the inertia of waiting for life to begin and not being sure where to start. Navigating first love, parental loss, and trying to find purpose, Winnie knows he must grow up—while Chance is figuring out, he’s not quite the man he knows he needs to be.",
