  "description": "Prisoner of Passion by Lynne GrahamP for predator, P for passionate, P for prey! These words came to mind when Bella thought of Rico da Silva. The international financier was definitely a predator-hadn't he pounced when her defenses were down? Passionate? Their lovemaking had certainly been that-when Bella was inadvertantly caught up in Rico's kidnapping. And now she was Rico's prey; he was determined to seduce her once more. Bella might have been forcibly imprisoned with Rico before, but she was a free woman now-free to meet Rico on her own terms!The Last Grand Passion by Emma DarcyWhen Thady Riordan walked out of her life to pursue his career on the other side of the world, he cut off all ties -- all communication -- with Anne for seven years. Now Thady was back -- offering to share his home, his body and, Anne believed, his heart. But he was keeping something from her, something that tormented him, something that took him away for long, unexplained periods. It left her with a shattering realization -- Anne didn't know Thady after all.Safe in My Heart by Leigh MichaelsShe had seduced her boss!

She had paid for the night of madness, though; she had quit before Steven could fire her. After all, seducing the boss certainly wasn't approved employee behavior. And here she was, with no reference, no permanent job-and pregnant. Then Steven came back into her life, insisting they do \" what people of always done when there's an unexpected baby on the way.
