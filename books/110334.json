  "description": "Meet THE BEAR - a cat who carries the weight of the world on his furry shoulders, and whose wise, owl-like eyes seem to ask, Can you tell me why I am a cat, please?Like many intellectuals, The Bear would prefer a life of quiet solitude with plenty of time to gaze forlornly into space and contemplate society's ills. Unfortunately he is destined to spend his days surrounded by felines of a significantly lower IQ . . .RALPH: handsome, self-satisfied tabby, terrified of the clothes horse.SHIPLEY: mouthy hooligan and champion mouser, rendered insensible by being turned upside-down.ROSCOE: fiercely independent kitten, tormented by her doppelganger in the mirror.And then there's Tom, writing with his usual wit and charm about the unexpected adventures that go hand in hand with a life at the beck and call of four cats . . . or three cats and a sensitive poet who just happens to be a foot high and covered in fur.",
