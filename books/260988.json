  "description": "Ethan Sutcliff seems like a normal seventeen-year-old—at least that's what he's trying to portray. In a secret society run by the Supernaturals, Ethan is what witches call a Bender. Benders are Witches' Guardians, who are able to control a witches' ability, bend it, or move it away from harming humans. In Ethan's case, he is able to bend the Earth element. But at the age of fifteen, he lost all connection to it, and the reasons behind it could only mean one of two things: His Wielder is either dead, or hiding out somewhere.  Alex Burgendorf has been living in her aunt's locket for the past sixteen years with her mother—a Fire Wielder, and her father—a Water Wielder. For sixteen years, her parents vowed to protect her, and they have, as she is the last Earth wielding witch. However, time is running out. Alex must find her Bender, or the fate of the Supernaturals might be at stake",
