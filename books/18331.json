  "description": "The Story of Hunadi brings the cruelty of apartheid into a glaring light and gives tribute to the hundreds of South Africans who refused to let this atrocity dictate their lives and their beliefs. Hunadi is a tenacious and beautiful young woman who grows up in a protected and happy home. As the Grand Apartheid system is established in the 50s, Hunadi quickly learns of the hatred and ugliness that the system brings. Clinging steadfastly to her traditions, she refuses to change her beliefs and is determined to honour one of her grandmother's traditions, despite the intervention of government officials. Hunadi has a secret love affair with the son of a white farmer and refuses to marry the son of a black foreman on the farm. Her rejected suitor accuses her of witchcraft. She is arrested and suffers unspeakable acts at the hands of a white policeman. The allegation of rape is reported in a Johannesburg newspaper. The aftermath, although tragic, results in Hunadi honouring her spiritual freedom and fulfilling her promise to her heritage. Mokoka Klaas Mashishi's stirring and beautiful narration expertly captures the mood of the time, the character of a proud people, and the price that those that fought had to pay in order to truly be free. Author Mokoka Klaas Mashishi is a fulltime writer and personally experienced the violence of apartheid. Although not published he has been writing since he was a young man, but some of his work was confiscated by Robben Island prison authorities. With his publication, Mr. Mashishi honours his heritage and gives voice to those who suffered from and fought against these crimes against humanity. He lives in Soweto near Johannesburg, South Africa.",
