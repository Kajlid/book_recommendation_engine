  "description": "Jonathan and an old college friend join a group of kayakers in a trip down Idaho's Salmon River in what is supposed to be a relaxing getaway from everyday life. However, the exhilarating runs over the rapids quickly take a backseat to heated political debates in camp and on the river. Disparate personalities and political parties spark strong opinions and heightened emotions, creating tension within the small group. But when a thunderstorm turns into a violent flash flood, the group finds they must put aside their differences if they want to make it off the river alive. Packed full of action, The Middle Fork hits on current hot-button political issues, like global warming, war, and illegal immigration, providing a sharp political discussion fueled by adrenaline and suspense.",
