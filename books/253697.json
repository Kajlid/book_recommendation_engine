  "description": "Paris Hilton was born into the life of luxury, and right from the start she embraced life and everything it had to offer her. Growing up in a fancy hotel with maids, butlers and posh surroundings, Hilton wanted her own identity and she struggled to find it. Photographers began to notice the tall blonde with the piercing blue eyes who started showing up at all the best parties with her equally beautiful sister. Paris was eventually appearing in magazines everywhere. She was becoming a fashion icon. Modeling jobs soon followed, but Parisâ€™s true desire was to be an actress. She was used to getting what she wanted and movie offers began coming in. Paris discovered that you can make your own destiny with a little hard work and a whole lot of dazzle.",
