  "description": "Can love be ignited under her disguise? Lexxi Rock is a fiery pop / punk rock singer and guitarist -- and billionaire, thanks to her father's oversight. She's grown tired of Los Angeles, the limelight, the isolation, her image, and her lackluster romantic life, most recently tarnished by smoking hot country star -- and cheating bastard -- Wilkes Barracks.  When her father suddenly becomes ill, she decides to temporarily leave it all behind. Anxious about the unwanted paparazzi and media attention that would follow her right back to her home in Tucson, Arizona, Lexxi takes a drastic, unprecedented step to hide from them all.  There's only one wild card she did not count on. Lexxi has no idea that her father's neighbor, and scorching hot firefighter, Sebastian \"Bash\" Sullivan, knows exactly who she is, and plays along with her ruse to get close to her.  Bash is the one reason she's tempted to blow her cover, but can she trust him? Will her disguise work for long enough to nurse her father back to health? Can Bash save her when disaster strikes?
