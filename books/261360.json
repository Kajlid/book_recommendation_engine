RUBYJust friends.That's all we are,All we ever were.But when I finally let myself go,Let myself really feel,The only thing I want is him.Despite how opinionated, frustrating, and charming he is,We're only friends.He's my player number two.But lately, we're powering up,Trying for more,And playing this game just might destroy us for good.LINKShe deserves better,Better than the game-less douche who gets to have her. She's strong, feisty, and so damn smart. Too smart--if you ask me. And now, I'm amped up for more,Ready to play this game,With no \"game over\" in sight. ** This book can be read and understood as a standalone but does contain minor spoilers for the first two books in the series. **",
