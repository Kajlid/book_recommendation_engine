  "description": "The influence of the Kurcet can still be felt in Metrocity as a group of men find an alien artifact and turn on a group of mutants that stumble across them. More mutants become involved, as do the heroes, in an attempt to stop these new dangers to the city. A void in drug trafficking by an unknown source has attracted the interest of the Guerreros del Toro, a drug cartel interested in expanding operations in the city. The heroes cross paths with several groups of the cartel before they can hunt down the primary base of the new group. Nightmonger's entourage, desperate to add villains to their depleted ranks, kidnap Dierdre to force her to work for them. It has unintended consequences for the crime organization as the heroes chase after information leading to the flying fae mutant.
