  "description": "Thousands of students on this campus, and I keep being set up with the roommate I can’t stand.FelixOne date.That’s how long it takes for Marshall Harrows to end up on my bad side.Luckily I have no plans to see the giant teddy bear again. Except, when he shows up as my new roommate, I can’t escape him, and he’s just as irritating as I thought he’d be.He leaves cupboards ajar and puts empty milk cartons back in the fridge. His bedroom door is always open, I find his underwear on the laundry floor, and he has this whole bashful sweetheart thing going on that I just … can’t … stand.But the most completely, horribly irritating thing about him, is that he’s totally my type.And my friends won’t stop setting us up on blind dates.MarshallOne date.That’s how long it took for Felix Andrews to steal my heart.The sparky little spitfire is everything I’m not. Confident, adorable, and completely outspoken.He also wants nothing to do with me. Which is a real problem when I want to give him everything. Including my virginity.But the more I try to gain his attention, the more I see the real him. The one who doesn’t feel worthy of being treated like anything other than a one-night stand. So I decide to take matters into my own hands.A total do-over. One night. One date. Where hopefully I can steal his heart too.",
