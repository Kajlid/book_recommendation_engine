Now, in this all-new tale, we learn of the pair's first meeting - well before New Mutants #98 - as Cable and his soon-to-be X-Force race through the timestream to stop the reckless mercenary Deadpool before he destroys American history for good! Everything you knew about Cable and Deadpool's shared history was wrong...but that's okay, because everything you're about to read is way more awesome!Collecting: Deadpool vs. X-Force 1-4",
