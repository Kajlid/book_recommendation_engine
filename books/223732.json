  "title": "Eunoia",
  "description": "‘Eunoia’, which means ‘beautiful thinking’, is the shortest word in the English language to contain all five vowels. This book also contains them all, but never at the same time. Each of Eunoia’s five chapters is univocalic: that is, each chapter uses only one vowel. A triumphant feat, seven years in the making, this uncanny work of avant-garde literature is one of the most surprising and awe-inspiring books of the year.",
