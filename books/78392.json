However they soon find themselves caught in the middle of a war no one could have foreseen: The War of the Species. The origins of which are shrouded in shadow.Few people knew the penguins were intelligent and had their own society. Even fewer knew that they were vengeful. For years they were seen as amusing clowns of the Antarcticâ€”waddling, dancing, characters of cartoons. Before the days of animated film they were seen as something else; a source for lamp oil, food for sled dogs, or other uses which resulted in the death of millions of penguins. This was a time they never forgot.A leader emerged from an ancient race of penguin known as the Royal Emperors. This leader united most of the penguin clans into a defensive coalition. From this propitious beginning, the Royal Emperor leader soon dubbed himself Overlord of the newly formed Penguin Defense Alliance and as his kind grew in number, so did his power.However not all penguins are content to subjugation by the Royal Emperors and resistance begins to show itself. But what the dissidents lack is a true leader. Under the iron rule of the Overlord and while enduring the horrors of war against the humans, an unassuming leader will emerge.Can one penguin change the fate of his species and the world?",
