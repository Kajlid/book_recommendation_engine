  "description": "Best Books Award Finalist!Ten years ago, Courtney Morgan had somehow found the courage to escape a life of abuse and run. Now living a comfortable--albeit lonely--existence, she's determined to make the most of her second chance. But when a newcomer strolls into the diner where she works, a series of events lands her on a road trip from Arizona to Georgia. After she learns her travel companion has been given a terminal diagnosis and is returning home, Courtney sees this as an opportunity to pay it forward and help, like someone had once done for her. Yet, despite her good intentions, it seems fate is determined to put love and friendship in her path, forcing her to evaluate her own future and what she desires most. Offering forgiveness is hard, especially when that person needing it most is herself. And she's discovering the important things in life are about the people along her journey, not the destination.\"A deftly written story.\" ~Midwest Book Review",
