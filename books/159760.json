  "description": "Alex’s life is stagnating. At twenty-two, he has a first-class degree, but only a minimum wage job to show for it. His mother is determined he should pursue a career in Law, but Alex has never wanted that. He always wanted something else, something different, something more. He just doesn’t know exactly what. With his parents piling on the pressure to join the family firm, time is running out for Alex. Every passing day brings him closer to accepting the future they chose for him. He’s trapped and he can’t find a way out. He has no one to turn to and nowhere to run. Until he meets Jake. Jake might just be the most handsome man Alex has ever seen, but he also epitomizes the one thing Alex wants more than anything; freedom. Jake has never allowed himself to be tied down. He is a free-spirit. A traveller. An enigma. Alex is falling for him fast, but being with Jake is pulling Alex away from his family. Relationships are reaching breaking point, and no matter how much Alex tries not to rock the boat, a storm is on the horizon. Alex is going to have to make a decision. He needs to make a choice between what is expected of him and what he really wants. Growing up is never easy though, and Alex quickly discovers that, sometimes, the hardest questions to answer, are the ones you already know the answers to.This book was previously self-published several years ago, but it has been substantially re-written and re-edited since then.",
