  "description": "The social and political revolutions of the 1960s are well-documented; their effects still felt today. But it was the scientific revolutions that took place in the decade that have had the most profound and far-reaching consequences for how we live our lives in the 21st century.So many of the daily facts that we hold to be self-evident, from why the continents we live on are the way they are to our ability to communicate with someone on a different one to our own, are only possible thanks to the monumental advances made in sixties science.In 'Science that Changed the World', Tim Radford takes us on a tour of the major scientific breakthroughs from the decade of revolution. Taking us as far back as the origin of the universe, Radford's storytelling examines the impact that each development continues to have on our lives today and how, in less than a decade, the world leapt and lurched forward into the modern era.Rich in colour and full of detail, this is the account of the other 1960s revolution - of the science and scientists that irrevocably changed the world.",
