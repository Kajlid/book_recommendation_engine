Except I got all of the renown and none of the spoils.That’s what it means to be related to the dark prince.Still reeling, I throw myself into uncovering more about my dark heritage. Meanwhile, Cal and Adrian try to solve a mystery of their own. Shifters from other packs are going missing…and all the evidence points to witches.Elias says it isn’t my problem, but he’s wrong.
