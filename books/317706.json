  "description": "A Male Male Arranged Romance with a bit of heat A long, long time ago…. More specifically, like, 20 years or so ago, two loving parents had a baby boy. They named him Elijah Ferris after his grandfather. A cherished name. They loved this child more than anything, so much so that they never wanted him to be lonely.To be sure of his lifelong companionship, they met with his very pregnant godmother. She had been a lifelong friend of the family, and her child was due to be born within the month. Such a coincidence could only have been fate, they thought. So they made a pact: When their children came of age, they would be forever bound in marriage, just as their families had been forever bound in friendship.“Wouldn’t that be cute!” they surely exclaimed.“How romantic!” They mused.That month passed quickly, and the second child was born, ready to be little Elijah’s eternal companion.Of course, what they forgot to take into consideration was that the second child might also be a boy.His name is Hayden Daniel, and he is the bane of my existence.-------------------Everything has been going great for Elijah Ferris since starting college. He has a soccer scholarship, he's got good friends, and he's certain his crush is into him. But when their parents tell him that they had planned for him to marry his male best friend, suddenly their relationship starts to feel a lot less innocent.This steamy but silly male male short story from the mind of Anni Lee explores what happens when you have a love triangle, but the third point in the triangle knows the other two are gay, complete with hijinks and a very unreliable narrator.",
