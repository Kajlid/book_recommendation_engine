  "description": "Talon is the elite of his kind, one of the proud, beautiful Kuryeen. So he cannot understand how he ended up under the command of barbarian Earthbreed Liam Grey. Ace fighter pilot Liam is the sort of untamed brute that Kuryeen females pretend to have no interest in—but they always look. Talon finds Liam’s so-called boyish charm childish. Liam is brash, brazen, shameless—qualities not valued by the Kuryeen. To the warrior, pride is everything and Talon would choose death before shame. Talon is afraid of Liam and cannot say why. Friendly, cheerful Liam is no one his wingman should fear. So why does Talon’s guard go up the first moment Liam brushes near him? Talon only knows that his commander presents a threat to him beyond his ability to resist.",
