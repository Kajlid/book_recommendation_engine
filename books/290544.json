  "description": "Second chances burn hotter  The assignment should be a fashion stylist’s dream. Dane Scotland—brilliant programmer, millionaire, partner in my brother’s company—is going to a big-money meeting, and he needs to look the part.  The problem? Dane doesn’t want a makeover. He’s grumpy and reclusive, and his wardrobe consists of two pairs of old jeans. He doesn’t want me anywhere near him.  Did I mention that he’s my brother’s best friend? And that no one knows exactly what Dane and I got up to ten years ago?  The nerd I knew is gone—Dane ditched his glasses and bulked up. Now he’s six-foot-plus of hot genius, but I can be professional. I can definitely keep my hands off him. Again.  But when he looks at me like he used to, like no one else ever has, the only thing I want is to lose control.  Dane and I gave each other our first taste of heartbreak. Are we destined for another round?",
