  "description": "Angel Loveday thought he had put his life as a gay soft-porn star of the 1980’s behind him. For seventeen years he’s hidden his sexuality and sordid past from his teenage son. But when someone threatens Angel’s secret and Detective Billy Sharpe is assigned to his case, he finds himself having to once again face them both. Since his youth Billy Sharpe has had erotic on-screen images of Angel Loveday emblazoned in his mind. Now Angel is there in the flesh, needing his protection and stirring up the passionate fantasies that Billy thought he’d long ago abandoned. As the harassment continues and the danger grows, Billy and Angel become closer. What began as an instant attraction turns into an undeniable hunger that unlocks Angel’s heart. It’s a race against time as Billy tries to save the man of his dreams from a life without love and the maniacal stalker hell-bent on destroying him.",
