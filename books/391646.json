  "title": "Becoming Johnny Nova",
  "description": "'Becoming Johnny Nova' is author David Kupisiewicz's only slightly heated up account of his late adolescent years on the outskirts of L.A., navigating his taste for danger around beer, bikes, songs-and-bongs and attempted dating, with the encouragement of his mostly reprobate friends, and in the face of the stoic resistance of his archetypically disapproving parents. What lifts this book way above being merely a series of insidiously suspenseful tales of teenage rebellion told by a naturally gripping story-teller are the scrupulously recalled living portraits of those he interacted with, from Disappearing John to Reappearing Tony, from full-of-shit Frank to female-buddy Dianne, from rock 'n' roll perk Sweet Ass and Treacherous Sister to Drummer Andy, Arnie, Rocky and Jeff. If you can put this book down, you have never used a Frisbee as a pinch tray, never street-raced a Kawasaki 750, never sung in a rock 'n' roll band, never dived off a neck-breaking cliff just for the rush, and never fought for good against evil in the Battle of Chantry Flats with baseball bats and tire irons.",
