With no allies willing to help him, Marius attempts to flee Staria for the safety of the Diabolos Islands, where he can start a new life far removed from his treasonous past. But his desperate flight is interrupted by Ranger, a mercenary who has taken a contract to escort Marius to Duciel to answer for his crimes against the Crown.Misthotoi are renowned the world over for refusing to be swayed from their contracts, and Ranger is no exception. A man of his word, Ranger is terrifyingly competent and a skilled hunter … but also good-natured, kind, and generous. While nothing Marius can offer will change his mind, he treats Marius with unexpected gentleness on their journey to Duciel.Ranger joined the Misthotoi in order to find and conquer Death as part of a Thalassan coming-of-age ritual. He's no stranger to the risks of the job, but as he brings Marius to his contact in Duciel, Ranger finds himself drawn to the disgraced noble. Soon, their growing bond threatens even his commitment to his vows. And when the hunter becomes prey, the two men will have to use all their cunning to outfox their enemies and find a future where they can be safe … together.",
