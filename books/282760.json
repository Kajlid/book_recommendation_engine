  "description": "After watching her two best friends marry a blood-sucking vampire and a furry-faced werewolf, Corinne vows there will be no inter-species dating in her future. While investigating wild reports of leprechaun sightings in Manhattan, she meets a man who makes keeping that vow a tricky proposition. After all, when she'd sworn not to get horizontal with anyone non-human, she hadn't known Faerie existed. She'd certainly never been seduced by a sexy supernatural hunk like Luc. And she had no idea when it came to matters of the heart, Luc didn't believe in fighting fairâ€¦This has been expanded into a longer story in the book Not Your Ordinary Faerie Tale",
