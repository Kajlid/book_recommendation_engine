  "description": "Before man, there was magic. And where there was magic, there were dragons. The world is turning. The faeries are dying. Fortune, a humble dragon of the new, natural order, joins his fire-breathing friend Cumber on an epic quest to challenge the force that is drawing enchantment out of the world. As the tyrant Wraith attacks the ancient stronghold of Covamere, Fortune's growing band seeks to bring together the divided races of natural and charmed, for only if dragons are united can the world be made to turn true.",
