  "description": "A collection of Miss Marple short story mysteries, plus a surprise and two bonuses!First, there's a mystery man with a bullet-wound who is found in a church...then, the riddle of a dead man's buried treasure...the curious conduct of a caretaker after a fatal riding accident...the link between a corpse and a tape-measure...a girl framed for theft...and a suspect accused of stabbing his wife with a dagger. There you have six gripping cases. There's one more, a surprise. They have one thing in common - the astonishing deductive powers of Miss Marple.The titles are: 1. Sanctuary, 2. Strange Jest, 3. Tape-Measure Murder, 4. The Case of the Caretaker, 5. The Case of the Perfect Maid, 6. Miss Marple Tells a Story, 7. The Dressmaker's Doll, 8. In a Glass Darkly, and 9. Greenshaw's Folly. The two non-Marple mysteries are #7 and #8 - both are Agatha Christie standalone short stories.Librarian's note: this entry is for the collection of short stories, \"Miss Marple's Final Cases.\" Entries for the individual titles can be found elsewhere on Goodreads. The entries for each of the 20 Miss Marple short stories can be found by searching Goodreads for: \"a Miss Marple Short Story.\" And for Christie's short stories which don't feature one of her leading characters: \"an Agatha Christie Standalone Short Story.\"",
