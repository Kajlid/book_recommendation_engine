  "description": "Trey Jackson is a big, bad-ass who makes no apologies for his biker life.  Having grown up in the Hellion Motorcycle Club and then taking the gavel as president, Trey was more than capable of handling his responsibilities. Just as he was his day-job as president overseeing and leading Hellion Construction and any of his needs of the personal, physical variety.   Dallas Sheridan has no time or use for bikers.  Even though she suspects she's surrounded by them in her work as the only female plumber for HC. But she's of a mind that if she doesn't bother them, they won't bother her. Besides, she's busy enough with long workdays, keeping her younger brother out of juvie and ensuring her disabled parents are healthy and secure, in order to avoid them.   A chance meeting puts them on each other's radar.  When Dallas meets with her boss's, boss's, boss she can't get over her discrimination against men who ride. Trey had thought he'd be meeting with another man, not a beautiful girl. But as fate continually throws them together, the two find it thrilling that something wonderful is building between them. One that transcends their roles and responsibilities, their choices and prejudices, even their busy everyday lives.   Leaving Dallas and Trey with the possibility of a 'them'.   From the author of Hiding in Plain Sight, comes the first book in the Hellion MC series. It's a story about surrendering to the possibilities of love in spite of the labels we give both ourselves and others.  **Intended for mature audiences due to very extreme language and explicit sex.**",
