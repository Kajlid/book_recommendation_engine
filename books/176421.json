  "description": "The three in the huge Fortress orbiting the swelling red giant star were silent. It was finally time to go. They were there at the beginning ... well, not the Creation beginning, but they were there eons ago when events on the third planet from the star changed everything. Their memory spanned all that had happened since then. Now all of the planets and moons – even the asteroids and comets - were gone, and it was time for them to follow. But first, they remembered ... The Defenders at the Gate.Nicholas MacEwen is something of a walking paradox. He is a brilliant energy weapons designer who yearns to develop a defense against his own creations. He is an amateur military historian and a nascent pacifist. He’s a self-avowed introvert who may be the only one who can break the back of the Second Great Depression and lead the world away from mutually assured destruction. Though he cannot see the future, Nick may just be the future. The unintended consequences of Nick’s attempt at sabotaging his own invention start a chain of events that has the potential to transform civilization for the better or for the worse. Realizing that he may have opened the technological equivalent of Pandora’s Box, he takes off on a perilous cross-county journey to seek asylum with an old college friend. However, Nick’s departure does not go unnoticed, and the chase is on with almost unimaginable power hanging in the balance. His actions will cause anger, joy, hate, love, devotion, betrayal, survival, death and destruction.",
