  "description": "Marvels, myth and microchips from classic writers of science fiction, and a dazzling array of new authors. From far-flung planets to Greenham Common, from distant futures to the here and now, the stories explore the myriad possibilities of womenâ€™s lives: women under attack, women in control, women alone and women together. With stories set in societies barely recognisable, and societies only too credible, this collection comes from the frontiers and offers a glimpse of what lies beyond.",
