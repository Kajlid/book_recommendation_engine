  "description": "The FREE and the KEY are weighing their age long wars, so long that most people don't even know about a time of peace. So people got used to it, with society developing around the two systems, one associated with technology and science and the other one with mysterious rituals and some sort of \"magic\". You can see only as far as you are allowed to.Understandably there are groups of rebellion, action being taken against the ongoing war that has shed so much blood and lives, but if every peaceful attempt fails. Is it right to fight fire with flames?For Tatsuo this decision has to come in the near future, as a bearer of the Uncontrollable which signals the edge of technology, abilities that can give you all you could have ever dreamt off, but each one having its own price to pay.Your typical dystopian Cyberpunk with some big twists shining new light into these genres.",
