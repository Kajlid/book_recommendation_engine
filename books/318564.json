No pizzaz.To make matters worse, my parents are pushing me to marry someone who doesn’t even give me orgasms.Yes, it took me awhile to figure out that I needed to stand up for myself.

I was hired to work directly beneath him.Did I mention he was my ex-best friend who left me without a backward glance when I was sixteen?I never thought I would see him again.I tried quitting. Oh, God, how I tried. Even though I officially gave him up seven years ago, it was like he was already back in my heart.Plus, he fueled my desire to live for myself. Hello, bucket list. It was back in business.Only, Holden King was never crossed off my bucket list. He was still there, written in black ink, enclosed with tiny red hearts.It was clear he had completed his bucket list.Own a corporation. Check.Billionaire. Check.Lamborghini. Check.Only he added something to that list that I never would have dreamed about in a million years.Revenge against my dad. Almost check.Yeah, that was the part I didn’t see coming.",
