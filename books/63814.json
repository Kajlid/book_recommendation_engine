  "description": "In the decades since he recorded his first album, Leonard Cohen has evolved into an international cult figure--and one of the most literate, daring, and affecting poet-songwriters in the world.  Stranger Music presents a magnificent cross-section of Cohen's work--including the legendary songs \"Suzanne,\" \"Sisters of Mercy,\" \"Bird on a Wire,\" \"Famous Blue Raincoat,\" \"I'm Your Man,\" and \"The Future\"; selections from such books as Flowers for Hitler, Beautiful Losers, and Death of a Lady's Man, and eleven previously unpublished poems. This volume demonstrates definitively that Cohen is a writer of dazzling intelligence and a force that transcends genres.",
