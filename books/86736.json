  "description": "There is good reason to be optimistic about helping people with addictive disorders and their recovery. Touched by the effect of addiction in his life, Jim Clegg-founder of The institute for Addictin Study--asked Drs Kevin McCauley and Cory Reich a series of pointed questions about addiction and the nature of addicts. This interview was recorded and is represented on the Addiction CD containing the doctors explanation on what addiction is, what can be done about it, and why they advocate so strongly for the treatment of addicts as patients with a brain disease. Due to the overwhelming response to put in writing the topics covered in the interview, Drs Kevin McCauley and Cory Reich have written this book on addiction. This book invites a new understanding of addiction, one that can provide individuals and families struggling with addiction real hope-- and even peace.",
