  "description": "[Menage Erotic Cowboy Paranormal Menage a Trois Romance, M/F/M, shape-shifters] Kate Bullion’s chance to surprise her grandmother for the holidays goes awry when, instead of Gran, she comes face-to-face with twins Rance and Troy Keekoti, her childhood best friends. They’ve grown up into two very sexy men, but pain from their past still stings Kate. Rance and Troy have never forgotten Kate--the girl of their dreams, now a woman they crave to possess. Yet tribal law prevents them from coming clean with her about their true nature as shifters. They can’t resist being near her, though, no matter what the risk. Kate bakes some of Gran’s famous cookies for Rance and Troy, but what none of them know is that one of the ingredients magically lowers inhibitions in humans. In the twins, it unleashes primal urges that scorch her to the core. Will she be able to let go of old pain and choose the love of her two wolf-shifters? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
