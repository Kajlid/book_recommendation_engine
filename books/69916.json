  "description": "\"Savvy, smart, and sexy!\" Susan Andersen, New York Times bestselling author of That Thing Called Love Holly didn't expect to be a widow at thirty-two. She also didn't expect to be so big. After her husband's death, food was the one thing she could always count on. Then she meets Logan Montgomery, a personal trainer so hot that he makes her sweat in all the right (and so embarrassingly wrong!) places. Charmed by her witty wisecracks and sharp insights, he offers to help her get back in shape. Holly turns out to be a natural in the gym, slimming down into a bona fide looker with killer curvesâ€”and a new kind of hunger. Before either of them can stop it, their training sessions lead to even more steamy workouts away from the gym. But can Logan commit to a woman who doesn't fit his ideal? Now that Holly's turning other men's heads, does she even need Logan anymore? Are they a couple built to last . . . or destined to fizzle?",
