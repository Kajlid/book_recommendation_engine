  "description": "Book 2 and conclusion of TSURA Duet. It's highly recommended to read Book 1 first before HOUSE OF STONE.Tsura is shattered. The last year taught her two things. First, life is a process of losing. Second, the only way to survive it is to turn whatever’s left of her heart into stone. But survive she will. She promised her brother Luca. Her husband Mihai also made promises to her brother. To protect her, or so he says. But he’s still holding on to secrets. Tsura doesn’t want to care. But keeping her vow to stay away from him is more difficult than she thought, especially with the memory of the passion-and-grief-filled night they spent together lodged so firmly in her head.Meanwhile, Russia and Germany threaten to play out the last battles of the war with Romania as the stage. Bombs rip apart cities, revolutions split the nation, friends become enemies and old enemies become new threats. When the Communist banner is raised over Romania, neither Tsura nor Mihai is safe. If they escape with their lives, though, can they get past the pain they’ve lived through to once and for all be man and wife? Or will circumstances separate them forever?",
