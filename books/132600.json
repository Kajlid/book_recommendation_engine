  "description": "A tale of boy meets ghoul - as only the demented writers of Deadpool can tell it!It's the twilight of Wade Wilson's life as a bachelor. But in this vampire love story, the only thing that sparkles is the dialogue.Dracula has chosen a bride. She's a succubus queen of the undead, and their union will end eons of conflict and bring the monster world under his rule. Only one problem: he's hired Deadpool to find her. The stakes are high, middling and painfully low as wascally Wade goes all Indiana Jones in a bid to dig up Drac's long-buried intended. But as teleporting assassins, Greek legends and the vampire hunter Blade get in his way, it's clear not everyone's on board with this unholy matrimony. And when Deadpool finally meets the bride-to-be, even he gets cold feet. If Wade won't run this gauntlet, Dracula will throw down the gauntlet. And that means sending Werewolf by Night and the most literal Frightful Four of all time to retrieve his quarry. As an all-out Monster Mash looms, how far is Wade willing to go to stop this wedding?Collecting: Deadpool: Dracula's Gauntlet 1-7",
