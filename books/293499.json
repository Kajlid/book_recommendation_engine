The Lipins are cat people. Keep to your pack. But Taylor is too tempting to give up—plus, his dogs love her.As Taylor and Josh grow closer, tensions in the town escalate and the need for secrecy starts taking a toll. Soon they'll need to decide whether their newfound love is just a summer fling or if they've found their forever home.",
