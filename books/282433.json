  "description": "\"Sometimes life is just like paper wings. Fragile, easily torn apart, and often there are too many pieces to pick up.\"In the tradition of the best Southern fiction--from Bastard Out of Carolina to Where the Crawdads Sing--Sherry Parnell's Let the Willows Weep is a heart-wrenching portrait of hardscrabble, humble lives in rural America. A keenly-observed and unflinching look at the life of Birddog Harlin as she grows up in her dysfunctional family, this novel explores the line between destruction and redemption.",
