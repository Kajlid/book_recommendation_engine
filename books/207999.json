  "description": "This major collection contains all of Doris Lessing’s short fiction, other than the stories set in Africa, from the beginning of her career until now. Set in London, Paris, the south of France, the English countryside, these thirty-five stories reflect the themes that have always characterized Lessing’s work: the bedrock realities of marriage and other relationships between men and women; the crisis of the individual whose very psyche is threatened by a society unattuned to its own most dangerous qualities; the fate of women.The stories in this book were taken from the following previously published anthologies:Five (1953)The Habit of Loving (1957)A Man and Two Women (1963)The Temptation of Jack Orkney and Other Stories (1972)",
