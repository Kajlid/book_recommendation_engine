  "description": "Sammy Jay thinks he's a very fine gentleman and is proud of his handsome blue coat and high cap. But Sammy often does things he shouldn't do — like stealing. Nobody likes to be told he's a thief — especially Sammy Jay! Much of the time, he just struts around, trying to look important when he thinks someone is looking at him. Filled with pranks and rivalries, this delightful tale — enhanced with Harrison Cady's charming illustrations — combines humorous animal escapades with gentle lessons about wildlife and nature.One of the most prolific and best-loved writers of children's books, Thornton W. Burgess (1874–1965) created heartwarming tales of animals and their natural habitats. His stories, bestsellers year after year, have thrilled generations of youngsters.",
