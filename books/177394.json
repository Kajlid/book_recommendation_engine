  "description": "“All my life I had been known for my mind, and now the only thing I trusted was going out of control.” That was the situation that confronted me when I was initially diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Seven years of medication, rehab and therapy had got me stable and functioning again. And then … the illness came back. Following an explosive meltdown fueled by a relapse of my Bipolar Disorder, I found myself surrounded by shambles: of my home, my arranged marriage, and my life. Confused and frustrated, I saw no choice but to leave everything I knew behind and search for a better way to live. Having previously been misdiagnosed once, an error that had disastrous consequences, I was determined this time not just to control my illness, but also to truly understand and overcome it. From a village in my homeland of India to the mysterious Wudang Mountains in China, Warrior: The Bipolar Battle is the story of my three-year journey through five countries on three continents in my quest to understand my mind and my place in the universe. “To fight through life, survive, deal with unpleasant emotions and learn to live — that is the way of the warrior.” Dark and emotional, yet filled with inspiration and hope, Warrior: The Bipolar Battle is a story of triumphing over adversity against all odds and realizing that no matter how dark it gets, no matter how low you fall, there is hope. There is a way out. “I am the Warrior. Bipolar is my enemy. This is my Battle!”",
