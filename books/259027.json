  "description": "Have you ever sat and thought about how boring your life was? That was me, Chad Walker. I was sick and tired of coasting through my senior year so I decided to shake things up a bit. I invited a set of demons into my life, and without knowing it I was in buried up and to my eyeballs. I was unable to fight the temptation or the addiction and frankly, didn't want to. My body needed more and I wasn’t strong enough to fight it. I preferred feeling strung out over living day to day. I had lost all control.  Until I met Alexa. Her smile almost pulled at my heart just enough to help me through the battle of my life. Almost…  Except, she doesn’t buy the story I am selling. She had been through it all before with her father. Alexa knew my actions before I did, pushing me away just as I was reaching for her, just barely hanging on with my fingertips. She swore she would never get involved with a person addicted to the one thing she would spend her life loathing.  Can an addict like me stop for the possibility of love?  Can I stop because I am better than that? Can I stop because my life depends on it?  Better yet, do I want to?",
