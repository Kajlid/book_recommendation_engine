  "description": "A reformed killer, a dragon agent, and a lone shifter must work together to investigate four abductions…I’ve always had a close relationship with death. Six years ago, I was the Renegade, the Wolf of Eden, terrorizing the streets of a small town in Mississippi. Now, after a plea deal that saved my life, I work for the police as a consultant and unofficial cop. Obsidian Moon, the Underworlder police agency, isn't doing anything about the disappearances of four college women. It falls to my shoulders while I'm stressing over my college assignments and the new transfer who thinks testing my control is a great pasttime.Then there’s him. The mystery shifter who danced with me at a club and reminds me of home. And he seems to be more than just a random stranger who walked up to an ex-murderer and danced rather than fight. But I have bigger concerns than two sexy men on my tail as a stream of darkness hangs over Paradise Grove. The opening of a new series, A Stream of Darkness, will have you guessing at every turn and turning the pages to learn more.",
