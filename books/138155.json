  "description": "The starship Genesis is carrying the last survivors of planet Earth on a desperate flight to a new home. But as they journey, the ship is slowly disintegrating and the oxygen supply is running dangerously low--it is a race against time and space. Out on the far reaches of the Universe, the Watchers of Space have gathered: Orion, the giant golden man; Starnight, the sword of power and magic; and Cygnus, the beautiful swan. Together, they will help save the doomed ship. But no one on the Genesis will believe twelve-year-old William when he tells the others of the Watcher's plan because they no longer believe in anything--and they won't until they see William go spinning off headlong into space.",
