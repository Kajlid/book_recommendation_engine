  "title": "Greek Lives",
  "description": "Plutarch's biographies of eminent Greeks and Romans are renowned not just for their historical importance but also for their insights into the personalities they describe. In prose that is rich, elegant, and sprinkled with learned references, Plutarch explores with an extraordinary degree of insight the interplay of character and political action. He portrays virtues to be emulated and vices to be avoided, but his purpose is implicitly to warn and educate those in his own day who wielded power. Plutarch brought to biography not only a clear moral objective, but also a natural storyteller's ear for a good anecdote. Influential in their own day, the Lives were drawn on by later historians and writers, including Shakespeare. This selection of nine Lives, chosen for their range and interest, offers a new translation as well as a lucid introduction and helpful notes and indexes.Lycurgus, Solon, Themistocles, Cimon, Pericles, Nicias, Alcibiades, Agesilaus, Alexander",
