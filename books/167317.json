  "description": "To stop an all-consuming evil, they must dive headlong into all-consuming lust.\nWicked Elementals, Book 2\n\nThe Reluctant Were-Lion\nTurned into a were-lion against his will, billionaire Arlan Leonard deals almost daily with two sources of mounting his inability to control his tendency to shift at random, and his on-again, off-again relationship with sinfully sexy alpha male Jay Nandoro.\nHis Ambivalent Lover\nFriends with Arlan since they were teens, Jay can’t deny there’s something between them. But while Arlan seems certain that committing to a sex-magic ménage with a female part-Fae will stop an evil force that’s been kidnapping half-fae children, Jay isn’t so sure.\nThe Half-Fae Scientist\nAugust Peak dedicated herself to a life of science, determined to forget the havoc her Dark Fae mother, Duvessa, has wreaked in her life. But when her professor practically drags her to Zimbabwe to study lions in the wild, she is ensnared.The sizzling tension among the three is surely magic. But when the Dark Fae discover the threat, bullets fly on the African veldt. And coming together—mind, body, and soul—is their only chance for survival. Explicit m/m/f scenes, hot male/male scenes, steamy magic that generates an enchanted tower, poacher dodging, kidnappings, and outdoor sex on the hot African savanna.",
