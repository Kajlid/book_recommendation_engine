  "description": "What happens after the fairy tale ends?Last summer, Casey Snow's life changed in an instant after a chance encounter with Blake Parker, the lead guitarist of her favorite band. In weeks, she went from being an average high-school student to the paparazzi-plagued girlfriend of a rock star -- all while dodging tabloid rumors that she was responsible for the breakup of his band, Moving Neutral.Moving In Reverse follows Blake and Casey past their whirlwind summer, into the reality of their first semester of college. Everything isn't as perfect as they'd hoped: Casey struggles in her classes and tries to fit in with her sorority-obsessed roommate, while Blake wonders about the career he left behind. And while Blake and Casey adjust to college, Moving Neutral is getting closer to signing a new guitarist... and replacing Blake Parker for good.",
