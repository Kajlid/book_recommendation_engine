  "description": "The extraordinary story of a Dalit family in southern IndiaPoised to inherit a huge tract of land gifted by the nizam to his father, twenty-one-year-old Narsiah loses it to a feudal lord. This triggers his migration from Vangapalli, his ancestral village in the Karimnagar district of Telangana - the single most important event that would free his family and future generations from caste oppression. Years later, it saves his son Baliah from the fate that was his forefathers': a life of humiliation and bonded labour.A book written with the desire to make known the inhumanity of untouchability and the acquiescence and internalization of this condition by the Dalits themselves, Y.B. Satyanarayana chronicles the relentless struggle of three generations of his family in this biography of his father. A narrative that derives its strength from the simplicity with which it is told, My Father Baliah is a story of great hardship and greater resilience.",
