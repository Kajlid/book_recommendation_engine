  "description": "This is a significant update to the first edition, with typos fixed and plot-holes closed.The ZomPoc has hit New York City like the 'A' train plowing into a baby stroller. A high rise at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge in Lower Manhattan has become the center of the universe for a group of survivors who think outside the box. Everyone understands the smoke signals from inside the bowl.This short but sweet first installment packs in:Lots of Zombies (it's the Big Apple, after all). Explosions. Awesome Views. Big Guns. Big Samoan Drag Queens. Kind Bud. Hot Babes. Mormons. More Zombies. Laughs. Musicians. Thespians. Millionaires. Dogs.Anyone and anything is fair game for us to poke fun at; absolutely nothing is sacred. So sit back, do whatever works for you to free your mind and don't take this too seriously; it's mental masturbation... not the end of the weed, uh, world ;).",
