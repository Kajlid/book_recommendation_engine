  "description": "A dark force is targeting a secret enclave of shapeshifters in the desert southwest, delivering them to grisly fates. Suspected of witchery and cast out of her human society, it's up to Ellery Chee, a lone coyote shifter, to stop this dangerous magician before her world is destroyed.  But Ellery will have to team up with other outcast magic-users to get the job done. It's a tall order to find witches and fae who are willing to come out of hiding to save the shifters. It's even tougher to convince Hosteen Sikaadii, an all-too-human detective, that Ellery is working for good, not evil.  Without Hosteen's help, she won't have a chance at stopping the slaughter. And she just might be the next shifter who's slated for a bloody end.  This is the first volume in a new urban fantasy series, and contains a cliffhanger ending. Donâ€™t miss Book 2, Red Fire Glow, available now from your favorite eBook retailer.",
