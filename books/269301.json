  "description": "\"The deliciously creepy, decidedly twisted and delectably eerie tale of a cursed Phoenix & his dubious influence upon a cursed Seraph.\"------------------\nCuriosity may well have killed the cat, but it damned for eternity the phoenix and the seraph.\nBorn into one of the poorest and most notorious families in the Arkansas Ozark Mountains, Jessica Louise Bell didn't want for much aside from a full belly and enough learning to read the old family bible. That her folks kept her holed up in their remote, ramshackle cabin made her no mind. That they left the 7 year-old alone all hours of the day and sometimes into the night, made her no mind either. In fact, Jessibel right liked it that way. Whether anyone knew it or not, Jessica had all the company she needed. She had Dolly, true, but Dolly was just a toy. Dolly was nothing like Miael.Sure no one else could see M or hear him. Sure sometimes he could be malicious, but he had yet to steer her wrong or lie to her - something she couldn't say for the rest of the Bell clan. So, on one hot Ozark night, when one of Miael's games leads to murder, it's only natural that Jessica should follow Miael's council. Only natural that she should feel no guilt or remorse. Only natural that they should kill again.---------------------------------------------Miael is a supernatural horror fantasy fable about a cursed Phoenix and his dubious influence upon a cursed Seraph.",
