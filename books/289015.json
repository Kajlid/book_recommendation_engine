Hardest GoodbyeEllis.I feel him.Before I even lay eyes on him, I sense him.The air in the room seems charged, my awareness of him heightened, but he is a stranger to me.Unfamiliar, yet familiar.Unknown, yet known. And something inside me says, “Hello, I’ve been waiting for you.”Macsen.I see him. I've seen him a hundred times before and I know this will not be the last, but each time I do, I feel it.
