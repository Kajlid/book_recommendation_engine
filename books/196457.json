  "description": "Captain Worthington is injured in the battle of Trafalgar. Blinded by shrapnel, his life goes from being at the forefront of society to being almost cast off. He finds himself sitting with the wallflowers at a ball - something he doesn't take too kindly to.  Miss Amelia Basingstoke has no dowry and enough dreadful relations to ensure that even on her third season, she is unmarried and a confirmed wallflower. Her only friend is a large boisterous dog of dubious character who considers himself too good to chase dead birds.  A chance meeting between the pair frees the Captain in ways that he had never thought possible since his injury.  A stubborn Captain - an opinionated young woman - an unruly dog and Christmas is approaching - what could possibly go wrong?",
