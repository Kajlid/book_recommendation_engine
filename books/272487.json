  "description": "I was kidnapped on my honeymoon by three masked men. Blindfolded. Bound. Destination unknown.  I was told to stay silent and abide by their rules. But they didn’t realize I wasn’t a victim…not anymore.  The open sea was my backdrop for nine torturous days. During that time, glimmers of my fate were revealed by a man with the mysterious chartreuse-colored eyes. He should have scared me, but he didn’t.  He intrigued me. And I intrigued him.  He punished me when I didn’t listen, which was every single day. But beneath his cruelty, I sensed he was guarding a grave secret.  I was sold. And in a game of poker, no less.  My buyer? A Russian mobster who likes to collect pretty things. Now that I know the truth, I only have one choice.  Sink or swim.  And when one fateful night presents me the opportunity, I take it. I just never anticipated my actions would leave me shipwrecked with my kidnapper.  He needs me alive. I want him dead.  But as days turn into weeks, one thing becomes clear—I should hate him…but I don’t.  My name is Willow. His name is Saint.  Ironic, isn’t it? He bears a name that denotes nothing but holiness yet delivers nothing but hell. However, if this is hell on earth…God, save my soul.   **BAD SAINT is a DARK ROMANCE. It contains mature themes that might make some readers uncomfortable. It features: kidnapping, captivity, strong violence, mild language, and some dark and disturbing scenes. This twisted tale is not intended for the fainthearted. So, if you’re game…welcome to the madness.",
