  "description": "Prominent Sherlockians have collected all of the facts, trivia, and quotes that remind readers why Sherlock Holmes is such an important literary creationExploring the fascinating and enigmatic world of Sherlock Holmes, this miscellany examines his place in literary history, his popularity, and how he has become the iconic, timeless character who is loved by millions. Along with facts, trivia, and quotes from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary stories and the subsequent film and television adaptations, it also explores the often weird and wonderful characters who graced Conan Doyle's pages, and explains the terms used in the original stories that might cause unnecessary—albeit amusing—confusion to the modern reader. For example, \"knocked up\" had a considerably different meaning in the 19th century, and if you think a \"life preserver\" is a flotation device, how does Wilson Kemp fit one into the sleeve of his jacket? And, would you try to warm your hands with a Gasogene? All of these mysteries and more are included in this lighthearted and highly informative miscellany, offering something to both the dedicated Sherlockian and those new to the world of 221b Baker Street.",
