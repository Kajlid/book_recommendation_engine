Fun-loving Gemmie couldn't be more different from the reserved Catriona. And Alix finds that her Scottish patients and their lives are very different from what she is used to in England. She is often moved by their bravery and pride in the face of life and death situations. After an emergency home birth, Alix gets close to registrar Robert Ross. But she wonders if their feelings for each other are genuine. And what of the nurses' mysterious landlord, Dr Charles Linsey? Why does his attitude towards Alix suddenly change? Could the beautiful Josephine Astley be the cause? A heart-warming romance set in early 1970s Edinburgh, with all of the trademark sensitivity and realism of a medical story by Lucilla Andrews.
