  "title": "My Soul Is a Witness: The Message of the Spirituals in Word And Song",
  "description": "For many years, singer/writer Marsha Hansen has helped concert audiences hear and see the rich legacy of the African-American sacred music known as spirituals. Collaborating with her brother-in-law, world renowned guitarist Keith Richards, and joined by veteran musicians, Babi Floyd, Blondie Chaplin, George Receli, and other stellar performers, Marsha and her daughter Jordan interpret hauntingly familiar songs in unexpected ways. Each artist on the CD lends a distinctive note, resulting in a chorus that truly reflects the history, the people, and the circumstances from which these powerful songs arose. My Soul Is a Witness explores the deep messages of faith sung about in African-American sacred folk music. Each chapter of the book explores both song texts and related biblical texts, leading to opportunities for personal and devotional reflection. Presented in a beautiful gift book format, the book includes the 14-song live recording of vocalist Marsha Hansen, accompanied by Keith Richards, Babi Floyd, Blondie Chaplin, George Receli, and others.",
