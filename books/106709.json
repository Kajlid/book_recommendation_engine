  "description": "“You are here. Good. You have work to do,” said the Cheshire Cat.Thus begins the adventures of siblings Isabelle and DJ in The Storyworlds. Having unwittingly released a dangerous creature known as an imp, the kids chase after it into Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland to prevent it from erasing the book from existence. As they stay one step ahead of Alice on her journey through Wonderland, Isabelle and DJ must fix the damage the imp is doing and ultimately capture it to ensure that the story unfolds as Lewis Carroll wrote it. Along the way, they encounter wonderful characters from a classic story, fill some holes in the original tales (Why is there a giant puppy in chapter four of Alice?), and, of course, have some fun.",
