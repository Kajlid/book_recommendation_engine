  "description": "There are volumes on the story of Saint Joan of Arc (even by famous Protestant authors), but can you imagine a better version than the documentation by one of the greatest Catholic authors of this century, Hilaire Belloc. In his characteristic style, Belloc carefully tells the complete story in the most compelling manner. A great story, a great saint, a great author. You won't be able to set it down, a Catholic treasure. Gold embossed cloth.",
