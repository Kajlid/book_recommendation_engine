Now, Nick has a serious problem—he has agreed to a high-stakes cruise with this important client and must find a willing “wife” to join him.Laney Parks is either in the wrong place at the wrong time, or the right place at the right time—She isn’t sure which. She isn’t even entirely sure how she got roped into posing as her hunky boss’s wife. She finds “sticking to the script” SERIOUSLY unnerving, especially when it involves cuddling up and kissing in public—and sharing the close confines of a cabin, and its single bed, with him.Rating: Adult situations and language.",
