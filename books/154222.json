  "description": "Fan-favorite author Neil \"Sandman\" Gaiman took on the science of lycanthropy with his Only the End of the World Again, a serialized story that was later collected by Oni Press. In it, we meet Lawrence Talbot, an adjuster who has set up shop in Innsmouth, a dark, mysterious town with a rich history of magic and evil. When the local overweight gentleman exclaims that the world is ending and that the instrument of destruction is a werewolf, Talbot is thrown into a turbulent and spooky adventure. What's made even more exciting (for readers, not for Talbot), is that our protagonist may turn out to be the werewolf himself. Filled with Gaiman's trademark genius, the story, as short as it may be, is a monster tale for the ages.",
