  "description": "Catharine Chase's entire life is built on a secret. In 1972, at the tender age of sixteen, she got pregnant. An embarrassment to her parents, Catharine was exiled to a maternity home to carry out her pregnancy far away from the watchful eyes of their tight-knit community. What they didn't tell her is that she wouldn't be allowed to keep her baby. With her daughter's screams still echoing in her ears, the medical staff told Catharine she'd move on with her life and have more children, they promised she'd forget. But they were wrong. Catharine never forgot Emily. And when she and her husband, Paul, learn that they can't have children, she risks her job, her marriage, and her family's reputation in a desperate attempt to find the daughter she never wanted to give away and reclaim her only chance to be a mother.**Available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook**",
