  "description": "Raised in the quiet suburbs of middle America, the unknowing hero of this story is a small dog named Mox. The family that owns him seems different now that he’s not a puppy anymore and Mox is slowly coming to the realization that the world around him is changing quickly. Mox is unhappy in his suburban pen but Daeden, a street-wise stray dog, is there to help. Daeden breaks Mox out of his fenced-in yard and shows him that the world outside the fence can be unimaginably wonderful...and tragically terrifying! Once freed of his confines Mox begins having horrific visions of a world in destruction; forests of fire, crumbling mountains and sunken cities, all under the ominous stare of a RED MOON. What do the visions mean? Why do they send Mox into an uncontrollable frenzy? Even Daeden’s vast knowledge doesn’t have an answer. But there is someone who does have an answer... Krigg. He’s a scarred brute of a raven, black as coal and as big as Mox if not bigger. The hideous bird recites a prophecy that tells the end of Man’s World comes with the visions of a Red Moon...With that Mox and Daeden’s journey begins. And along that journey they will cross dangerous enemies, make powerful allies and come face to face with some of the most fantastic ancient sages of the animal world!",
