  "description": "A searing debut novel that follows three generations—fractured by murder, seeking redemption—in fictional Pitchlynn, Mississippi.An Iraq war veteran turned small town homemaker, Colleen works hard to keep her deployment behind her—until pregnancy brings her buried trauma to the surface. She hides her mounting anxiety from her husband, Derby, who is in turn preoccupied with the media frenzy surrounding the long-overdue retrial of his father, Hare Hobbs, for a civil rights–era murder.As Colleen and Derby prepare for the arrival of their twins, they must confront what it will mean to parent children in Pitchlynn, a town whose upscale marketing rebrand will reframe its antebellum estates … and erase any legacy of violence. And as the trial draws near, questions of Hare’s guilt only magnify these tensions of class and race, tied always to the land and who can call it their own.Twisting together individual and collective history, Some Go Home is a richly textured, explosive depiction of both the American South and our larger cultural legacy.",
