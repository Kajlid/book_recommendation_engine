  "description": "All of us have dreams about what we'd like to do, who we'd like to be and where we'd like to go in life. But most of us are never able to make these dreams a reality. Now, in this highly motivating new book, Fiona Harrold uses her experience as a life coach to show us that we can turn our own lives around. With encouragement, humour and an emphasis on the practical, Fiona sets out the 10 steps to taking control of our lives. First we must set our goals, however crazy they may seem; then we must start on the path to achieving them. Along the way, Fiona uses case studies, affirmations and motivational techniques to keep us going, coaching her readers in the same way that she would her personal clients. Helping you in all areas - personal and professional - this book will be your most valuable guide to being the most that you can be.",
