  "description": "“...a throwback to the golden era of mysteries…” – J.M. LeDuc for Suspense Magazine A lot can happen in three days. Friends can become enemies, enemies can become friends, and the truth, if you can find it, can get bloody. When a mistake in a run-of-the-mill reconnaissance mission is ruthlessly exploited as a pretext for war, the Grangers must scramble to expose the plan before casualties start mounting. To make matters worse, someone is using a powerful computer algorithm against the international intelligence community, raiding files and manipulating reports. Ron, Valerie, and Leecy go undercover to try to identify the real mastermind before the CIA and Interpol arrest the wrong person, leaving the world’s data vulnerable. But can they do it before they are exposed as agents? When you can’t trust anyone else, trust your family. Bloody Truth is the second installment in the Granger Spy Novel series by John J. Davis.
