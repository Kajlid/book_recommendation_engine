  "description": "At last, DC presents the adventures of Kamandi, the last boy on Earth, in the popular Jack Kirby Omnibus format! Kamandi-one of the few survivors of a Great Disaster that has destroyed civilization--must search for a safe haven in a world populated by bizarre mutated animals and other strange wonders! Considered one of Jack Kirby's most creative works, Kamandi features a band of anthropomorphic supporting characters who accompany Kamandi as he searches for answers and adventure across the wastelands of Earth. From one of comics' legendary creators, Jack Kirby's Kamandi faces danger from a giant, monstrous crab creature and an intelligent killer whale, and is hunted by the Sacker Company as a valuable intelligent human. In what is considered the series' greatest tale, Kamandi is forced to compete with the leader of a gorilla clan for the ultimate prize: Superman's costume!Collecting: Jack Kirby's Kamandi, The Last Boy On Earth 1-40",
