  "description": "A historical western cowboy romance novel about a mail order bride.   ** Sweet clean romance novel **  Rebecca Walker has been plunged from the pinnacle of high society into a life of poverty and shame. Her reputation in Savannah, Georgia has been irreversibly tarnished. Forced into menial labor, she dreams of escaping the cruel fate that has befallen her. Rebecca never dreamed she’d answer a mail-order-bride advertisement, but it seems like her best option for creating a better life for herself.  Jake Henderson owns the saloon in Dawson, Montana. Running the Watering Hole has been his life’s work, but it doesn’t keep him from being lonely. With no serious prospects for marriage available, Jake resorts to putting out an ad for a bride. Surely there has to be someone out there for him.  Dawson isn’t what Rebecca had bargained for when she answered Jake’s ad. Neither is Jake or the Watering Hole. The handsome bar owner captivates her from the beginning, but Rebecca has a lot to learn about the way of life in Dawson. Jake isn’t sure that Rebecca is going to be able to adjust to the rowdy atmosphere of the Watering Hole, but her beauty and her gifted musical ability casts a spell on him. As Christmas nears, they’ll have to learn to compromise and listen to each other or be trapped in a loveless marriage. In the season of joy and good will, can they find it their hearts to let go of their pride and reach out to one another again?",
