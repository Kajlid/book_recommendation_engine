  "description": "Three teenage boys drive into the swamp. They’re hoping to find Bloodshine, a mysterious concoction rumored to have extraordinary powers of intoxication. Success will bring them legendary status among their peers and the all-important respect of an older brother. Failure is not an option. They must do what it takes to find this strange brew. Who, or what, will they have to cross to get their hands on Bloodshine? Chase, Wes, and Brax are prep school boys out of their element. Driving a borrowed BMW along the secluded back roads of Virginia, they are men on a mission. They’re looking for a mythical elixir with an unusual reputation. Bizarre events lead them deeper into the swamp and farther from home. Even if they locate the source of the fabled Bloodshine, they must figure how to get it from the folks who make it. But something is frightening about the family living in the murky black woods. A crazy, dangerous group of swamp people, it’s said they enjoy tormenting outsiders before selling their product. Going through them seems to be the only way to get Bloodshine. Do they have what it takes to get out alive?",
