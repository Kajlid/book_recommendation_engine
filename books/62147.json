  "title": "Another Day in Paradise",
  "description": "A young officer is forced to deal with love, loss, and his own understanding of duty while fighting a savage enemy in the wilds of Afghanistan. Although fictional, this story is an honest, gritty, and often humorous portrayal of the realities of combat, and the toll it takes on those who fight. From the frustrations of a desk job to the responsibilities of a commander thrust into the thick of the action, Captain Chris Braddock is a man who must overcome his own personal demons to successfully lead his men into battle, and safely home. Written entirely in Afghanistan while the author served on his own combat tour, this story offers a unique and realistic look at our nation's longest war.",
