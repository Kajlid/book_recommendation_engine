  "description": "The origins of horror...In the lonely darkness of your bed, have you ever started up trembling, sweating - knowing you have been wakened by something, unable to discover what?This is outside horror - terror you can dispel with a light.But in the long reaches of the night, have you ever cringed in a knot, curdled with terror at something remembered, something you nearly did, or wanted to do?You are getting a little closer.For horror comes from somewhere.
