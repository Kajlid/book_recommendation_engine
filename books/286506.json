  "description": "I never should have gone commando in that dress. I'm almost positive the rest of it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't been dangling off a hotel balcony with my lady parts in the breeze. And of course the one person to witness my mortification had to be HIM. Camden Cox.Sure, today he's gorgeous and wealthy, and fine, I can admit he has a great sense of humor. But once upon a time, he was the boy who loved to make my life miserable. He no longer pulls my pigtails, but I know his type. He wants one thing, and one thing only. A chance to get in my pants.Nope. Not happening. Not even with that sexy southern drawl. But I'm Sophie Abbott, and if there's one thing I'm good at, it's making a mess.Only this isn't just a mess. It's a disaster. A Sophie disaster.Because after a wild night in Vegas, I wake up naked in his hotel room.And I'm pretty sure we got married.",
