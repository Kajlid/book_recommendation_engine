  "description": "Curvy redhead Ariana Jacobson doesn't know what to make of Grayson James, the sexy yet mysterious man who can't seem take his eyes off her. He's everything a girl could want--tall, handsome, rich, and built like a Greek god.  Only problem is, Ariana hates rich people almost as much as she hates cocky alpha males. Much to her demise, that's not enough to stop their mutual physical attraction, but Ariana knows he's hiding something.  She's put in a compromising position when she takes a job as a nude model for a still life drawing class at a ritzy, nearby college. She soon finds out that this particular class studies the erotic arts, and her posing partner is no other than Grayson himself. Will he be able to control his dark secret around her? Will she be able to hide her growing attraction for him?  BEAR NAKED is a standalone, 22k word novella, featuring a curvy heroine, a sexy shifter, no cliffhangers, and a HEA ending.",
