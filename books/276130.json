  "title": "The Groaning of Creation: God, Evolution, and the Problem of Evil",
  "description": "Pain, suffering, and extinction are intrinsic to the evolutionary process. In this book Christopher Southgate shows how the world that is \"very good\" is also \"groaning in travail\" and subjected by God to that travail. Southgate then evaluates several attempts at evolutionary theodicy and argues for his own approach--an approach that takes full account of God's self-emptying and human beings' special responsibilities as created co-creators.",
