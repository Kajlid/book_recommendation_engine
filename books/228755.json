  "description": "How can he act so calm and collected after he just stole my first kiss? Riley Summers doesn’t quite fit in the Fairfield High crowd. She listens to Led Zepplin and watches Star Wars—not your usual teenage girl favorites. She has been fine with living in the fringes of her high school scene until Aiden Callaway, Fairfield’s infamous rebel hunk, “kidnaps” her one afternoon. He eventually lets her go, but their time together is far from over. Join Riley and Aiden on their senior year journey—a year of Star Wars movie marathons, a crashed wedding, a paint war, and something a keen, growing attraction. This might be your next favorite rebel-boy-and-nerd-girl romance. Grab your copy now!",
