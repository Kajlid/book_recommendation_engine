  "title": "How to talk to your adolescent daughter so she will listen",
  "description": "As the mother of two (2) teenage daughters myself,I know how challenging yet crucial this stage of parenting can be.From the outside, it may seem like all the drama and mood swings. But as any parent of a teen knows, this is a time of immense growth, change, and discovery for our girls.More than ever, they need our guidance, support, and unconditional love to help them bloom into the strong, confident women they're becoming.But I know it's not always easy to understand their changing world from our perspective. That's why I wanted to share the lessons I've learned raising my daughters into their teens.In this book, I open up about navigating the emotional ups and downs, puberty changes, and independence strugglesâ€”all with empathy and compassion.My hope is to offer parents a window into the teenage psyche and relationships through stories from my own journey.Most of all, I want to remind you that our girls still need us, even if they don't show it the same way anymore.By listening without judgment, validating their feelings, and showering them with love, we can build the unbreakable bonds that will sustain them through every challenge ahead.It's not always easy at the moment, but looking back, I see how far our relationship has come by cherishing quality time beyond screens and disagreeing respectfully.My prayer is that by sharing the joy and struggles openly yet caringly, other parents and daughters will feel less alone in this profound period of life.Our words and actions now have the power to influence who our girls become long after their teen years pass.I hope this book can help you, as it's helped me, to impact that journey in the most positive of ways.",
