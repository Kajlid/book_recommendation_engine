  "description": "After leaving the Mainland for Hong Kong in 1952, Eileen Chang was commissioned by the United States Information Service to write two books, one of which was her magnificent novel Naked Earth. Far from being a simplistic exercise in anti-Communist propaganda (two previous novels Chang wrote were pro-Communist), Naked Earth is a powerfully moving, Balzacian tale that follows two young student cadres, Liu Ch’uen and Su Nan, who fall in love during a time when, as Chang writes, “the whole country lay stretched out like an open palm, ready to close around any one person at any minute.” Mao’s land reform movement is in full force when Liu and Su Nan arrive at a farm to help the peasants take over the fields. The work is hard, the nights  long, and spies abound. Liu is eventually imprisoned by his enemies and sent to fight on the Korean front. But both Liu and Su Nan harbor festering secrets that are pulling them apart. A romance, a thrilling drama, a tragedy, Naked Earth is a stunning work of twentieth-century fiction by one of China’s most revered modern novelists.",
