  "title": "The Iron Heel",
  "description": "The Iron Heel has been hailed by some critics as the greatest of all dystopian novels. Published in 1908, the novel is a prophetic warning of the dangers of capitalist excess. The Oligarchy, a monopoly trust, has gained control and is in the process of squeezing out and shutting down small to midsize businesses and making farmers subservient to their wishes. They are opposed by the Brotherhood of Man, a group that embraces London's idea of a socialist collective. London employs the ruse of having his manuscript not only written by someone else, Ernest Everhard, but discovered by a third party, Anthony Meredith, who offers commentary throughout. London finds time to praise Oscar Wilde, who was still regarded by most of the public as a demonic corruptor of youth, while providing a prophetic vision of the rise of fascism.",
