Through the years, I've celebrated my brothers finding their women and starting families, but for me, it's just my son and I. I don't ever want to risk him and I loving someone who might leave us again.But the most important woman in my son's life is his school counselor. An intelligent, shy beauty named Clara Rogers, who has my son's heart . . . and my attention more than I want to admit.With my President missing, his ol' lady needing the club more than ever, the last thing I need is extra drama on my plate. Too bad I don't have a choice when I happen to drive past Clara's one night to find her in the dirt, in tears, her face bloody and bruised.Bringing her under my protection is without question, but getting her to open up about who hurt her is like pulling teeth with rubber pliers - it's damn near impossible. Until the very man shows up looking for her, and he's a damn cop to boot.Now, he wants Clara back, but there's no way I'm giving her up, and I don't care what force we have to go up against. No one is gonna hurt this woman again, not now that she's mine, and her ex-husband better realize - Irishmen aren't scared of the cops, no matter how crooked they are.",
