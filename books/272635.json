  "description": "Lennox Caldwell is a talented fighter with a bad reputation and a habit of drowning his emotions in the bottle. When a few past one too many lands him yet another DUI, his trainer and Rock Hard Gym’s owner, Mad Max Malone insists on mandatory AA meetings or he’s out. With his career on the line he reluctantly enters rehab, where his new babysitter has him questioning everything about who he is.  Tanner West isn’t happy with his new sponsee match. Lennox is an arrogant asshole with apparent memory issues, and no matter how hot he is, Tanner knows better than to get involved with someone new to the program. Been there, done that. And while Lennox might not remember their meeting the night before, Tanner can’t get it out of his head.  Can their growing attraction survive Tanner’s past and Lennox’s faulty memory?",
