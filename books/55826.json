  "description": "Joshua Bannon has harbored a secret crush on renowned physicist Patrick Riley ever since high school. Now fresh out of college, Joshua has landed a job at the Eloi Institute, assisting Patrick in his work producing time fluctuations in the massive particle accelerator they've affectionately dubbed \"Saturn.\" As they work, a strong bond develops between the two men-a bond that takes on romantic overtones even though Patrick is concerned by their twenty-five-year age difference. The project and their relationship make slow progress until a startling discovery about Patrick convinces Joshua to take a leap of faith to prove the technology-and their relationship-can work. A story from the Dreamspinner Press 2012 Daily Dose package \"Time Is Eternity.\"",
