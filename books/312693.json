  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Ana Santos has ambitions to make it big in music. When she signs a contract with the owner of a music cafe, she has no idea there are sexual strings attached. This book looks at the darker side of the music industry, including sexual harassment, lyrics that degrade and demean women, and social media trolling as backlash for speaking up. Ana is a strong, realistic main character who overcomes her feelings of shame to find a voice for herself and her music. The #MeToo movement has revealed the prevalence of sexual assault in society, and an issue that also affects the lives of teen girls.",
