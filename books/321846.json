  "description": "What have I done?Everything was going so well. I have a job that I adore and I just earned my degree in library science.I also have the best friends a girl could want, who weren't about to let my graduation pass without a celebration.It's not their fault. They couldn't have guessed how it would turn out. If I can help it, they'll never know all those drinks lead to Marty's satisfied face smiling down at me in his bed the next morning.My concern when we decided to share this apartment with the guys was that we'd be dealing with a steady stream of women running through Marty's bedroom, not that I'd be one of them.The idea is laughable. Yes, he's good looking. Tall and muscular with golden brown skin from working out in the sun every day. It isn't hard to understand why women fall at his feet when they see him. But I know him.This is the same guy who never misses a chance to take his shirt off to flex around women and once asked his Alexa to call him Daddy.It's safe to say nothing will ever happen between us again.",
