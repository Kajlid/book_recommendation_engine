For over two centuries, he's held the honored position of Treasurer of his Clan's most sacred Trust. He's also been responsible for the financial security of the most elite of the immortals, the Dominie. In order to ensure his redemption, Byron isolated himself on a small private island, away from all temptation. It was a good plan.until the day Violet Deeds was stranded there. Violet is beautiful, sexy, outspoken, and a human, which makes her completely off limits. His society's canon may forbid relationships between vampires and humans, but will that be enough to help Byron and Violet conquer the intensity of their attraction to one another? Or will Byron succumb and take a little nibble? This is a fresh new twist on the classic vampire tale of seduction. Extremely erotic, The Claim has a hero that you'll want to spend eternity with and a heroine you'll envy. It's the first in what is surely going to be a fabulously successful series for Samantha Sommersby.",
