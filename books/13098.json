Dr. Wyman Richardson lived the life of a busy, and distinguished, physician, practicing in Boston and teaching at the Harvard Medical School, but here is recorded his other lifethe one closest to his heart. Cape Cod, and, more specifically, his humble farmhouse on Nauset Marsh, was his refuge. First published in 1947, The House on Nauset Marsh presaged later authors who discussed such subjects as the intelligence, language, and emotions of animals. His observances of fog, time, bird language, the wind and weather touch upon the philosophical. Little could escape Wyman Richardson's gaze in his activities and at restreflecting on the shifting moods of land and sea, the denizens of salt marshes and woods, and the personalities and stories of the Cape Codders of a gentler time. 43 black-and-white illustrations",
