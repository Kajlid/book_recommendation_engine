Neferity has waited a long time for the revelation to come to fruition, and she'll stop at nothing until it's fulfilled.The darkness is circling, anticipating it's next feast, and if Draven and Aliyah aren't careful, they'll find themselves hanging themselves with the little rope they have left. Will they continue to curb their urges, or will they fall victim to the debauchery within.",
