  "description": "Introducing NAKED, the dark and sexy new adult series from New York Times bestselling author Kelly Favor. And now the series continues with book six...  Caelyn Murphy is broken.  She's broken because of something that was done to her--something she can't even bear to think about. So she does the only thing she can think of...she runs. Away from her Ivy League college, away from her perfect life, and away from the man who hurt her. Only she runs straight into...  Elijah.  Elijah Daniels is hardened from a life that's seen the worst the world has to offer. But when he meets Caelyn, he knows there’s something different about her. She's been through hell and back, but she hasn't given up.  Caelyn can see that Elijah is gorgeous on the outside, but she also knows he's dangerous. And the last man she trusted hurt her so badly, she may be beyond repair.  But the harder she tries to resist, the more Elijah’s persistence strips her of her armor and leaves her naked and vulnerable.  In the end, neither of them will be able to predict just how far they might have to go to save themselves...and each other.  RAW is the sixth book in the dark and sexy new adult series by the New York Times bestselling author of the For His Pleasure series.",
