Powerful monsters roam the forests in ever increasing numbers and only the Defenders of the Realms have any hope of stopping them.But the Defenders are also on the lookout for Outworlders, auburn-haired girls pulled from other worlds and brought to Esgar, the unwilling playthings of Gods and daemons.The orphan Tracy Lupin, now a grown young woman of eighteen, hates men, all men... except her uncle. Ever since being attacked two years ago she has steered well clear of them, kept herself safe.Until conspiring forces bring Tracy to Esgar. The daemon Zalophus needs her to fulfil an ancient prophecy, and so does the Goddess Kellandra. Both need Tracy to reawaken the ancient powers and forever tip the balance between good and evil, one way or the other...Lost in a world governed by men, chased by the forces of evil and hounded by Defenders, all Tracy wants to do is return home. But terrified by the pursuing image of a blood-red monster, her only chance is to overcome her ingrained distrust of others and seek their help before time runs out...",
