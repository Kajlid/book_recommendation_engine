  "title": "Sigga of Reykjavik",
  "description": "Meet Sigga, a spirited young woman who flees the abusive conditions on an Icelandic farm, only to face grinding poverty in Depression-era Reykjavik. Her struggle for independence runs parallel to Iceland’s quest for freedom from Danish dominance. Born a century before the Me-Too movement, Sigga supports her family, working among men who learn never to touch her without her permission. Adventurous, optimistic, and always practical, Sigga is thrilled when World War II brings Iceland out of centuries of isolation. Thousands of Allied forces occupy the country, bringing money and work. But moral dilemmas abound as Sigga seeks to financially exploit the occupation while at the same time protecting her young and beautiful red-headed daughter from soldiers. “As brave Sigga fights her way through the mid-century chaos of war and dislocation to become the person she knew she was meant to be, you can’t help falling in love with her.” Frank S.
