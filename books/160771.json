It’s love at first sight, and they plan to live Happily Ever After. Then the worst happens. Mya's vacation ends, and Herman is given to a woman whose dog treats cats like chew toys. He escapes danger, but the road to finding Mya is scary and tough. She promised to leave picture-maps along the way to her home. All Herman has to do is follow them and he will live Happily Ever After in the safety of Mya’s arms. It's a wonderful plan. Too bad it goes wrong right from the start.",
