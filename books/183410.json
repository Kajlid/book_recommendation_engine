  "description": "The Key, A Crusader’s Story, follows Ralph de Mortimer on his great adventure, his frequent heroism and his struggles to reconcile his commitments to his Order, his King and his woman. The book is filled with battles, shipwrecks, intrigue and survival. It paints a vivid picture of the life of a soldier of God during one of the most tumultuous times in history. Ralph, from a village in Berkshire in 1181, was a Knight Templar and the companion of Earls and Kings during the Crusades. He served in Jerusalem when the Babylon key was discovered and became its protector. The Babylon key was a guide to the looted treasures from the Second Temple and other conquests of the tyrant King Nebuchadnezzar. It had remained hidden more than 1500 years before being found by a Templar knight in the tunnels deep beneath Solomon’s stables on the Temple Mount. Unable to decipher the ancient Babylonian writing, Ralph kept the key safe while he participated in the great events of the age, pursued by Saracens, Jews, and Christians alike. All the while he searched for the one person who would unlock the key leading to the Babylonian treasure. The story of The Key fills in some of the holes left empty in history books with facts and exciting plausibilities.",
