  "title": "It's a Dance: Moving with the Holy Spirit",
  "description": "The author uses a fictitious church and fictitious people to write a nonfiction book about the Holy Spirit. Patrick Oden destroys the myth that solid Christian doctrine is only communicated in a didactic style as he shares the conversations of a newspaper journalist and pastor. The personalities of the people and the conversational style turn theology into an enlightening, fascinating read.",
