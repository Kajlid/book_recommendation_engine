  "description": "Suck my soul out? I’ll get over it. Try to kill me? Whatever. Send me a dead bunny? Watch your back. Life’s not perfect, but I didn’t realize it could be this good. Family, job, friends, that’s all covered. Caring boyfriend, Ethan, was icing on the cake. As each strand of happiness is ripped away, I’m forced to see how bad things can get.  When we’re called into a civilian crime scene, it makes it impossible to hide my secret from Ethan. After a madman and a killer crash our date, Ethan learns more than he can handle, so he’s out the door. For me, there’s no time to stop. The arrival of deranged gifts tell me that I’ve been marked for death, and I’d like to return the favor.  The trouble is, can you kill someone if they aren’t alive?",
