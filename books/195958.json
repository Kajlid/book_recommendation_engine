  "description": "15-year-old Alaina Roberts can count on one hand the number of times she’s left Shiloh, a cult compound in the North Georgia mountains. After being found beaten in a shed during an FBI raid, she’s forced to leave the only home she’s ever known and live among the sinners she’s been raised to fear. At first, she does her best to resist the influences of her Aunt Beth and Cousin Holly, worried that their kindness is a deception meant to lead her astray. But when she learns the truth about Shiloh and its leaders during court supervised visits with her mother, things get far more complicated.The rules that she’s always lived by don’t make any sense outside of Shiloh. And the people she’s been told are evil are anything but. Particularly Adam, the blue-eyed boy that Alaina can’t seem to stay away from.As her relationship with Adam develops, Alaina learns some hard truths about her mother. Now believing herself to be a prophetess, her mother is hell-bent on saving Alaina’s soul and will go to any extreme to turn her from her “sinful” ways, even if it means someone has to die.",
