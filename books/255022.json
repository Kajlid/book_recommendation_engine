  "description": "Welcome to three stories of the strange and macabre from the mind of David J. Fielding! Inside you'll find Willy Conklin's Last Snipe, and discover what terrible fate befalls a group of bullies who take things one step too far; in Bad Animals, you'll read how an estranged brother's disappearance leads one man to confront not only the demons of his past but some very hungry ones in his present - and finally Buddy Holly and the Cold, Cold Ground where you'll come to understand that ghosts are real - as are the things that hunt them. So sit back, crack open the covers and settle in for a trio of strange and eerie stories so beyond the pale, they can only be classified as... Oddities.",
