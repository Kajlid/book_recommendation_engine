  "title": "Looking Back:: Poems from My Adolescent Self",
  "description": "These poems were written by me between 1971 and 1975. That was between my junior year of high school and my senior year of college. The exception is the final poem. I wrote that a year after I met my husband and a year before I married him. I am happy to say that we are both Loving today. Thank you for reading.",
