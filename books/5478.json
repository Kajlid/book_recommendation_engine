The family has just moved to an old farmhouse in a new town, where the only good thing seems to be Miri's ten-sided attic bedroom. But when Miri gets sent to her room after accidentally bashing her big brother on the head with a shovel, she finds herself in the same room . . . only not quite. Without meaning to, she has found a way to travel back in time to 1935 where she discovers Molly, a girl her own age very much in need of a loving family. A highly satisfying classic-in-the-making full of spine-tingling moments, both books in the delightful time-travelling Molly and Miri series is perfect for the whole family.Don't miss the Magic in the MixAwards for The Magic HalfThe Virginia Readers' Choice Award list (2010-2011)Missouri Mark Twain Reader Award nominee (2010-2011)Kentucky Bluegrass Award Nominee2011 Rhode Island Children's Book Award2011 Massachusetts Children's Book Award2011 Washington State Sasquatch Reading 2011-2012 Florida Sunshine State Young Reader's Award (grades 3-5)",
