  "description": "When you cross lines every day it can be hard to remember what’s real.And what’s not.Keeping Eva Tatum safe was supposed to be a simple task. One Brock Cassidy should have been able to do with one arm tied behind his back.All he had to do was pretend to be her boyfriend.Show up and bluff away the stalker giving the bull-headed business woman the creeps.But the more time he spends around her, the less faking Brock is doing.\nAnd protecting the woman who hired him becomes personal.\n****Going to Alaska was just a precaution.One Eva was forced to take, whether she wanted to or not.It’s not like there was any real danger. She’d faced crazy once, and this was definitely not it. The situation was completely manageable.Harmless, really.But crazy has a way of showing up where it’s not wanted. Where it’s not allowed.And crazy isn’t allowed within one-hundred feet of Eva. She has the court documents to prove it.But papers don’t stop madmen intent of claiming what they believe should be theirs.\nAnd taking down anything in their way.",
