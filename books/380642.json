Featuring stories of crime and misdeeds, this fascinating book includes chapters on a typical day inside a Victorian prison—food, divine service, exercise, and medical provision; the punishments inflicted on convicts—such as hard labor, flogging, the treadwheel, and shot drill; and an overview of the ultimate penalty paid by prisoners—execution. Richly illustrated with a series of photographs, engravings, documents, and letters, this volume is sure to appeal to all those interested in crime and social history in Victorian Britain.",
