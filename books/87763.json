  "title": "We Love Jenni: An Unauthorized Biography of Jenni Rivera",
  "description": "“We Love Jenni,” is a frank and revealing biography of the late Mexican-American singer Jenni Rivera written by The New York Times best-selling author Marc Shapiro and journalist Charles Vazquez that goes behind the scenes to tell the riveting story of the iconic Latina, who was killed last December 9th in a plane crash in Mexico. Shapiro, author of popular biographies of celebrities such as J. K. Rowling and Justin Bieber, says the book tells the story of a woman “who never shied away from any of the huge problems she faced in life – her rough and tumble childhood, her cheating husband, her first love who in reality was a child molesting monster, her son's indiscretion with an underage girl and so much more. Jenni was such an amazing woman – it’s reflected in her fiery live performances and the music that would set many millions on the course for equal rights for women in a long male-dominated Mexican culture,” Shapiro added. “She was a star in a world that many of us did not know and only her sad, untimely death kept her from breaking out and having it all.”",
