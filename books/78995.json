They are the first notes in the love song she hears when she can’t help falling in love with her King of Rock ‘n’ Roll. When the Memphis Mafia rudely invades her affair with the most eligible bachelor in the country, no one can tell which way the records will spin.Singer, songwriter, actor, and author Carol Dunitz and Pulitzer-nominated author David W. Menefee lay down the tracks in this unforgettable romance that's topping the charts as the year’s most musical love story. This is the first book in the Allison Webster trilogy, followed by the tantalizing funny and unforgettable continuation, COME AWAY TO PARADISE.",
