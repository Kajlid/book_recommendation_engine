  "description": "If someone asked you what you did to get where you are today, what would you tell them? Author Bill Carpentier gives us his take as he looks back over his life with a critical eye—and great comic timing. He tells tales of growing up in an Italian family in Brooklyn in the 1950s (even including a recipe for egg creams), training for the Navy (during one winter on the Great Lakes), and trying to be “present” for his kids (while having to handle emergencies long distance). Don’t worry, though, his wife was always there to help him—or at least to tell him what she had already done on his behalf.The tales of soccer “coaching” will resonate with anyone who has played (or watched) a little league sport, while the stories from the road (both his stories, and those of his staff) are sure to connect to everyone in business. With a little something for everyone—not to mention a keen look at some foibles we all share—this Dust from the Attic won’t soon be getting swept under the rug.",
