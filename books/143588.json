If you thought the only means of preserving humanity was to capture, imprison and breed humans against their will - would you sanction it? Ariet has been taken from her family, drugged and removed against her will to a secret underground location. Selected for a genetic breeding program, Ariet and her captor Mason, have to provide an offspring with a predetermined inherited genetic profile, or face termination. Will Ariet be able to save her unborn child from the Monarchy of this new world?This book is a horror story, a coming of age story and dark, thought experiment into the extreme application of genetic selection. It raises interesting ethical questions and poses the question - How far would you go?",
