She's got direction, ambition, and a mother who's intent on keeping her that way. But as soon as she arrives at WCU she runs into Hardin, her mother's worst nightmare.

His dark mood grabs her, and when they kiss, something ignites within her - a passion she's never known before...He'll call her beautiful, then insist he isn't the one for her and disappear without a word. Despite the reckless way he treats her, Tessa is compelled to dig deeper and find the real Hardin beneath all his lies. He pushes her away again and again, but every time she pushes back she winds up being pulled in further still.
