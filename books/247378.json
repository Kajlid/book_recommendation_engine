Did the god create us or did we create him?\"When the universe was to be created, did god hold the atoms in his hands and say “Dear ones. Go! Create an universe with lots of dazzling galaxies, stars, planets. But ensure that you create a place for the humans who will worship me.”In this book, the author compares the \"Theories of creation\" proposed through religion, spirituality and science. Will we ever be able to get answers to our questions on our existence?",
