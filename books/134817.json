  "title": "The Haiku Seasons: Poetry of the Natural World",
  "description": "In a wonderfully lucid way, The Haiku Seasons presents the historical and modern Japanese usage of seasonal themes in poetry. It shows, as nothing else in the literature has done, the growing dialogue between poets in Japan and other countries. The ways to create, use, and enjoy a saijiki (seasonal guide and anthology) and the samples from an international saijiki should prove fascinating to everyone interested in haiku and related poetry. An extremely valuable work!",
