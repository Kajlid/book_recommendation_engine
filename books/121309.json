  "description": "Nicholas said a conversation about gender equity without men did not meet the criteria for inclusion. Blake said equity is essential and will happen when we acknowledge that men face challenges too.In Men-in-the-Middle, author Kori Reed interviews men across corporate America about gender equity in the workplace. This is a topic men can influence, as they hold nearly 75 percent of C-suite positions, but they don't talk about it at the office. As it turns out, men have a lot to say! They are aware of the issues and the impacts and, at the same time, unsure of what to do. This uncertainty renders Men-in-the-Middle, even though they may be supporters, on the silent sidelines of gender equity.Combining interviews with insights from secondary research, Reed seeks to provide a framework to understand this \"silent majority\" and shine the light on new perspectives and topics that often go undiscussed. Conversations to Gain Momentum with Gender Equity's Silent Majority invites men and women to cultivate conversations by providing an orientation on perspective-taking and laying a foundation to move gender equity forward in a new inclusive way. Awards and Accolades- Kirkus \"Recommended\" Review- 2023 NYC Big Book Distinguished Author Award- 2023 Finalist in the IAN Book of the Year Awards- 2023 Booklife Prize Nonfiction Finalist",
