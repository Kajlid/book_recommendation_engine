After walking amongst the undead, she knows that vampires are the true heroes of the ancient conflict, and she’ll do what it takes to make sure they win—even if that means going against the sibling who got caught up on the wrong side of the war.The third book in the Blood, Bloom, & Water series takes the war between fangs and fins to new heights as betrayals and secrets threaten to unravel even the best of intentions.",
