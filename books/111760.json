  "title": "The Pulse of Awakening: How-to Connect with Soul and Life Purpose",
  "description": "In this gentle little how-to book, The Soul Guardians share a simplified version of their truth of Soul having its own agenda, purpose, and plan. They also share clarity on the purpose of Spirit and the purpose of Humankind. Soul Guardians are informing us, right now, through thousands of earthly messengers, that this is the time to consciously relearn how to connect directly to Source. The Guardians are here to help us in this process, and all we have to do is open the conversation. The human being who brings this particular message to you is Sue Rumack, SoulDancer, author and translator for The Soul Guardians, herself an earthbound Soul Guardian. Sue is one of those messengers, sometimes called light workers or channelers, with life-altering lessons for those who can 'hear' what she has spiritually contracted to share. She has been given in-the-moment messages, images, and dreams that change and save lives, guide the confused into clarity, and ground the lost. So come with us on a journey of enlightenment. Suspend judgment. Expand your sense of wonder and reality until they blend as one Universal possibility. Touch and be touched by Soul.",
