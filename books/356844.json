  "description": "The Chicano Movement is not dead. It lives on, fierce and passionate, in the voice and person of Gloria Velasquez. Challenging our complacency, her resonant cries for justice \"refuse to be silent/to be buried in obscurity.\"Velasquez has known poverty and discrimination intimately and, like a phoenix from the ashes, she has risen to recognition as an artist, an educator and a leader. But, the poet is as uncompromising with herself as she is with her reader. Refusing to rest on her laurels, her ardent verses are a pledge reiterating her allegiance to la causa and a call to arms demanding that others perpetuate the struggle.",
