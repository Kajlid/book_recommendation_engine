  "description": "Develop Jedi Self-Confidence: Unleash the Force within You by top self-help author Stephen Richards is the fast way to restore or even build a more powerful self-confidence mindset within you.If you are under the impression that building confidence is all about tapping your inner strength, hold it right there! This e-book will take you through an easy-to-follow process of building self-confidence that is simpler than you imagined ... Jedi easy!Self-belief, also called self-efficacy, is the kind of feeling you have when you have, like a Jedi, mastered a particular kind of skill and with its help have been able to achieve your set goals. This type of self-confidence can not only be acquired through learning and practice but can also push a person to stretch his or her limitations and face newer challenges. Your self-confidence is simply the part of your brain that tells you whether or not you should try something different or new or believe in yourself, and just as a Jedi truly believes that it is within their power to control their thoughts and stay in the Light, so can you.Right now you feel charged and feel that the time is just right to get started to build your self-confidence. Of course you are not wrong, you can do this. However, you also have to understand that building confidence is not possible at the press of a button or clicking on the mouse of your computer. It is a process that may seem rough and burdensome in the beginning. You must be prepared to fumble and fall, a couple of times during the process. During such periods of uncertainty, think of the fear and apprehensions that makes you who you are. These negativities would help you glide through the hurdles with ease and comfort. The more you try to tackle the fears head on, the quicker you can reach your desired goal of gaining self-confidence. FROM THE AUTHORThere is a school of thought that believes that self-confidence can be an acquired art through self-ratification and persistent positive thinking. However, without competence, self-confidence is often replaced by a veneer of arrogance and boastfulness that is not without its fair share of ego-centred hiccups.CONTENTS:JEDI SELF-CONFIDENCE – WHAT IS IT?THE JEDI CORE OF INNER STRENGTHTHE INNER WORKINGS OF SELF-CONFIDENCESELF-CONFIDENCE – BUILD IT LIKE A JEDIGETTING READY FOR THE JOURNEY AHEAD THE JEDI WAYSPEEDING LIKE LIGHT TOWARDS SUCCESSEXPAND SELF-CONFIDENCETO DREAM BIGBIG UP YOUR SELF-CONFIDENCE AND OVERDOSE ON IT UNLOCK THE CONFIDENT PERSON IN YOUCLEARING THE MIND THE JEDI WAYBE MINDFUL YOUNG PADAWANSUPER SELF-ESTEEM AND SUPREME HAPPINESSUSING THE FORCE TO OVERCOME NEGATIVE THOUGHTSSUPREME CONFIDENCE – THE JEDI MANTRASELF-DEFEATING BELIEFS DESTROY SELF-CONFIDENCEANNIHILATE GUILT WITH JEDI MINDFULNESS FRAMING THE POSITIVE WITH JEDI POWER BOOSTINGLIMITLESS JEDI SELF-CONFIDENCECRUSH THE DARK FORCES WITH THE JEDI POWER WITHIN FINE TUNE YOUR EMOTIONS THE JEDI WAYMAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU",
