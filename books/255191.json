  "description": "Despite the fact it seemed like Base Masters was all over Sterling Shore, I'd never really known much about him, aside from random factoids. Things like... he's a semi-estranged cousin of one of my brother's friends, plays guitar in a local band, and he doesn't get mentioned much unless he's on stage.  Until... he decided I was going to be his first real-life muse, moved himself into my spare room, and started splashing the walls with pictures of my face next to his lyrics...  His weirdness differs from mine, but he'd be a perfect candidate for my hymen situation. Then I could finally move on to the next personal challenge on my list. The only problem is that he's yet another man afraid of a virgin.  I genuinely never expected it to be so difficult to lose one's virginity. I think the world has filled me with false expectations of debauchery coming so easily.  The human element always messes up the plans in my head.",
