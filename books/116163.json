  "title": "Tattoo: Journeys on My Mind",
  "description": "The trouble with over 30 years of traveling is being over 30 years older. But I can’t help it; I’m curious and the years flew. In my midlife review, I invite you to join me for the ride in TATTOO—JOURNEYS ON MY MIND. These 21 chapters share an eclectic mix of genres and places. Included is a canoe trip in South Carolina to set the fun tone of tree house to right; retracing how I lost my cultural empathy in Northern India; dog sledding in Minnesota to experience team dynamics and self-empowerment, notes on wives being put out to pasture in the Utah desert; Eastern Europe’s sideways look into gulags; and a pair of caving trips that altered my view on the ground. These are the journeys on my mind. Maybe some of them will stay on your mind for a while too. (218 pages, an E-Book or Paperback)",
