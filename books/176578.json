  "description": "Join the author, Tirza Schaefer, on a magical journey travelling to the Eifel Mountains in Western Germany with her mother and two daughters, Tarjani and Tarini. After a ride in the car, the family find themselves in a magical garden in which stands the Pear Tree of Life. Walking through the garden, they find a magical house. They spend one week travelling through different time-space and vibrational dimensions. It begins with a conversation between mother, daughter and a cow and continues with many inner and outer adventures in an environment which is as magical and otherworldly, as it is celebrating the beauty of nature and encompassing the joys of experiencing the physical realm in a very in-joyable and spiritual way. From walking deep below the ground to viewing the world from a birdâ€™s perspective, it incorporates all. Edited by Marilyn Holzmann, with a foreword by India Wilson.",
