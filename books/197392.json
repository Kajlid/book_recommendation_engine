  "description": "\"It's you, Princess,\" Ethan says. \"You're perfect, and I need you in my life.\"  Rule #15 â€“ We have to cuddle as much as possible. All the time. Every night.  \"I love you,\" I say, mumbling, not sure how to tell him exactly how I feel about him right now.  \"I love you, too,\" he says. \"I love you so much.\"  \"Can you tell me what you meant before?\" I ask. \"About the girl stuff?\"  \"Yeah,\" he says, genuine. \"What I meant to say is that this is hard for me. It's hard being away from you. I think if you were here with me, it'd be different. Everyone could see we're together, right? They'd know, and then I could focus solely on you and you alone. Right now, though, the way things are, and the way I left things last year, everyone thinks it's a joke or something. Or that I'm making it up, or that me saying I have a girlfriend now is some kind of game. It's not a game to me, Princess. It's more real than anything I've ever experienced before, and I guess I just want everyone to know it, but I don't know how to get the point across.\"  I know why they do it. I don't know if I can tell Ethan, but...  It's because they've all only ever had a week. A week isn't enough with you, Ethan. I've had over two months with you and that's not even enough. I don't know how much is enough. I don't even know if it's possible to get enough...  I wish I'd known how much I had before.",
