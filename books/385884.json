  "description": "Young Toby spends his days exploring the backwoods surrounding his UK country home. His imagination not only supplies adventure but also the exciting promise of lustful embraces and kisses with the handsome field hand. When Toby's mother, a nurse, brings home a sickly yet handsome youth, Cymon, to recuperate, Toby finds himself drawn to the older boy. Their friendship, awkward at first, blossoms as each offers the other much-needed comfort. Cowboys Can Fly presents a classic story of gay adolescence, one that is as heartbreaking as it is triumphant in spirit.“Woods and boys were born to be together; born to share each other’s unquestionable beauty. A woods is that special place where a boy’s quest to be spiritually free is born, a place of magic and mystery, a wonderful place to fall in love.” --Ken Smith",
