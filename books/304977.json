  "title": "Pitch: The Adventures of Danger Rabbit",
  "description": "Pitch\" is a work of fiction written for a teenage audience and older (16+). The story follows a boy in a world where magic is so common spellbooks are sold like cookbooks. After a dreadful mistake turned the titular character into the town's laughing stock, Pitch is set on a path with an approaching fork in the road. Will he continue to sulk over his mistakes and search for a way to undo them, or will he learn to embrace his new life. He'll have his friends and family with him along the way to help make his decision, but in the end, only Pitch can decide where his journey leads. No one is saving the world, and the existence of life itself is not at risk. Pitch is a low stakes modern fantasy that gives you time to warm up to characters and their struggles. The story explores many themes, such as family dynamics and wealth and equality. Depression and codependency are struggles to be overcome. Sexuality is something to be explored. It can be hard learning who we are when we're faced with daily struggles we can't escape. These are all things Pitch delves into, but never at the cost of realism and character. Crass humor is abundant in this tale. With fleshed out characters wilder than a zoo, there's no telling what will happen. Each chapter is its own episode in the long narrative of Pitch's ongoing story. You can focus on the overarching story or take each entry and find they hold their individual subplots. Romance, drama, action, and comedy are everywhere in this world but make no mistake; everyone in the life of Pitch has gravity grounding them to something familiar and real.Enter the town of Daybreak and lose yourself.",
