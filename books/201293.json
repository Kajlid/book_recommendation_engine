  "description": "This is Joanna Campbell's first collection of short stories, many of which have won prizes or been shortlisted in international competitions. They are about lonely people for whom the world has shifted a little on its axis. A wry sense of humour often illuminates the dark edges of these tales.Each story catches the moment of implosion - a lame girlâ€™s friends disappear on a bleak mountain, a schoolboy nurses a doll during a lesson, a babysitter is caught in her own web of lies, a mother watches her pram sink in the river, and a child discovers the truth about birth and death in the space of a day.",
