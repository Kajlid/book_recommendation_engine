  "description": "Reeling from the aftershocks of what will heretofore be known as \"The Hot-Tub Incident,\" American party girl Tasha jumps at the chance to spend a semester abroad at tweedy Oxford University - banking on the fact that the tabloid stories about her won't have made their way across the Pond. But is wading Uggs-deep in feminist theory really so much better than living down the stares and snickers stateside?Meanwhile, studious control freak Emily disappoints her snooty British family by throwing herself into film classes - not to mention bikinis and beer pong - at UC Santa Barbara. Her English accent gets her plenty of male attention, but not all of it welcome - especially the frustrating confrontations with a fellow classmate.Twenty-four-year-old debut novelist Abby McDonald has crafted a funny, fast-paced, and poignant look at survival, sisterhood, and the surprising ways we discover our true selves.",
