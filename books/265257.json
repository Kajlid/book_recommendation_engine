  "title": "Chicken Soup for the Sister's Soul: Inspirational Stories About Sisters and Their Changing Relationships",
  "description": "This new Chicken Soup book offers a heartwarming and uplifting collection of stories that celebrate the lifelong bond of sisterhood. Whether they share this special connection with someone through genetics or the heart, only a sister can understand the complex, deep and dynamic relationship they share with loved ones as they journey together through the stages of life. For younger sisters who look up to an older one, older siblings who tolerate a younger sister tagging along, or the brother who knows full well that girls can wrestle as well as any boy can, this book celebrates the sisters in our lives. It conveys how sisters influence us during life's most defining helping us face the schoolyard bully; providing wise counsel during our first crush and subsequent comfort after the breakup; and refusing to reveal intimate secrets to parents or friends. With real-life stories from celebrities and everyday sisters-next-door, chapters On Love, Insights and Lessons, Sibling Rivalry, Overcoming Obstacles, The Bond Between Sisters, Sisters by Heart, On Family (Brothers, Too!), and Special Memories and Traditions. While they may not live under the same roof, act in the same manner or even get along without an occasional spat, nothing creates a more special and lasting bond than sisterhood. Now there's a book to celebrate that bond.",
