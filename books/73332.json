  "description": "Dreams can become nightmares. Small town girl, Sarah, hopes to find love and fame in New York City, but following her dreams leads to a downward slide into the insanity of the late 1970s: nightclubs, sex, drugs, and violence á½° la Magic Mike. Desperate to dig herself out of debt, Sarah becomes a pole dancer, Rosy Dreams. But the more money she makes, the darker her nightmare becomes as she sinks into a world where no one can be trusted--especially the men who claim to adore her. As Sarah slips deeper into the underworld, she questions not only her dreams, but her sanity. She battles demons--imagined and real--fighting to survive the city's brutality, fighting for her dreams, and ultimately fighting for her life.Note: Chapter Headings are linked to Amazon MP3 sample and downloadAdult themes: sex, drugs, language",
