  "title": "Hagan's Watch",
  "description": "It is two hours into a cold and windy midnight-to-eight tour. Police Officer Matthew Hagan walks his beat along Flatbush Avenue. Unknowingly, he takes the same steps that his father took two decades before. He carries with him the memory of his father. He thinks of his sons, now toddlers, who are destined to follow the same path two decades later. Get into the head of Matthew Hagan as he walks his beat and whip through the streets, with lights and siren, to shoot-outs, horrible injury and, ultimately, death. Meet Hagan's domineering father and witness the escapades of his two fearless sons, who bring crisis, trepidation and glory to the Hagan name. Follow the lives of three generations of Hagans, whose watch parallels events in New York City during the post WW II era, the riotous 1960's and '70s, and the violent, crack-infested 1980's and '90s. Become immersed in the saga of a family whose iron provides the grit and stability necessary to overcome the social mayhem and danger of \"the job.\" Discover an old police call box that foreshadows ominous events. Experience an encounter in blackness, void of any sound. Feel the struggle for the sight of a child. And, witness the psychotic obsession of one man to exact revenge on a cop called Hagan.",
