  "title": "Wage Slave: Surviving In Corporate America With Your Sanity Intact",
  "description": "It's your first day on the job as a lower-level administrative person in an office - an assistant, technology person, word processing, or some other such position. You will be making crappy-to-okay money, you will be a number in the system, and you will find yourself under the thumb of evil overlords (managers and honchos) whose to-do list includes making buckets of money, exerting their authority over anyone that they can, and sucking out your soul and self-esteem. You are a wage slave.  What if, on that day, someone who was obviously a fellow cube-dweller walked up to you, smiled, set a book down on your desk, then turned around and walked away without a word being said? If that actually happened, this would be that book.  Wage Slave is a satirical, profanity-laden, how-to book on surviving your work day. It will make you laugh, take away some of that stress, and maybe even give you a few scraps of wisdom.",
