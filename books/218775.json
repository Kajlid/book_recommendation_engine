  "description": "With one kiss she was his. From USA Today bestselling author Terri Anne Browning, comes a new ROCKER series—Tainted Knights. All it took was one look, one kiss. The promises he made—I should have known better. He was a rock star and I had no time for a guy like him in my life. I fell anyway. I believed his promises. Held onto them and waited. But the thing about rockers is that their private lives are never truly private. Seeing him on the cover of a national tabloid shouldn’t have surprised me. Seeing him with two women all over him? That nearly broke me. Now the memory of that first magical kiss was TAINTED. *NEW SERIES*STANDALONE",
