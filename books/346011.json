  "title": "Child Sexual Abuse: From Harsh Realities to Hope",
  "description": "This book is for people who want to understand child sexual abuse in new ways. Based on interviews, the book shows what child sexual abuse means to child and adult survivors, perpetrators, and mothers of child sexual abuse survivors. The book provides information on signs of sexual abuse, talking to children who have been sexually abused, risks for becoming abusers, whether abused children become abusers, family incest treatment and other treatment approaches, and strategies for preventing the development of sexually abusive behaviors.  Survivors, family members and friends of the families will find their experiences reflected in these pages. The actual words of people directly involved challenge myths and misunderstandings. The stories are difficult to hear. This is an old problem. It is time to put aside our reluctance to hear such stories. Avoidance protects perpetrators, allows child sexual abuse to go on, and isolates survivors who often feel blamed and shamed. For public policy and prevention programs to be responsive to the issues that child sexual abuse creates, we need an informed public. Humane responses depend upon accurate understandings.",
