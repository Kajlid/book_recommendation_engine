  "title": "Clemency Pogue: Fairy Killer",
  "description": "Only a child so quick-witted as Clemency Pogue, upon finding herself attacked by a wicked, invincible fairy, would remember a lesson learned from the story of Peter Pan . She shouts \"I don't believe in fairies,\" and when it doesn't work, keeps shouting it until the horrible little creature drops as dead as a gossamer-winged doorknob. But then a mischievous hobgoblin arrives to tell Clem that she's killed six other fairies around the globe, some bad, but mostly good. Even if it was a mistake, it's now Clem's duty to set the world aright. In his hilarious, action-packed debut novel, JT Petty does for burlap pants what holes have done for Swiss cheese.",
