A huge manhunt ensues. The culprit is captured. The story is over.Except it isn't. For Alan Banks, still struggling with a tragic loss of his own, there's something wrong about this case — something unresolved. Reteaming with profiler Jenny Fuller, the relentless detective deeper into the crime... deep enough to unearth long-buried secrets that reshape everything Banks thought he knew about the events outside that chapel. And when at last the shocking truth becomes clear, it's almost too late.Packed with twists and turns, heart and soul, this is another triumph from an author \"at the top of his game\" (LOUISE PENNY).",
