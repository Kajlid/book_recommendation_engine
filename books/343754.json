  "description": "One man is a harbinger. The other a bad boy. She’s set to save their race. Too bad she has to die.NiaMora, a magical crime scene cleaner, is destined to die tonight. Severin, a harbinger of death, has already arrived to bear witness. But he’ll defy his duty. He won’t stand by and watch, not when NiaMora may be the Fae’s last hope of survival.Zan Wynn cares nothing for Severin’s heroic delusions. The Fae-tech mogul has “spies” on NiaMora and her aftermath cleaner team. He wants her for reasons of his own and as the quintessential bad boy—some might say bad guy—he can’t be bothered to play fair.Oblivious to her doom, NiaMora focuses on the missing Way, the very essence of the Fae and the reason they are trapped in the mortal world. There’s also the small matter of remaining single when she can’t deny Severin’s power over her or Zan Wynn’s hypnotic pull. One man is her fate, the other the prelude to her destruction.",
