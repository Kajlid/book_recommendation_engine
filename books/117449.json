Hyperbole and A Half is a blog and webcomic written by a 20-something American girl called Allie Brosh. She tells fantastically funny, wise stories about the mishaps of her everyday life, with titles like 'Why Dogs Don't Understand Basic Concepts Like Moving' and 'The God of Cake'.. Brosh's website receives millions of visitors a month and hundreds of thousands per day. Now her full-colour debut book chronicles the many 'learning experiences' Brosh has endured as a result of her own character flaws. It includes stories about her rambunctious childhood; the highs and mostly lows of owning a mentally challenged dog; and a moving and darkly comic account of her struggles with depression. 'Quirky and captivating' Observer'It's impossible not to warm to cartoonist and blogger Allie. If she doesn't get to you with her funny childhood anecdotes (eating an entire birthday cake) then her honest reflections on depression will' Grazia",
