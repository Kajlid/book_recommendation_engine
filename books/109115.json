  "description": "Midway through her sophomore year, 19-year old college co-ed Marissa Dumfrey is tired of boys her own age treating her like just another hookup. She wants to find a man who will really appreciate her love -- and her lust. Fed up trying to compete with all the other girls on campus where boys call the shots when it comes to hook-ups, Marissa decides to test out a hypothesis her economics professor would be proud of: finding a lover who might value a sexually-adventurous college girl -- an older man who is in desperate need of a young woman's attention. To Marissa's surprise, she finds herself completely aroused by the least likely of new lovers -- a man old enough to be her father, or even grandfather. After spending her life as a good girl, sticking close to the world's expectations for her, Marissa is shocked at how much she enjoys being one older man's new erotic toy. Stunned by her own brazen sexual seduction of her new, much older, lover, Marissa finds herself crossing lines she never imagined would ever be a question -- her older lover's desperate passion for her youthful body excites her and she finds herself pushing her own boundaries further and further to satisfy his lust.",
