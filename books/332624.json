  "description": "Taylor hates Beau. He's the man she gave her heart to years ago and he shattered it to pieces. The butterfly effect from that one night altered Taylor’s life irrevocably, and she has never forgiven him. Her new purpose in life? To make Beau's life as difficult as possible by chasing off every date he meets and throwing in some war-level sparring, too.Beau cannot stand Taylor. She’s the one woman who can crawl under his skin and turn him from Mr. Goody Two Shoes to a raging, testosterone-fuelled beast who just wants to ravage her sassy mouth and put her over his knee. Every bitter word between them is a reminder of their painful past, and the way his body reacts to her drives him crazy. Still, when Taylor needs help convincing her stalker ex that she’s moved on, Beau can’t resist helping her out and playing the part of her doting boyfriend.But when old wounds crack open, buried feelings resurface and close quarters crank up the heat, can they keep their walls high or will they realize that giving in is the sweetest surrender…Triggers: Abortion, abandonment, adoption, stalking, violence and threat of sexual assault.",
