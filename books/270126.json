  "description": "A very proper prince and a rude, dangerous man who may or may not be a stableman: a fairy-tale love story...Ice Prince.Prince Jamil of Calluvia has always disliked that moniker, but he is responsible and proper, and it's probably accurate to say that he isn't good at emotions. After being widowed, Jamilâ€™s life has revolved around his duties as a crown prince and little else. But one night, everything changes.One night, Jamil meets a man at the royal stables, a man who is the opposite of proper, a man with eyes as black as sin.Rohan di'Lehr is everything Jamil should despise. He's a rude, lowborn criminal. He's terrible for Jamil's self-control. He makes Jamil behave like a wanton creature, not the Crown Prince.They have nothing in common. They have no future together.He still can't stay away.A story of forbidden, twisted attraction and love that defies all odds.Note: This book contains explicit sexual M/M content and graphic language.",
