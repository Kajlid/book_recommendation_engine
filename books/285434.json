  "description": "Smoky: Exiled Guardians MC 4 An Alpha Older Man, Younger Curvy Woman Romance  Smoky I’m a player… and it’s getting old. I’m no longer even tempted by the women at my club. That is until Harper walks in. Then I’m thinking about making her, my wife.  Harper I just need a job. I don’t need the drama of coming between a man and his girlfriend. I want to save my house and hopefully keep the lights on. However, once Smoky sets his sights on me, he makes my heart race and body tremble. But I don’t need or want a player. I want forever.  Dear Reader, I love to read MC romances. I’ve just always enjoyed reading about the tightness of the MC brothers and the way they love their women. I love it so much that I have always wanted to write one. However, being a short story romance author, it seemed impossible to build an in-depth storyline like most MC romance series, but I wanted to give it a try. Therefore, I present to you my version of an MC romance. I’m borrowing the term MC Lite from Frankie Love. It is heavy on the motorcycle club sense of family, it has lots of alpha men and the curvy women that love them. However, it is a little lite on the drama and most violence is handled off-page. I sincerely hope you like it. XX, Hope This is a Steamy, Sweet, Short Story Romance. No Cliffhangers. This is the fourth story in the Exiled Guardians MC Series. If you love short romances with insta love, hot love scenes, and a sweet story, then this one is for you.",
