  "title": "The Virginian",
  "description": "A ranch foreman becomes a hero in this classic Western novel that inspired five films and a popular TV series. Loosely based on the Johnson County War of 1892, a bloody clash between big landowners and small ranchers in Wyoming, Owen Wister's The Virginian is the classic saga of a man who embodied the spirit of a growing nation… “When you call me that, SMILE!” He wasn't looking for fame or glory. He wasn't looking for war. The man they called “the Virginian” was earning his way off the land, mingling his sweat and blood on the rich Montana soil as a trusted foreman for a rich man's ranch. Somewhere along the line he made an enemy, made a choice and then made a stand…. In the eyes of a woman, he was a man of contradictions, as violent as he could be tender. In the eyes of others, he became a hero, a man who had the courage to draw his gun and use it against his enemies—and the courage to stand for justice without it.“Owen Wister has come pretty near to writing the American novel. It contains humor, pathos, poetic description, introspective thought, sentiment, and even tragedy.”—New York Times",
