But even so, predestined lovers still have the choice to walk away . . .In 2014, Marc Wilde--martial artist and actor--finds his life a mess. His latest film, Croc-nami, is being trashed on social media, sending his acting career into a tailspin (crocodile pun . . . nice). His dating history isn't much better. Romantic love? Not so much. And then there is the tiny matter of blackmail. Someone knows about the time portal in the cellar of Duir Cottage and is threatening to tell the world unless Marc pays up. So yeah . . . life not going so well.In 1814, Kit Ashton has problems of her own. Her brother has disappeared (again), leaving Kit penniless and forcing her to take up employment as a lady's companion (sigh). Worse, there are French spies in the area, and Kit finds herself pulled into the conspiracy. Add in the sudden appearance of a wind-swept, silver-tongued rogue who makes Kit want to flirt, flirt, flirt . . . it all leaves her one misstep from disaster. Kit is determined to find her brother and return home, all while guarding her heart and (most importantly) keeping her secrets . . . well . . . secret.This hilarious, quick-paced installment in the Amazon bestselling House of Oak series can easily be read as a stand-alone book.",
