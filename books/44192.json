  "description": "Poetry. At once clear and hermetic, oracular and elegiac, MUSIC'S MASK AND MEASURE presents a series of five \"equations\" in a cosmic algebra. Drawing from such disparate sources as medieval theology, modern physics, and a Pythagorean sense of harmony, these poems offer glimpses of a dance in which only one partner can be seen. Reading them, we move in \"the firm embrace/ of the unsolved.\" Jay Wright is the author of eight previous books of poetry that were collected in one volume, Transfigurations, in 2000; he won the Bollingen Prize for Poetry in 2005.",
