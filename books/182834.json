  "description": "When his mother goes out to party one Saturday night and doesn't come back, seven-year-old Ishmael Hood is taken in by his estranged uncle Henry and Henry's live-in boyfriend, Sam. As this unlikely trio begins to build a new life together, they encounter both support and hostility in the small Mississippi town where they live. Seems like just about everybody has an opinion on the matter—and they're not shy about expressing it.  While this blossoming little family finds its feet, outside forces—and ghosts from the past—threaten to tear it apart. Henry, still trying to deal with the tragic death of his parents, finds himself hard-pressed to open his heart to this needy child.  Just as a little shine begins to come back into their lives, Ishmael's mother returns, and their world is thrown into chaos.",
