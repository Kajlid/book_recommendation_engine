  "description": "Far from the fort, the girls fear they might never see their homes and families again.. Sarah and her best friend Mely are typical homesteader girls in Old Kentucky. They spend their days cooking over open fires, tending to animals, washing clothes in a nearby stream and exploring the dense forest near their homes. But when they venture a little too far, everything changes. Shawnee and Cherokee warriors kidnap the girls and take them deep into the wilderness, leaving them to wonder if they'll ever see their homes again. The girls endure an action-packed adventure inspired by the true story of Daniel Boone's frontier times that offers a look at the lives of early settlers west of the Appalachians. Learn about the frontier, Kentucky's native peoples and more with acclaimed author Karen Leet.",
