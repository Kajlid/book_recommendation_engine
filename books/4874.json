  "title": "My Dog, My Cat",
  "description": "In this bright new picture book, the author describes all the differences between her dog and cat, who don't always get along. Her dog barks; her cat meows. Her dog likes steak; her cat likes tuna. Her dog's tongue is wet; her cat's tongue is rough. But the story ends on a delightfully sweet note when the author reveals what her dog and cat have in common â€” a love of pizza and a love of their owner. The strong lines and fresh colors make this book an appealing read as young readers learn about normal behaviors for the two most popular pets, and that even the most different of creatures can find things in common.",
