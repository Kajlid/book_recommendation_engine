  "description": "Two cousins meet for dinner. Who are they? Why is a plumber arguing with a professor? They begin to discuss one of the great problems of our time - inequality. Can they find solutions? Can they agree on the meaning of equality? Follow their conversation to its powerful conclusion.In their conversations, the plumber and the professor introduce the reader to basic principles of equality and social justice. In accessible language they tell us about incentives, equal opportunity, fairness, merit, property, and reciprocity. They tell us how such ideas can and cannot work in an era of pandemic and climate change. They arrive at an agreement that all progressive thinkers and activists would do well to consider. â€‹The ideas in the book are dramatized in eighteen colour illustrations by Hanna Melin.",
