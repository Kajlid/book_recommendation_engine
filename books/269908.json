  "description": "The blue has seeped into Aya's skin, making it impossible to feel anything but passion and depression. If she thought controlling only red was bad, this is ten times worse. At least Dune is dead.Or so she thought.But Dune is very much alive and she won't rest until she has the Aveum, and Aya is either the tool to find it or the obstacle standing in Dune's way.Aya is armed with Van Gogh's book that contains a map to the keys that will allow her to find the Aveum once and for all. She finds that Dune has three of the keys locked away in a high-security building, and the rest are spread throughout the world. She has to make a choice; be forever hunted by Dune or find the Aveum and destroy it.With that choice, she drags her friends across the world and into situations more dangerous than any of them could have imagined. Aya doesn't know what to believe when a mysterious stranger shows up and tries to win her over, but no matter how she tries, her heart isn't willing to give Liam up quite yet. She only needs to keep the blue and red under control, find the keys to the Aveum, keep going after being betrayed, keep one step ahead of Dune, and stay alive for the process.No pressure.",
