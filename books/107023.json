In a rural corner of England the vagaries of war bring together a group of people wrestling the enemy within--fear, despair, loss of faith.A web of chance... a fateful meeting in a London street... A lost teddy bear... the wrong train... and the lives of four people were altered forever! A shy, middle-aged spinster was to find a new home and fall impossibly in love. An elderly street fiddler, bitter and lonely, was to take an unexpected train ride and encounter kindness from a total stranger. Two frightened children were to escape ther terrors of wartime London and bring dramatic changes to the Castle on the Hill.",
