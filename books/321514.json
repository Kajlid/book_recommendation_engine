  "description": "The saga of the Talisman Bay Shadow Walkers continues in Forsaken Talisman... Other than her name, Skylar has no idea who she is or where she's from. A kidnapper stole her memory, but she knows that the man who rescued her is someone she can trust. Wrapped in Dusty's strong arms, she feels completely safe and ready to create new memories with him. But first she has to convince Dusty to stop being a gentleman... Dusty knows he shouldn't want the mystery woman he'd stolen from the enemy--her very presence could rip the Shadow Walkers apart. But her long legs, soft skin, big silver-blue eyes and sweet-as-sin smile have him ready to throw caution to the wind. In one night of passion, Skylar surrenders herself to Dusty, body, heart and soul. Every touch, every moment they share, convinces her that she's exactly where she's supposed to be. Dusty feels the same, ready and willing to give up life as he knows it to stay with the woman he's so quickly fallen in love with. Everything between them is perfect. Until Skylar gets her memory back... Volume Two of the award-winning Talisman Bay series where all hell breaks loose on a daily basis...especially when you fall in love.",
