  "description": "Rampaging orc armies. Vicious bounty hunters. Hot lady robots. Just another day in the life of Ian the Warlock and his succubus Alaria. On the run from a goblin mob boss, Ian and Alaria travel to a distant land to kill her next ex-master - who just happens to be a gnome. Like the other villains before him, this one plans to make SHORT work of our heroes! (Sorry, bad joke.) In addition to saving themselves, our intrepid duo has to deal with a host of other problems - including steampunk war machines, female elf sex cults, and the end of the world. This is a story featuring naked women, threesomes, kinky sex, demons, warlocks, violence, revenge, and moral quandaries. If you’re an old granny lady who’s going to clutch your pearls every time a woman’s breasts are described or somebody gets naked, this book is not for you.",
