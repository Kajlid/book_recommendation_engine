  "description": "Partners for seven years, Ilsa and Kai are the best Professional Finders in the business. There's nothing they can't track down, no matter how hazardous the path or unfamiliar the star system.  Eleazar Dantes isn't the first client to hire them to locate lost family, but he is the most unpleasant. For double their usual fee, though, Kai and Ilsa will tolerate a lotâ€”even Dantes' insistence that he tag along on the investigation. A high stakes hunt is no time for distractions. When Kai realizes his true feelings for Ilsa, his timing couldn't be worse.  Because as the trail they follow grows more dangerous, Kai and Ilsa begin to doubt they'll find Eleazar's missing daughter alive.",
