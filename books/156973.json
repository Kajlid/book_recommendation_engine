  "description": "An epic fairytale romance set in a semi-fictional ancient world, containing elements of action, adventure, poetry and comedy. The title has a triple meaning: The central character is a renowned beauty - 'the rose of the world' - while the rose flower features heavily in the plot and it also implies that the world rose up. When Ronwind Drake discovers treasures in a distant paradise, a new golden age seems set to begin. But Ella Tundra will find that all which glitters is not gold as she faces many obstacles in her quest for true love.",
