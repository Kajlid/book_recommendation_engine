  "description": "Long before God created the Garden of Eden, there was another, much older garden, where the Seraphim and Cherubim waged war upon each other with such cruelty that God saw fit to destroy his first creation and make a new paradise.Abandoned to rot and decay for countless millennia, only the twisted and malformed dreams of mankind now wander through its poisonous wastelands, trapped like wasps in a jar. But they are not alone. One of the ancient Seraphim survived the wrath of God, and has finally found a way out of his nocturnal prison.Only one man can halt the fallen angel’s trail of bloodlust and slaughter – the very same man who can also hand the Seraphim the key to wiping out mankind. The mean streets of Glasgow are about to become a battleground of a type never seen before.From the author of 1-2-3-4, The Garden of Remembrance, and Carapace.",
