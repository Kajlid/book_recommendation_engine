But after setting aside the assumption she’s gone crazy, Alexia engages in the impossible—she agrees to help the ghost discover who he was and what happened to him. Convinced this mystery is what’s keeping the phantom in the world of the living, Alexia puts her heart on the line to find out what his unfinished business might be.Ultimately, Alexia must decide what’s more important to her—keeping her phantom boyfriend or helping him finally find peace in death. What she didn’t plan on was not having a choice. One of them must move on, but what if neither wants to let go?",
