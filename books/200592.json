  "description": "In this remarkable novel of menace and mystery Pammy and Lyle Wynant are an attractive, modern couple who seem to have it all. Yet behind their \"ideal\" life is a lingering boredom and quiet desperation which leads both of them into separate but equally fatal adventures. And still they remain untouched, \"players\" indifferent to the violence that surrounds them, and that they have helped to create.",
