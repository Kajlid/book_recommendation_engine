  "description": "Monster.\nThat's what they call me. Lock your doors, hold your loved ones tight. The Carver is on the loose. Except I'm not. I was caught. The days of allowing my inner depravity to run wild are over. I've been sent to prison for good, something of a celebrity in this dark, dank hell-hole they call Alabaster Penitentiary. The only thing I have left to offer the world is my story, and unfortunately for me, the Warden has the rest of my life to get it out of me. Being poked and prodded, examined and tested on isn't something I enjoy very much. Until they send him...The new doctor is here to study me and my crimes. And I'm beginning to think we might not be as different as it seems. He craves knowledge the way I crave the blood of my victims. Despite his robotic nature, there's just something about him... Something I want. But I'll have to be careful not to smother it to death. After all... It's kind of my thing. ** Brainwashed is a dark MM doctor-patient romance with content that may be disturbing/triggering to some readers. Our protagonist is a sociopath. Please proceed with caution. While this story follows a new couple, it is strongly recommended to read Volumes 1-2 first, to avoid spoilers. **",
