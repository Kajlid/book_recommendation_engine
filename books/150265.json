The quiet small town of Iron City is just what she needs to get her life in order and learn to stand on her own. No men needed! Unfortunately, disaster follows her. Unable to let her go, her abusive, cheating, ex- fiancé finds his way to the U.P. and sets out to make Clare’s life more of a living hell then he’d done in the past. Additionally, Clare’s involvement with the Fire Chief, aka, town player, lands her in a world of trouble with his ring of female admirers, sending her on a dangerously chaotic adventure including murder and kidnapping. Will Clare be able to survive the deceptively peaceful Iron City?",
