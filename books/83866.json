  "description": "David Clement-Davies's novel transports teen readers back to the days of Richard the Lionheart's medieval crusade. Young Rhodri Falcon and his Crusader father become entangled not only in a war of religious zealotry but also in the schemes of a seductive sorceress who literally steals men's hearts. The author of Fire Bringer and The Sight weaves an Arthurian fantasy in which heroes can be undone by both swords and evil magic. A fascinating departure for a master of fantasy.",
