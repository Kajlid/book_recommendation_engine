  "description": "Eleven inspirational fairytales for children and the child in all of us. Each Princess embarks on an adventure of self-discovery and along the way learns the importance of trust, devotion, courage and the power of love. Originally told by a father to his young daughter, these new classic tales transport children to a time and place where they become the heroes of their own making, creating their own happy endings. Every delicate pen and ink illustration reflects the classic fairy tale drawings of the late 19th century. The Princess Fables is the winner of numerous awards including Best Children's Book at The Beach Book Festival and The Great Midwest Book Festival, along with a Silver Medal for Best Illustrations in Children's Fiction at the Global Ebook Awards. The paperback and Kindle editions are both Amazon #1 Best Sellers.",
