At first he wants nothing more than her blood, but after fighting for possession of her, his appetites take a decidedly carnal turn. In his arms, she finds the answer to a question she didn't know she should ask. What happens when an Impure Vimpyr and an Impure Terran join forces to fight the new exotic weapons dealers? It is a tale written in flesh and blood.",
