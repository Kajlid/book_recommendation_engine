A marriage.

Sabar conjures their big-city love stories in novel-like detail, drawing us into the hearts of strangers just as their lives are about to change forever.In setting the stage for these surprising, funny, and moving tales, Sabar, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Awards, offers a fascinating look at the role of place in how--and whether--people meet and fall in love.",
