  "title": "Almost Famous",
  "description": "The screenplay of the brilliant new film about rock 'n' roll journalism, from the writer/director of Jerry Maguire.Inspired by his own start in journalism as a teenage reporter for Rolling Stone, Cameron Crowe has created a coming-of-age story that is both funny and moving—and laced with sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll. Set in 1973 and starring Frances McDormand, Billy Crudup, and Noah Taylor, Crowe's new film tells the story of a fifteen-year-old boy whose dream of becoming a rock journalist comes true when Rolling Stone sends him on tour with the up-and-coming rock band Stillwater—loosely based on Led Zeppelin—over the objections of his protective mother. Crowe brings the same wry humor he brought to Jerry Maguire as well as the brilliant evocations of teen life that animated his earlier cult film Fast Times at Ridgemont High to chronicle and celebrate a pivotal moment in rock history—and one teenage boy's place in it.",
