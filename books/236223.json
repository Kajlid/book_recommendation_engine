  "description": "Teaching the lionesses selected for the Royal Harem how to please their king is a time-honored tradition that has served the shifters of Ironhaven well for over a thousand years, and, as luck would have it, the Saint John brothers love their work. But when they’re called upon to tutor auburn-haired Anaya Eldrich in the ways of seduction, all four brothers quickly realize that they don’t want to let her go. As their bonds strengthen and whispers of a dark secret run rampant through the palace, will the Saint John brothers turn her over to their king or will her tutors become her guardians, laying down their very lives to protect her?",
