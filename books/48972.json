  "description": "Despite the success of his first soul chasing mission, Dexter Blackwell finds himself back in the Accounts Receivable department at Hades Correctional, answering to Mr. Belial, the demon boss from hell.So when a strike at the Soul Pursuit and Apprehension Agency (SPAA) gives him the chance to reprise his role as Agent Johnny Black, Dexter jumps at it.This time he's tracking the hedonistic Roman General Tullius Bacchus to 44 B.C. But right from the start there are problems. After ending up in the wrong body, being hailed as a god, thrown into the arena against a seven-foot-tall barbarian and being seduced by Mark Antony's wife, you'd think that Johnny Black has enough on his plate.Not even close. He still has to contend with traitorous senators who want him to help them murder Caesar, a megalomanic Roman emperor reincarnated as a blind beggar, rival soul chasers, a determined money lender, and Pandora Jain, the most beautiful woman in the known universes who also happens to be a duplicitous, conniving bitch. And then, of course, there's Jitterbug, Johnny's not so helpful imp sidekick, who is determined to drink his way through every tavern in Rome, while bemoaning the loss of his bobbit. Johnny Black, Gladiator is the second book in the Johnny Black, Soul Chaser series, and takes us from ancient Rome to the depths of hell in a genre-bending adventure that is as hilarious as it is thrilling.
