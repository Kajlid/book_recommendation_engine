  "description": "A party in a college flat in May 2001. A case of dodgy home-brewed beer. A violent storm. Next day: the mother of all hangovers. What would you do if you the morning after the night before brought a banging head, a raging thirst… Oh, and your very own superpower?Meet the All-Stars: Harriet (invisibility), Charlie (the ability to read minds), Caroline (flight), Mary-Beth(super-strength) and Jack (faster than a speeding… well, you know).

And all the while the clock ticks down to one day in September 2001...",
