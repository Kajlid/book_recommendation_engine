  "description": "\"Here is yet another cookbook that can stand among the best reference works. I suspect it's a harbinger of kindred books to come as publishers begin to respond to a growing audience of cook-readers who hunger for connected, nuanced, reliably researched information..\" --Gourmet Magazine \"James Peterson has done for sauces that which Escoffier did for the cuisine of La Belle Epoque.. Sauces is a manual for the professional cook and, as such, it will rapidly become a classic and indispensable reference..\" --Richard Olney, From the Foreword \"It's the single contemporary reference on the subject that is both comprehensive and comprehensible. I love Jim's recipes (and there are gems all over the place here), but what's special about Sauces is the It reads so well that this is the kind of book you can take to bed.\" --Mark Bittman, From the Foreword \"This is a book I wish I had written myself.. Every few decades a book is written that says all there is to say on a subject, or has all the information and passion that sets the standard for professional and amateurs alike. Sauces is one of the best culinary books of this century in English..\" --Jeremiah Tower, Stars Restaurant \"The art of sauce making is the cornerstone of serious cooking. This book is a must for the new generation of creative cooks who wish to build on the classical French foundation with contemporary, delicious variations.\" --Daniel Boulud, Daniel \"It is a special reference book--comprehensive and inspiring..\" --Alice Waters, Chez Panisse",
