But if opposites attract, maybe itâ€™s the differences between them that make it worth the fight.Brent Kelly is a laid-back tradesman whose only concerns are drinks with friends and which man to bed next. In need of a new accountant to sort out his nightmarish shoebox of tax receipts, he's referred to Logan Willis.He doesn't expect to be intrigued by the science fiction-loving, geeky guy with dark-rimmed glasses and a TARDIS blue shirt. So his fascination with the soft-spoken Englishman surprises him, and their mutual attraction is completely unexpected.

But in this opposites-attract erotic drama, maybe it's the differences between them that make staying together worth the fight.",
