She's surrounded by people and completely alone. It's the way she likes it. Men are fun – nothing of substance going on there.

Clair is researching the unsolved case for a college criminology paper. She meets a friendly local girl and teams up with her cute brother for a bit of sexy fun and to snoop on the widow. Secrets long buried come back to life – their key unlocking more than our unsuspecting heroine could have ever imagined.  Secret of the Widow Mulvane: Clair & David is the 2nd in a five book series of powerful stand-alone mysteries with strong romantic persuasion. You will find the dual plots quite balanced. Fans of either genre have plenty to delve into here.  Erotic content - adults only reading.",
