  "description": "Traitor… Liar… That’s what they call me. No one believes me. Not even my team. I know it’s up to me to get the answers. To stop the corruption and unlock my memories. I’ll do anything to get them back. Even if my hands will be covered in blood.Elsa's every move is scrutinized. She’s labeled a traitor by those she sought for protection, and kept from her family and team. Regaining memories has been a slow process. Too slow for the Council's liking, taking matters into their own hands. The new captain has history with Elsa and operates with a hidden agenda. Even Elsa’s team reacts differently toward her. If only she could unlock her memories. Everything is playing right into Alexander's hand, even amassing an army with unconventional methods, designed to annihilate the Nepherium---starting with Noah. Elsa will do anything to stop Alexander ... even kill.",
