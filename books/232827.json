  "description": "A battle fought. A war lost. A world thrust into darkness... Adopted twins DeeDee and Wendy Areion woke on their 18th birthday expecting an epic party. Instead, evil invades their happy day in the form of creatures straight out of their worst nightmares. The beasts bring with them a startling truth, that the girls are descendants of a land of ancient magic called Gaai. Once a peaceful and thriving land, Gaai has been enslaved by a powerful enemy. Their only hope of liberation lies in a long lost prophecy of four sets of twins raised far from the darkness that would be the key to Gaai's salvation. Alliances will be struck. Hidden truths revealed. But when the dusts of war settle, will their efforts be enough to win their freedom?",
