  "description": "Adam Fluke is a regular guy. He wants love, friendship, and happiness. However, his bumbling-but-good-natured tendencies have left him lacking direction in life. Content with his lack of motivation, he earns a meager living as a pizza delivery boy. Everything changes one night, though, on a medium cheese pizza delivery to Sara DuBeau. Sara is interesting, intellectual, fun, and successful: everything Adam believes he is not. An unexpected, whirlwind relationship begins, and it's a match made in heaven. Or is it? Their storybook happiness is called into question by the discovery of a mysterious, buried-away photograph of a man with an uncanny resemblance to Adam. Secrets are revealed, the search for answers begins, and Adam's very identity is suddenly the one thing that could tear them apart.",
