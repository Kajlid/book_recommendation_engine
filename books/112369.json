  "description": "Luke has almost nothing…no job, no apartment, no stability. His life consists of off-the-books jobs and crashing on the couches of buddies who’ll take him in spite of his screaming PTSD nightmares. He wouldn’t even care about his lack of stability except for one reason: when he comes home from his tour in Afghanistan, Luke is surprised to find he has a two-year-old daughter. He instantly wants to take care of his little girl and protect her from her party-hungry mother. He just has no idea how.Through luck and circumstance, Luke begins fight-training with Marcus Walker, Atlanta’s top MMA fighter. With a proper outlet for his rage and physical tension, Luke pulls his life together one small piece at a time. It’s not until he meets Jennalyn Roche, however, that he understands love, peace, and hope. With the influence of good friends and the woman he calls his angel, even scars as deep as his may heal.",
