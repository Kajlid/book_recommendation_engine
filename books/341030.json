  "description": "The Beast of Rose HillThe Victorian splendor of the Sedleys' manor was a startling incongruity next to its half-naked heiress, but Julian was not surprised; he'd heard rumors of Anya's behavior since her shipwreck with pirates in the Caribbean. The young woman had been made a deity—a love goddess, no less!—by a tribe out there, and changed. She had returned an animal: lusty and domineering with no restraint at all. Yet if he were to tame her, he'd hold the key to his dreams.& De ButyAnya found herself grateful. The suitor her grandmother had provided—the next man to attempt to reform her, to break her to polite North Carolina society—lived up to his name. He was a beauty. But he also claimed celibacy was the way to productivity and health! The man was sick—even if he did have a good heart. Well, Anya had the cure. She would marry him, let him go about changing her...then, when Julian least expected it, she'd show him just how wild she really was.",
