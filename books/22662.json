  "title": "Enchanted Caravan",
  "description": "This book looks younger than the text actually is- so watch out in placing it with appreciative readers for it's an unusual story and demands unusual appreciation and presentation. There is quite definitely an element of magic, much more adult and elusive than fairy tale magic, but there all the same. It concerns five lonely people who are thrown into intimate relationship by an odd set of circumstances, and live and work together through a wonderful summer in an odd shabby old caravan. Through the happenings of that summer, they find themselves. There are two romances,- one a mature love story which is ready to ripen into marriage as the story ends, the other a teen age romance with fulfilment in the future. All in all, it is the type of story Junior High and even some High School students really want and need (and young adults wont find it below their interest level either). (Kirkus Reviews)",
