  "description": "Jaxson Adronatof had vowed as a child that she would spend her life hunting the evil that had slaughtered her parents and help those like her, who were different. For 15 years, she’d been the leader of a resistance force and one stubborn, arrogant and frustratingly gorgeous alien claiming she’s his mate isn’t going to deter her from that vow.  Especially when being a mate to these guys meant being kept pregnant and out of danger. No matter how much she’s drawn to him; Jax is determined to fight her feelings and stay as far away from the mate business as possible.  For 1400 years, Reven Debreskii had resigned himself to a life of loneliness. As a hardened Valendran military commander, second only to Ivint Torenson, Reven was used to his commands being followed without question. So when he tells Jax that she’s his mate, he’s perplexed and frustrated when she not only doesn’t listen to him, she does her best to ignore him at every turn.  However, fate did not bring Reven to Earth solely so he could be tortured by a mate he couldn’t claim. With neither one prepared to give an inch to the other in their battle of wills, they will be thrown together for a fight neither expected, but neither is willing to lose.  As two young lives rest in the hands of the stubborn, seasoned warriors, they will all have to learn to trust and compromise or none of them will make it out alive.",
