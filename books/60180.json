  "description": "When former blacksmith Corin Drey finds himself lying on his back in the midst of Orthin's Wood, he cannot imagine what has happened. The last thing he remembers is searching for Thom Blaire's wife-one of the disappeared. As he slowly sits up and looks around, he sees dead soldiers hanging from trees and other bodies scattered about the burnt forest floor. Corin knows he must find his way home-but how? Seventeen-year-old Kara Kinfolk has an old soul. Her small town of Arrow's Flight is idyllic and quiet. But when travelers and residents start to vanish, no one appears interested in finding them. Worse yet are the nightmares, the voices that whisper to her from the shadows, and the dark house at the center of town where secret rituals are performed. Now the house, which possesses powers that prevent anyone from entering or leaving town, has begun to desire Kara for reasons she cannot comprehend. Kara knows she must flee Arrow's Flight-but how? As Kara sets out on a quest to quell an ancient evil, she must rely on Corin and a stranger to help her follow a maze of clues that she hopes will lead to an escape-before it is too late.",
