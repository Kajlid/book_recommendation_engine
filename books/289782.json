  "description": "ALMOST HUMAN ~ The First TrilogyIn this paranormal fantasy, chapters alternate perspective between a vampire and a young woman, as they join an ensemble cast of characters to navigate difficulties of addiction and desire; perils of zombies and vampires; and struggles with abuse, morality and... college.Volume 2: Lost ReflectionsFelicity has helped her friends to escape the venomous vixen Sindy, but cannot divine the motives of Cain, the vampire who captured first her gratitude, and then her heart.She finds the historical account of Cain’s past enthralling and frightening. Now she must determine whether the addictive venom in Cain’s kiss is clouding her judgment, and if his thirst for her blood is a driving force too strong for their love to conquer. It’s difficult to contemplate such questions while under the attack of a vengeful vampire and his zombie slaves. Felicity’s heart has already been lost to Cain; will she lose her life as well? *ALMOST HUMAN is a series of successive trilogies, not stand-alone books. Each trilogy is self-contained enough to be read alone as a 3 book set, but the story unfolds chronologically, and the characters do continue from one trilogy to the next. Main storyline closure is in each 3rd book, but there are also story-ties leading from one trilogy to the next in the series.",
