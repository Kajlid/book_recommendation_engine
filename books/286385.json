  "description": "Within my body are all the sacred places of the world,\" the Buddhist saint Saraha once said, \"and the most profound pilgrimage that I can ever make is within my own body.\" For fi fteen centuries, the realized masters of the Tantric path used the crucible of their own lives to develop an accelerated means to enlightenment that remains alive today within the vajrayana (or \"indestructible vehicle\") of Tibetan Buddhism. With Buddhist Tantra, Reginald A. Ray introduces you to this powerful path to \"naked and unprecedented experience.\" The word tantra means \"to weave through,\" a metaphor that points to the vibrant fabric of intelligent and living energies that are the fi nal and most basic reality of our bodies, our inner life of thoughts, feelings, and intuitions, and the external world. Through nine CDs of specifi c teachings and guided meditations designed to open your body and mind, you are invited to glimpse a wondrous realm of reality known as the \"vajra world\"-a vibrant fabric of intelligent and living energies that make up the essence of every cell in your body, every fl eeting thought you have, and every particle of the universe. If you have been seeking a gateway to this potent tradition, Buddhist Tantra is an ideal opportunity to approach the temple of its deepest truths.",
