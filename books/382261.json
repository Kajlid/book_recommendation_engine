  "description": "Pictures to feel as well as to see while your hear or read the story from Eric Carle, creator of The Very Hungry Caterpillar.Early one morning aa little spider begins to spin her web on a fence post. One by one, the animals of the nearby farm try to divert her, each in its own way, but the busy little spider keeps patiently at her work. And finally she gets a chance to show that her web is not only very beautiful, but also very useful.In this multi-sensory book, children can feel the pictures as well as see them, while they hear or read the easy, rhythmic text. Added to the visual excitement of Eric Carle's vibrant collages of familiar animals is the tactile experience of feeling the spider's web as it grows from a simple line into a complex and beautiful creation. The rhythmic, repetitive text is easily learned and is ideal for use with groups of children as a voice-and-response game, a prelude to learning to read. Listening to the story, children will also learn the typical sounds made by each of the various animals, the animal's name, and something characteristic about it.A new concept in picture-books, this is perfect for reading aloud and sharing with visually-handicapped as well as sighted children. And all small readers and listeners will rejoice to discover that even the tiny, humble spider has an important role to play in nature's scheme of things.Edition MSRP: $21⁹⁹ USA / $31⁰⁰ CAN (9780399211669)",
