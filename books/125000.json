  "description": "[Siren Menage Everlasting: Erotic Cowboy Menage a Trois Romance, M/F/M, HEA] Soon to be homeless, Billy Jean Simmons swallows her fear of horses to accept a position as chef at a guest ranch in Montana. Laramie and Laredo Marshall don't know what hit them when they get a taste of her cooking. What's an amazing chef like her doing out in the wilds of Montana? While Laredo believes they should be concentrating on getting the ranch up and running instead of flirting, his brother is convinced they can do both. It doesn't take long for Laredo to climb onboard with his brother to woo Billy Jean into their arms. But there's something going on with their sensuous chef. She's got a secret and they're determined to coax it out of her. A little PTSD and a world of misunderstanding lands the brothers in a pot of boiling water where Billy Jean is concerned. It might take two to tango, but three can work things out if they will just take the time to listen. **A Siren Erotic Romance",
