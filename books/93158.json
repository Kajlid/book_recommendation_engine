  "title": "In Recesses of Being: Romantic, Philosophical, Moral and Ethical Reflections",
  "description": "The book is a collection of artistic stories and topical political articles and tracts. The author tries to demonstrate versatility of life in a special unity of man and nature. Here are reflected the author's views on intimacy of the bee and the wild flower, on pernicious influence of regional, local wars, as well as reflections about bright ideas of democracy, freedom, and human rights, dimming and paling against the background of ambitious politicians' activities. We hope the author's viewpoints will be interesting to a wide circle of readers too.",
