  "title": "Churchill’S Desert Rats in North Africa and Italy",
  "description": "This well researched and well written book covers the early campaigns and battles that earned The Desert Rats their fame and name.This volume covers the difficult early years when ultimate victory was less than certain. The Nazis were victorious on many fronts and Britain stood alone. Indeed it was at El Alamein that 7 Armoured Division and the rest of Montgomery’s Eighth Army turned the tide. The church bells rang out in Britain and a new spirit was born. But much fighting lay ahead and many were to die. The successful completion of the North African campaign led to the invasion of Sicily and the long slog up Italy.The Desert Rats were at the forefront of these campaigns. Three Victoria Crosses were won in the desert and many famous names were associated with the Division, such as Field Marshal Lord Carver and Major General Pip Roberts.The Division’s story is told by many first hand contributions and is the result of painstaking research by the author who was also a ‘Desert Rat’.",
