  "description": "Tallant is an elf astray—he's been disowned by his family, has dared to battle bond with a human, and has no desire to ever see his homeland again. He is, in fact, vastly more excited to finally be seeing the home his battle-bonded, Milton, is finally returning to after twelve years of exile.  But instead of the joyful place Milton spoke endlessly of, they find a land rife with deadly dragons, where fifteen women have gone missing, including Irene, the woman Milton loves.  Even Milton's brother, Cecil, is not what he used to be. Instead of the scholar Milton talked about, Cecil is a hardened soldier who keeps company with thieves. He is also beautiful and intriguing—but contemptuous of Milton and Tallant. Worse, he's also married to Irene, making it clear that Milton and Tallant have arrived far too late to matter.  Author's Note: This story was first published by Less Than Three Press in Fairytales Slashed Volume Three. It has not been significantly changed for re-release.",
