  "description": "From the author of the comedy, \"Five-Star FLEECING,\" comes a parody about online dating that'll make you gasp in laughter and horror at the same time: eDating the Old School Way. Clear, concise and scathing, eDating the Old School Way hysterically cuts to the core and introduces the parade of characters who populate internet dating sites, e.g., catfish, Damaged Goods, the Crazy Lady, zombies and escorts. Novices as well as jaded online dating enthusiasts learn the ins and outs while navigating the tangled web en route to romance.",
