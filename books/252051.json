  "description": "Here are the dreams of all children, worlds of fantasy, humor, terror, and grand adventure. It was the greatest comic strip of its day, perhaps the greatest of all time, acclaimed the world over for its artistic majesty, unbounded imagination, and ground-breaking techniques that helped define a new art form. But since its debut 100 years ago, it has been all but impossible to view these masterpieces in their original size and colors.LITTLE NEMO IN SLUMBERLAND...can now be seen as creator Winsor McCay intended: full broadsheet-sized and with glorious colors. The digitally-restored prints presented in incredible detail displaying the superb draftsmanship of the prolific McCay. Enjoy the Sunday morning experience shared by millions a century ago. Again, for the first time.",
