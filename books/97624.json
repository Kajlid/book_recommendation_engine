  "description": "Demonkind and humankind have lived side-by-side for centuries.  Not that Savannah would know it. She’s never even met one of the regal, beautiful, mysterious demons who for some reason a few months ago flocked to St. Louis where she lives. Sure, her mother is one, her father obviously had a thing with one, and her best (and only) friend is obsessed with them. But demons don’t look twice at a lowly half-caste like her.Until three handsome demons walk into her father’s bookstore and Savvy discovers she is the reason so many demons suddenly moved to the Midwest.Once content being ignored, never meeting the mother who abandoned her and never understanding why she didn’t look or feel normal, Savvy is thrust into the complicated demon world where her mother is now Royal, making Savannah royalty too.At least there was a gorgeous, brooding demon who made her feel a way she didn’t even know she could feel supporting her along the way. Maybe being half demon has its perks after all.",
