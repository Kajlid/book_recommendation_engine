My father’s headed to prison. A zombie apocalypse is imminent. And now a mind-reading sociopath has my identity… and plans to use it against me.But it’s still all fun and games until my mother gets abducted. Now I have to find who took her, and stop them from killing her. All before the entire city is dragged halfway to hell…Could be worse.",
