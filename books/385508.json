  "description": "Rod Serling became a cultural icon of the 20th Century with his creation 'The Twilight Zone, ' which more than 50 years later was nominated by the Writers Guild of America as the third best written television series of the past seventy years. Of the 156 Twilight Zone episodes, Serling wrote 92. In the early 1960s, Rod Serling, novelized nineteen (19) of his scripts and published them in three volumes - this is the first. In this volume, you will read about a baseball pitcher with magical powers; a self-centered hypochondriac; a nostalgic journey back to childhood; a self-righteous domineering husband getting his comeuppance; the panic of a man with no memory finding himself alone in an empty town; and the destructive combination of fear and mob mentality.",
