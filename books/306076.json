  "description": "One feisty red-head. One stubborn Scot. One meeting to change their life forever.When Richie Campbell arrived in Pretoria, he had a reputation a mile long. The Flying Scotsman had no choice to leave Scotland since he was left in the cold after yet another brawl with a member of the British press. Pretoria was far away, and Richie hoped to find peace and to be able to enjoy his rugby again. What Richie hadn’t expected was to meet his Scottish teammate’s sister in Pretoria and to fall head over heels in love. Not that it helped. It seemed that Sarah Mackay was immune.Sarah had two rules. One: never date a client. Two: never date a professional sportsman. They have way too much testosterone. She knew as she had been on the receiving end twice. Sarah added one more nickname to Richie’s repertoire: Wrecking Ball. Getting involved with Richie will spell disaster. But for how long could Sarah resist his charm, especially when she learned his secrets? And was Richie’s Nan right? Did things happen for a reason?",
