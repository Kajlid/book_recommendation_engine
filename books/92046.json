  "description": "Natalie is consumed with her love for Tanner, and his ability to guide her sexually. Yet, her obsession goes deeper than she ever imagined, and his possessiveness threatens to smother her. In this story, you can follow Natalie through her ever growing passion, and deepening love of the only man she’ll ever want.“Could Natalie even hope that Tanner would make more of a commitment, or did she want him to? Her head spun with the emotion, but she couldn’t allow herself to think long term. For now, she wanted every crazy second he could give her, knowing that if he left, she’d never be able to recover. She was sure of that. She was in dangerous water, and was all too aware of it. She was losing touch.”",
