  "description": "\"Into the best-laid plans a little chaos must fall \"\"Granite Lake Wolves, Book 5\"Jared s not sure how his quiet morning coffee near the harbour ended with him on a cruise ship impersonating one of his pack mates. Well, it might have something to do with a woman, but who can blame him? The female of the species was made to love, and he s more than willing to share his considerable skills in that area. Especially since he figures the chances of meeting his own one-and-only are slim.Keri Smith is positive the last-minute recruit sneaking aboard the Arctic Wolf Cruise Lines tour is her mate. Ix-nay on confirming that, though, at least for the next ten days. She s promised her best friend to be overall troubleshooter for the shifter-only cruise. Getting tangled up in mating lust would reduce her skills to nil. Avoidance of the sexy wolf for the duration of the cruise, followed by jumping his bones, seems the logical solution.But when libidos are on the line, logic and wolves don t go together. Throw in suspicions of wrongdoing, and these two virtual strangers will need a lot more than luck to find their way through to forever.Warning: Really? You need to be warned about the hot nookie and sarcasm? Yeah, it s in here. Also colourful cat shifters, lupine royalty, and wild adventures in cabins like you ve never seen before. \"",
