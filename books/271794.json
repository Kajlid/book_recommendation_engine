The flames between them continue to rage, adding a complexity to their relationship that neither of them quite knows how to handle...or resist.  Jack makes concessions in order to keep Jessie in his life and in his bed, but he’s holding back. He’s not sure he can follow through on the commitment that she needs. Jessie struggles to overcome her insecurities when Jack’s past won’t leave them alone.  Just when it seems that they might finally be on the same page, old doubts surface, making them question whether or not they can ever make it work.  An unexpected separation forces them both to contemplate a world without the other, and a secret between them threatens to tear them apart- this time for good.  Where there’s fire, something always gets consumed... ​ This story contains sexually explicit scenes and is intended only for readers 18+ who enjoy erotic, no-rules love stories.
