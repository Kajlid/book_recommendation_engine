  "description": "When Sophie Hill came across the book Does God LOL? she pondered if this was a confirmation.A friend of hers seemed so eager to know what happens when God LOLs that she asked Sophie to share it by writing how Chloe came to the knowledge.To collaborate with Chloe - who envied the dead, for \"they do not have to bite their tongue or respect culture etiquette\" - seemed laughable and not in a humorous way. Her writing had been an outlet for recording observations and connecting dots.It was when Chloe asked her, \"Can the last domino in the 'Domino Effect' question 'Who started the chain of fall and when?\" that Sophie considered at least lending her an ear. As the song says, That's what friends are for.Things were overlapping with her observations. \"Who knows,\" she thought. \"I must've been given this gift for such a time as this - to share Chloe's understanding of what we see here on Earth when God LOLs.\"",
