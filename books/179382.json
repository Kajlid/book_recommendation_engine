When Ihana discovers the pond that the dancing salmon call home, she also meets their caretaker- Flynt. But Flynt looks so thin, and so hungry, and Ihana doesn't understand why he won't just eat the dancing salmon that live in the pond beside his cabin. With a little push from Flynt, Ihana embarks on an adventure to discover the purpose of the dancing salmon, and why Flynt could never feast upon one.",
