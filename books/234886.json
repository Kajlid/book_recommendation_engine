  "description": "Sassy, dramatic, hot-headed are just some of the words used to describe me since the time I was born. A few little mishaps growing up and my mom has a running ‘Emerson Baker’ prayer circle, and I have the reputation of a spit-fire that won’t go away.I prefer the terms loyal, passionate, fiery, and possibly a bit impulsive. So when my best friend proposes the concept of starting our own business, I jump on the idea. CHEATERS BEWARE!That should be our motto… because your secrets can’t stay hidden for long with Trixsters Anonymous on the case.We are the moonlighting duo hell-bent on helping those who suspect their lovers are cheating. We’re professional, careful, and completely anonymous…What could possibly go wrong? Walker Scott… that’s what goes wrong. I never stood a chance against the gorgeous, hazel-eyed, fiercely determined man who storms into my life and completely blindsides me. He’s the proof that opposites attract—and when they do, the chemistry is explosive. Did I mention he’s also a detective? A very, very, talented detective? Pretty soon being a Trixster is a lot more complicated.",
