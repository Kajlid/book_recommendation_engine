  "description": "Andrew Martin has been alone since the day he was born. When his short time with his foster mother comes to an abrupt end, he loses the only family he has ever known. Moving to a new town in search of a better life seemed like the obvious thing to do, but Andy soon learns that every rose has a thorn. CONTENT CAUTION: This book contains an atypical HEA and is not a romance title. It is drama/horror and contains references to rape, abduction, abuse, and graphic violence. Not for the faint at heart.",
