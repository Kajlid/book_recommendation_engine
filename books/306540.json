I would be the bridge to his real enemies. I can’t let myself forget that he isn’t the hero of this story. His hands are covered in blood. I saw that with my own eyes. CristianoI thought I knew Scarlett’s past, but I didn’t know anything. I thought I knew the worst of monsters, but I hadn’t seen anything yet. Sometimes you have to lie to yourself to survive. Sometimes it’s those closest to you who will bury their knives in your back. Too many times it’s the innocents who pay for your mistakes. For your refusal to see.I can’t let Scarlett pay for mine.But I may be too late to stop it.",
