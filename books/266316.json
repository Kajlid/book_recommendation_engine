  "description": "I grew up in the dark.Right and wrong?In my world, it was kill or be killed.I spend my time in the shadows; doing what I want, when I want. I refuse to follow anyone's rulesâ€”I own this town. They might not see me, but my club controls everything... including her. I took Daddy's little princess and defiled her to send a message. Now, I want to keep her down here in the dirt forever.She's crazy not to run.Around here, there's no right or wrong. I'm the judge, jury, and executioner and god help any fool who tries to lay a hand on what's mine. If you're looking for a hero, you're in the wrong place. Please be aware that Deserter is not recommended for readers under the age of eighteen, as it contains strong language, sexual situations, drug use, and graphic violence.",
