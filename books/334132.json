More importantly, I should be a chef, not a damn bartender.Hereâ€™s the thing: I can create the most decadent desserts from scratch, but mixing cocktails is a totally different story.So when she sauntered into the bar with her flowing red hair and asked for something strong with her heart-stopping smile, I served up my best.I didn't expect that one cocktail to make me question all my plans.Then she said it would be perfect paired with cheesecake. Now I need to make her mine over dessert... and so much more.But then I got the call I had been waiting for and now I have to make a choice.Bitter Bartender is romantic comedy that is part of the Cocky Hero World and features characters from the Man Card series.",
