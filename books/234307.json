  "description": "Book two of Cyborg Shifters, same universe as the Stranded in the Stars series, every book is a standalone that only subtly builds off of the others.Everybody feared the man with the metal band over his mouth. Stryker was part of an elite group of Cyborgs genetically enhanced with inhuman DNA. He was known as the Creeper, the quiet, the man with half a face. His fate was his own and his freedom hard-earned, having nothing to live for but the hunt and his perfect record. Until he received a distress call that changed his bleak existence. “Please, oh god, please. Is anybody out there? This is Norah Lee, a scientist of Earth. I-I don’t know what to do. I think everybody...everyone is dead. Please if you hear this, please help us. I can hear them outside. They’re coming… I don’t want to die.” Warning: mature readers only, explicit sex scenes, horror elements",
