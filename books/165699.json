Joe was the embodiment of all women’s tall, dark, handsome, and a little kinky in the bedroom. Best of all, he liked his women curvy. Elsa could never shake the feeling she didn’t quite deserve him but counted her blessings….until a lifetime of bad habits caught up to her. When Elsa is diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, her life as she knew it was over. Would Joe stand by her side or would her new reality tear them apart?",
