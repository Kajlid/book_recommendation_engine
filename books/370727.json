  "description": "\"A happy little elephant was dancing through the jungle ... But whenever he went one-two-three, his big feet pounded so that they shook the whole jungle...\"\nAfter a parrot makes fun of Sooki's big ears, long nose, and wrinkled skin, the \"Saggy Baggy\" elephant isn't all too sure of himself. But once he meets some beautiful creatures who look just like him, Sooki celebrates with a joyful \"one-two-three-kick.\"For over 50 years, parents and children have treasured this tale, with gorgeous art by Gustaf Tenggren, the illustrator of The Poky Little Puppy.",
