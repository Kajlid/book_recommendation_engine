  "description": "The Anasazi whispered of his evil and of the woman who could defeat it. Fire, sky, and stone must unite to fulfill an ancient prophecy. Madison Evans inherits a turquoise locket, travels to New Mexico, and discovers the stone dates back to the Chacoan Anasazi. When she's attacked, parks ranger Lonan Stone, of Chacoan ancestry, fears Madison's turquoise is a missing twin of the revered Fallen Skystone, an egg size piece of turquoise on display in Albuquerque. The mystical stone is missing two slivers - one's in Madison's necklace, the others whereabouts unknown, but if united by evil they can destroy. Madison and Lonan are part of a 1000 year old prophecy to save Chaco Canyon. Thrust back in time, they meet a witch, solve a murder, fall in love, and imprison a 1000 year old evil spirit. Their mission complete, can these two people from different cultures blend their lives as the prophecy predicted?Although this is a standalone, you might first enjoy reading its companion book, My Heart Will Find Yours.",
