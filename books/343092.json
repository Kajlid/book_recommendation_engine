  "description": "His life littered with the women he's used--including a dead hooker he'd planned on marrying--Chip Davis is ready to move on. A blue eyed teenage wonder has found her way into his life, and he intends to run with her at full speed towards happiness. He knows she's the one, and nothing is going to keep him from holding onto her; not a dead friend, a missing brother, a kidnapped son, or a father whose sudden choice to explore the darker side of his employment will turn him away. Nothing except for his own demons, and, perhaps, the truth.Charybdis, the well received first novel of writer K.A. Thompson, is the first book in the Charybdis Novels series, which includes As Simple As That and critically acclaimed Finding Father Rabbit.",
