  "description": "Getting accidentally pregnant is never a good thing, especially when you are seventeen years old. And it doesn’t help if your mother is a pastor at one of the biggest churches in your city… For Janelle, getting kicked out of her parent’s house was one of the best things that happened. For most teenagers, the opportunity to live away from your parents, with a rich aunt, sounds like heaven. It was heaven.. until Janelle found out her aunt had her own issues. Between adapting to a new city, and having her aunt as her new guardian, heaven could quickly turn into hell.",
