  "description": "In the 5th century BC Greek philosopher Anaxagoras hypothesis on life is very radical. He presents the case for panspermia; which is the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe, distributed by meteoroids, asteroids, comets and planetoids. Remarkable for an ancient right? What if he was just sharing what he already knew to be true? What if he was a descendant of such life spreading molecules?There is so much to say, and even more to regret. If I were to tell you that you are not of this planet and that your true origins lie in a galaxy far away what would you do? What if I were to tell you that your Gods were men? What if everything you ever knew about your world, your faith, and your reality were all not of this realm? That your meager existence is predicated on the happenstance of an exploding moon, that became a comet, that smashed into Mars and later your planet some 700 million years ago.My name is Zion Rivers and my time here is ending. I have traveled this planet for over 300 years in search of members of our dying race. There is none after me for I am the last in a long line of Feira Grandmasters given the task to unite these direct descendants in a call to action against evil one last time. Intriguing is it not?These are the stories that launched Are there no more Dragon Warriors and Better Off Dead.",
