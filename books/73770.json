  "description": "Matchmakers come in all sizes and shapes and in the case of this Christian romantic-comedy the little (and big) arbitrators come with tails. Brutus, a Great Dane could have gotten hurt most anywhere in the Dog Park, but his owner, Matt puts the blame on a peppy little Welsh Pembroke corgi named Bamboo, and her feisty master Lynne, who happens to be very attractive. These two pet-owners do not get off to a good start, yet they canâ€™t deny that there is a spark between them. Can a Great Dane and a wild little corgi join forces to convince their owners to be friends and to forgive and forget?",
