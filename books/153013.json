  "description": "The Wait, Brittâ€™s undoing Ethan Radcliff Blurb: Mack Hargrove never waited for anything. He was an impatient man. When he met Britt England he wasn't sure what to make of the pretty blonde. She came across as too self-assured and confident. Mack liked his women, needy, submissive and well trained sexually.  It was rumored that the twenty eight year old was untried a virgin. That piqued Mack's curiosity and burned at his brain; he hadn't a challenge in years when it came to women.  He turned on the charm and sought out Britt only to find she'd make him play the waiting game. He'd turn the tables; he'd take what he wanted and walk away. He thought he'd won.  The wait had begun for Mack Hargrove. For the first time in his life he couldn't have what he wanted.",
