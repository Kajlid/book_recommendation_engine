At its center is an artist named Juan Pablo Castel, who recounts from his prison cell his murder of a woman named Mar√≠a Iribarne. Obsessed from the moment he sees her examining one of his paintings, Castel fantasizes for months about how they might meet again. When he happens upon her one day, a relationship develops that convinces him of their mutual love. But Castel's growing paranoia leads him to destroy the one thing he truly cares about.",
