Willem Chauderon, or Buddy as he introduced himself that night, dazzles Scarlett with his rebellious edge, leather and smoke in the dark. Abandoning all rational thought she escapes with him. Their time together is short but alters her life forever. In a world where rules need to be followed, Buddy returns her to her life and steps aside. He can be patient and wait for her to summon him, the way it has always been done. Little does he know he's changed her and set demons loose that should never have been set free. Scarlett runs from these demons tormenting her into a life of raw and gritty debauchery. Couch hoping until eventually she has no where to go except the streets. Taking her adrift friend Cassandra Lee with her, they spend their days chasing the next party. Scarlett searches tirelessly for the smoke Buddy gave her. She sinks into a dark, hopeless world that she knows only he can save her from. Can she find the courage to call him back to her before she self destructs? Can he forgive her for all she has done and accept her back as his?",
