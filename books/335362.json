  "description": "First wave from outer space.It was Earth's darkest hour. Weak, disunited, backward, prey to attack. It could only be saved by the \"Vigilantes.\" Sci-fi writer Thane Smith had the job of assuring Earth's population that there was nothing to fear. That was what he tried hard to do, at least at first. Then, in the blackest moment of that terrible night when it all began, he faced a monstrous \"thing\" that could only have been created by an alien race.",
