  "description": "Love is the sweetest song of all…\n Gentle and compassionate teacher Janae Simms isn't looking for love—her heart has been broken one too many times, and she doesn't intend to relive that kind of pain. So when her best friend convinces her to let loose and attend a concert featuring R & B sensation Monte, all Janae expects is an evening of music and fun. But as soon as she hears his smooth, honeyed voice and they share a moment together backstage, Janae fears her heart is in danger once again. Terrence \"Monte\" Campbell has been hurt by women seeking his wealth and celebrity instead of the man he truly is. So music is his only passion, until he meets Janae. He struggles to maintain emotional distance, but her tender sensuality and caring ways tempt Terrence as no other before. And one sizzling night, they both give in to their desires and explore all of the erotic promises between them. Is Janae really the one for Terrence, or just another disappointment waiting to happen? Can he finally let go of the past and embrace the idea of their loving future?",
