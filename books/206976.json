  "title": "The Bells",
  "description": "\"The Bells\" is a heavily onomatopoeic poem by Edgar Allan Poe which was not published until after his death in 1849. It is perhaps best known for the diacopic use of the word \"bells.\" The poem has four parts to it; each part becomes darker and darker as the poem progresses from \"the jingling and the tinkling\" of the bells in part 1 to the \"moaning and the groaning\" of the bells in part 4. - Wikipedia",
