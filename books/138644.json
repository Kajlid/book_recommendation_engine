  "description": "In the distant future, humans live in a utopia where even death is not the end—for everyone except Amber’s parents. At 25, she is a cynical, aloof Ph.D. in history who resents her sheltered life at home and yearns to find her place in the world. Then, an exciting job offer comes her way—the chance to uncover the mystery of a civilization that disappeared thousands of years ago. Teaming up with the archeologist Lullaby, Amber embarks on a hitchhiking quest to find the fabled Aquamarine Moon and, perhaps, some much-needed meaning in her life.Mattie Bukowski [he/him] is a writer, video essayist, and a PhD student of evolutionary biology. He is a queer, disabled trans man with a lifelong passion for science fiction. When not at the keyboard, he can be found playing board games or taking part in TTRPG sessions. Up The Entropic Hill is his debut novel.",
