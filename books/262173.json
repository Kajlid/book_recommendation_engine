  "description": "\"If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.\"--Ernest Hemingway to a friend, 1950 Published posthumously in 1964, A Moveable Feast remains one of Hemingway's most beloved works. It's his classic memoir of Paris in the '20s, filled with irreverent portraits of other expatriate luminaries such as F. Scott Fitzgerald & Gertrude Stein; tender memories of his 1st wife, Hadley; & insightful recollections of his own early experiments with his craft. It's a literary feast, evoking the exuberant mood of Paris after WWI & the youthful spirit, unbridled creativity & unquenchable enthusiasm that Hemingway himself epitomized.",
