  "description": "Outlaw and all around bad guy Marston finds a dying man along the railroad tracks. His only plan is to take the mans nearby horse, his gun and whatever money he might have in his pockets but the dying man's words gnaw at him ‘Give my love to Rose’ the man had said and ‘Tell my boy I’m proud of him’. Without knowing why Marston feels the need to honor the dying man's wishes. The man's quest leads him to Harper Louisianna and when he finds Rose she is not what he expected and neither is the boy…. Marston has spent his whole life hurting people and not caring. Will these people make him want to change and what will Rose say when she learns what kind of man he really is?",
