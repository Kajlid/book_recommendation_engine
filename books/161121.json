  "title": "Mortal Peril",
  "description": "For almost two thousand years the vampires of London have clung to a shadowy existence in the crypts, cellars and coal holes of the great city. Dependent on mortal blood, obliterated in a burning instant by exposure to sunlight, and hidden at all costs from the knowledge of mortals, they form a close community, hedged about by centuries of rules and received wisdom designed to aid their survival. One of the most important of these rules is: never let a mortal get too close.Martin, a young man of twenty has lived as a vampire in London for over two hundred years, never straying far from the side of his lover, Roderick. One evening, he returns to their den to find Roderick gone with no explanation. Can Martin survive the lonely life of a single vampire or will he give way to despair? Distraction and temptation appears in the form of Anthony, a flame-haired mortal medievalist. If Martin forgets the laws of his community, it won't just be himself he places in terrible danger.",
