  "description": "Winner of the Prestigious Christopher Award! Be inspired by the Catholic saints like never before in My Life with the Saints by James Martin, SJ. This best-selling memoir of spiritual self-discovery is an homage to the Catholic saints who have accompanied Fr. Martin throughout his life. From a lukewarm childhood Catholicism, to the Wharton School of Business, to the executive fast track at General Electric, to the Jesuits, to a media career in Manhattan, Martin has relied on the Catholic saints to intervene in and guide his life. As Martin shares with us his many surprising encounters and journeys with the saints, he convincingly shows how we, too, can be close friends with the saints of the Catholic Church. \"Over the past few years, whenever I've felt particularly close to a saint, I've spent some time writing down what drew me to him or her. Some of these essays reflect a devotion based on the public actions and well-known writings of a saint; others are rooted in a more personal response to a hidden part of a saint's life—a small, almost unnoticed, piece of his or her story that has affected me in a deep way. The memoir is organized chronologically, so that the saints are introduced more or less in the sequence in which I first encountered them.\"—from \"An Introduction,\" My Life with the Saints",
