  "description": "When Molly Carter finally gets hired at a small school on the plains of Colorado, she couldn't be more thrilled to declare her independence. Now that she's hours away from friends, family, and the amenities of the big city, she embarks on an emotional roller coaster as she realizes that not everyone in the close-knit town is ready to welcome her with open arms. Her already vulnerable composure is further shaken when ruggedly compelling cop Jake Runco returns to his hometown after being injured in the line of duty. Their attraction is immediate and intense, but Jake has every intention of going back to L.A. as soon as he recovers. Hoping to protect her heart, Molly tries to fight the inevitable. But their bond grows when the sleepy town is rocked with a scandal that quickly spirals out of control. A local teacher, Georgia Quinlan, and her stepsons disappear without a trace. Already suspicious of Georgia's temper and heavy drinking, Molly is determined that her deranged coworker is behind the scheme. As Molly pushes closer to the truth, she finds herself caught in a web of danger fueled by desperation and greed. As much as she hates to admit it, she'll have to rely on Jake--and the few friends she's made--to help her unravel the plot before it's too late.",
