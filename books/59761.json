  "description": "India is home to over a thousand species of birds ranging from glittering sunbirds, peacocks and pheasants through to unassuming inhabitants of town and countryside like crows, sparrows and pigeons to those that are rare and threatened like the Indian Bustard. In this book, many of them are brought to vivid life by one of the country’s greatest naturalists and nature writers.M. Krishnan’s prose is studded with evocative descriptions of nature, literary allusions, stylistic flourishes, humour, and most rewardingly, precise observations and original insights into over a hundred species of birds in a variety of habitats. This is a work that will delight bird lovers of every stripe.As Zafar Futehally, one of the country’s best known ornithologists, says in his forward, ‘Every piece in this collection has something even for the seasoned naturalist, and even his description of common events holds your interest because of the writing.’",
