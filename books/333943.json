She flees with the only other survivor, a baby named Serek. In a world where males are rarely born, Serek is precious beyond measure, and Leyloni must put aside her grief and pain to take him somewhere safe.The only sanctuary she knows of is a friendly village on the far side of the Endless Forest.It is a harrowing journey for a huntress to make on her own, more so with a babe. But Leyloni soon realizes she is not alone—she is being stalked by something far more dangerous than any raiders.The beast is massive with a scaled hide, wicked claws, and sharp teeth. His eyes are like violet lightning, his roar like thunder.He is a dragon.And he intends to make her his.-----VENYS NEEDS MENThis collaborative series are all standalones and can be read in any order.
