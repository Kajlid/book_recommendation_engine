  "description": "You wake up on the floor of a cell … dirty, tired, terrified. You hear sounds but no voices because no one can speak—including you. Violence surrounds you and you’re helpless to do anything, unable to escape. You face the reality of your own life as you recall past events in an effort to understand why you’re here. You’re innocent, after all! Aren’t you?",
