  "description": "Zee Mahan had always known the boy she loved would leave one day–Whiskey River was too small to hold the talent and charisma of Jamie Templeton forever. She just didn't realize that when he left, it would break her hometown heart.  Jamie had never lied to Zee about his plans, and when he'd left for the bright lights—and made it big—he'd thought she understood. She'd loved him and his music and had encouraged him to chase his dream. Sure, he could have gone home for a visit, but when his band caught fire, he was afraid to interrupt their momentum.  When the crazy world he was living in turned on him, Jamie walked away---back to the only place he could think of to go....home. But was it too late to find forgiveness and rekindle the fire with the only woman he’d ever loved?",
