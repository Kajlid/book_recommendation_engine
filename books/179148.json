  "description": "Out of print for over a decade, two standouts from the bewitching Georgie the ghost series are available again. In Georgie (1944), readers are introduced to the gentle little ghost, who happily haunts Mr. and Mrs. Whittaker's house -- creaking the loose board on the stairs and giving the parlor door a little squeak every night -- until his world is turned topsy-turvy and he must find a new house to haunt.",
