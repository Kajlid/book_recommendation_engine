  "description": "I’m a businessman. Level-headed. Always keeping my eye on the bottom line and nothing else. I’m not a creature of want, never have been. So why has all that suddenly changed the moment Julieta appeared in my life? I can’t seem to think straight, can’t stay focused on anything except obsessing over her. I don't know if I'm losing my mind? Maybe so. But I do know that once I’ve had a taste of my Julieta, I won’t be able to let her go. Even if that means playing dirty for the first time in my life in order to keep her.Growing up in the foster system, allies are few and far between. But I always had my best friend Raegan who could find the brighter side for us in the roughest of times. When Raegan calls for me to come home with fear in her voice I know her twin brother has likely brought trouble to their front door. I drop everything and rush to her side even if it means losing all I'd been working towards. She would do the same for me without question. What I didn’t expect was trouble to be a man with an iron grip and a smile that he only gives to me. It doesn’t take me long to realize I may be in deeper trouble than them all.",
