  "description": "Fourteen-year-old Khioneus Nevula is beginning to realize something strange is going on. Adopted from unknown parentage, he has always been marked as different by his purple eyes. Now a winter break that should have been nothing but goofing around with his best friends is haunted by some other presence—ghostly apparitions appear to him in the dark of night, the surface of his mirror ripples like a pool of water, and he dreams of a girl with a long blue braid who invents fantastical devices. Drawn into a mystical land, he meets his twin sister, a proficient mage, a slightly mad scientist, and a princess. In this land where he is a prince, he finds himself and his friends caught in a war between the inhabitants of Elkloria and an ancient and powerful evil. THE DOOR TO INFERNA, Rishab Borah’s first novel, creates a fantasy world as fully realized as those of Rick Riordan or Tamora Pierce. Elkloria draws on Borah’s interest in mythology, science, and linguistics as well as the imaginative lands he and his friends once inhabited in play—open to all to explore.",
