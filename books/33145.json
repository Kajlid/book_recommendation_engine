  "description": "This book contains Bonus Section: TRUTH ABOUT AZTEC UFO CRASH By Sean Casteel!The CONSPIRACY JOURNAL is very proud to offer this expanded version of perhaps the most seminal book in the history of the unexplained . . . a case that now stands right beside the UFO crash at Roswell, MN for its credibility and veracity. For years the Aztec case was spurned by serious researchers who did not have access to all the information now available on the crash. In addition to reprinting the entire, unabridged, text to the rare 50s Scully book (reset in an easy to read, \"large print,\" large format edition) journalist Sean Casteel has dug deep to provide the reader with an updated account of what really happened outside this isolated desert town near the Four Corners. His up to date research on Aztec includes material supplied by such outstanding researchers as NICK REDFERN -- STANTON FRIEDMAN -- ART CAMPBELL -- SCOTT and SUZANNE RAMSEY.AN IMPORTANT RE-EXAMINATION OF AN HISTORICAL UFO CASE! - - - Were 16 alien bodies recovered from a dome-shaped device that crashed near the town of Aztec, New Mexico circa 1948? . . . Why does the FBI continue to withhold 200 pages of classified material on the case for alleged \"national security reasons?\" . . . Was the incident covered up with a camouflaged \"front story\" presided over by con men and scam artists, who were perhaps in the government's \"back pocket?\" . . . Did President Eisenhower make contact with aliens around the same time, thus adding weight to this and other UFO crash cases?",
