  "description": "Tyanni has spent the last two years in a hospital bed with no chance to live a normal life. Her sister has remained at her side and kept her interested in the world by looking through their family trees, and a genetics scan turns up surprising news, they arenâ€™t completely human.  The Lrrko is a cloned race that is rapidly running out of usable DNA. The discovery of no less than five new sources gains a lot of attention, and they dispatch five of their best to bring the Terran women back.  Brex is one of the Familiars sent to gather up the lost Brides. He is assigned to Tyanni, and he feels a sense of relief. Out of the two sisters, he got the quiet one. When she leaves the healing tank, he learns of his mistake.  He takes over care for her body, soul and physical needs. He gradually becomes Familiar, in every possible way.",
