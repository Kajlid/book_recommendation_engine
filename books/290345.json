  "title": "Writers Revenge: Four Authors and the Publisher from Hell",
  "description": "If your publisher stood in the way of a lucrative book deal in the US, how would you react? Esther was livid…How would you like it if your first novel got no marketing support – and your second sold out within days because they printed too few? Donna didn’t like it one bit.Or what if you’d naively signed a contract for your future books, on the same miserable terms as your first? Gloria wanted to pack it in before things got worse.And – would you feel as hurt and upset as Petra if your editor blurted your closely guarded secrets to the world and their auntie? Wouldn’t you want better treatment? Esther, Donna, Gloria and Petra do as they take on a – callous publisher– a scheming editor and a – marketing manager in thrall to the publisher’s dysfunctional ethosWill they compel them to mend their ways?",
