B00CA67A64 Seedy corporations and airship factions, demons and rogues, zealots and thieves… Nimbus is an epic fantasy tale of power, greed, and corruption. Jude Finley is a new recruit aboard the Gangly Dirigible, an airship that extracts water from rain clouds. While working aboard the ship, Jude and his friends uncover a secret which may or may not help them against a growing uprising that could spell doom for everyone on the planet. Meanwhile, Demetrius Rucca, the wheelchair-bound son of a prominent religious leader, begins recruiting followers for his own subversive cause. As allegiances are sworn to him and his followers grow, he begins to discover the new powers that lie within him. This power could be the salvation Demetrius is looking for–or it could be the destruction of the known world. Whether you're looking for sky pirates or steampunk magic, Nimbus is the young adult steampunk adventure that has it all. And be sure not to miss the new follow-up series of steampunk novellas--Stratus takes place three years after the events of Nimbus. You'll see old friends and new faces, explore deep under the deathly fog and into the Burrows, and just maybe hear a few new steampunk tales you'll want to share with your friends.",
