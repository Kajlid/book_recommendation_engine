  "description": "Invalidating its sometimes sinister connotation, C.W. Leadbeater defines occultism as \"the study of the hidden laws of nature,\" thereby revealing its role-here intertwined with vegetarianism-in the pursuit of spiritual truth and wholeness. In this pamphlet, first published in 1913, Leadbeater, always keeping in mind the practical issues that arise and consistently providing scientific support, provides a thorough review of vegetarianism and the many ways it benefits the body and spirit through nutrition, purity, and harmony with nature.",
