  "description": "Birth of a Vampire is a prequel to the Blood & Light vampire series and for those who have read the 6 novels in that series already, other wise you may be lost as to who this is and what it is about.This story first had it's debut in an anthology called \"Red Wine\" a couple of years ago and since then Rue Volley has revised it for it's stand alone. Mia is a rogue vampire and she is struggling with the reality of her life and her situation at hand in a house that never quite felt like a home. Cameo's occur in this short with the appearances of Jonah and Lily and their connection to Mia and a deeper look into a vampire who has yet to fully be born. This is a twisted tale of a mind coming to grips with reality and shows a deeper look into where Mia came from and how she ended up at the circus.",
