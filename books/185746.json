  "title": "Only in Naples: Lessons in Food and Famiglia from My Italian Mother-in-Law",
  "description": "In the tradition of M. F. K. Fisher and Peter Mayle, this enchantingly warm and witty memoir follows American-born Katherine Wilson on her adventures abroad, where a three-month rite of passage in Naples turns into a permanent embrace of this boisterous city on the Mediterranean. It is all thanks to a surprising romance, a new passion for food, and a spirited woman who will become her mother-in-lawâ€”and teach her to laugh, to seize joy, and to love.",
