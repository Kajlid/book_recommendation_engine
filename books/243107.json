  "description": "A Renegade never surrenders.  After evading both the Union and the Sarkonian Empire, Jace and the crew are off in search of Earth. With the help of Titan, their new base of operations, Jace believes they might just have a chance.  That is, if they can outrun the two armies at their backs, and somehow manage to survive a galaxy that wants them dead. Not exactly a walk in the park.  But no one ever said being a Renegade was easy.  Experience a sprawling galactic tale in this third entry to The Renegade Star series. If you’re a fan of Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, or Leviathan Wakes, you’ll love this epic, space opera thriller.  Warning: This book contains action, cussing, and general badassery. Read at your own risk.",
