  "description": "ABOUT THIS EPISODE  How do you profile a serial killer who keeps changing his pattern?  A body encased in ice and a cryptic message make Malcolm, Seong-Jae, and Aanga Joshi question everything they thought they'd learned about the Golden Ratio Killer. If their suspect can change his methods and alter his patterns, he could easily disappear...  ...along with any chance of catching him before he completes his deadly game.  To keep up, Malcolm and Seong-Jae will have to find the bigger picture, the larger plan to intercept their target before that strange message turns into another victim — but it's the small things tripping them up when their relationship and some unsettled business between them leaves them stumbling around each other and falling head-first into mistakes that could cost them more than just the case.  It could cost another innocent life, and leave that blood stained on their hands.  ABOUT SEASON TWO  Malcolm Khalaji and Seong-Jae Yoon are back on the case — and partnering with the FBI on a horrific serial murder case that will test Malcolm's faith and revive the darkest parts of Seong-Jae's past. With an enigmatic killer leading them on a wild goose chase through city after city and body after body, both Mal and Seong-Jae will find themselves pushed to their limits as they discover the worst of what humanity can do.  Even two minds against one may not be enough as they track the devious Golden Ratio Killer, and try to find the key to his pattern. But the trail of breadcrumbs left by the white rabbit will lead them suspiciously close to home, and a connection they never could have predicted. With their worlds exploding around them and everyone they know suddenly cast into doubt...  Can their partnership — and their love — survive the greatest trial of their lives?",
