  "description": "Captivating. Vulnerable. Agonizing. Seductive. Frankie Clermont was supposed to be like a sister to me for as long as I’d known her. But no one knew the depths of our lies. I had been in love with her before… before everything changed what we could be. Undeniably connected and effortlessly infatuated, the two of us had remained each other’s weaknesses through everything. I couldn’t afford to allow her to be my weakness anymore. I was in love with someone else. I was engaged. But it didn’t matter how much time had passed, the moment I saw her again, I knew I would never escape her. I never should have touched her again. Whispering her name in the dark was a mistake. She was still everything I wanted and nothing I should have had. We became a secret that neither of us could keep. A devastating secret that would destroy everything.",
