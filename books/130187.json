  "description": "It’s funny how it only takes one moment, one simple action to throw a normal life into utter chaos. After the death of their parents, Ethan Harlow and his sister Cordillia do the best they can to pick up the pieces and live a normal life but after an attack that leaves Ethan in the ICU, their lives quickly become anything but normal. Noticing some strange changes in himself, Ethan sets off across California to find an answer, a name for what he has become but what he finds instead is far worse than anything he could have imagined. A centuries old evil waiting to return, a race of creatures that shouldn’t exist and a war Ethan never meant to start. With the help of his new friends and the woman that made him, Ethan must make a choice… Will he run for his life? Or stay and fight at the side of the wolves that have become family to him?",
