But after a turbulent few years abroad with her diplomat parents, forgetting the past is easier said than done. After all, \"normal\" high schoolers aren't trained in several forms of combat. Then Sophia meets Aksel and finds herself opening up in ways she never thought she could. Except Sophia's past is about to catch up with her, and she must confront who she really is, why she was betrayed, and what she is capable of in the name of love and survival.",
