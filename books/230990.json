  "description": "Tom’s day has not gone well. He bombed the job interview in San Francisco and missed his flight connection back to Iowa. Now he’s stuck at the Minneapolis airport, on standby for an early morning plane home. But things begin to look up when a handsome man named Rafael strikes up a conversation. Rafael says he used to fly but, having made mistakes, was grounded. Now he has to be content with watching jets take off. What at first seems to be a short tryst in the wee hours of the morning may turn out to be much more. The universe contains surprises, and perhaps being stuck at the airport could have some long-term benefits.",
