  "description": "Once, I wished I was more. Stronger. Faster.Smarter. Braver. And then one night I was forced to become all those things. I pulled the trigger and changed my life forever. Now I’m an assassin for a Queen Pin, and together, we are taking the cartel world by storm. Sex, drugs, and secrets surround us like smoke. The DEA is breathing down our necks, and a rival cartel is threatening to destroy us. But I didn’t come this far to be intimidated or pushed around. I didn’t shift my entire universe just so some cocky, sweet talkin’ recruit could get in my pants either. Those days are over. I’m not that easy anymore. Tate may be sexy, deadly, and dangerous — his tongue his most lethal weapon — but my body and my heart just aren’t on the table. I won’t let another man derail my life, no matter how drawn or attracted I am to him. Or how much I hate seeing him with another woman. The only thing I have left to offer is death. They call me La Tiburona — the shark. And I’m not afraid to show you just how deep I can sink my teeth.",
