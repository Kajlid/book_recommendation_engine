  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Jordan Klein is a New York City girl who cracks wise to deal with the world around her. Her mother, Rachel, is a litigator—sharp, refined, and always careful not to spill her gin and tonic on the couch. Her father, Eli, is a professor of divinity, an unapologetic eccentric and, in Jordan’s eyes, a dipsy-doodling disaster. When he agrees to pastor a small Texas church for the summer, he turns Jordan’s world upside down. It’s not long before Jordan meets Knox Colville, a local teenage heartthrob who eases Jordan’s stay even as he complicates it. Jordan also finds an unlikely friend in Bliss LeBaron, a whimsical blonde with big dreams. Through Knox and Bliss, Jordan discovers the best parts of her new summer home, including the strange church sign outside her bedroom window. The quirky sign offers advice, provides pun-laden humor, and has an uncanny ability to predict the future—including hers.For anyone who likes bubble gum snow cones, stampeding pigs, roaring chainsaws, llamas that look like Rihanna, eyebrowless bandits—with a few sharp moments of loss and compassion sprinkled on top—SO THE SIGN SAID is an irresistible read that will leave you glad and light-hearted.",
