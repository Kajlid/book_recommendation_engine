  "description": "Single mom Rita Slocum wants to get her life back on track. Taking things one day at a time seems doable—especially with Brooks Harriman at her side. Brooks has been there for her through good times and bad. But she's always been leery of getting too close to the broad-shouldered woodworker who keeps his past locked away. Now that Rita's opening her own bakery, she needs him more than ever. If only Brooks would open up his life—and his heart—to Rita.",
