  "description": "Daniel knew going to look for shifters with his best friend Anthony wasn’t a good idea, but he never expected it to end like it did. Now he has a new job with Kameron Rhett, the Gillham pack alpha, and he loves it. He enjoys being around shifters, and even more being away from his house and his alcoholic father.  Bran Morris’ first meeting as the head of the council enforcers takes him to Gillham. Kameron needs to make a decision about coming out to the town, and Bran is supposed to help with it. He never expected to meet his mate, not after losing his wife and child thirty-six years before.  Daniel and Bran hit it off right away, but when Daniel’s father becomes a problem, Daniel doesn’t know what to do. Should he live his life and be with his mate, or should he stick with his father to be sure the man doesn’t hurt himself? What would happen to his relationship with Bran if he chooses his father?",
