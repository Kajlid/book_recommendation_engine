  "description": "Aza is far from beautiful. With pale skin and blood-red lips (not to mention ungainly size), she is seen as odd, at best. But Aza does have one blessing: a voice of astonishing beauty. In Ayortha, where singing is the main mode of communication, this gift is no small thing, and soon Aza finds herself rising at court. But, as she will discover, unexpected good fortune can also bring unexpected danger....Funny and moving, wise and uplifting, Fairest represents New York Times best-selling author Gail Carson Levine at her finest. Composer-director Todd Hobin has crafted melodies for all the story's lyrics and songs, resulting in a unique listening experienceâ€”an audiobook that has as much original music as a Broadway show!An unabridged production on 8 CDs (8 hours, 15 minutes).",
