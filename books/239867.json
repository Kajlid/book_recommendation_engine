  "description": "Meredith Worthington should have taken that turbulent experience on board her family's private plane as a warning sign. And she should never have agreed to spend the summer with her strict grandmother at Greyhurst while her father, a top candidate in the gubernatorial race, jet sets around Massachusetts. But she can’t help it. There is just something so eerie and magnetic about the uninhabited old Herkimer mansion on the private island across from Greyhurst. One look at it and Meredith knows: she has to stay. After burning curiosity lands Meredith and her friends at Herkimer, intriguing clues about the mansion’s cursed former residents come to light and things quickly go from dicey to dangerous. Plunging headlong into a mystery that takes her from Herkimer’s crumbling passageways to the campaign trail and the cynical political posturing that surrounds it, Meredith’s life is forever changed when she learns a shocking truth about the mother who abandoned her as an infant. Her search for answers is derailed when an unexpected enemy strikes, and the devastating consequences of Meredith’s probing find her fighting to stay alive.",
