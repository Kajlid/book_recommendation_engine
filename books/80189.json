  "title": "The Kissing Coach",
  "description": "Feather Hilborn is a style and dating coach. Despite what you may have heard, she is not a “kissing coach.”Devin Nelson is confident and suave, not the kind of guy you'd guess has never kissed a girl. He's cute, too, which is making it even more difficult for Feather to resist trying to kiss him. Her first attempt sends him running. The second attempt doesn't go much better. But you know what they say … third time's the charm. Coaching Devin is fun. The only problem is, once Devin “graduates,” some other girl will be benefiting from his new-found kissing skills.",
