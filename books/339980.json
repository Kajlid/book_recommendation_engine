  "title": "Pretty Little Tease",
  "description": "It’s a harmless way for a college student to make extra money… until it isn’t.I’m careful not to show my face, so why do I feel like I’m being watched when the camera turns off?No one should know who I am or be able to find me, but they do, and things quickly spiral out of control.The two unhinged men who fill my cam chat with all the deplorable things they want to do to me are closer than I think. To them I’m just a pretty little tease, and their obsession turns into something so much more than I bargain for.I should have run away when they found me, because now it’s too late for me to be anything except theirs.",
