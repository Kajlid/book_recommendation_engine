Abandoning work, her studies and any human contact, she holes up in her room, haunted by strange dreams and the creeping realisation that there must be something beyond the mundane.When loved ones try to reach her, Fern takes flight onto the streets of Sydney, where she meets an array of unlikely allies: a woman cursed with the gift of prophecy, a mysterious bartender, and Adam, an ex-soldier tormented by his past.As danger looms, Fern embarks on a journey with Adam into the labyrinthine depths of the Tasmanian wilderness, where she must finally face down her demons.Interwoven with myth and metaphor, FLIGHT is a compelling and original story; sometimes eerie, sometimes earthy, always spellbinding.",
