  "description": "Nowadays hardly anyone notices if you're of faerie descent and Jeanne has no trouble whatsoever running a nice little café in Paris. They keep their magic in check, save the occasional splash of comfort in the coffee or a dusting of joy on the pastries, and are happy with simply observing their mortal customers without ever giving themself away. At least that's how it was, before a young man waltzed in who was just a bit too pretty and definitely a bit too light-fingered.Rule number one: never steal from a faerie.~Coffee and Faerie Cakes is 45k of light urban fantasy with a generous helping of romance.You want a cute romance between a curious nonbinary faerie running a little café and a charming trans boy with knowledge of magic and thieving fingers? This is it.",
