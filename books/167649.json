  "description": "\"I knew the moment I gave in to pursuing Selene that trouble would follow me. It always does. I should have resisted.\"  Remington St. Germain is at a crossroads. He can either go after the one person who makes him feel as if he matters—the only person to ever calm the demons that roam his mind—or forget about her. The latter is not an option, even though there is a chance she might reject him. But, damn it all to hell, he will convince her. He has to. Otherwise, he will be right back where he was before she came into his life.  Selene Michaels' stay in Paris is only temporary. She shouldn't get too attached to Remington and his son, Adrien. But, Remington makes her feel alive and reckless, and Adrien makes her loss almost bearable. They complete her. She has a feeling there is more to Remington than a doting single father and her overprotective Prince Charming. Besides, the risk of being with them still looms closeby and she will do anything to keep them safe.  Sometimes life gives you a second chance. But what happens when danger threatens that chance?",
