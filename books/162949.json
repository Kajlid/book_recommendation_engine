  "description": "To Live in the World as Ourselves: Self-Discovery and Better Relationships through Jung’s Typology is a guide to one of the pillars of Jungian psychology. Going far beyond merely an exercise in categorizing and affixing ourselves and others with a personality “type,” the author offers simple but fundamental aspects of psychology that are easily observable in everyone. The book shows readers how to discover the essentials of their true nature, and offers techniques to live more authentically and with less stress, and to relate to others with more ease, understanding and mutual support. Through real-life examples and avatars of typology from popular culture, the author describes extroversion and introversion, thinking, feeling, intuition and sensation, universal psychological abilities to perceive and process life experience that cover all aspects of a fully human life. She shows how an innate hierarchy of these psychological abilities shapes our personal priorities, interests, special talents, ways of working and relating, even how we fall in love. Throughout the book are tips on relating best to people of various typologies, so as to avoid misunderstandings and even heal long-standing conflicts. Readers find out where they are likely to feel vulnerable, and ways to work best with and around fears and self-doubts, leading to self-awareness, self-enhancement and deeply rewarding relationships.",
