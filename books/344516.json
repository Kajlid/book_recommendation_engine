  "title": "The Conqueror Worm",
  "description": "A meditation on death and mortality, “The Conqueror Worm” describes a cryptic and ghoulish play that represents the inevitability of death. Despite the fact that his first published works were books of poetry, during his lifetime Edgar Allan Poe was recognized more for his literary criticism and prose than his poetry. However, Poe’s poetic works have since become as well-known as his famous stories, and reflect similar themes of mystery and the macabre. HarperPerennial Classics brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms.
