  "description": "Rick says:“Erectile dysfunction is a thief, ED takes away physical and emotional intimacy. ED steals your confidence in the bedroom. ED robs you of your manhood. ED walks off with your self-esteem. Far too many men allow their fear, embarrassment or shame, drive them into hiding or self-destructive behaviors. As a result, these men lose the opportunity to benefit from the professional help which could restore their sexuality and manhood.” After reading the Redners’ story, readers will know how to recognize and overcome the various roadblocks that prevent men and couples from seeking help with erectile dysfunction. They’ll discover healthy ways to think, talk about, live with, or cure erectile dysfunction, and how to determine whether penile implant surgery is the right option for them.",
