  "description": "\"Memories of My Father Watching TV\" has as its protagonists television shows, around which the personalities of family members are shaped. The shows have a life of their own and become the arena of shared experience. And in Curtis White's hands, they become a son's projections of what he wants for himself and his father through characters in \"Combat, \" \"Highway Patrol, \" \"Bonanza, \" and other television shows (and one movie) from the 1950s and '60s. Comic in many ways, \"Memories\" is finally a sad lament of father-son relationship that is painful and tortured, displayed against a background of what they most shared, the watching of television, the universal American experience.",
