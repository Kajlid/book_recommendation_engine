  "description": "In English Language Learners and the New Standards, three leading scholars present a clear vision and practical suggestions for helping teachers engage ELL students in simultaneously learning subject-area content, analytical practices, and language. This process requires three important shifts in our perspective on language and language learning—from an individual activity to a socially engaged activity; from a linear process aimed at correctness and fluency, to a developmental process, focused on comprehension and communication; and from a separate area of instruction to an approach that embeds language development in subject-area activities. In English Language Learners and the New Standards, the authors:Clarify the skills and knowledge teachers need to integrate content knowledge and language developmentShow how teachers can integrate formative assessment in ongoing teaching and learningDiscuss key leverage points and stress points in using interim and summative assessments with ELLsProvide classroom vignettes illustrating key practicesFinally, the authors explain the theories and research that underlie their vision and examine the role of policy in shaping pedagogy and assessment for ELL students.",
