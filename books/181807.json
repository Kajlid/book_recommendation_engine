  "description": "201 Homemade Beauty Tips & Tricks in You is a beauty manual that offers and showcases the most comprehensive guide to natural homemade beauty cosmetics and medicinal remedies. It is written for those who want to take good care of themselves in natural ways. Inside you can find old housewives' recipes that had worked for people from early eras. You can discover different recipes for beauty concoctions such as facial masks, bubble baths, perfumes, body scrubs, body butter/creams, and soaps. These homemade beauty products are made from natural ingredients such as vegetables, fruits and essential oils. There are countless chemical-based beauty products that the beauty industry has put on the market with endless promises to solve all the skin problems that women and men are faced with. As much as the benefits of these commercialized products are appreciated, the fact that they come at exorbitant price and some of them contain toxic, poisonous chemicals which are harmful to our health cannot be overlooked. Some of the chemicals found in commercial cosmetic products can disrupt people's hormones and mood by causing hormonal imbalance, imitating or obstructing the body's hormone functions and resulting in health conditions such as low sperm count, increase the rate of cancers and birth defects. Homemade products are cheaper to produce and contain only toxic-free natural ingredients. It is therefore not surprising to see more and more people turning to Mother Nature to provide them with health and beauty solutions – even the commercial beauty and pharmaceutical industries advertise their products as natural. The benefits of homemade products differ but they include the following:• Revitalizing the scalp and combating scalp conditions such as dandruff• Stimulate hair growth and promoting healthier and glowing hair • Nourished and healthy skin • Treatment of skin conditions such as; acne, blemishes, oily and dry skin• Regenerate skin cells and preventing premature ageing • Cure fungal and bacterial infections such as athlete's foot, ringworms and eczema• Promote blood circulation• Protect the skin from free radicals caused by UV radiation • Detoxification",
