  "title": "Romancing Rosalie: A Cascade Creek Christmas",
  "description": "Rosalie Weld's fianc√© has a mistress, and he doesn't intend to give her up just for marriage. After breaking her engagement, Rosalie flees Boston for her cousin's homestead in the Colorado Territory and it might just be the perfect refuge, if she can learn to accept the hard work and solitude of frontier life.  Even on her journey, she can't avoid womanizers like Garrett Ballinger, who stumbles out of a brothel and straight onto the stagecoach. But Rosalie will be safe when she arrives in Cascade Creek; the local marshal will escort her to Audra's homestead.  Trouble is, Garrett is the marshal and he's plenty interested in the pretty Easterner. He may not be the man she thinks he is, but she can't trust him--until she's forced to. Can a Christmas miracle warm up Rosalie's frozen heart?",
