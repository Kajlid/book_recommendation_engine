But in the works of Michael Moorcock and the novels of Elric, Richard's life becomes fabulous! As Richard goes through the school year, his love and obsession for the Elric novels become the shield that protects and strengthens him as he suffers the humiliation of persecution by bullies and domination by adults and teachers who threaten to betray his innocent trust. Also included with this special comic is a 6-page prelude of the upcoming Elric Stormbringer series. 32 pages, full color.Pages,",
