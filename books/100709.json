  "description": "FBI Special Agent Gwen Ryan is on assignment in Taiwan, where three American military women have mysteriously gone missing from the local base. Given her history, Gwen suspects White slavery, and her suspicions are only sharpened when she finds out the base commander is a religious fanatic given to performing corporal punishment on his own aide, the young, cute, earnest, shapely, and quite determinedly gay Lieutenant Anderson. Aided in her investigation by a young and irritating Taiwanese police woman - and the reluctant, but cowed and blackmailed Lieutenant, Gwen learns more than she ever wanted to about the harsh treatment Asian masters mete out to their unwilling slaves.Word Count: 38300",
