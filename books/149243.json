  "description": "MARROW BONES AND CLEAVER MUSIC can best be described as ekphrastic. However, more than simple homage to art, these poems reflect the ancient meaning of ekphrastic poetry to include the analysis of any person, thing, or experience.There is wondrous art in all creatures and creations, especially when viewed through a prism that blends truth with fable. In MARROW BONES AND CLEAVER MUSIC, Weil closely examines specific (often obscure) experiences and endeavors from the full spectrum of existence. Weil's poetry is designed to synthesizes his interests into universal expressions. He writes poetry to highlight the importance of little histories; to help process and embrace our fragile, fleeting, and beautiful lives; and, to enlighten, entertain, and enrich the mind.Weil's poems are compact. The significance of brevity surfaces in the way that limitations can both complicate and cultivate emotion and how these complications may manifest themselves in our human attachments to objects, time, others, and the places that we call home.",
