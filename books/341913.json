  "description": "A lavishly illustrated insider s look at 80 years of music and culture in Laurel Canyon. Laurel Canyon is a zip code with its own playlist--Sonny & Cher, The Doors, The Turtles, Canned Heat, Monkees, Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne; Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young; Eagles, and Carole King all cultivated their immortal sounds in this L.A.-based musical fraternity. Written by a long-time L.A. resident who knows them all, Canyon of Dreams traces the history of the community and its enduring legacy. Taking an intensely personal approach, it uses a multiple-voice narration based on exclusive interviews with the area's musical elite. Because of their close and long-time connection with Kubernik, some of these stars speak openly for the first time. Eye-opening visually and informationally, this is a book no music lover can be without!Interview highlights include:- For the first time in years, the three surviving Doors talk about performances, recordings, band dynamics, and, of course, Jim Morrison- Randy Meisner reminisces about the Eagles' first gig and the recording of One of These Nights - Graham Nash reflects on life with Joni Mitchell and describes writing Our House - Lou Adler discusses his legendary Sunset Strip venues the Whisky a Go-Go, Roxy Theater, Rainbow Bar & Grill, and Tapestry - Michele Phillips reflects on the Monterey Pop Festival- Slash, a child of the Canyon, details the formation of Guns N' Roses- And much, much more!",
