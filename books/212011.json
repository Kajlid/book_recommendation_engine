Leaving behind the darkness that has been their home for generations, they discover a world of colour, warmth and light. The people of the small village of Sparks seem willing to help them . . . at first . . . but life on the surface has it's dark side too.Before long the villagers of Sparks become more reluctant to share their precious resources with the strange, new underground people.
