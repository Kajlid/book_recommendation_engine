Not only am I meant to act like I'm open for dating, but I'm meant to be sexy and get up close and personal with a complete stranger.None of the above is me. But I'm a sucker, and my best friend can talk me into anything.Deacon is the kind of guy my heart could be safe with. But I've been taking care of myself for a long time, and I'm not sure I'm ready to rely on anyone else. Not even the handsome, successful older brother of my best friend.DeaconI never saw her coming. One date with a beautiful stranger, and I'm hooked.Technically, Ramsey isn't a stranger. She's my little sister's best friend, the same sister who volunteered me because she claims \"I'm a workaholic in desperate need of love.\"All I know is I can't stop thinking about Ramsey and the way her lips felt against mine. I have to see her again. Good thing I'm an attorney, because convincing her to take a chance on me is going to be the hardest case I've ever pleaded. She's worried about the past repeating itself. What she's yet to figure out is that her fear is unnecessary... never with me.",
