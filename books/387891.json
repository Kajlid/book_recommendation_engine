Covan, Ph.D., chief psychologist at Bellevue Hospital, takes you behind the gates and into the psych ward of one of the world's most famous mental institutions. With razor-sharp insight and great compassion, Covan follows the lives of a group of young interns and the unforgettable patients they are committed to serve, including Brenda, a paranoid schizophrenic who claims she has slept with six presidents; Matthew, a silent, tormented young man who cut off his own penis with a pair of pinking shears; and Gloria, a severely depressed dermatologist with a panic reaction to the sight of skin.Balancing the delicate line between normalcy and pathology, theory and reality, CRAZY ALL THE TIME explores the dark moods and outrageous behaviors of both doctors and patients in a place where madness reigns and disorder is the order of the day.\"A wonderful book . . . Superbly written . . . Nothing short of perfect.\" -- Los Angeles Times Book Review",
