  "description": "Do you know what it means to be alive? Have you ever asked yourself if there's more to life than this? But you're busy...You have a career, a family, a social life and all that inner peace stuff looks so time consuming. And surely it means trekking to off-beat locations? Well it doesn't! Inner peace is a lot more simple than you think. In 'Dance with Life' a very modern Mira explores the realm of the heart under the practiced eye of a life-changing teacher. The journey is within, she doesn't even have to leave her front room! Travel with her and you might find that you'll never look at life in quite the same way again.Sometimes on one's own personal journey there is a sense of aloneness and perhaps that is why we are drawn to such books - to know that we are not alone and that there is a personal journey that each of us must make. It is a long time since a book touched me so deeply. I think 'The Prophet' by Kahlil Gibran may have been the last time and that was in 1986! Other books speak to us but this one knows. --Reader's letter",
