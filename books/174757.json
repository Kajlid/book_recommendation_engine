  "title": "When To Let Go",
  "description": "Three stories. One book. Six lives intertwined.  This is a story that starts at childhood and ends with adulthood. It's about the first time your lips meet and the last time they part. It's the free falling of love and the pain of crashing. It's broken promises and stolen kisses. It's reaching for the sky and letting dreams slip away. It's the past controlling the present and the present defining the future. It's learning when to stay and when to go. It's the story of the Baxter Triplets and the ones they fell in love with.",
