  "description": "In 2031, fifteen-year-old Geon awakes from a coma with a biolimb arm in a postapocalyptic tech-driven world he barely recognizes. Climate catastrophes—the EarthShift—have reduced the livable landmass to a mere 1 percent, and the EndWar has killed much of the human population off. The remaining governing bodies have united into the Coalition Against the Reduction of Earth—CARE—and severely restrict all facets of life. Geon, along with his sister, two foster brothers, and new caretaker, learns to survive in a society where every aspect of life is controlled.At first, he’s happy to have a second chance, thrust into his first day of school, surrounded by confusing 3-D holograms and into the heart-pounding new sport of JetSurf. On the surface, things seem optimistic.But strange occurrences and a mysterious message from a supposedly dead old friend make Geon suspicious of CARE. Driven by a burning desire to know the truth, the foursome venture out in covert death-risking night missions to discover what CARE is hiding. Their search reveals a world of illegal holographic JungleWars, a secret underground society, and opulent hidden cities where only the elite survive.Ultimately, they discover a sinister plot to control the population and a dark truth about the planet's future. Geon must risk everything to expose CARE—or abandon millions of citizens to a horrible fate.",
