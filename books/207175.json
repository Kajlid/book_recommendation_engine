Constantly moving from place to place, from job to job, he can never escape the nagging feeling that someone, or something, is coming for him, and that this predatory evil threatens all he holds most dear... Rose is a creature of the night, a brutal killer with no conscience who is propelled only by the need to survive. But now, suddenly, she sees in her dreams the face of a child, her baby, and her life is thrown into a chaos she never saw coming. What links these two damaged souls, and what will happen when their paths merge? The Last Night, the second novel from Mark P. Dunn, is a twisting ride through the darkest fears and brightest hopes of the human heart.",
