  "description": "Sarah Anders is a Scorcher. She specializes in burning plague victims to make worlds habitable again. When her ship is captured and her body sold to slavers she knows it is just a matter of time before the Alliance comes for her. She had never imagined that she would be sold as a breeder, or that her new mate would be a man she could respect. Athon Kellan is a creature of mixed blood. His Dhemon appearance is at odds with his Azon mating drive, but together they make him one hell of a fighter.",
