  "title": "Reflections of Mamie",
  "description": "It is said \"where there is no vision the people perish.\" Rosemary \"Mamie\" Adkins has rightly said she is a 'dreamer' and her dreams and visions reveal how much hope can come from what may seem to be the most hopeless of situations. In her book Reflections of Mamie she details the horror of being raised in a home without love as she speaks of the abuse that she experienced. Sadly, there is no doubt that her story has been seen in other families, and I would recommend this book to those who are seeking to know the answers from those trials of life. Rosemary speaks quite frankly about how she felt within herself as a young child seeking to cope with both the emotional and physical scars of life that no one should have to endure at such a young age. She also details the way she discovered help from her 'special friends' who were there when she needed them. Today, as an adult, Rosemary \"Mamie\" Adkins blossoms as she pursues her goals in life by keeping her dreams and visions alive.
