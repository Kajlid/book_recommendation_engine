  "description": "ACT Tori McNulty has problems. As she’s putting her life back together, she’s attacked in Boston's South End. She doesn’t remember mostly blood-drenched pavement and the crumpled body of her assailant. The good news is that she’s uninjured and not a murder suspect. The bad news is the obnoxious young man in 18th century dress shadowing her and confusing, violent flashbacks. Tori must figure out what happened that night before her stalker gets to her or she goes completely mad.\"Recommended for thrill-seekers, paranormal enthusiasts, history buffs… and the insane.\" — A.M.
