  "title": "Life with David",
  "description": "I have the best husband in the world. He just has a few attributes that can give you pause. Don’t most husbands? As his fifth wife, he came to me pre-owned but oh so fun to be around. Some of that fun was intentional. A lot more of it wasn’t. Life with David gives you an insider’s take on all things David. It was fun to write. Even more fun to experience.I'm not writing about everything I’ve learned about David over the years. I’m not even writing about everything I've learned about David during the last couple of weeks. Trust me, even I was met with more than a few surprises during some of our \"tell me about this\" sessions. If it appears that I’m making fun of him, I’m not. You just can’t explain David without pointing out his foibles, idiosyncrasies and, well, “Davidisms”. Never doubt that I love the guy. It just takes a certain amount of je ne sais quoi to fully appreciate him.Everyone deserves a David. If you don’t have one of your own, you can borrow mine for a few hours. But I’ll need him back when you’re done. I’m rather attached to him.",
