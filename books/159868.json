  "description": "Forever changed by one night that leaves their lives, love, and sacrifices forever altered. Chelsea Landon and USA Today Best Selling Author, Megan Smith, bring you two novels that weave a web so intertwined and elaborate that while one breath is being stolen, another is aching for the next - demanding to unravel what they're holding onto, all the while, another is struggling to let go. After a night that should have celebratory, it ends tragically for the lives of six teenagers on the cusp of adulthood. Years later, through their own struggles and accomplishments, each is left suspended by their own fears that surround them. While some feel blinding light, others are trapped inside a horrific, soul-stealing darkness. Can they find their way out of the intricate web of guilt and deceit? Can they reach the light amongst the shadows of what they used to be - and manage to be who they should become? Sometimes the only way to heal is to face the fear of forever.",
