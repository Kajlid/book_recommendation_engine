  "description": "My magic doesn’t define me.Within my secret, ancient race of witches everyone prays to be chosen by the Goddess to join the Coven of Cards. Well, everyone except me. All I want is to discover the truth of the past that was stolen from me. But being Marked as the Emperor, I have the most power and my Coven-mates expect me to take the throne. I didn’t ask for this gift, it was forced upon me. So I lay low, defending the world from demons and training my Coven to be the strongest it has ever been.My plan crumbles to dust when I kill a demon and it taunts me with an artifact that’s integral for closing the Gap for good. Problem is, one clue only leads to another and none of us know what they mean. With every step of the way it appears only the magic in my veins can unlock the path to a demon-free world. Soon, I’m forced to do the one thing I never wanted to do…claim my title and hunt this artifact down all by myself.Salem’s prophecy has weighed on our race’s shoulders for over three-hundred years and now it’s up to me to save the world from eternal darkness.Question is…what will I have to sacrifice to succeed?",
