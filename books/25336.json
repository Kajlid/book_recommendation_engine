  "description": "Among his countrymen, Waimbrill is a respected yet feared man, a beloved outcast whose work makes him distant from others, growing ever more eccentric from cleaving the dead and gaining their angst and pain. Trying to do good despite the neutrality of his church, Waimbrill cares for a quiet young orphan while a monster terrorizes the land. Together, the two must venture into murky waters where danger teems, and a monster waits for them in the deepest, darkest reaches of the world.",
