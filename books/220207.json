  "description": "A pocket watch frees a young girl from an unhappy vocation. Something strange frequents the dance halls of the fifties. A motorist catches a glimpse of giants on a journey through Barnesmore Gap.In this collection you will discover tales as diverse as the rugged Donegal landscape that has shaped its people over the centuries. Seven authors have crafted themes of emigration, love, loss, friendship, and the supernatural to reflect life hard up against the Wild Atlantic coastline.These stories provide a unique insight into a part of Ireland where people once gathered around turf fires to indulge in their love of storytelling, a craft which lives on through Meas Writers today.",
