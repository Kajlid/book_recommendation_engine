  "title": "A Woman in a Man's World: The True Story of a High School Principal",
  "description": "In 1977, when author Dr. Norma L. Winter overcame the adversities of her youth and became the only female high school principal in the state of West Virginia, less than three percent of the school administrators in the United States were women. In A Woman in a Man's World, she shares her professional journey into school administration during a time when gender differences among administrators were obvious and roadblocks to success were copious. In this memoir, Winter describes a personal and inspirational triumph over hardship, and she includes meaningful contributions to the study of contrasts between the careers of male and female school administrators. She tells a story about her nontraditional and unconventional life in which she beat the odds both personally and professionally. In the end, she reflects she may have been happiest when she was a woman in a man's world. Praise for A Woman in a Man's World Winter's book is \" . . . an inspirational resource . . . \" -Kirkus Review \"A treasure trove of historical and practical information . . . \" -Clarion Review \" . . . Winter's tale reads as a powerful model of ambition and drive\" -Blue Ink Review",
