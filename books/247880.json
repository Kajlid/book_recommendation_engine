  "description": "It was love at first elbow to the nose. When skirt-chasing TV star, Liam Black, gets thrown out of an unknown actress's apartment, he is impressed by the Z-lister's surprising amount of self-respect. (She's a Z-lister and he's Liam Black, after all.)  After some subtle stalking, Liam learns that the woman is ambitious Hollywood attorney, Gemma Vaughn, and he becomes intent on making her the Amal to his George Clooney. The cold-hearted lawyer, however, has zero interest in Liam, whom she believes to be a walking STD.  When Gemma is forced to accept the trouble-making celebrity as a client, her worst nightmare is he begins to grow on her - kind of like a fungus.  Will Gemma be able to keep their relationship strictly professional, or will Liam break down her walls and compromise her heart (and maybe her health)?   \"The Fakers\" is for mature audiences only. It contains sexual content, strong language, drug/alcohol use, and general assholery. This is not your mother's romantic comedy.",
