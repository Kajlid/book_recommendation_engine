  "description": "FINALIST FOR THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR DRAMAIn such critically acclaimed plays as The Dining Room and The Cocktail Hour , A. R. Gurney has wittily captured the manners of upper-middle-class WASP America, but never as gracefully or with such dazzling economy as in Love Letters . Tracing the lifelong correspondence of the staid, dutiful lawyer Andrew Makepeace Ladd III and the lively, unstable artist Melissa Gardner, the story of their bittersweet relationship gradually unfolds from what is written—and what is left unsaid—in their letters. A smash hit both off and on Broadway, Love Letters captures Andy and Melissa with a precision of detail and depth of feeling that only Gurney can command. Two other, thematically related plays by Gurney, The Golden Age and What I Did Last Summer , are included, providing a trio of wry and affectionate paeans to love lost, found, and fleetingly glimpsed.",
