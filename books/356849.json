  "description": "Between the herb shop, the catering business, and now a weekend paper-making class, China Bayles and her friends have as much work as they can handle. Of course, that doesn’t stop the rest of their lives from going on—or coming to an end, as the case may be. Meanwhile, China’s half-brother is opening up old wounds, trying to investigate their father’s supposedly accidental death. Although she can’t stop her husband from taking the case—after all, he’s a P.I. who hasn’t had a bite in months—China can at least put the unsavory business out of mind by gathering supplies for making paper. But in a patch of yucca plants (which make great paper), she finds a body—cause of death unknown. Many residents of Pecan Springs live seemingly simple lives that hide complex and dangerous pasts. And now, while unraveling secrets that hit close to home, China must set the record straight—and find a killer.",
