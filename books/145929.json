  "description": "In 1995, 20-year-old Rebecca Francis learns that her roommate's boyfriend Cam exposed her to HIV during a one-night stand. On a Saturday morning, the nurse at the clinic tells her she'll have her test results by Friday. All she has to do is wait. That shouldn't be hard...right?  But Rebecca has an internal radar that sometimes tells her when things are about to happen. This time, it's telling her she's going to die. And as she struggles to keep herself together in the face of mounting despair, Rebecca plunges into a downward spiral of depression and psychic anxiety that refuses to let her rest. A novella of shame, regret and the unbearable weight of uncertainty.",
