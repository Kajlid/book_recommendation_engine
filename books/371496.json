  "description": "Teenager Taniel Summers has seen benevolent spirits her entire life, fourteen years to be exact. As a small child she was comforted by the silver lady but her parents and sister, Jessica, were having none of it. The spirits were real friends to her but whenever her mother or sister caught her talking to her \"friends,\" they had a fit. There were times when the spirits seemed to be her only friends. When her skeptical parents move the family into an empty house, a different kind of spirit awaits her, a dark force that is bent on killing her. Taniel is forced to confide in Gabriel Smith who, with the help of his parents, is her only hope. Is the price they will have to pay too high?",
