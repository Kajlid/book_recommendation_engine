  "description": "Jason Manns loves love. Too bad it doesn't love him back. He retired from professional football and came out at the same time, excited to finally search for someone special to share his life — and his kinky secret — with. But what he ends up with is a string of increasingly bad hookups that leaves him unfulfilled and alone.  Tony Taylor doesn't believe in love. Even if it were real, it never lasts. He knows because everyone in his life has suffered from heartbreak, and his only attempt at a relationship ended in disaster. Instead, he focuses on being a good Dom, and one-off encounters suit him just fine… at least, until Jason lands directly in his path.  Jason is everything Tony doesn't want — a bratty submissive looking for more than one night together. But the electricity between them is too intense to deny, and they start a secret fling that slowly evolves into more. When Tony faces the risk of losing him forever, can he admit his feelings to Jason… and himself? Or will he allow the walls around his heart to ruin his chance at happiness?  Tony & His Tiger is a sweetly kinky and steamy 92,000 word friends-to-lovers MM romance featuring a big, bratty submissive, his small, grumpy Dom, and a whole lot of puppy play. It is the third book in the Oh My! series and can be read as a standalone.",
