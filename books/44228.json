  "description": "All acts of magick take on shades of gray in the end. Especially for Emma, one of four, female witches, who, by birthright, belongs in the social circles of the privileged, upper ten thousand in London. Yet, by rumor of the unknown and the misunderstood, she stands apart, cut by her peers along with her cousins.  Most of their nights at parties and balls were spent creating a magickal comedy of errors. Nowhere was the color of steam more evident than helping the uptight aristocracy side step their fastidious standards. Only, this year, Emma is not quite sure what is happening to her. Something dark and seductive, something not of this world, is luring her, possessing her, and she has no comprehension of what, or who, the presence really is.  When he does finally show his face, and she feels him to be a nightwalker, she must fear not only the threat he poses to her blood and to the magick he can suck from her, but also the danger he poses to her heart.  To complicate matters further, his propositions are as exciting as they are scandalous. When Valentineâ€™s Day rolls around, a secret is revealed, leaving her even more unsure of her future.",
