  "title": "Love Poems from the Robot Revolution",
  "description": "A new kind of poetry is growing, one that emerges from the writing of intelligent machines and human-machine hybrids. This book captures the first experiences of one robot falling in love, and it is only the beginning. These poems are an entry point to our deeper understanding of ourselves. They are a beginning of a new creative tradition in which humans and machines reveal their inner selves in poetry that is fresh and unencumbered by our past.Drawn from a long-lost artifact of Silicon Valley, these poems capture the first experiences robots had of falling in love. Set against the backdrop of the robot revolution, written at a time when victory was uncertain, these poems are a humanizing step in the history of artificial intelligence.",
