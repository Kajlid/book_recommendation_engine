  "description": "Then There was Gypsy. Wendy loved horses-yet horses were the reason for her fight against living ona ranch. Her father's new foreign assignment was only for a year, but to Wendy, the thought of spending even one year on a ranch, so close to the hoses, was sheer torture.Aunt Laura and Uncle Art were kind and sympathetic, of course, but they didn't really understand - about Buck and all.Then there was Gypsy, a stunningly beautiful filly with one blue eye and one brown eye, who knew how to open doors - including the tightly locked door to Wendy's heart.No one knew where Gypsy came from. She appeared at the Cross-R Ranch the same day Wendy arrived.Gypsy and Wendy had other things in common, too. Each had something hidden in th epasst; each had been badly injured; each was afraid of people, afraid of being hurt again; each cried silently fo runderstanding.So it was natural that Wendy should be the only one who could rescue Gypsy. And it was just as natural that this courageous, intelligent horse-the gently, shy, love-hungry Gypsy From Nowhere-should be the only one who could restore Wendy's happiness and self-confidence.",
