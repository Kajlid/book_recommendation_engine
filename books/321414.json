You may also be asking why I agreed to be a designer’s apprentice with no intelligible sewing skills.Cake.Delicious, fluffy, flour-laden, sugary cake—the beginning of my downfall.If it weren’t for that cake, I’d have never bribed Mai Sakamoto for more. We’d have never developed a friendship. I wouldn’t know of her dreams to become a fashion designer. And I’d sure as hell would never have ended up on a reality TV show to help her chase those dreams.Real knight in shining armor moves, right?Our friendship was a match made in heaven… before the show put us up in a one-bed hotel room.Now my lines are blurry and I can’t help but wonder, could Mai be my perfect fit?MaiEvery day I’m battling imposter syndrome, anxiety, and abject terror—and why?Is it for prize money? Fame? The opportunity for my designs to be seen around the world?Nope.It’s because of Theo. Beautiful, hilarious, frustrating Theo.Theodore Garrett believes in me. He believes I’ve got what it takes to win this crazy competition.
