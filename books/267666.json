  "description": "FIVE TIMES THE TROUBLEFive girls who want to do anything but study, and their tutor: A high school boy who's got book smarts and not much else. Futaro Uesugi took the tutoring gig because he was desperate for cash, but when his students--the five beautiful daughters of a wealthy businessman--find five times the excuses to slack off, what can he do?! At this rate, the sisters won't graduate, so if he wants to get paid, Futaro must think of a plan to suit each of them... Which feels hopeless when five out of five of them think he's a loser!",
