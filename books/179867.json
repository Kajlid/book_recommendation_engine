When he meets the enigmatic vampire Mistress Anya from the House Millar, he believes he's found an ally in creating a warrior class to police the vampires and protect the innocent—human and vampire alike.The two goals bring Rory and Lor together, in more ways than one. But Sidhe nobles aren’t meant to love the damned and Rory fights against a rising attraction for Lor, just as Lor pushes every one of Rory's buttons—mostly on purpose.When they team up, using both their magics and knowledge, to save those that matter most and find possible future Guardians, their predesigned realities and perceptions change and twist. As love, hate, passion, and betrayal collide, the only question left is which emotions the pair will grasp and hold.",
