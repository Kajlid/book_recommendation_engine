  "description": "Two old dudes want to kill me. Oh, and one of them is my ancestor…And after centuries of practice, they’re pretty good at the whole murder thing. But at least they want to kill each other just as badly.Now, I’ve taken down a Greek Goddess, worn a Horseman’s Mask, and I ride a homicidal unicorn who hates rainbows with a passion. Some might say sending two senior citizens to a permanent retirement home should be a breeze.It ain’t.Because that’s not my biggest concern.

Because either way, I’m about to have a very bad series of days…",
