  "title": "Outrageous: A History of Showbiz and the Culture Wars",
  "description": "From the preeminent historian of modern comedy comes an expansive history of showbiz and the culture warsThere is a common belief that we live in unprecedented times, that people are too sensitive today, that nobody objected to the actions of actors, comedians, and filmmakers in the past. Modern pundits would have us believe that Americans of a previous generation had tougher skin and seldom complained. But does this argument hold up to scrutiny?In Outrageous, celebrated cultural historian Kliph Nesteroff demonstrates that Americans have been objecting to entertainment for nearly two hundred years, sometimes rationally, often irrationally. Likewise, powerful political interests have sought to circumvent the arts using censorship, legal harassment, and outright propaganda. From Mae West through Johnny Carson, Amos ’n’ Andy through Beavis and Butt-Head , Outrageous chronicles the controversies of American show business and the ongoing attempts to change what we watch, read, and hear.",
