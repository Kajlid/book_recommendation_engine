  "description": "On Yona, Gifted women rule by the sword, and men are property. Running from her life as a Gifted woman, soldier-turned-thief, Roya has rejected her elevated station because of her leader’s corrupt ways. A band of renegade Elderwomen tempts Roya to steal a powerful relic from the Soldia stronghold. That’s the last place Roya should go. For her disloyalty to the Supreme Holder, the ultimate punishment awaits her there—death.  Enticed with the promise of answers about her mother’s mysterious murder, she can not refuse. Against her better judgment, Roya accepts their gift—a handsome manservant, Kaiden. Posing as her companion, Kaiden’s friendship stirs painful memories of Roya’s past. With the trap set, Roya finds herself on a destructive path to steal from the world’s most dangerous woman.",
