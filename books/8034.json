  "description": "Sharon wasn’t well liked, bullied by her brother, ignored by her parents and picked on by the other kids in her neighbourhood.She didn’t care as Sharon had her own special friends, her dolls loved her and she loved them back. If only they wouldn’t stop breaking.The heads kept falling off, glue and stitching just didn’t keep them together. Perhaps she ought to stop using heads from road kill or pieces from her neighbour’s dead pets?",
