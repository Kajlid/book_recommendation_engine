  "description": "Avoiding love is hard. Catching a killer can be fatal. . .  When Rob's sister passed away, she left him her dog and her house. He can handle the dog part, but he doesn't need another home. Especially a fixer-upper the neighbor swears is haunted. Then he meets Bridget, who's working on getting her life back together after a car accident left her scarred in more ways than one. She can't pass up Rob's offer of free lodging, regardless of the shape it's in. Or the roommate that's part of the package. She's never believed in ghosts, but now she's living with one who wants Bridget's help in catching a killer. There's only one problem: the killer has unfinished business. . .99,314 Words",
