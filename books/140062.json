  "description": "All three best-selling books of the Remember Trilogy in one bundle! REMEMBER WHEN, REMEMBER WHEN 2: The Sequel, and REMEMBER WHEN 3: The Finale.  Remember When is the first story in an NA romance trilogy. It will take you back to that time before the real world kicked in, that limbo between adolescence and adulthood, that trial of hanging on to the past while figuring out where the future will lie. With heart-shredding romance, steamy love scenes and hilarious eighties references, readers of all ages will find themselves rooting for Layla and dreaming about Trip for years to come. It's an endearing journey through the tumultuous world of friendship, family and high school…  …and the memory of that one incredible guy your heart just can't seem to forget.  Remember When 2 is the second story in an NA romance trilogy. It will bring you back to that exuberant and riotous time of life in your twenties when you struggled to figure out your place in the world and the person you were meant to be… …and the person you were meant to be with.  Remember When 3 is the third and final book in the Remember Trilogy. It’s a story about taking chances and following your heart… and knowing that sometimes, you just have to learn when to let go.  ***All books are intended for readers 18+ due to some questionable language, alcohol abuse, smokin' hot sexual situations, and 1980s flashbacks.***",
