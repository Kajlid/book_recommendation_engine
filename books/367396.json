  "title": "Possum Kingdom",
  "description": "Rose is seventeen and on the run, desperate to escape an unspeakable home life in Miami. She finds herself in Possum Kingdom, Tennessee, a tiny little town with secrets as dark as the woods that surround it. Here she meets Robbie Jo, her new best friend. The girl is dirt-poor, brilliant, funny...and bloodthirsty. Robbie Jo is a young psychopath. A budding serial killer. She hides her true nature from the people of Possum Kingdom-most of them, anyway. The lucky ones. Rose settles into small-town life with quiet joy. For the first time in her life, she feels safe. For the first time, she falls in love. And she confides it all to her new-found \"sister\". As Robbie Jo plays the townspeople like game pieces, as she digs into past atrocity that is better off forgotten, she draws Rose closer and closer. The battle for Rose's soul has begun. But the stakes are higher than anyone could imagine. \"Possum Kingdom\" is an intimate portrait of love and madness, and an epic story of magic, murder, and outrageous ambition. This is supernatural Southern Gothic taken to a whole new level.",
