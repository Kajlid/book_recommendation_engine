  "description": "Ryker calls it an accident. I call it another betrayal. He didn't want me to leave but didn't fight to keep me by his side. Wronged magically and devastated emotionally, I exile myself to another country, Dorley. Now I perform tricks under a tent, my mystical gifts a common sideshow. Just as Iâ€™m accepting my self-inflicted fate, Ryker makes a move that forces me back to the Valley. But an ancient evil is stirring and follows me. With magical stones disappearing, the power I possess within makes me a target. Old hurts have to be put aside and enemies must unite or an evil strong enough to destroy us all will be unleashed.",
