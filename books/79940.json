  "description": "Nadya, a Riss-human, is now an experienced SAS naval officer, having participated in two battles against the Raider’s cruiser packs. However, because she hosts a Riss—an intelligent parasite—she continues to be seen by many as an alien, generating disgust, fear, raw hate, and attempts on her life.To add to her problems, the Raiders have identified her as contributing directly to their bad luck in fighting against the SAS Navy. They consider her a dybbuk—a demon—and have set a price on her—dead or alive.Nadya alone has deduced the Raiders aren’t a bunch of independent criminals, but clans with their own planet, and with spies on SAS planets and naval cruisers. She needs to convince the SAS, find the clans’ planet—and stay alive. Her life has become very complicated. This is the thrilling sequel to THE RISS GAMBLE!",
