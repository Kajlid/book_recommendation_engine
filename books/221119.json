  "description": "This isn't a novel... it's not a book of poems... it's something MAGNIFICENT!Enter a world of luscious thoughts and decadent desires. Within these pages you will find a momentary escape from the real world as you sink into a sensuous realm where reality, fact, and fiction combine to sweep you away in an unadulterated fantasy.Why is it called \"Not Your Mother's Coffee Table Book?Because, the stories and images inside this book are not fit for younger eyes. They are however, meant to inspire your imagination; to take you on a sensual journey into \"what if\"and \"what may be.\" It's a key to the discovery of the soul, a path less taken, a road you will want to travel again and again. It's something to share with your lover. You'll want to keep it close at hand. Under your pillow might just be the perfect place!The concept for SENSUAL SECRETS: Not Your Mother's Coffee Table Book came to me this Fall. I enjoy writing erotic shorts, snippets of stories, kernels of revelation, simple moments where we can dip our toes into another place, a sensual realm where we can dream and play. Sensual Secrets is a compilation of my sinful shorts, passionate poems, and sexy short stories written this past year, all bundled into a visual feast for your enjoyment.",
