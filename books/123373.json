  "description": "Tobe, the self-proclaimed Sexiest Nigerian in the Universe, has a few problems. One: his all-encompassing, seemingly everlasting virginity, and Two: his best friend is the devil. As in, Lucifer, the ex-angel who tried to rebel against God and whatnot. Day after day, Lucifer puts Tobe through the ringer, plaguing him with gut-wrenching panic attacks and using his aforementioned virginity as a knife. All Tobe wants is to get rid of this stage-five clinger and finally be happy. He almost accepts that this will never happen, until the Devil himself gives Tobe a knife—one that can kill him—on the sole condition that Tobe gets a girl to fall in love with him before he graduates high school.The Imaginary Parts of Lucifer Heart is a love letter to every teen who took their anger, passed it forward, and now just wants to be better—to be happy.",
