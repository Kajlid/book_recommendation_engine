  "title": "Landmarks in French Literature",
  "description": "Though written several years before the author became famous with Eminent Victorians, this book is of the mature Lytton Strachey vintage, sound in judgement, brilliant in expression, and with the clarity and sense of form which are requisite for the criticism of French literature. It is an unsurpassed little classic of literary history and criticism.",
