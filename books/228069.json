  "description": "Samantha Osborne and her three brothers strive to keep Raven Falls, a cattle property on the Northern Tablelands of NSW from being another drought-inflicted statistic.  They organise to have an irrigation system installed but when the assessor arrives Samantha is shocked to find that it's Bradley Harper, the man who faked his way into her heart and broke it in the process.  As the Osbornes' deal with encroaching cattle rustlers, an injured brother and with a near death experience, Samantha and Brad realise they cannot ignore their attraction any longer, except one thing stands in their way.  Will it be enough to send them in opposite directions or unite them until the end?",
