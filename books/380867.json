  "description": "Amoth of Valenwood was an Ellowan—a sylvan race known throughout the galaxy for their music and their sensuality. And with his warm brown eyes and well-muscled form, Amoth was the most sensuous of them all, although he had forced his desires to remain dormant in order to serve as a protector to his people. But as a youth, he had glimpsed a dark-haired woman from a faraway planet, a beauty who inspired harmony in the young prince’s body and soul.Sierra of Nirvahda had never known love. But with her long dark tresses and shining eyes she had inspired plenty of it, only to turn away with a tuneless heart. Yet when she found herself hiding deep within a cavern on the red planet of Tseir, her heart began to do strange things. For with her in the cave was Amoth of Valenwood, the sound of his lyre reaching out to her through the dark and winding passageways. His song spoke to her of yearning, an ache she would come to know when he held her body close to his, with the rhythm of their hearts beating for the memory and melody of their souls.",
