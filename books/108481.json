  "description": "Calista's Men Jory Strong \"Book 3 in the Crime Tells series.\" Have you ever wondered what it would be like with a woman we actually cared about? One who belonged just to us? One who wanted more from us than a good time. A woman we could have together or separately. One who saw us as individuals who came as a package deal? One who was waiting for us at the end of the day? No. No? I like them easy and I like to share them with you. End of story, Benito. Getting involved with any woman, much less one who might ultimately drive a wedge between him and Benito, is the last thing Dante needs, especially now, when his life is already in turmoil. The wealthy, influential family of a murder suspect he killed in the line of duty is portraying him as a trigger-happy vigilante, putting his career and reputation on the line. But as soon as he sees Calista Burke-and witnesses Benito's identical reaction to her-he knows the stakes have just gotten higher and a lifetime of never risking his heart is about to be put to the test.",
