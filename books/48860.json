But still, she was stuck confined in an underground shelter with three men—all totally different, all powerfully sexy. Together, the group faced the threats of the deadly city above ground.Over time, each man succeeded in seducing Grace. And before long, all three wanted her for himself alone. Animosity inside the shelter grew unbearable until Grace finally resolved to end it once and for all… and simply vanished without a trace.It took months for the men to eventually realize that Grace had left them willingly. When they did, hostilities flared between them again. They fought each other, and then fought together to muddle through the complexities of sex, love and their own egos to forge an arrangement that could make them all happy.[Menage Amour: Erotic Menage a Quatre Romance, M/F/M/M, bondage, spanking, HEA] ** A Siren Erotic Romance **",
