  "description": "A story that touches on themes of homelessness, poverty, teen pregnancy and child loss....and finding the light in times of darkness.Set in California's northern wine country, The Road to Hope tells the story of two mothers who experience the earth-shattering impact of two separate tragedies. For Jill, it's when she discovers her two-year-old son passed away in his sleep. For Maddie, it's when her parents kick her out the moment they find out she's pregnant. Both are handed a life neither asked for, forced to navigate a rough road of hardships that include depression and grief for Jill and homelessness, poverty, and abandonment for Maddie. But a brief encounter forces the path of their lives to change course, offering light to their despair, and setting a journey where hope leads the way.Healing from the stillborn death of her son, author Crissi Langwell wrote The Road to Hope as a therapeutic fictional story that addressed the depression and loss of losing a child. Her experience with poverty and young motherhood influenced this story, as well. While The Road to Hope is a work of imagination, the emotions are true, and the story is set in the author's Northern California home region of Sonoma County.",
