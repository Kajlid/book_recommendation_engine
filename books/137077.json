  "title": "The Problem with Crazy",
  "description": "The problem with crazy is that crazy, by itself, has no context. It can be good crazy, bad crazy ... or \"crazy\" crazy--like it was when my ex-boyfriend sung about me on the radio.\" Eighteen-year-old Kate couldn't be more excited about finishing high school and spending the summer on tour with her boyfriend's band. Her dad showing up drunk at graduation, however, is not exactly kicking things off on the right foot--and that's before she finds out about his mystery illness, certain to end in death. A mystery illness that she could inherit. Kate has to convince everyone around her that her father is sick, not crazy. But who will be harder to convince? Her friends? Or herself? The Problem With Crazy \"is a story about love and life; about overcoming obstacles, choosing to trust, and learning how to make the choices that will change your life forever.",
