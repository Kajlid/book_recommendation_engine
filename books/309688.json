  "description": "“How angry are you, Vixen?”Those are the words Whiskey would speak to me before he hate-fucked me when we started all this. I was abused, but he had it worse—missing-kid-on-the-side-of-a-milk-carton worse. We’re both broken, and he’s scared he’s gonna hurt me, but we’re good for each other. I know we are. We can help each other get better.Vixen’s become my entire life, but even she can’t save me when things get too dark. That whole love-fucking thing she taught me is slipping away, too. We’re heading into Hate-fuck Hell. I don’t want to hurt her. But not even the head-shrinker I see for therapy can fix everything that’s going on now. Everything I thought I had—everything I knew about myself—is gone. What little I had is taken away from me, and I hate it. There’s no hope. I can’t even look Vixen in the eyes anymore. As I face the people who hurt me, the world, the press, and their lawyer make me out to be a monster, so I decide I’m just going to have to show them a fucking hellhound. Vixen, the sexy badass that she is, won’t accept that and is forcing me to confront my abductors. I need her next to me and to not let me believe I’m this evil thing everyone says I am. It’s hard to face the people who made my childhood a living hell as I try to put them away, while the rest of the world judges and hates me. I’m crossed between wanting vengeance and seeking justice, which is pushing Vixen to her limit. All I really want is to clear my name. If that can happen, then maybe Vixen and I will be able to find our way back to Hate-fuck Heaven.
