  "description": "Return to Island X is an epic, dramatic science fiction.Tetris, a typical college student had his life completely turned around during a family trip to Las Vegas. His association with mad men began when he had decided to sneak out to play the slots at one of the largest casinos in the world. One minute he was winning thousands of dollars, the next he found himself locked in a chamber with an insane scientist, Douglas who claimed he was a dinosaur. Why? Because dinosaurs who survived the mass extinction to produce offspring who diversified must had supreme luck. He had to believe Douglas when the steroids the latter gave him transfigured him one night. While he had returned to a human form, now he got to see the world from a dinosaur's perspective- and something he sensed was unnerving to say at least. He came to know the existence of \"the department\" that Douglas worked for with the aid of unlikely companions, and he came to learn how Douglas' craziness was merely the proverbial tip of the iceberg. When he saw that he was the only one who was equipped with enough luck - the only thing that could take on \"the department\", he ventured to save the world - as a dinosaur.",
