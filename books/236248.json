  "description": "In this riveting memoir, Judy Rebick, one of Canadaâ€™s best-known feminists, lays bare the public and private battles that have shaped her life. She documents two major decades in her life: the 1980s, when she became a high-profile spokesperson for the pro-choice movement during the fight to legalize abortion; and the 1990s, when she took on her biggest challenge as a public figure by becoming president of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women.Here, for the first time, she also reveals the very private battles she waged during these important decades. The result is a fascinating, heartbreaking, but ultimately empowering story.",
