  "description": "Erika Todd moved to New Orleans because she needed a change - and, well, yes, because that's what her fortune teller said she would do. Not that she'd admit that to many people. But so many of the psychic's predictions - about her work, even finding that stray black cat - have already come true. Now all the lonely sculptor needs is to meet and fall in love with the prophesied dark-eyed prince.Reclusive musician Vittorio Ridgewood has a new neighbour he's been trying to avoid. Sure, she's gorgeous, but she's coming on strong, and the last thing the 200 year-old vampire needs is to get involved with another mortal. Especially since several of his former human paramours have lately been turning up dead.Sensing the relentless beauty needs someone to watch over her, Vittorio agrees to sit for a sculpture, and their attraction to one another quickly ignites. But is passion even this hot worth dying for?",
