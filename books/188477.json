  "description": "Can time predict the future?  In the gripping conclusion of the bestselling EVE series, Jocelyn and Jackson come face to face with the challenges of living combined lives on both planes. While Jackson struggles under the demands of his chosen profession, Jocelyn discovers hidden branches on the family tree. But the more she uncovers, the deeper she finds herself and her family in an uncharted realm that no one considered possible. Can EVE not only skip around with family members but also switch branches?  The happy couple soon learns that a branch, like time, has the tendency to bend in the most unexpected directions and occasionally even break. When that happens, lives are forever changed, the forces of destinies altered, and fates derailed. The fluidity of time begins to take on an obscure meaning as the barrier between the two worlds fades into darkness.",
