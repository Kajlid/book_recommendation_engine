  "description": "I want to f**k my stepdaughter. I know it’s wrong. But my marriage is just a business deal and nothing more. I don’t care if I’m a bad man. I’m going to make her call me Daddy.  I refused to get involved with Julia Hall at first. She couldn’t pay me enough to be her pretend husband.  Then I caught sight of my future stepdaughter and the word “yes” slipped off my tongue.  I need to keep my hands off sweet Sydney. Taking her could ruin everything. Not to mention, she’s twenty years younger than me. Maybe I’m messed up, but when she parades her tight little body around the house, I can’t stop thinking about tasting every inch of it.  I know she wants me too. She gives me those f**k me eyes every day, even though we both know it’s so wrong.  I don’t care if this ruins everything; I can’t resist her anymore. I know she’s waiting for me to sneak into her room in the middle of the night. I’ll open the door, step inside, and whisper in her ear:  You belong to Daddy now.  Possessive Daddy is a dark romance with steamy scenes and bad language. It’s only recommended for readers 18+.  Possessive Daddy is a STANDALONE, full-length novel. No cliffhanger. Guaranteed HEA. Includes bonus content!",
