  "description": "Although Slings & Arrows and Gone are available separately, I felt that as the stories are undeniably linked, it would be useful to combine the two stories – one true, one fantastical answer – in one volume. In so doing, I hope that after reading the events of the first, your mind will be open to the possibility of the truth of the second. Whatever you believe in this world, I’m sure that by the time you’ve read to the end of both tales, you will never think the same again.",
