  "description": "Now a TOP TEN Bestseller! Fake Girlfriend, Real Arousal A woman I’ve never seen before just told her father I’m her boyfriend. I walked into the restaurant to grab dinner between important meetings and there she was, red cheeked and fury in her electric blue eyes. I figure I’ll help her out with whatever she has going on with her father, so I kiss her. If she wants to be what’s on my menu, that’s fine by me. As she melts into my arms, the taste of her lips and the fire in her eyes hits me in the gut. She’s mine. This might be a game to her, but I’m playing for real. And trust me when I say I never lose. I’m going to use my vast wealth and power to get her exactly where I want her. Who knows, I might even tell her who I really am. *** A steamy STANDALONE contemporary romance with a hot bad boy billionaire alpha. No cliffhanger, no cheating, and a guaranteed happily-ever-after. *** Now re-edited ***",
