  "description": "Who the hell answers their front door wearing next to nothing and showing off their monster c*ck?  Finn Thorne, that’s who.  Recent transfer, new quarterback, rumored bad news, and my new tutoring student.  He’s cocky as hell, smart-mouthed, and thinks he owns me the way he owns his opponents on the field.  But he’s wrong.  I have plans. Goals. And I’m not about to get deterred by some sexy football player who screws anything that walks.  Except…before I know it, his cocky, dirty mouth is whispering nasty things in my ear.  And soon our tutoring sessions are becoming less about me teaching him math, and more about him teaching me how good his mouth feels between my legs, how to get him off, how hard and fast he can make me come.  I’m determined not to fall for him.  But off the field, Finn Thorne only plays dirty…  *SNATCHED is a standalone sports romance with a guaranteed HEA*",
