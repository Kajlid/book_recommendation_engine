  "description": "There was a son whose father sent him on a mission to deliver letters. The young man did not understand why he was chosen as the messenger; he only knew that whatever the letters entailed, they could only be understood by the person they were intended for. He soon realized that these letters drastically changed each person's life. The journey and his encounters with these individuals caused this young man to discover a love he never knew. The story was one of transformation for both the son and the people he met along his journey.In the midst of writing this story, something special happened. Instead of me writing the story, I was given the letter. I became the receiver and the messenger. Love inspired me to write, and I was transformed.It is my honor to now share these same love letters inside this book with you. They will speak peace, happiness, and purpose into your life. Without question, you will be inspired by these letters. Though the message is simple and familiar, it is life-changing and powerful.",
