But amid the hubbub of the city s annual sausage festival, Gretel struggles to find any clues that point toward the elusive thief.Even with the aid of the chatty mice living under her bed, the absent prints remain stubbornly out of view, and Gretel is forced to get creative in her search for the truth.\"",
