  "description": "Alternate cover edition can be found here.The day Valerie found out she was pregnant with her second child was the day her husband died. He'd fallen asleep driving. She didn't know how to be a widow. Widows were old, with bunions. Not 26, and pregnant. She moved cross-country from Massachusetts to Oregon, delivered her baby, and sought catharsis in journaling and art. And then there was the dating. Somehow that seemed scarier than trying the spirit medium. During her spiritual journey, she discovered that falling in love again wasn't a betrayal, and soon enough, she was able to wear grief with grace.",
