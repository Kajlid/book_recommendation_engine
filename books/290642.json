He dreams of two sexy mates to bring all of his fantasies to life. When he encounters a sexy cowboy who wants to take him for a wild ride, what does he say? Hell yes!  Coming to ranch country for a picture shoot, Leyland was shocked to find not one, but two mates. Being a tri-omega, he had always known that he would have two mates. He just never expected to find them in the same place. Or to find out that they had been lovers for years. Having two mates is no big deal for Leyland. He grew up with two fathers. But having two mates that were already in love is something all together different. How is he supposed to share Lucas with Jake...or Jake with Lucas? And where does that leave him? \"I have always believed that, while most people see a smaller mate to be weaker, it is not always true. Strength and wisdom come in many different forms, even small ones. And it is usually the one that needs the most protection that holds the relationship together and gives the most love.\" ~ Stormy ~ A Siren Erotic Romance",
