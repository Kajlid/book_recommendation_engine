  "title": "The Universal Words : Identify Your Original Self",
  "description": "Everything is dynamic in this stable form except The Universal Wisdom which collectively guides the self to the states of Awakening & Beyond. Every human being is a super human being not gifted with super natural powers but blessed with super natural sensory abilities which the majority of human beings never realise about in their lifetime. Everything is in a cycle and getting out of it is oneself's biggest task at hand. The Universal Words discusses those integral words of our common rulebook of nature and its living beings. The book is divided in to two parts, 'The Early Phase' and 'The Culminating Phase' metaphorically explaining the two stages of a human's so-called self-realisation journey. It has 60 medium length poems along with 16 'doha' (couplets) and 7 intersections (short poems) arranged in a manner in which the cycle of an individual's realisation generally takes place from being in an Unknown state to being a Learner to becoming an Observer to understanding deep mysteries of Existence to integrating the Self with That Only Self. Time will never arrive by itself, one has to initiate it at first. Read and dig The Universal Words and become more aware of your own ongoing journey of working days and sleeping nights. Get on to an Inner Ride and understand the single reason behind everything which was denied. Realise your True Inner Potential and Reveal for Your Self, its Original Self.",
