  "description": "From city streets where secrets are bartered for gold to forests teeming with fabled beasts, Suyi Davies Okungbowa's sweeping epic of forgotten magic and violent conquests continues in this richly drawn fantasy inspired by the pre-colonial empires of West Africa. After escaping Bassa, Danso and Lilong live in the vagabond colony of Chabo, under the looming threat of the new emperor's bounty. Lilong's dreams of returning home with the Diwi seem all but dashed, until opportunity knocks in the form of an offer from the Gaddo resources for a journey east. In exchange? Lilong must break into a prison.  Events from the heist soon force Lilong and Danso to leave hiding and travel the Lonely Roads East to the seven islands, accompanied by new allies. But Red Emperor Esheme, fresh from acquiring new powers and territories, has other plans. Her relentless pursuit haunts the treacherous journey through the Savanna Belt.  But surviving each other is the least of their problems.  A new power arrives from the Sahel. Something ancient and uncontrollable awakens in the seven islands. Trouble heads for Bassa, and the continent of Oon will need more than ibor to fix what's coming.",
