  "description": "FEATURED ON HUFFINGTON POST!!! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kimanzi...  Joe Pardo wrote 31 Life-Changing Concepts because he strives every day to live by these concepts. How this self-development book is written is important because Joe is a slow reader and does not read many books. A short and intentional book with no fluff was the goal. Joe’s hand-drawn pictures were done with Sharpies to show the power of what someone who “isn’t an artist” can accomplish. The message here is simple: Be Yourself!",
