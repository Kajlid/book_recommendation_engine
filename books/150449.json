Whoever scores the most points wins the game.Kimber’s a feisty young woman enjoying life. No plans for finding Mr. Right. Not when Mr. All Wrong left her in a world of deceit and crushed her spirit.Jax is the epitome of men. His striking good looks turn heads. Lots of them. He walks past Kimber in a cloud of sex andarrogance, and he’s slowly dragging her in to his perimeters. This wasn’t a part of Kimber’s strategy—she hadn’t planned on him and struggles to pull back, away from his striking distance, the kiss of death. It’s a game of command and docility. He’s gaining control.She’s falling prey. When stakes are high and Jax is at the top, will he let it all go for Kimber? Because choosing Kimber will end his game and he’ll certainly fail if he drops out now. And if he backs out, will Kimber still want him when she learns the dirty little fraternity secret?",
