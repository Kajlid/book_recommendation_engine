  "description": "A collection of twenty-three stories from one of the most influential figures in modern Japanese literature.Yasunari Kawabata is widely known for his innovative short stories, some called “palm-of-the-hand” stories short enough to fit into ones palm. This collection reflects Kawabata’s keen perception, deceptive simplicity, and the deep melancholy that characterizes much of his work. The stories were written between 1923 and 1929, and many feature autobiographical events and themes that reflect the painful losses he experienced early in his life.",
