  "description": "\"Who said Immortality was Forever?\" Life trickled by well for Cas, goblins tended to stay dead after getting run through and her partner in crime - Hum, the Giant of whatever place he chose for that week - was still vertical. But that all changed one day in an inn (it's always a dilapidated inn as opposed to a warm meadow or carriage show) when a cowled figure entered her life and bonked it good. Now she's stuck leading a pack of elves, and one ass, through a forestry maze that's determined to keep them from their goal; which she'd happily tell you about as soon as she figures it out herself.",
