Now, they need to deal with the aftermath of their (mis)adventure. Blue hopes to keep what really happened silent, but old resentments and tensions come to the fore, and the rumors can't be avoided. Additionally, though Phe, Kevin and Forrest haven't exactly stopped being her friends, there is a distance there, and Blue is determined to overcome it despite her own feelings of guilt. So, Blue has a new Plan, and mysteries to solve. She's going to get Phe and Kevin together, and Forrest out of his house. And she's going to figure out why she can't stop thinking about a certain red-haired clansman, and what she'd going to do about it.",
