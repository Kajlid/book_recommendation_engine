  "description": "\"...A remarkable, adventure-packed odyssey in Russia.... It will challenge readers to think more critically about international relations and world governments.\"San Francisco Book Review Armed with youthful optimism, a degree in Russian Area Studies, and a desire to contribute to post-Cold War Russian/American relations, Kenneth Maher thought he'd landed his dream job when he joined a US company in unraveling former Communist Russia. Despite his best intentions, he may have gotten just a bit more than he'd bargained for.  Wind of Change  is a keenly observed, insightful, and wry outsider's look at a nation and people in transition and the systems that wield the power, but not the appetite, for progress. Illuminating the communication and cultural breakdowns —from the comical and harrowing—alongside a memorable cast of characters, Maher takes his readers on an unforgettable journey through the Soviet Union and back again.   With astute cultural and political insights and a healthy dose of humor, Wind of Change delivers a front-row seat to the post-Soviet breakdown that foreshadowed Russia's return to authoritarianism.",
