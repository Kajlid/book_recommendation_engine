  "description": "Delaney Collins’s intuition is always right on. The trouble is, she never listens to it - especially when it comes to men. So when her fail-proof dating system fails completely, her best friends, Summer and Josie, stage The Dating Intervention, in which they take control of her dating life. Although she struggles to follow the rules they set out for her, her intuition tells her that if she doesn’t, she may end up alone and forever lonely in a sea of men with stained neckties and cumbersome baggage.",
