  "description": "‘The demon lay face down on the cobbles, still as a fallen statue…’Who can you trust, in a world where not all devils have horns…?Calais, 1454, England’s last remaining foothold on the Continent. Across the Channel, England is poised on the brink of civil war.Matthew Fenton has come to France in search of the nephew of his out-of-favour master, the duke of York. But on his first morning in Calais he is shocked to find the body of a murdered demon lying in the street; and when other demons ask him to investigate the death, Fenton finds himself with more mysteries than he’d bargained for – and more worlds than one in which to solve them.Why was the demon murdered? Who is killing the magicians of Calais, and why? And what is the connection with the disappearance of the duke’s nephew?A Yorkist in a Lancastrian town, to answer these questions Fenton must stay one step ahead of the authorities – and for a man seen to consort with devils and even visit their home world, that includes the Church’s Inquisition.A compelling mystery, a fantastical tale of magic and wonder, An Inquisition of Demons is an imaginative recreation of a society on the cusp of change, making the transition from the medieval to the modern world – a society where violence is seldom the last resort...",
