  "description": "A LITTLE DISGRACE ...Miss Winslowe's \"Wallflower Society\" is less a statement of the ladies' dire prospects for marriage than a pleasant get-together for tea. Still, Daniel, Earl of Colebrooke is outraged that his marriageable sister, Gretchen, has joined such a resigned group of spinsters. Then he gets to know the fetching Miss Winslowe --- hardly a spinster and anything but resigned.A LITTLE MIX-UP ...As attraction blossoms, so does a predicament that could be disastrous for their romance. Gretchen's been discovered in Miss Winslowe's garden with a stone cupid in her hand and a man lying dead at her feet. Certainly Daniel's sister never intended to kill London's most eligible bachelor!A LITTLE SCANDAL ...It's up to Daniel to protect the family name and to keep the unfortunate accident a secret. But when the body disappears, they're all left to wonder just what in the ton is going on --- and where in the name of love could it possibly be headed?",
