  "description": "I have a secret. A deep and painful secret that has been feasting on my insides. Clawing at my heart and lacerating it in a slow and painful agony. If Wyatt thinks that he can just walk into my life and rattle things up, he’s got another thing coming. He’s nothing to me. Scum. Dirt. As good as dead. You see, I have a secret, but so does he. It’s my turn to get my revenge, and I can already taste the sweetness on the tip of my tongue. No questions asked. My secret stays mine. His, however, is about to go up in flames. I’ll love nothing more than to watch him burn. He better look out, because this vandal is about to paint his world blood red. Vandal is an MM romance with hate speech and content that may be uncomfortable for some readers. While each book in the series ends with an HEA, this is NOT a standlone and the series must be read in order. Start the series with Striker: A Dark Bully Romance.",
