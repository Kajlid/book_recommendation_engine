  "description": "USA TODAY Bestselling Author Claudia Burgoa brings us a light-hearted small-town romantic comedy full of a swoon-worthy billionaire, single dad romance, and big laughs. I need a massive break.So long to my cheating boyfriend and betraying roommate.Goodbye hectic emergency room and long hours.When I get an opportunity to take over my grandfather’s medical practice in Luna Harbor I happily accept the chance to try on a new life that holds sweet memories.But I can barely think about anything at all when the new coffee shop/bar next to my practice always seems to be having an impromptu concert.Who sets up a coffee and a bar in the same location as a music venue?Fisher Hannigan, Head Man Child (ok, Keyboardist) of the band Too Far From Grace, that’s who.He’s also the man who can't stop flirting with me every time we meet. He’s having the time of his life, while I’m trying to run a quiet medical practice.Even though he infuriates me, our chemistry is off the charts and I can’t say I haven’t thought about giving him a full physical exam.Until a baby changes everything.",
