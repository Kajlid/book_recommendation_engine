  "description": "Rockwell Terry is a career naval captain who has served since WWI. Now is the dawn of another world war as his ship patrols outside Pearl Harbor. He leads a sheltered life, goes nowhere and sees no one. With the outbreak of the war, his past begins to emerge.  This book was the basis for the 1965 Otto Preminger film IN HARM'S WAY featuring John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Dana Andrews, Patricia Neal, Henry Fonda and others. Bassett served on the staff of Rear Admiral \"Bull\" Halsey, and later managed three of Richard Nixon's political campaigns. The book examines critically and at close quarters the U.S. Navy he knew well from his own experiences - having achieved captain's rank and been awarded a Bronze Star for his services.",
