  "description": "Wind tunnels, torrential rains, and earthquakes tear apart Casden. The cause of the world's imbalance is unknown, but the mounting occurrences suggest there's little time before life ceases to exist. Rydan Gale and Akara Nazreth are the only humans with the ability to wield magic. The tattoo on their necks and the discovery of an ancient book explaining the importance of a blue stone dictate they are the key to the world's survival. But the greatest obstacle for saving mankind isn't the natural disasters, extreme betrayals and magic-fearing men hunting them. It's that Akara doesn't believe the world is worth saving.",
