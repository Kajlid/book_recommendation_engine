Everything wrong with Craig Pelling’s life can be traced back to 1986 and the moment he popped in to a newsagent for a can of Coke. Now in his mid-forties, he lives in a loveless marriage and earns a living in a dead-end job managing an electrical store. He could have been so much more, achieved so much more.But as bitter as Craig feels about his mundane existence, fate hasn't finished with him yet. A series of unfortunate events pushes the hapless Craig to breaking point as his life crumbles around him. All looks lost until he's thrown a lifeline — the miraculous lifeline of a brief trip back to 1986, to relive one weekend as his sixteen year-old self. Will he be able to fix his mundane life? Is it as simple as just reverting one decision he made over thirty years ago? Craig is about to find out.",
