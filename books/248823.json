  "description": "Two years ago, my partner and I battled a doomsday cult intent on opening a gateway into Hell. On the bright side, Skulick and I prevented the end of the world. But the cultists opened a rift to the dark dimension, creating a nexus for supernatural activity, and the Cursed City was born.  Now the Crimson Circle has returned. They have a new leader. A new plan. And the same old appetite to cause mayhem and destruction.  I'm about to go up against my most dangerous enemy--for a second round. But this time I'll have to face the nightmare alone.  Wish me luck.  I'm going to need it.",
