  "title": "The Earl",
  "description": "In this, her sixth brilliant novel, Miss Holland demonstrates once more that the novel of history can incorporate the most serious purpose with the color and excitement of large adventure. At the book's heart stands the 12th century Earl of Stafford, complex warrior-knight, whose private conflicts mirror the discord of England as two rival claimants to the throne tear the country apart in civil war.",
