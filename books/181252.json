  "description": "Rhianna Armand’s world implodes at the death of her brother, the only remaining family member she has left; the man who is more her father than her sibling. Lost and unable to grieve, she careens into the arms of the enigmatic Caleb Ryder, sharing one memorable night with him, a night that will change her world forever. It doesn’t take Rhianna long to realise that not everyone is quite what they seem. As her world turns more chaotic, she is left with a myriad of questions and no discernible answers. What secret is Caleb hiding, and who is the mysterious Jared Hanlon who turns up at her door and begins pursuing her best friend Millie with a vengeance? What did happen to her brother Rafe, and why is she so fascinated by a wolf in the forest?  Her head spinning, Rhianna strives to come to terms with a paranormal world she had no idea existed. The only weapon she has at her disposal; her unconditional love for the people in her life. Suddenly normal seems such a subjective term, and Rhianna must choose which world to call her own.",
