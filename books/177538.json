  "title": "A World Waiting to Be Born: Civility Rediscovered",
  "description": "Just as The Road Less Traveled   provided hope and guidance for individuals seeking  growth, this major new work by M. Scott Peck,  M.D., offers a needed prescription for our deeply  ailing society. Our illness is   Incivility --morally destructive patterns of  self-absorption, callousness, manipulativeness, and  materialism so ingrained in our routine behavior that we  do not even recognize them. There is a deepening  awareness that something is seriously wrong with  our personal and organizational lives. Using  examples from his own life, case histories, and  dramatic scenarios of businesses that made a conscious  decision to bring civility to their organizations ,  Dr. Peck demonstrates how change can be effected  and how we and our organizations can be restored to  health. This wise, practical, and radical book is  a blueprint for achieving personal and societal  well-being.",
