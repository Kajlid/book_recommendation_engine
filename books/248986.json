  "title": "Tales of Ordinary Madness",
  "description": "Exceptional stories that came pounding out of Bukowski's violent and depraved life. Horrible and holy, you cannot read them and ever come away the same again.With Bukowski, the votes are still coming in. There seems to be no middle groundâ€”people seem either to love him or hate him. Tales of his own life and doings are as wild and weird as the very stories he writes. In a sense, Bukowski was a legend in his time: a madman, a recluse, a lover; tender, vicious; never the same.From prostitutes to classical music, Bukowski ingeniously mixes high and low culture in his \"tales of ordinary madness.\" These stories are humorous and haunting, angry yet tender portrayals of life in the underbelly of Los Angeles.",
