Not everyone supports his ideals, however, and having offended the pope by welcoming Jews and heretics into England, David is summoned to Canterbury to explain himself.But when information comes to light that reveals the accusations against him have less to do with religion than with power and wealth, David finds himself on familiar ground--and at the center of a conspiracy that stretches from Ireland to Italy.
