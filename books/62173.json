  "description": "Read 10/52 poems and reviews from MAVERICKS free on wattpad http://www.wattpad.com/story/90631-10...Essentially, these poems are about Man and Woman and Love. Romantic and sometimes intimate, they leave their own footsteps in the rural and industrial landscape of today which resonate our profound need to love and be loved, a need that transcends all attempts to homogenise us into one cultural identity.In these poems romance, chivalry and passion come to life. The Ranger's mind enjoys its exile in the golden forest of Lothlorien wandering through the Pre Raphaelite images. His mythical and mystical ideals, fuse with our thirst for realism and the alienation of pod life in this matrix of Metropolis.Love is more than a singles bar at the end of a hard working week. It is real and tangible, and like life, it makes mistakes. In these poems of love remembered, love now and love to be, exile ends and life begins again.By Connie Calomeni, Poet 21-Sep-2012 on lulu.comThe poems in this collection show Strider’s gift of being able to weave words into creative and surprising configurations. He manipulates words to do his will, taming them with his love for the sounds, rhythms and cadence of language. The result is poetry that is fresh, wild, sensual, and new. His poetry lulls the reader into hypnotic and sensual trances with imaginative renderings of lush landscapes of the mind, body,and nature. “Mavericks” is a wonderful compilation of poems, resonating with a poet’s passion for life, love, and language.http://www.lulu.com/shop/strider-marc...http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mavericks-Str...",
