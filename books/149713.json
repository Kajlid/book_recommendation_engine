  "description": "The Moon Is Calling: Read the Stars! This is a story of a cursed land called Zynpagua. Not many years ago, Zynpagua was a part of the Earth. It was ruled by King Soto and Queen Sussaina. The queen possessed supernatural powers, which she used to bring happiness and prosperity to her people. Zynpagua thus was a very happy land. But an evil eye was watching it. It was the eye of the scientist Drudan. He tricked the king and the queen to ignore their kingdom. This angered the Sun and Stars, and they refused to shower their blessing on Zynpagua. In the meantime, Drudan created a fatal violet light to kill King Soto. The violet light generated catastrophic movements that separated Zynpagua from the Earth, carrying with it all the people on the land. Without the support of the Sun, Zynpagua became a dark planet. Drudan imprisoned Queen Sussaina behind the shadow of the moon, while King Soto could not be traced. Zynpagua became a cursed land. While in prison, Queen Sussaina secretly gives birth to a girl and transfers all her powers to her and sends her to the Earth. Now the only solution to Zynpagua's misery is the return of this princess.",
