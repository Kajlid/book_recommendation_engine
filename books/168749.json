  "title": "Always Have Hope",
  "description": "From the author of the Kellington series of Regency romances, comes the third book in the Emerson saga.  Lady Winifred Pierce has been wrongly accused of the murder of her abusive husband. Despite the best efforts of her family, someone is set on seeing her hang.  Alexander Lewis is the barrister prosecuting the case. He's told it will be the easiest win of his career. But something isn't right. When he objects to the proceedings, he's told to get a conviction or lose the career he worked so hard to attain.  Can two lonely people find love with each other in such desperate circumstances? (Well, yes, it's a romance novel.)  ADVISORY: This book is, technically, historical romance. But it is very light on the history and very heavy on the passion. It contains explicit language and graphic sex scenes. You will not like this book if you don't like either of those things. If you prefer your romances clean, you should run screaming from this book.",
