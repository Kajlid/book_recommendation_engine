  "description": "My bike. My cut. The club. Three things I love most in life. But, my club brother, Magnus is f*cking dead. And he left behind his legacy. A daughter he'd been searching for. I found her. For him. What I don't expect is to keep her. For me. Holy F*ck. Beautiful is an understatement. Raven hair, firm round ass, and an attitude to rival any f*ck head in my club.  Talon's arrival in Brently brings up the question everyone has been silently mulling over for months. Was Magnus' death a set up? And who's to f*cking blame? We never expect the answers lay within our club. Betrayal among the brothers is heavy and no one can be trusted.  The ride ahead will be LONG and HARD, but know I have to protect Talon. To keep her safe. Then I will claim her. Make her f*cking mine.  If you love dirty-talking heroes who love their MC as much as their women, one-click this insta love novella now. Mick is a standalone MC Romance. No cliffhangers, just kindle-melting happily ever afters!",
