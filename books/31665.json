  "description": "In these stories, the acclaimed author of the Reef describes his homeland of Sri Lankaâ€”a kind of paradise in which a sudden moment of silence in a city is cause for fear, where civil war disrupts a marriage thousands of miles away, and where the building up of home, relationships, and lives is more often than not swiftly and violently brought down. A New York Times Notable Book of the Year.",
