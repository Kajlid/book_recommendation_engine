  "description": "What happens when two broken men collide?Marcus Prater has spent the last two years of his life existing, ignoring his friends and family because remembering hurts too much. Benjamin Danvers, running from ghosts of his own, has separated himself emotionally from the world. Neither man needs anyone.When these two men collide again, one life hangs in the balance. Will it break them, or provide more healing than either man thought possible? Friends come together, brotherhood is confirmed, but will it be enough? Yeah, this is the third in the six story cycle so no more nasty cliffhangers. Hot men may have sex, old friends may bond again, and a few tears may be shed. I promise, it was worth the wait. Oh, and look for Marcus and Benjamin again in August",
