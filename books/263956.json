  "description": "The Good Mage  As the ever-rolling wave of magic washes over our universe and inevitably Earth, Solee finds himself and his surroundings instantly and miraculously changed. Where once technology and science had ruled, the world he had known is now governed by the forces of magic. Intent on enjoying his existence rather than working in a kitchen his entire life, he sets out to find adventure, beer and people to annoy. Along the way he meets friends both new and old—all changed by the new world. Joining a caravan guard for lack of a better option, he soon encounters monstrous undead, sentient wolves and more spiders than he can comfortably poke a stick at, along with far more subtle enemies. With great power, comes… some responsibility, however no one has told Solee this.  A story of adventure, deceit and friendship, mixed in with quite a few beers and a realistic amount of vulgar language.",
