  "title": "Voodoo, Slaves and White Man's Graves: West Africa and the End of Days",
  "description": "Crammed into battered buses and less than road worthy bush taxis, or hanging on to the back of a series of pollution spewing mopeds, Tom Coote journeys along the lush but disease ridden Slave Coast of West Africa and then up through the Saharan trade routes into the environmentally devastated dust lands of the Sahel. Travelling through Benin, Togo, Ghana, Burkina Faso and Mali - some of the poorest and least developed countries in the world - we find ourselves amidst a battleground of 'end of days' ideologies. Dealing with such themes as freedom and slavery, the resurgence of superstition and its threat to rationality, the corporate colonisation of the unconscious, and the modern day construction of tradition, this irreverent travelogue will take you to places both magical and macabre.",
