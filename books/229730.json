  "description": "I was a dead man the minute I inked her. I’ve spent ten years as the ink man for the Black Dog MC. When a member wants ink, he comes to me — and I always obey. Because even when you’re not a brother, disobeying the Black Dog is deadly. So they own me. And they also own her. Dani. Beautiful, sweetly sensual, temptation incarnate. The president’s woman — completely off-limits. But when she comes to me for a tattoo, and begs me to get her out of the Black Dog before he kills her, my blood starts to burn for the first time in a decade. And when I realize my own reason for getting out — an inheritance from nowhere that will make me obscenely rich — I have to decide. Stay, and we’ll both be sacrificed.Run, and we’ll both have a price on our heads.Take Dani, like she begs me to, and I might not live to see the morning. Some things, I hear, are worth dying for.Tonight is the night I find out.",
