  "title": "The Frog: A Tale of Sexual Torture and Degradation",
  "description": "Jane is abducted by a sadistic couple intent on reducing her to a sexual object. Drawn into a world where sensuality is blurred and splattered by the harsh brush of abuse, the exploration is as much a matter of the mind and soul as of the body. Jane, called \"Frog\" by her captors, learns to adapt as her world shrinks to the avoidance of pain and the pursuit of pleasure. Ironically, her captivity frees her to finally appreciate a life she took for granted, and even in her sexual prison she discovers small joys and, ultimately, redemption.",
