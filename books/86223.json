But care for her he does. So, even though Jane doesn't fit the criteria, Julio goes against Protocol to bring her back to his utopian world where she can be given a beautiful new body, and offered the kind of life she could never have imagined possible.But for Jane, being beautiful is problematic. She doesn't know whether the gorgeous bad-boy, who has stolen her heart, loves her for who she is or for her beautiful new body. And what dark secret does Julio hide that is driving him to dangerously flout the safeguards set down for rescuing missing children from the past?This is the second in the exciting new time travel romance series, New Atlantis, by Australian author Nhys Glover.",
