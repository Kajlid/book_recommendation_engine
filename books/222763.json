  "description": "When he received a frantic call from his older sister, the last thing Jonah Jacobson expected to hear was that Madison Bishop was having a makeover emergency. Her brother-in-law was the epitome of a lumberjackâ€”from the flannel shirts and unkempt beard to the broad build and mud wrestling titles. But when Jonah arrived to the rescue, he ended up having a night to remember and a date with Madison.Discovering he had more in common with Jonah than their niece was a pleasurable surprise in more than one way for Madison. The only thing he needed to do was show the fashion forward stylist how good they could be together if Jonah allowed him to take the lead. Flowers and crowns might have brought them together, but a massage table would give them their happily ever after.
