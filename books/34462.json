  "description": "Autumn 1944: V2 rockets are being fired by the Germans from Holland against London. They must be stopped, whatever the cost!A riveting and fast paced story of suspense, deception, sex, and betrayal, in a superbly authentic setting.It is early September 1944 and in the West the Allied armies are advancing inexorably towards the borders of the Reich. It seems like the War could be over by Christmas. But then, a 16 year old boy on the coast of Nazi occupied Holland witnesses the launch of Hitler's ultimate secret terror weapon, the V2 rocket. Across the North Sea, the great city of London and its 8 million inhabitants lie prostrate at the mercy of the rocket bombs. Churchill is they must be destroyed. Radio signals are received from a \"sleeper\" agent in enemy territory, and RAF photo reconnaisance locates the launch site. An elite commando team parachutes in to link up with the Dutch Resistance and sabotage the weapons. But sadistic SS Sturmbannfuhrer Aldorf and his murderous sidekick Zharko have other ideas, and a deadly game of ‘cat and mouse’ develops. The tension builds inexorably with every twist and turn, as it hurtles towards an adrenaline pumping and explosive climax..........",
