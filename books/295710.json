  "description": "My little dog, Toto, just shifted into a man. A gorgeous, chiseled beast of a man. That was about thirty seconds before the storm hit and he clutched me against his naked body while wild winds raged all around us.  Yeah, we're seriously not in fucking Kansas anymore. There are male witches with toothy smiles, a man with a tin arm, and some wizards. Some very, very bad wizards--and they're all interested in me. Romantically. How ... interesting.  Oh, and then there's Dorothy, the girl who's claiming that she's the good guy, and I'm the bad one, all because the power to control storms sleeps in my fingertips.  My name is Ozora, Oz for short, and I'm a girl from nowhere, destined for somewhere.  VERY BAD WIZARDS (Book 1 of 3 in the \"Wicked Wizards of Oz\" series) -- is a full-length reverse harem/new adult/fantasy romance novel, a gritty retelling of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". Don't expect a children's tale; these characters are nothing like their more innocent counterparts. This book contains: drugs, cursing, violence, sex ... and love found in the darkest shadows.",
