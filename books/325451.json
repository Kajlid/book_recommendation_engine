  "title": "Again, Dangerous Visions",
  "description": "All you need to know about this book:1- It is the companion volume to the most influential book of speculative fiction in the past twenty-five years, the award-winning \"Dangerous Visions\". Of course, you've heard of \"Dangerous Visions\".2- It contains original stories, written especially for this anthology, by forty-two very special writers, none of whom were in \"Dangerous Visions\". Of course, you remember the writers who won all those awards for \"Dangerous Visions\".3- It contains forty-six stories ranging in length from shorties of 1,000 words to short novels of 40,000 words; each story was written without thought to taboos or publishing restrictions that usually hamper sci-fi writers. Of course, you remember what a mind-blower, in this respect, was \"Dangerous Visions\".4- Each story has its own Afterword by the author, as well as its own individual Introduction by the editor. Of course, you remember the wealth of addenda that made such a milestone of \"Dangerous Visions\".5, 6, & 7- It took over three years to compile this book. It has been edited by Harlan Ellison who put together \"Dangerous Visions\", which you will surely recall. And... this is a more startling book than \"Dangerous Visions\". This book takes off where \"Dangerous Visions\" stopped and it is a BETTER book than \"Dangerous Visions\".",
