  "title": "Stealing the Tithe: The Cursed Nation, Biblical Stewardship, a Crisis of Faith",
  "description": "After accepting the Lord at a Billy Graham/Ralph Bell crusade in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1980, two months before his twentieth birthday, Marvin began serving in ministry with the same youthful fervor he brought into each endeavor. A humble beginning and a poor community fostered a spiritual walk of faith by necessity if by nothing else. Seeing how God abundantly blessed people who had nothing to give but themselves, in faith, he believes he has a good understanding of what God requires of Christians. He finds the current quid pro quo Christian culture, undergirded by the increasingly popular tithing doctrine, troublesome. Especially troublesome to him is the notion that this is Godâ€™s formula for bringing the believer prosperity, health and wealth and is the principal sign of obedience to God. He sees a gaping faith void and observes that the trend is widening that void. There is an exchange of faith for lucre and the Church is blindly stumbling along.",
