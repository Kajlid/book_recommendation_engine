  "description": "RichardMy family is divided, some say we were gifted by the gypsies to prosper and know our soul mate, others feel we were cursed. The divide in the family may have a little to do with the gypsies forgetting to mention that when we Silverman find our soul mate we turn into possessive cavemen.I also thought it was a gift and was filled with jealously when my cousin Stephan found his other half though he believed it to be a cures. But now it’s my turn, the only problem is Bailey Rodgers thinks I’m crazy, overbearing and egotistical.BaileyMy brother Ethan, my guardian since I was six, was finally loosening the reigns and giving me some freedom. Being vision impaired and the only family left, he sometimes took his role as protector too far. I’d convinced Ethan to let me celebrate graduation with a week-long holiday just friends sun and fun.The start of my holiday didn’t start out at all how I had planned when I was kidnapped by a crazy guy telling me I was his soul mate and his to keep forever. Imagine my surprise to learn he is a Silverman and supposedly sane. Richard wants me to give him a chance, but I don’t know if I can handle Richard’s overprotectiveness. I already had that with my brother and I didn’t want it in my relationship.",
