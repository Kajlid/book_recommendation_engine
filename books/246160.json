  "description": "Lady Tabitha's first season had ended in sorrow with the scandalous death of her father and her unhappy parting from the man she was coming to love. Several years later, she returns to London chaperoning her youngest sister, who seems bent on upholding the family tradition of blackened reputations. â€” Much to Tabitha's delight, Lord Lovell, whom she still remembers so well, is quick to bestow flattering attention on her. But her joy soon turns to dismay, for she cannot imagine Lord Lovell's interest remaining fixed on a woman whose family is far from virtuous.",
