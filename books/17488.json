  "title": "Simply Jesus: A New Vision of Who He Was, What He Did, and Why He Matters",
  "description": "In Simply Jesus , bestselling author and leading Bible scholar N.T. Wright summarizes 200 years of modern Biblical scholarship and models how Christians can best retell the story of Jesus today. In a style similar to C.S. Lewis’s popular works, Wright breaks down the barriers that prevent Christians from fully engaging with the story of Jesus. For believers confronting the challenge of connecting with their faith today, and for readers of Timothy Keller’s The Reason for God , Wright’s Simply Jesus offers a provocative new picture of how to understand who Jesus was and how Christians should relate to him today.",
