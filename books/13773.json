  "description": "Today’s stories of alien abduction and experimentation include temporary embryonic implantation. The Sixth Seed, a dark paranormal fantasy fraught with suburban Pittsburgh horror, takes this scenario one radical step further when the first alien/human hybrid fertilization develops to full term in utero.Believing a vasectomy will prevent another unplanned pregnancy, 34-year-old Tom Furst—Melanie’s loving husband and the father of their five children—wants more than anything to dig them out of the fiscal hole they're mired in and become financially secure. However, during the procedure, mysterious Dr. Prindar Krakhil secretly implants a worm-like alien seed in Tom’s vas deferens that not only ensures Melanie gets pregnant, but plants in her womb a child half alien.Their children are abducted. Melanie becomes gravely ill. When Tom loses his job, their home, and the sixth seed is born, will he accept the child for what it really is—and conquer the temptation to exchange it for the money Krakhil offers?",
