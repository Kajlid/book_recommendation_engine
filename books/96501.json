But when he trades her in for a younger actress, Courtney's world topples down around her. With paparazzi on her tail and nowhere to turn, she hides away in a secluded cabin in Colorado with her new (and deliciously hot) bodyguard, Damien Young. As Courtney strives to rebuild her shattered heart, she finds herself drawn to Damien, the man determined to get her back on her feet again.But as a man of honor, Damien won't take advantage of a woman in such a vulnerable state, no matter how undeniable their chemistry is. Author’s Note: A Hollywood Ending is a sizzling, opposites-attract romance. It’s much spicier than a regular Melanie Summers rom-com so you may want to grab a fan (or maybe a glass of cold milk).",
