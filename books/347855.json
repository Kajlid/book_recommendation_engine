  "title": "The Doctor and the Soul: From Psychotherapy to Logotherapy, Revised and Expanded",
  "description": "In this classic work, internationally known Viennese psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl, founder of the school of logotherapy, sets forth the principles of existential psychiatry. He holds that man's search for meaning in existence is a primary facet of his being; if the search is unrequited, it leads to neurosis. The role of the therapist, then, is to help the patient discover a purposefulness in life.",
