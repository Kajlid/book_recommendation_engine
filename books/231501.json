  "description": "Four years ago, I was just an ordinary teenager living an ordinary life. Until someone hid a secret in my mind without my knowledge. And the people who weren’t supposed to, found out…Today, I am the best assassin the supernatural world has ever seen.In a world where people turn into animals at will and others levitate things with their minds, it sucks to not have any magic in your veins. But I didn’t need magic to be a fighter. I didn’t need to float shit on air to learn how to use a dagger.
