  "description": "A missing woman. A businessman who knows more than he is prepared to admit. But keeping secrets can be as dangerous as telling a lie. Withholding information that could get him into trouble during a police investigation into the whereabouts of his young assistant seemed like a good idea to accountant Cal Miller. As a newcomer to small-town Leyton's business community, he had his reputation to protect, but when he discovers that her deceptions far outweigh his, he is plunged into a nightmare of his own making with far more than his reputation at stake.A gripping page-turner showing how the loss of trust can undermine the foundations of any relationship.",
