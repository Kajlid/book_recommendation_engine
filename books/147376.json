  "description": "Veracity Q&AQ: Where I can I find Veracity?As of now, Veracity is not available to read or purchase.Q: Why did you take Veracity down?I wrote Veracity in a frenzy. I loved this book. I poured all of my free time into writing it on Wattpad. It eventually became featured, got reads from all over the world, and started getting good reviews on both GoodReads and Amazon where I had released it as a Kindle e-book. There was a moment (and I'm not sure why) that I fell out of love with it. I won't get into the details, but so much of it suddenly didn't seem to fit who I wanted to be as a writer. I took the book down and didn't touch it for a long, long time. (I have heard that this is normal for an author's first real work, but it was devastating to suddenly have no love for something that had dominated my thoughts for a year. I kept coming back to it hoping that I would reconnect with it . . . but I never did.) Q: Is the new book a straight rewrite?Not so much. I went through Veracity and I chopped it to bits, only keeping the parts and characters I absolutely loved. I then created an entirely new world, one with a rich history and mythology. I gave the characters more vibrant personalities, backstories, and took the time to discover their hopes, dreams, and fears. The plot was stripped down to only the very best concepts and ideas. What was once Veracity became The Last Verityâ€” which spawned several \"spin-off\" stories set in the same universe. Is this a straight rewrite? No. Is it even the same book? Well, sort of. If you read the original Veracity you will see the bones of it in there, no question . . . but the story has become something new.",
