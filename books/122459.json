  "title": "Death in Dutch Harbor",
  "description": "When two murders strain the police force of a remote Alaskan fishing port, veterinarian Maureen McMurtry is tapped by Dutch Harbor's police chief for forensic assistance. The doctor's got a past she'd rather not discuss, a gun in her closet, and a retired police dog that hasn't lost her chops. All come in handy as she deciphers the cause and time of death of a local drug addict washed ashore with dead sea lions and an environmentalist found in a crab pot hauled from the sea in the net of a fishing vessel. When her romantic relationship with a boat captain is swamped by mounting evidence that he's the prime suspect in one of the murders, McMurtry struggles with her own doubts to prove his innocence. But can she? McMurtry's pals, a manager of the Bering Sea crab fishery and another who tends Alaska's most dangerous bar assist in unraveling the sinister truth.",
