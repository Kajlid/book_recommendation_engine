Many people know it as the origin of Shangri-la, but it is also home to the region of Dali, a place that has become synonymous with the province. If you go to Yunnan, you must go to Dali.The region is cherished for its unique food – famed Ham, mushrooms varietals, cheese-making (a rarity in China), and rare herbs; temperate climate, surrounding rivers and mountains; ethnic diversity – bordering Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar it has been a cultural blotter; and overwhelming hospitality – many a traveller has settled in Dali having fallen in love with the Old Town. Mei returns to her childhood home and journeys through the region, sharing a personal and beautifully illustrated chronicle of exactly what makes Dali so special.",
