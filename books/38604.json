  "title": "A Predicament of Innocents: Might the Schools Help?",
  "description": "This collection of essays and photographs by a long-time progressive educator and photographer explores the art of teaching, the minds of children, and how the educational infrastructure stifles the growth of both. The portraits of schoolchildren taken over six decades invite pause and reflection —  what are they asking for? Innocents examines educational practices, debates, and theory, and advocates learning with children rather than teaching to them. This is a passionate book about the intersection of education and the love of learning.",
