  "description": "Return to Hidden Mountainâ€¦Lorelei Stewart has always accepted her role as the town tramp's daughter and has earned her fast and loose reputation. She's a hard woman who pays her way and asks for nothing, but times change. Pregnant and overburdened with responsibility, she's given up on men and has a plan to provide her baby with what she never had as a child; a decent home and a loving mother. The old bootlegger, Rollie Roper, needs a caretaker and has room for Lorelei and her coming child; a fair exchange.Everything's almost perfect until Rollie's long lost nephew, Cob Thornton, turns up with money and plans of his own and those plans don't include the woman living in his house, yet something about Lorelei fascinates him. He begins to see past the cold armor she wears to protect herself from pain and finds a vulnerable and loving woman within. Now all he has to do, with a little help from old and new friends, is convince the pessimistic Lorelei that sometimes, changing times can be a blessing in disguise.",
