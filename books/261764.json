  "description": "\"I’m saving up for an airport, a city center and a park, cause I already own a phone on which you called me to ask if I was coming, always asking if I’m coming as if in another universe you wanted me there. I want to own a dancefloor that won’t remind me of your body pressed warm against my own. Maybe I’ll buy a disco ball instead, to plug it in my stomach, and electrocute the butterflies.\" A poetry collection dealing with consuming love, heartbreak and pain, adulthood and helplessness, anxiety and depression, family, gender identity and sexuality.",
