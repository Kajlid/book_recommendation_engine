  "description": "***All 2 Books in The Effect Series are Now Available***  One small movement can impact the rest of your life, like a set of dominoes lined up one after another. It’s not until you step back and see the big picture that you realize the damage you’ve done…  Brandt Mattox had it all—love, success, and friends. One impulsive wrong decision led him down a path that ended in a prison of regrets. He now only dreams of the happiness he once had before the consequences of his actions cost him everything.  He lost his love—not just any love, but his soul mate.  Nikola Kingston has worked hard to keep the past in the past while she focuses on her career and spending time with her grandmother. On a random night, she runs into the one man who will forever hold her heart captive. Her heart knows she still loves Brandt, but her mind cannot forget the dreadful night that cost her the love of her life.  Will the domino effect of Brandt’s and Nikola’s decisions be too much to overcome? Or will the love they never thought they would get back have an everlasting effect?
