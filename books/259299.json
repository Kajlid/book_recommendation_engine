  "description": "Dave POW Tabain’s schoolmate Stu is being bullied by Johno and his crew. At first, Dave doesn’t know how he can help Stu. He’s ashamed that he just stands and watches, too scared to do anything. Then he remembers that his parents taught him how to deal with people who say and do mean things to others. It’s time to make a plan.Instead of doing his maths work, Dave spends the lesson writing out his POW plan. He explains it to Stu and their friend Bray, and they test it out that afternoon at sport. In a thrilling game of basketball, Stu overcomes Johno’s bullying and their team wins the game. The boys are so excited that the plan worked, they’re pretty sure it could work for other kids too.",
