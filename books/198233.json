  "description": "Bilingual collection of poetry, English and Italian, written on the road in the California Desert from 2013 to 2015. Traveling in the light of the desert is nothing less than a poetic meditation on the landscape as well as the self. The space around and inside is observed, moving in and out of dreams, and of spiritual and geographical realities. Above all is serenity and the choice to live the present fully, leaving behind the past. Silence and the vast spaces are admired and invoked, as well as the chasing of the white spaces between letters or the sandy spaces between one village and another. The texts of the poems, linear and minimal, leave room for the reader to be led on a personal journey. The placement of the words on paper induces the reader to read the poems multiple times during which the sense of the poem will change. You can travel being still, thanks to the writing. The texts collected here are a total of eighty poems, forty in each language.",
