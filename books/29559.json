  "description": "Author Carl Douglas has discovered from colonial American history some simple yet amazingly powerful principles of representational government which he calls \"The Baltimore Principles\" after Lord Baltimore, who in 1650 established for Maryland this groundbreaking form of government with an effective system of checks and balances both horizontally and vertically from the bottom up. These forgotten principles successfully kept the English Crown from dipping their hands into colonial coffers for generations, and once reapplied, will cure an ailing America, effectively restoring true power to the people.",
