  "description": "Award-winning author Connie Brockway takes readers to the elegant drawing rooms and sprawling country estates of Victorian England in this captivating tale of a woman who must keep an irresistible nobleman’s most scandalous secret—without losing her heart. Evelyn Whyte has never forgotten the night she first met Justin Powell—or the shocking indiscretion that left the raffish military hero eternally in her debt. Now, desperate to save her aunt’s foundering nuptial-planning enterprise, she’s ready for Justin to repay the favor. All she needs is his scenic ancestral home, where she’s determined to show the world that even a woman innocent in the ways of love can turn a simple wedding into the social event of the season. Justin is happy to oblige, but his hospitality may place the wedding party in peril. Unaware of the daring double life he conceals behind a cloak of amiable gentility, Evie and her guests descend on North Cross Abbey. Pursued by enemy agents amid a whirl of festivities, Justin vows to keep Evie safe. But who will protect him from the charms of this alluring woman—and the promise of a matchless love worth any risk?",
