  "description": "A blinding snowstorm--and a homicidal maniac--traps a small party of friends in an isolated estate. Out of this deceptively simple set-up, Agatha Christie fashioned one of her most ingenious puzzlers, which, in turn, would provide the basis for The Mousetrap, the longest-running play in history. From this classic title novella to the deliciously clever gems on its tail (solved to perfection by Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple), this rare collection of murder most foul showcases the inimitable Christie at her inventive best, proving her reputation as \"the champion deceiver of our time.\" (The New York Times)Includes the storiesThree Blind MiceStrange JestThe Tape-Measure MurderThe Case of the Perfect MaidThe Case of the CaretakerThe Third Floor FlatThe Adventure of Johnny WaverlyFour-and-Twenty BlackbirdsThe Love Detectives",
