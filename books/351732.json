  "title": "The British Invasion: The Music, the Times, the Era",
  "description": "In 1964, North America had a second revolution—but this time we welcomed the British! That year, four mop-tops known as The Beatles made their first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, ushering in a new era of British music, film, fashion, and art. This richly illustrated and informative volume celebrates the pivotal cultural moment when the United States took on a British accent. The huge influx of talent from across the pond included not only the The Beatles, but also The Dave Clark Five, The Kinks, The Moody Blues, Them (and Van Morrison), The Yardbirds, The Who, and, of course, The Rolling Stones. But the invasion wasn’t only Peter O’Toole, Julie Andrews, Sean Connery, and Michael Caine made a splash in Hollywood, while films like Goldfinger , Alfie, and What’s New, Pussycat? topped box-office charts. The Avengers became cult TV, and Carnaby Street defined hip style, turning Mary Quant, Twiggy, and Jean Shrimpton into fashion icons. Filled with photographs that capture one of the most exciting artistic periods in recent history, this is an evocative, irresistible look back.",
