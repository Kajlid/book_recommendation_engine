  "description": "Erotic ContemporaryJocelyn Rhodes is a single mother with a demanding career and a long-neglected libido. Frustrated with the dating scene and way overdue for some satisfying sex, she takes a friend’s advice and hires Sabian, a deliciously sexy escort. He’s well worth the money, and the sheets haven’t even cooled off before she’s ready to call him again.The more time she spends with him, the more she realizes she and Sabian have important things in common. For starters, she’s a single mom, he’s a prostitute, so when it comes to dating, they’re both damaged goods. To most potential mates, Jocelyn and Sabian are in a category akin to dented soup cans, but if the two of them can look past each other’s respective dents, they just might find something they’ve both been missing.But even if they do find that something, how on earth can she make a relationship work with a man who sleeps with other women for a living?",
