  "description": "In this remarkable collection of fourteen previously uncollected stories, L.M. Montgomery weaves her unique brand of magic as she explores the private passions of the heart. A country doctor never loses faith in the young woman who swears to return to him; a beautiful maiden, in a fit of pique, recklessly pledges to marry the very first man who asks her; an estranged wife bets her future happiness on a horse race; two maiden ladies, scared onto a roof by a dog, ponder marriage to the dog's owner as the price of rescue. These are some of the unforgettable characters whose stories—of romance and friendship, reconciliation and abiding love—live again in an anthology L.M. Montgomery readers will treasure.",
