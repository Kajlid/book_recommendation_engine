  "description": "After getting turned down by the guy she had a crush on for ages, Sakura thought things couldn't get much worse... until she realized that she had been seen! Embarrassed, defeated, and exhausted, the only thing keeping her going was that she was about to meet her cute little step-brother... until it turns out that her \"cute little brother\" was not only a tall, handsome guy in her class, but he was the one who'd seen her get rejected! Now Sakura has to pretend everything is cool, but with an over-protective \"little brother\" who sees the best in Sakura, and an aloof crush who starts to take an interest, Sakura's high-school life will be anything but easy!",
