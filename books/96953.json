  "description": "The,\"Giggle Out Loud, Call your BFF, Read Way Past Your Bedtime Novel!\" Book Description:Every woman has that \"aha\" moment when things suddenly make sense. All of the ex-boyfriends, old jobs, former friends and anemic bank accounts. Those old \"WTH\" occurrences helped you to become the woman you are today. You tried so hard to disguise it, but even though the world saw you as this fierce, fly, fearless female who seemingly had it all together, beyond the facade you were about to fall apart. Meet Christian Cullen. She's a woman of many labels: entrepreneur, volunteer, daughter, sister, soror, friend and occasionally, significant other. She doesn't know it, but she's due for a breakthrough...and you get to be there when it happens. If you're in it for the long haul, maybe you can share in that breakthrough. So what is it that you need to do? Read her journal. Yes, you heard correctly, read her journal. It's alright, you're not eavesdropping...okay you kinda are but you're forgiven. This is honestly the best way to get to know her and to see who she really is. It's okay to laugh, life is a comedy of errors and God definitely has a sense of humor. Just try not to judge, she's only human. A woman in her thirties who's still coming of age, discovering her purpose, accepting her flaws and learning to simply let go and let God.",
