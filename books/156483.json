  "description": "Baptized in battle and bathed in blood, the Emain Macha have lived among humans in silence for the past six thousand years as they pledge their lives to protect them from enslavement at the hands of a maniacal vampire known as The Host. None are more dedicated than Jaden Payne. He has a personal vendetta against his enemy and has vowed to avenge his family’s deaths at all costs. But Jaden faces a new challenge with the emergence of the Firebrand. An ultimate tool of destruction, the Firebrand has the power to eliminate any obstacle in her path, vampires and humans alike.  Alice Roarke knows she’s different than everyone around her. All she wants is a normal life and to fade into the background, but her blackout episodes make it harder for her to fit in. She is unwillingly thrown into the vampire world when Jaden and her paths collide because of a demon who has come back from her past to haunt her again. There’s an undeniable attraction as Jaden keeps her under his care even though they are both damaged souls.  Jaden is in a race against time to keep The Host from harnessing Alice’s powers as well as losing the woman who has found her way into his heart. As passions run high and time runs out, Alice and Jaden will fight the most dangerous battle of trusting each other.",
