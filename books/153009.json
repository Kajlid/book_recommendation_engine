My wife Karen has served as a public defender, private defense attorney, and a prosecutor during her long and esteemed career. She reads every word I write in all my books. As a result, all of the legal matters that ended up in this novel were assiduously vetted by someone who is intimately familiar with the law and its practical application.SDShe was framed for murder. Three times.Rebecca Moreland has a picture-perfect life—until the day it shatters. When someone close to her is murdered, all evidence points to Becky. Convicted and imprisoned, she refuses to accept defeat. With nothing but her wits, she uncovers the truth, exposes the real killer, and wins her freedom.Then it happens again. Another murder. Another wrongful accusation. This time, she clears her name before the bars can close around her.But the third time is different. The love of her life is dead, and the case against her is airtight. Sentenced to life in prison, Becky has no way out—until a new inmate arrives with a secret that changes everything.INNOCENT AGAIN is a gripping legal thriller of betrayal, resilience, and the fight for justice. But beyond the courtroom battles and prison walls lies a deeper truth—sometimes, the hardest fight isn’t proving innocence, but learning to forgive.",
