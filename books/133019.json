  "description": "Filled with sweet, sexy and heart stopping moments Where There's Smoke is a fast paced, adrenaline packed romance!!! -- Amy @ The Reading Realm It's action-packed, mysterious, sweet, and sensual in all the right places! -- Erica @ Back Porch Romance Where There's Smoke had me on the edge of my seat multiple times. The combination of emotions, sexual tension and action kept me completely enthralled in this book. I couldn't think of sitting it down until I'd finished. -- KimberlyFayeReads There is something to be said for letting go. Ryland Roberts knows that better than anyone. He'd let go of his ambitions, of his family and—most of all—of her. He'd perfected the art of putting his past behind him and accepted the fact that the town he wanted to leave in his rearview was the place where he was going to live out his days. But sometimes the past doesn't just go away. Sometimes it comes back to haunt you. Piper Jameson convinced herself that she left for all the right reasons. She'd saved people by leaving—made sure that they weren't tainted by her rebellious ways. When her little sister asks her to come home and say goodbye to their ailing mother, she's forced to see that things aren't always as they seem. The people who she'd left behind might not have been saved at all. In the amount of time it takes a bullet to travel from point A to point B, Piper and Ryland will have to put their feelings for each other aside and make a choice. Forced on the run with Piper's sister, they begin to understand that the future they thought was gone was never really lost. 17+ Audience",
