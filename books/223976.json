Something is off with the mecca and if she doesnâ€™t fix it the fae might just make another earth side appearance.  Now she must work with the king of the bears to save both of their people. Which is easier said than done when he tempts her in every way and a relationship between them is forbidden. One slip up could cost her everything and in the NYC mecca someone is always watching.",
