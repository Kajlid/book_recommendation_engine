  "description": "Force Me: The Hunter - A Forced Seduction/BDSM Novelette He's stalking me through the woods. Hunting me down as though I'm his prey. I don't know exactly what he wants, but the desire in his eyes means I can take a good guess. I'm the object of his lust, and once he's caught me, he intends to have me. Is he going to hurt me? I think he might. One thing is for sure - I'm in for a wild ride. This is a standalone novelette of around 10,000 words, with no cliffhangers and a twist that will make you jump out of your seat! Warning! This book contains scenes of forced seduction and dubious consent. If you find this offensive, please do not buy this book! If you're into this kind of thing though, well - you're in for a wild ride too!",
