But now he's awakened and collared, unable to use his powers and alone in the modern world. His only company is his insane adopted cat and Faye, the curvy, sweet neighbor who makes his dragon sit up and say ‘mate’. Too bad the only woman he finds irresistible has no trouble resisting him.Faye doesn’t know what to do with Red. He’s always causing trouble, between his cat making noise at all hours or the women constantly chasing him. But he isn’t like the hot jerks she has met in the past. Yes, he’s sexy, with green eyes and a body to die for, but he’s also kind, funny, and needs her help. He’s also willing to protect her from her ex. So despite her mistrust of men, he might just be slowly winning her over.Though men have let Faye down, Red is sure she just needs the right dragon to help her find her wings again. He just has to do it before the evil creatures after them catch up.",
