  "description": "Fox didn't come to the library to read a book--he came to catch a mouse! But  Mouse offers the fox a book, Fox gets all sorts of creative new ideas.  Like eating chickens!  Until Chicken points out that chicken bones are dangerous. But then all the animals must band together when the chicken eating, hating-Farmer walks into the library.  • The adorable antics of Fox should be of interest to all booklovers…librarians, booksellers, and parents! • Books about books and libraries (such as Library Lion) have a built in appeal.",
