  "title": "What Looks Like An Elephant",
  "description": "The book contains over 80 poems dealing with ambiguities and paradoxes in experience, especially how impressions of certainty and doubt affect everyday life. Ed Nudelman (author) has tried to call on influences in his vocation (he's a cancer research scientist in his other life) as well as child and adolescent memories, and hopefully mixed in some humor and poetic metaphor.",
