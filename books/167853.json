  "description": "The craftsman and freemason's guide : containing a delineation of the rituals of freemasonry, with the emblems and explanations so arranged as greatly to facilitate in acquiring a knowledge of the rites and ceremonies of the several degrees, from Entered Apprentice to that of Select Master, and the order of priesthood.Excerpt:Having examined the manuscript pages of a work prepared by Bro. Cornelius Moore, entitled, \"The Craftsman, and Freemason's Guide,\" I have no hesitation in commending it to the favorable consideration of the fraternity in Ohio, and elsewhere, as a useful, convenient, and compendious Text-Book, for the use of Lodges and private brethren. It is a judicious compilation from standard masonic authors; and in point of the arrangement of its matter, is preferable in my estimation, to any work of the kind which has fallen under my observation. Especially in the hands of those upon whom devolve the active duties of the Lodge and Chapter, it will be found a ready and acceptable Manual of masonry. By the exclusion from its pages of much that is interesting chiefly to those of far-reaching curiosity - while all is retained that is necessary for the exemplification of our principles, or to aid in the practice of our rites - the work is brought within a convenient compass, and is afforded at so low a price as to place it within the reach of every brother.",
