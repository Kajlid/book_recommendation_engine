  "description": "Setting â€“ Modern Day Rebecca is a little older now and after her first year at University, common sense rears its head a little too often for her liking. She finds herself applying rational thinking to all that life offers, and this includes her previous meetings with Meredith and the information within the three boxes. What university could not teach her was how to prepare herself for what is about to happen. Again, all balanced thinking is going to tumble into a world beyond common sense.",
