  "description": "When professor Peyton Cache bought a big, gloomy, romantic Victorian house, he should have expected a ghost. He certainly got one, the kind that likes to float his undies around and drop slime in the stairwell for fun. But the professor can't let the rest of the faculty know he's lost his mind, so he hires a ghost hunter on the down-low. But somehow, when he booked a ghost hunter, he didn't think that he was getting a live-in leggy blonde with an attitude like a Jersey gangster and a body like a pinup poster...Kaci Melton needs to hide out for a while, and where better to disappear than a haunted house on one of her dad's ghost-hunting jobs? All she'll have to do is deal with a crabby old professor for a couple of days and kick out one measly ghost. Two the professor is a tasty young guy with piercing blue eyes, six-pack abs, and a penchant for talking dirty. And the ghost scares the panties off her...actually given the professor, maybe that's not a problem. But if she can't",
