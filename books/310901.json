  "title": "63-DAYS in the life of Brendan Anderson: sailing, leaving school and a strange turtle girl",
  "description": "Brendan Anderson is graduating in eight weeks, and in his seventeen years, he’s learnt that a lot can happen.There is practice for final exams, end-of-year assignments and cramming 12-years’ worth of learning into six exams – as well as evading the question of what he’s going to do for the rest of his life. Add to this his dad’s cancer …should he really be fixing up his grandfather’s old boat? Brendan has it totally under control …until his friend goes missing, unravelling a tangle of lies, and exposing how complex being an adult can be. Do bad things happen instead of good, or do they both exist in balance? Does the pressure stop as you get older, or do you learn to live with it? …and what is he going to do for the rest of his life?",
