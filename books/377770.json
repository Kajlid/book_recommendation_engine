  "description": "Nicky is the least popular girl in school, so when the popular kids briefly befriend her—out of boredom—she'll do anything to keep them, including picking on the new girl. At first it's easy since everyone thinks she's weird anyway, but when does weird become witchy? Is it when Bella's skin breaks out like a plague? Is it when Mags and Janet end up in the hospital? Is all of this normal teen stuff or evidence of witchcraft? As Nicky's plan reaches its shocking conclusion, she discovers that she has not only lost her friends but also unleashed something truly evil in the process. This compelling thriller explores just who the real witches are in teenage life.",
