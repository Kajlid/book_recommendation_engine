  "description": "From Publishers Weekly: \"Incredibly dense and colorful.\" For those who live agelessly in the shadows of the world, sustained by blood, history is not something that happened to other people. In twelfth century Europe a web is spun in those shadows to contain the ambitions of an immortal emperor. But, when history is a memory, the greatest danger comes from what has been forgotten.",
