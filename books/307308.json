  "description": "While on a NATO exercise in Norway, ace Marine chopper pilot Makato McShane discovers a threat unlike any humanity has ever faced . . . a race of stone giants. Thirty feet tall, impervious to missiles and shells, they lay waste to one city after another. At the height of the conflict, another monster appears, one straight out of legend. A fire-breathing dragon! But is it friend or foe to humanity? McShane and mythology professor Ylva Tande team up to find the origin of these creatures and hopefully a way to stop them. Should they fail, Norway, and all of Scandanavia, could face utter devastation.",
