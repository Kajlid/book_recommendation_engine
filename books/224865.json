Harry Hunt of the Royal Society is called to investigate, for the dead man is Sir Jeffrey Hudson, the Queen's dwarf, a fierce warrior for the Royalist cause, who once killed a man in a duel. But no one knew of Hudson's death...except the murderer. For years, an imposter has lived in Hudson's place, working as a spy.

There, he becomes ensnared in a city obsessed with poisoning. With the help of a cross-dressing aristocratic swordswoman, who has schemes of her own, Harry embarks on a desperate race to return to London. He must save the Queen and all who gather for her Catholic Consult. He must save them from the Clockwork Assassins.
