  "description": "Paris at Night - already we're expecting something special. And that's exactly what Gary Zuercher gives us in this gorgeous collection of photographs and this fascinating history of the bridges. Over a period of five years, he took his cameras out into the Parisian night to capture stunningly evocative images of the bridges that span the Seine. Using his artistic eye and sophisticated photographic technique, he created these glorious black-and-white photographs, rich with detail and possessing a clear, luminous, quality. This collection is unique, and remarkable. No one else has ever photographed all the bridges that cross the Seine in Paris in this way. We don t see crowds of people, or heavy traffic. Nothing obscures the beauty and strength of the structures, the romance and symbolism of the bridges. Shooting in black and white allows the details to shine: the architectural elements, artwork, nearby buildings, trees on the riverbanks, and starry lamps casting paths of light across the water.\" Finished with the shooting he spent painstaking hours researching and reporting on the history of the bridges, spanning the period from Julius Caesar to the death of Princess Diana under the Pont d'Alma and up to current day. A fascinating read.",
