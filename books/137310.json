  "description": "Drake Colson has seen more than his share in his short-lived career. Fighting off rebels to protect women and children in third world countries has taken its toll on an otherwise formidable man. There are only so many times a person can witness unfathomable brutality inflicted upon innocent women and children before he cracks. Drake cracked and went to the only family he knew could help. His brothers, and the MC his father started many years ago. His mother's side of the family shut him out when he ripped up his college degree and picked up an AK-47. Sherry Moore has been working three jobs for two years trying to pull her life back together. Twelve years ago she married a man she thought she knew, only to find out he was exactly the opposite. Now she spends every waking moment working to save enough money to see her two beautiful daughters. In order to get her freedom from abuse, and put an end to the torture her ex-husband forced her children to watch, she signed away her rights and left San Diego for Phoenix Arizona. She went a little too far and landed in the small town of Apache Junction where the infamous motorcycle club Exiles gave her a job in their bar. Drake took one look at Sherry and knew he had to find his voice and his sanity again if he was to have any hope of getting to know this dark-haired beauty better. Sherry knows better than to let anyone get close, not just for her heart's sake, but also for the safety of her children. Will a damaged ex-mercenary with a bad disposition be enough to take down one of California's most disturbed millionaires? Maybe not, but once the club gets involved, the scales tend to tip with the weight of Exiles.",
