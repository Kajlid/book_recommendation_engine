  "description": "When monsters need a makeover, they head for the one place that can make it happen. Hollywood. Book 1, Monsters in Hollywood series. Luke is desperate to save his people. A lifetime of sneaking in to human houses and watching movies has convinced him that if he can make a great movie about monsters, humanity will change its opinion of them. With his friends at his side, all in shiny new human bodies, Luke heads for Tinsel Town. A rising Hollywood producer, all-business Lena knows a good story when she sees it. Luke? He’s just another amateur who wants to get famous. But Luke’s too gorgeous to pass up. And there’s something vulnerable about him that leads her to throw caution to the wind and invite him to dinner. One night of incredible sex later, Lena wakes up next to the surprise of her life. She’s sleeping next to a monster. Literally. Appearances aside, she finds herself wanting to help Luke save his people. But they’ve got more to worry about than just human prejudice. Some of the monsters would rather stay in the closet—and to make them all stay there, they’re willing to kill. Warning, this title contains the multiple orgasms, spanking, misuse of kitchen utensils and sex with monsters.",
