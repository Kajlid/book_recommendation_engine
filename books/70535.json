  "description": "Dawn sees dead people. Unfortunately, she sees her dead uncle, in the form of a raven, every day, too. But seeing and speaking to the dead comes in handy when you're trying to find lost children. And Dawn is going to need all her powers in her next case while she tries to rescue a little girl kidnapped by her ex-felon father. Unfortunately, the dead person helping her with the case isn't all that helpful: it doesn't speak.Turns out it can't - because it's a baby.Now Dawn is racing to save a lost little girl before it's too late - while trying to find a murderer and put to rest a dead infant.Whoever came up with the saying \"Rest In Peace,\" had clearly never been a Necromancer.",
