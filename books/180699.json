  "description": "Wolf shifter, Malcolm Burke, lives an ordinary life and that’s just the way he likes it. Until Willow Tanner waltzes into his office and into his life. Perky, odd, and human – his new receptionist is definitely not what he’s looking for. So why does his wolf so vehemently insist Willow belongs to him? And why does he find it so difficult to resist her sweet kisses?Willow Tanner knows what she wants, and what she wants is the grumpy but deliciously sexy Malcolm Burke. The wolf shifter makes her entire body tingle, and she’s not going to let a silly little thing like him being a paranormal stop her from coaxing him into her bed.Determined to prove she’s no ordinary human, Willow uses her special abilities to help Mal and his partners at the security firm. But when her curiosity and eagerness to help lands her in trouble, Mal will do whatever it takes to keep her safe.Author’s Note: This book contains explicit and steamy sex scenes that may not be your cup of tea. It is intended for mature readers only.",
