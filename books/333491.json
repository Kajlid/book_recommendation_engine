  "description": "WillaWhen my creepy boss at work won’t take no for an answer, I do what I must. I make up a boyfriend. It should’ve ended there, right?Nope.When that same creepy boss, presses me for proof at a company outing––a professional baseball game––I point to someone off in the distance. A guy with his back to me and exclaim, “That’s him! That’s my boyfriend.” When I have no choice but to wrap myself around him, I cross fingers and toes that he’ll play along.HudsonI’m a bit startled when a pretty girl with all the curves wraps her arms around me and promises me twenty bucks to play along. The second I saw the weird dude following close behind her, I knew this wasn’t a game––that there was more to her ask than just a bit of fun. So, I did what any single man in this situation would do. I pulled her close and played along.Of course I played along.",
