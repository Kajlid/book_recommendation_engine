  "description": "How many times should a man propose before finally giving up?\n He thought his adventures were over.A rogue reluctantly turned rector, Alexander Hawksworth, prefers soirées to sermons and parties to prayers. Though impoverished, he seizes every opportunity to escape parish duties, preferring to hob nob with London’s finest–especially after the precocious and petite Brette Culpepper arrives in Town. When he unexpectedly inherits an earldom, he’s determined to make her his countess. Until he’s accused of murdering the previous earl.Then she burst headlong into his life.New to Society, Brette adores the whirlwind social scene, the stream of invitations, the slightly-sensual verbal sparring with the devilishly attractive, much too witty, and oh, so unsuitable Mr. Hawksworth. But her fairytale existence crashes to a halt when rumors circulate she’s a peer’s illegitimate granddaughter, and a newly appointed guardian emerges, intent on forcing her to wed an elderly degenerate.Time is against them as Alex struggles to clear his name and deliver the woman he loves from an unthinkable fate.\nCaution:\n This book contains a rector too sexy for his own good, a match-making, meddling miss who finds herself in one conundrum after another, an endearing portly Welsh Corgi, and a troupe of well-meaning, interfering cousins and sisters",
