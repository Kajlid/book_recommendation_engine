  "description": "Crispin Mayo was a stranger to the law of the gun. He had come west from Ireland to seek his fortune-- one man with nothing but his fists to protect him. What he found instead was trouble. A cutthroat band of Confederate renegades were planning a train kidnapping. It was none of Mayo's business-- until the desperate plea of a lady changed his mind. Soon the diehard rebels would be very sorry indeed they'd ever crossed paths with the lone man from Skibbereen.",
