  "description": "Beaten once again and left for dead by the man she should have been able to trust with her life, Kate awakened from a coma to discover that not only has she lost the precious baby she carried, the beating also damaged her internally so that doctors didn't think she would ever conceive again. As if that weren't enough, Kate is also nearly blind due to the injury to her brain.  Scarred-not only physically, but emotionally and spiritually too-Kate moves in with her childhood friend to try to recover. Eventually her physical body begins to heal, but her emotional state seems to deteriorate with each passing day. It isn't until Patricia Daniels, an Irish psychotherapist, comes into her life that Kate finally starts putting the pieces back together in her shattered life.  Patricia takes Kate with her on holiday to Ireland and Scotland. Through a series of kindhearted Celtic men, brick by brick Kate is finally able to bring down the fortress she's built around herself. The only question is whether a shattered shell of a woman can love wholeheartedly.  Heart Shaped Shards is not only an endearing romance, it is a story of triumph; a testimony to the perseverance of the human spirit. This novel deals with the difficult subject of spousal abuse, but leaves the reader with the knowledge that there is always hope...and when there's hope, amazing things can happen.",
