This is the setting for Zollocco, a comedic sci-fi fantasy in which a human woman finds herself transported from a dying Earth to the forest world of Ipernia, a place where plants and trees walk and forest life behaves as a collective consciousness. Hunted as a beast by an interplanetary corporation of human settlers, she embarks on a magical adventure, traveling between cities, continents and worlds, embracing alien cultures and languages, yet always longing to return to the Forest Zollocco. But as she proceeds on her journey, she begins to uncover a secret that may yet save Earth from destruction.",
