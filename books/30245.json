  "description": "'The Cadre' claims to have Christ's body preserved and hidden in an ancient tomb.For journalist Art 'Mac' Mackenzie, the scenario smacks of an alien agenda. He determines to unearth the truth at any cost. But the Cadre doesn't surrender its secrets easily. Mac's former editor, Jim Cranston, has been found wandering among the ruins of Machu Picchu with burns on his body and in a constant state of fear.Worse yet, General Roswell, Mac's inside connection in the secret government-alien cooperative, is dead of cancer. However, Roswell has left behind two potential bombshells: a set of files with far-reaching implications, and a link to the aliens that he has kept secret for years.With Mac hot on Roswell's trail, the Cadre moves forward with its agenda: to convince the world that Jesus was just an ordinary man granted miracle-working powers by the aliens. The Cadre must be stopped before they can publicly unveil the fraudulent body of Christ, an event that could precipitate a global and apocalyptic shock wave. Mac is swept into a race against time in which losing is not an option . . . but winning could cost him all.",
