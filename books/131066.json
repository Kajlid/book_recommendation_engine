  "description": "\"In a hilarious spoof of the counting classic Over in the Meadow, Silverman deposits two escaped convicts in a haunted house, and then lets the inhabitants scare the escapees back to prison. Cheerfully rendered ghoulies accompany each delightfully understated rhyme... A hit if read aloud or read alone, no matter what the time of year.\" â€”Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books",
