  "description": "Detailing the impact of the AIDS epidemic and the Lebanese civil war in Beirut on a circle of friends and family, \"Koolaids\" tells the stories of characters who can no longer love or think except in fragments of time, each of which goes off along its own trajectory and immediately disappears. Clips, quips, vignettes and hallucinations, tragic news reports and hilarious short plays, conversations with both the quick and the dead, all shine their combined lights to reveal the way we experience life today in this ambitious novel.",
