  "description": "Our relationship starts off like a bad joke.  A gorgeous guy walks into a bar and says to me, “Do you want to F#ck?” and damn if I don’t say yes.  And that should have been it—the punch line.  We never should’ve seen each other again.  Only we do.  Turns out sex on a stick, Ryder Wilde, is more than an orgasm-giver. He’s a player. Not just any either. A Major League Baseball pitcher. And damn, I want to be his catcher.  Except he doesn’t want to play any games or follow my rules: No relationships. No falling in love.  Because he’s used to winning … and wants to claim me as his prize.  His mission is to own me, body and soul, no matter how much I push him away.  Powerless to stop him, I can only hope my heart isn’t another casualty of his fastball.",
