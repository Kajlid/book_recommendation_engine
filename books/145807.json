  "description": "Little Black Dress has fallen head over heels in love with the one and only Julie Cohen - and when you pick up one of her clever, funny and oh-so-sexy romances, you'll know why...Private investigator Sophie Tennant has realised knowing everyone's dirty little secrets isn't that much fun. Retraining as an aromatherapist should rebalance her karma -- or so she thinks, until she goes on tour as resident de-stresser with a rock band whose moody, magnetic frontman Dominick Steele is none other than her very first honey trap. Yes, the man she pretended to seduce in order to shop the evidence to his broken-hearted wife, spelling the end of their marriage. Dominic may be a reformed character these days, but Sophie hasn't forgotten the games he used to play! and he certainly remembers Sophie. A little bit too well!",
