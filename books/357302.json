  "description": "Two months ago, 23-year-old Tressa Jayne Turner knew just where she stood with \"Ranger Rick\" Townsend. Sure, he's what you'd call hott with two t's, but he's also responsible for her nickname \"Calamity.\" And ever since they solved that murder last summer-ever since Rick saved her cookies-he's acted as if he has a god-given right to sample them.Of course, Tressa has bigger frenches to fry. The Iowa state fair is about to start, and her uncle Frank's ice cream stand is poised to scoop the competition. So when a soft-serve saboteur appears at the same time her cousin goes missing, it's another fine sticky mess. It's time for Tressa to don her hot pink cowboy boots and solve the mystery.",
