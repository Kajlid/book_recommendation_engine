  "description": "Backworld tomboy Alba \"Al\" Domici is an adventurer. With her side-kick Wilbur, Al trains hard, rides her bike like a star fighter, and does repairs after every crash.Then life spirals out of control. Strangers show up and know everything. Her family isn't quite what she thought. Scratch that, her family is nothing like she thought: the family dog probably has deep, dark secrets. Al crashes every relationship possible and then must face thugs, wearing a dress, mutiny, tough coaches, and weird prophecies from the Mad Knitter. Someone who \"isn't exactly a spy\" offers to help, and Al must choose; be like everyone else, or risk being herself.",
