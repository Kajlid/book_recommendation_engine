  "description": "The book is structured around six locations where Goldsworthy has worked over recent years - the semi-desert of Santa Fe, the verdant landscape of New York State in which Cornell University is set, Nova Scotia, forest and coastal areas in Holland, a geological reserve in the south of France and, of course, the area around his home in south-west Scotland. Rich insights into his working methods are provided by the artist's diaries which deliberately document the failures as well as the successes and vividly evoke the ways in which he familiarises himself with a new locale and begins to 'touch' it.An erudite and fully illustrated chronology compiled by Dr. Terry Friedman provides an overall account of Goldsworthy's career to date, showing, among other things, how particular forms often take many years to become fully developed.With a selection of more than 500 illustrations, Time is destined to become the definitive reference source on Goldsworthy's sculpture.",
