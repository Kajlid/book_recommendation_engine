  "description": "I thought it was what I wanted. Kept locked away in a dark basement only to be pulled out and used on occasion. I know it sounds twisted and I know most people don't understand, but I'm just wired that way, I guess. I knew what I was getting into when I handed myself over to my Master. Didn't I?He came out of nowhere. The new, handsome man in the nice suit. I don't know what he's doing here with his beautiful, stormy eyes and elegant, capable hands. But if Master is going to sell me... I hope it's to him. WARNING: This book contains graphic material that may not be suitable for all readers.",
