A master horse soldier, Mosby was the scourge of Union forces in Northern Virginia or, as the region came to be known, \"Mosby's Confederacy.\" First published posthumously in 1917, 'Mosby's Memoirs' provides an extraordinary record of the war in Virginia as well as the studied, first-hand insights of one of the Confederacy's most formidable soldiers.John Singleton Mosby was born in 1833 at the home of his grandfather, a Revolutionary War veteran, in Powhatan, Virginia. Mosby participated in the First Battle of Bull Run and later received a commission as a lieutenant and then as a captain. He formed his own cavalry unit, which became known as Mosby's Rangers, under the Partisan Ranger Act.Includes index and list of suggested readings.A volume in the Barnes & Noble Library of Essential Reading.",
