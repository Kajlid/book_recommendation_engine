  "description": "Rico was always up for a good time.A little naughty fun with no strings attached.But the past six months have shifted his priorities. Changed his wants.Sharpened his needs.And what he needs is the sweet new-hire with the face of an angel.Lennie is the type of woman he would never have given a second glance before the men around him started falling into a life Rico used to swear would never be his.She’s sweet and soft and smart, but stubborn and wickedly surprising in the best possible way.The problem is, Lennie came to Alaska for a reason.A reason that could steal her away before Rico can claim her for himself.****Lennie expected Alaska to be an adventure.A needed escape from a breakup that hurt her pride more than her heart.Hearing you’re too stuck up and frigid to love is more than enough to make a girl reevaluate all she is.All she wants to be.It’s why Lennie went to Alaska. To be what she never could before.A woman who sees what she wants and takes it without embarrassment or fear.And what Lennie wants is Rico.He’s got bad boy written all over him and her fingers itch with the need to trace every line inked into his body.But Rico isn’t what she expected him to be. Beneath his laid-back attitude hides something very different.Something that pushes her boundaries and stretches her limits.And makes her question everything she thought she knew.***Advance by Bounds is a complete stand-alone set in the world of Alaskan Security. You do not have to read the first five books in the series to enjoy Rico and Lennie’s story.***",
