  "description": "My name is Landon Hamilton.  I’m in hell.  I was sacrificed to save the world, and imprisoned with the very thing that sought to destroy it.  It wouldn’t be so bad, except the love of my afterlife is stuck here with me, and the monster in this cage has all of eternity to make us pay for shutting him down.  Even worse? Our only hope of escaping this torment rests with the vampire who set it loose to begin with.  I hope it was worth it.",
