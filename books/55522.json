  "description": "Praise for Jamaican Flowers :             -- Joe Klare, online editor the420times.comSonny Flowers is pure, charming genius when it comes to biochemistry and genetics-specifically, marijuana and its potential to make the world a more joyful place-but he still has a lot to learn about fatherhood, guilt, women, happiness and himself, and very little time to learn it in. Sonny has already lost one daughter and will lose the other unless he can win her back-and do it before he literally loses his mind. A crooked general, self-proclaimed Rastafarian Deity, tongueless henchman, and the ghosts of his past, work to smother his good intentions. Forced back to Jamaica, Sonny must not only decide who in this crazy story he's living he can trust, but also what is real and what decidedly is not. Want action and adventure? Suspense and even a bit of romance, with some humor thrown in for good measure? JAMAICAN FLOWERS could be just what the Dr. ordered. Find out today why this funny, action-packed book is receiving so many 5-star reviews!",
