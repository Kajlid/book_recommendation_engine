I have to help my best friend, Gem, host a singles cruise that uses your zodiac sign to match you with your soulmate.Ya know, if you drink the Kool-Aid.I find the whole thing amusing until she starts to set me up with every Aquarius, Cancer, and Virgo on the boat.Then I meet Gage. A Leo.He's the exact opposite of my ideal match by zodiac standards, and is the perfect solution to get Gem off my back.Then the stars align, and I find myself drowning in love whether I want to or not.But I guess that's what I deserve for tempting fate.If only he felt the same way.",
