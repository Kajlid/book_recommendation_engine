His billionaire parents raised him to be the perfect man, brilliant of mind and pure of spirit.   You know what? Purity be damned.  When tempting grad student Carrie Young arrives on his island with a group of researchers, Joshua makes his move. He wants her, and he’ll utilize every advantage of his gorgeous surroundings and exquisitely thorough education to seduce her.

But she must resist him, for Carrie is the keeper of dangerous secrets, and her boss has plans more devious than anyone knows…The first of the 4-book The Island series.",
