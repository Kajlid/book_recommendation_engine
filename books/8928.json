  "title": "James Madison: A Biography",
  "description": "The best one volume biography of Madison’s life, Ketcham’s biography not only traces Madison’s career, it gives readers a sense of the man. As Madison said of his early years in Virginia under the study of Donald Robertson, who introduced him to thinkers like Montaigne and Montesquieu, \"all that I have been in life I owe largely to that man.\" It also captures a side of Madison that is less rarely on display (including a portrait of the beautiful Dolley Madison).",
