  "title": "Spectacular Capitalism: Guy Debord and the Practice of Radical Philosophy",
  "description": "Despite recent crises in the financial system, uprisings in Greece; France; Tunisia; and Bolivia, worldwide decline of faith in neoliberal trade policies, deepening ecological catastrophes, and global deficits of realized democracy, we still live in an era of \"spectacular capitalism.\" But what is \"spectacular capitalism?\" Spectacular capitalism is the dominant mythology of capitalism that disguises its internal logic and denies the macroeconomic reality of the actually existing capitalist world. Taking on this elusive mythology, and those who too easily accept it, Richard Gilman-Opalsky exposes the manipulative and self-serving narrative of spectacular capitalism. Drawing on the work of Guy Debord, Gilman-Opalsky argues that the theory of practice and practice of theory are superseded by upheavals that do the work of philosophy.",
