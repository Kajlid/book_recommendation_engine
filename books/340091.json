  "description": "They say the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else. They say the best way to stay sober is to love yourself. I’m great at making bad decisions. Addict? Check. Poor impulse control? Check. Obsessed with the guy I’m sponsoring? Check Check Check. There is no one worse for me to want in my bed than Jake Tully. He’s hot and grumpy and literally a terrible idea. Terrible. Worse, no one has ever made me feel the way he does — valued. But here I am - thinking about him again. Falling for my sponsor is not my worst idea yet, but it’s damn close.Felix Fields is everything good. He’s thoughtful and kind. I can’t help but think about every bad thing we could do between these sheets.But we can’t be together. I’m not willing to risk my recovery for anyone – even if he might be perfect for me. Finding a love like this is nothing short of a tragedy. **Author's Note: This book ends in a Happily Ever After, but getting there isn't easy.",
