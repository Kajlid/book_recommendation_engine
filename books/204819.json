  "description": "The 1983 Unification Agreement for Banking Reconciliation and Security (UARS) has been signed. Now, seven families will fight for control of the new data driven financial infrastructure. For the first time ever, live the untold story behind the people whose job it is to move money, weapons and gold through the international markets.How will they build and secure a system that not only thrives amongst FATF and CFATF recommendations, but also prospers in today's globally regulated banking environment? In this vivid tale of money laundering and South Asia outsourcing, you'll get a moment in time glimpse into the influential families and banking empires that keep money, weapons and power flowing between sovereign nations and the black markets they serve.During the mid-1980's, proceeds from the Latin American drug trade and Soviet-Afghan war flowed into these banks at a rate of over six hundred million dollars per month and with little global regulation, the families grew in wealth and political power, quickly adding billions in cash and real estate to their already vast portfolios.By the late 1980's, these families were faced with a digital landscape that would change everything. The data revolution was taking hold and the old ways would no longer keep them in power or safe. This work has been published from a recorded audio book narrative as told by K. Stern. The Kindle e-book follows the original script format.",
