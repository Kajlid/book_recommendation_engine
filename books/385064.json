  "title": "My Name Is Love: The Darlene Love Story",
  "description": "Finally, the woman whose voice the New York Times said \"is as embedded in the history of rock 'n' roll as Eric Clapton's guitar and Bob Dylan's lyrics\" tells her story. Right out of high school, Darlene Love began singing lead vocals for legendary producer Phil Spector, cutting such classic hits as the number one -- He's a Rebel,\" \"Da Doo Ron Ron,\" and \"He's Sure the Boy I Love.\" As part of girl group the Blossoms, she held a regular spot on television's Shindig, and with Bob B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans she toured the country. Later, she sang backup -- and collected numerous scintillating back-stage stories -- with, among others, Dionne Warwick, the Mamas and the Papas, and Sonny and Cher. Now in My Name A Love, Darlene is ready to tell her tales about Elvis coming on to her backstage during his famous '68 Comeback Special,\"about wild parties she witnessed at Tom Jones's house, and about her love affair with Bill Medley of the Righteous Brothers. She also recalls how she found herself cleaning houses in Beverly Hills, heard herself on the radio, and vowed to make a comeback. That comeback has included roles in all three Lethal Weapon movies (with the fourth now in production), starring roles on Broadway, and headlining concert appearances worldwide. My Name Is Love is a dishy, behind-the-scenes showbiz memoir that is also the inspiring story of a woman who refused to give up.",
