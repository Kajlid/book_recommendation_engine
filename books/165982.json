  "description": "The bestselling author of I Feel Bad About My Neck brilliantly and hilariously resuscitates Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy—two bigger-than-life feuding writers—to give them a post-mortem second act, and the chance to really air their differences.Although Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy probably only met once in their lives, their names will be linked forever in the history of American literary feuds: they were legendary enemies, especially after McCarthy famously announced to the world that every word Hellman wrote was a lie, “including ‘and’ and ‘the.’” The public battle, and the legal squabbling, that ensued ended, unsatisfactorily for all, with Hellman’s death.“A sharp-eyed and even sharper-clawed memory-play.... Provides...guilty pleasures, keeping the repartee both snappy and snappish.” — The Wall Street Journal",
