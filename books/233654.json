  "description": "Revel in the spirit of Christmas, and let your heart be an open book with a heartwarming novel set in Thomas Kinkade’s charming town of Cape Light…Shortly before the start of the holidays, successful renovation business owner Sam Morgan has an accident on site that leaves him housebound. The timing could not be worse, as his wife, Jessica, just left her job to run an animal rescue shelter on their property. Now, not only are they without two regular incomes, but Sam has to recoup in the middle of a small zoo. His oldest son, Darrell, a senior in college, assures Sam that he can step in and run the business. But Sam is opposed to Darrell leaving college and doubts his son can fill his work boots. Meanwhile, Jean Whitman has returned to her childhood home, Cape Light, to care for her ill mother. The relationship between Jean and her mother has never been easy; Jean has never been able to please Cynthia. To build common ground, Jean reopens Cynthia’s old bookstore café. But what Jean doesn’t know is that one of the first customers to walk through the door will change her life forever.",
