  "description": "Rainbow's got the blues. His girlfriend's dumped him; his assassin mate Rory's found God; his Aunt Rube's as sick as a bad joke; and his ex-wife's thrown up a barricade - all right, a cordon bleu - around his daughter Imogene.So when a snake's let loose in a laboratory, his ballet teacher's under siege and a nasty little joker by the name of Cock Robin cops it, Rainbow climbs into the ring because it's his job - but also because he needs the distraction.In the red corner he finds an unpredictable dame called Tsunami; a crooked cop; a tough -as-granite developer; a politician; a couple of thugs; a paparazzo; and too many bodies.While in the blue corner- yeah, that's Rainbow's-there's just two dames in distress and a bald journo. The clue is blue. But is that the moody blues, blue blood, a bad blue, a stoush - or just plain old fashioned blue murder",
