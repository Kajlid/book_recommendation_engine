  "description": "Collecting four stories by the inimitable Tatsuaki Ishiguro, contemporary Japanese literature’s most closely guarded secret until now, Biogenesis puts the “science” into science fiction not only on the level of subject matter but also form. At turns taking on the shadings of mystery and horror as well, Dr. Ishiguro’s odd yarns are a rare treat for all connoisseurs of genre fiction.",
