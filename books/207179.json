  "description": "This free short story is exclusively available for newsletter subscribers.I am not Chase Finland’s boyfriend. Ask him and he’ll tell you. He’ll say it loudly if he’s been drinking, or if there’s a crowd around.Chase and I grew up together in a crumbling trailer park, holding hands on the roof and dreaming dreams so big they didn’t have words. Ate the same government lunches in the cafeteria. Fell in love with the same emo guys. Then one of us got famous. And the other one came along.He’s not the same person he used to be. He doesn’t treat me like he once did. But we’re addicted to each other, in so deep it’s too late to walk away.Someone wants to give me all the things Chase won’t. Someone wants to cover my body in the kisses and bruises that I secretly crave. Wants to give me the pain I need and the pleasure I don’t deserve. The kindness just might kill me, but I can’t seem to help myself.I won’t tell Chase, but it doesn’t matter. After all, he’s not my boyfriend.Vicious Cycle is a 9000 word bittersweet short story, heavy on the bitter, light on the sweet. This explicit M/M story includes BDSM/spanking elements, angst, and semi-cheating (non-exclusive relationship) themes.*This is NOT a romance and does not have an HFN/HEA ending.*",
