  "description": "Derek, a young New Yorker, is tired of being treated like a piece of meat by his boyfriend. He moves to Richmond, a smaller city in the South, hoping to find love. However, he's not prepared for the overwhelming response to his arrival. Sure, he was considered cute in New York, but handsome guys there are a dime a dozen. In Richmond, he's the hottest bottom around. Derek isn't the sharpest tool in the shed, and quickly earns a reputation of being \"simple and easy.\" He tries to behave, but before long, the city's tops are tricking him into giving up his rump all the time. Derek discovers that he loves every minute of it. Will he decide he still wants romance or that he wants to be the official town sex toy?",
