  "description": "Tabitha has a choice. She can return home to the sheltered, predictable life that will undeniably lead to an eternity of knitting afghans for her swarm of cats, or she can accept her estranged grandmother's order/ invitation to join the elite social circle Tabitha's mother turned her back on years ago. Neither holds a promising outlook. But when she can't seem to avoid meeting a particularly tempting member of a world to which she doesn't belong, she has to decide if the walls she's built around her heart are any defense against his determination to win her.",
