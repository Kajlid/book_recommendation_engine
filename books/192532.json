  "description": "Welcome to Roman's Dungeon!  You are about to experience SM Johnson's M/M BDSM Dungeon series from beginning to end, including Above the Dungeon, Out of the Dungeon, Three in the Dungeon, Dare in the Dungeon, and the bonus short story, The Story of Hawk and boy. Let my main men, Roman, Dare, and Jeff escort you into their lives for a time. Remember, your safewords are \"yellow\" for check in, \"red\" for stop all activity now. Safe, sane, and consensual is the rule, but Risk Aware Consensual Kink is acceptable here for experienced BDSM practitioners. Water is available upon request, and all practitioners are expected to provide aftercare.  Most common side effects are bruises â€“ skin, egos, and hearts.  Most common benefit is personal growth and healing.  Enjoy the journey.  310,000 words of M/M erotic romance!",
