  "description": "Pasquini's 3 Dimensional Design is a lovely book that details the steps for creating quilts or wall-hangings to give the illusion of being three-dimensional. Although this book may be somewhat advanced for a novice, experienced quilters will find the instructions for drafting quite clear. Also. the eighteen color plates of the author's beautiful creations are inspirational and will help spur the reader to attempt original designs. The author begins by describing the various tools the quilter will need for drafting a three-dimensional quilt. She then covers the concept of a \"vanishing point\" to give depth to a design and, next~ guides the reader through several exercises to emphasize the concept. She goes on to cover spheres, squares, multiple points, and diminishing circles, thus giving the reader a full range of shapes and ideas for projects. After covering the basics of perspective, she includes a detailed chapter on composition (combining the various shapes and methods) and on color. A brief bibliography is also included. Recommended for public libraries and for quilters.
