  "description": "Kane X. Faucher and Tom Bradley bullwhip some of literature's most vibrant luminaries, including Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Charles Bukowski, Henry Miller, Antonin Artaud and Hunter S. Thompson. Through occult means, \"Ebeneezer\" Pound has reanimated his favorite dead authors as part of a villainous master plan. The re-embodied writers suffer through their tragicomic limitations as epigones of themselves. Faucher's puppeteering of Pound is matched by Bradley, who hurls into the text an annotated revelation of diabolic intrigue involving a dead author and a commandeered laptop. Delight in this collaborative adventure of nested plots, uniting for the first time the virtuosic talents of Faucher with the vaulting wit of Bradley - two hulking giants of humour and the absurd. What Kane X. Faucher and Tom Bradley have done is like going into Top Drawer Writer's Cemetery and having all the authors suddenly emerge from their tombs and start talking--and suddenly Bradley's notes turn it from pure fantasy into total believability. A fascinating combo of resurrection and meditation. One of the most original/unexpected books ever written. If you want to get into the souls of these authors, this is the place to start. -Hugh Fox, author of Shaman.",
