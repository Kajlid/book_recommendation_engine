At least that’s how seventeen-year-old Agent 093762 sees it. To help her city, she signs up for a covert mission, one that takes her far from the comfort—and safety—she’s used to.It’s a simple mission, one that’s supposed to take her team in and out of enemy territory before anyone knows they’re there. They’ve trained for months, but things don’t go as planned and before she knows it, she’s injured and trapped. When she finally does reach her home, she learns that she was betrayed and left for dead. Unable to trust anyone, she flees the city and the only life she’s ever known. Alone, her life becomes a struggle for survival until she meets Logan and learns that there’s more to life than surviving—life is meant to be lived.*Author's Note* Redemption was revised November 2016",
