  "description": "In this second book of The Cort Chronicles, Andy, John, Wendy, and Zack go on a quest to save their world from a powerful Corporation named CORT. This company controls the lives of almost everyone, yet a spark of hope still lays hidden underground with the Resistance. Then, from deep in the woods comes a new evil, named Spirral. If CORT is successful in finishing this project, human life as we know it will be over. Our heroes must find Spirral's heart and destroy it. Will good prevail over evil or vice versa? Responding to COVID-19 and the greed seen during the pandemic, David D. Bernstein continues his sci-fi/fantasy trilogy with both a response to our reality and a thrilling escape from it-into an alternate one where good eventually rises again.",
