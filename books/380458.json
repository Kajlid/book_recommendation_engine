  "description": "This was no ordinary war. This was a war to make the world safe for democracy. And if democracy was made safe, then nothing else matteredâ€”not the millions of dead bodies, nor the thousands of ruined lives...This is no ordinary novel. This is a novel that never takes the easy way out: it is shocking, violent, terrifying, horrible, uncompromising, brutal, remorseless and gruesome...but so is war.",
