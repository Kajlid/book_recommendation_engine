  "description": "An archaeology student, an Ice Age princess, and an undead sorceress...Talia was meant to be her clan's greatest leader. But when her parents fail to invite a powerful—and very dangerous—sorceress to her birth party, the clan's long-desired blessing becomes their final curse. As Talia comes of age, the power of the sorceress finds her, and she is lost in a blizzard.Millennia later, archeaology student Owen is on the field trip of his life to a glacier dig. But what begins as a routine dig soon becomes much more when he discovers a perfectly preserved mummy in the ice—a mummy that returns to life and drags him into a millennias-old dispute.For deeper in the glacier, dark magic is at work, waking the sorceress known as the Shadow Woman, and she will stop at nothing to end Talia's life and destroy the clan once and for all. If Talia and Owen can't stop her, she will destroy not only Talia but also Owen and the rest of the team. But if they can survive, they may just re-discover more than they could have ever hoped for.
