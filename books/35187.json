If you are ready for more intimacy and happiness in your relationship, then you have come to right place. My goal is to provide you with 20 steps that will help you get the kind of relationship that makes you giggle yourself silly with joy. Is it more cuddle-time you want? More overall sweetness?

We'll talk about body parts, manipulation strategies (that sounds terrible, I know!), picking your battles, learning how to trust and a whole host of other ideas designed to create a happier home life for both you and your man. Happy wife, happy life. Happy spouse, happy house. We've heard it all before. Now it's time to make it happen!
