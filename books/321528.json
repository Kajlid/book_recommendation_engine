  "description": "Teagan, Once, you were my best friend and first love, but then you ran away, hiding in plain sight for years as a sidekick to a villain. We’re no longer on the same side, so the stakes have increased. I know your weaknesses, and I’ll do whatever it takes until I break you. You push me away, but I’m not going anywhere. You want a reprieve, but the reaper isn’t in the business of gifting such an act. I’ll win this fight, Cherry-Girl, whether you like it or not. After so many years, the despair I felt at losing you manifested into something greater—something darker and more malicious. Until the circumstances change in ways I hadn’t expected, and I realize whose side you’ve truly been on. This time, I’m not letting you go again.Viciously yours, Brent Vicious Texts is the third book in the Captive Writings series, which must be read in order.
