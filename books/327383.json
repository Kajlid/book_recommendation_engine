  "description": "Poetry. Brandon Scott Gorrell's debut full-length poetry book captures the feelings of small, alienated, and highly self-conscious humans who exist in an array of situations, from a very odd Halloween party to a full-scale planetary war involving humans, androids, robots, and aliens. Focusing on severe feelings of low self-worth, meaninglessness, and yearning for something unknown, Brandon Scott Gorrell--who has generated a large internet following of disenchanted youths--uses predominantly science fiction imagery in direct, deadpan prose to describe humans in need of meaning that they feel hopeless to attain. \"I like these poems. I really do. They made me laugh\"--Matthew Rohrer. Brandon Scott Gorrell was born in 1984 and lives in Seattle. His blog is at brandon.alien.fine.blogspot.com.",
