  "description": "Newly divorced party girl Cara Reid wants to have fun. Much too young to even be a divorcee, she and her bestie, Miranda, set off to have fun and maybe a few casual hookups and live life. One night at a military bar, Cara meets Riley Forrester, a hot Army soldier who makes her melt with one look of his deep ocean blue eyes. But Riley is only staying the summer in California and then has to go back to Colorado at the end. Cara tells herself he’s just a summer fling and is determined to enjoy herself and let him go once the summer is over. But once Riley receives orders he wasn’t expecting, she’s forced to make a decision on whether she’s going to be there for him when he gets back, or move on with her life. What she wasn't expecting was to fall so hard for the beautiful soldier boy and now she's faced with accepting her feelings or letting him go.Keywords: free, freebie, free ebook, free romance, free romance ebook, free new adult romance, free contemporary romance, free military romance, free erotic romance, quick erotic book, free romance book, free quick read, sexy Army, free Army, sexy soldier, cop sex, free military sex book, short, serial, romance, free romance books, free romance book, romance, free, freebie, free book, free ebook, free romance ebook, free romance book, free romance novel, free book, free romance",
