  "description": "The award-winning designer and author of Rooms showcases inspiring opportunities for the exteriors, interiors, and details of houses in this lavishly photographed book Celebrated designer Mariette Himes Gomez believes that a house becomes a home only when it is infused with personal touches, when its individual parts flow together logically, and when it assumes a warm and welcoming character. In Houses , Gomez begins by inviting readers to consider the many elements that unify a house. She reveals how each detail—from the doors, fireplaces, and staircase, to the more conceptual elements of balance, color, and movement—contribute to the home's overall aesthetic, and how each can be combined to create a certain effect. She provides practical guidelines for building, buying, or renovating to create the perfect home, while illustrating how to instill flow and harmony in your overall design. Subscribing to the philosophy that less is more, Gomez reveals how to create homes of unparalleled beauty and grace. Complementing Gomez's invaluable advice are stunning photographs of the interiors, exteriors, and details of breathtaking houses in a variety of gorgeous settings. An inspirational guide for every design-minded home buyer, builder, or renovator, Houses illuminates the world of possibility that opens up when you create your own home.",
