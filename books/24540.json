  "description": "Cody Everett has a temper as hot as the inside of a combustion chamber, and it's landed him at his uncle's trailer, a last-chance home before military school. But how can he take the guy seriously when he calls himself Race, eats Twinkies for breakfast, and pals around with rednecks who drive in circles every Saturday night?What Cody doesn't expect is for the arrangement to work. Or for Race to become the friend and mentor he's been looking for all his life. But just as Cody begins to settle in and get a handle on his supercharged temper, a crisis sends his life spinning out of control. Everything he's come to care about is threatened, and he has to choose between falling back on his old, familiar anger or stepping up to prove his loyalty to the only person he's ever dared to trust.\"Nowak capably depicts a realistic, likable teenager with typical teenager flaws.... An endearing story about a teenager, his mentor, and what a difference true, unselfish love can make.\" ~ Kirkus ReviewsNamed one of BookBub's \"6 Seriously Awesome YA Books Even Adults Can Get Into.\"\"The roar of engines practically explodes off the page in this compelling, heart-thumping debut. Cody Everett is a straight-shooter with attitude, smarts, and whip-cracking wit; he doesn't pull any punches, and neither does author Lisa Nowak. The collision of Cody and the world of stock car racing makes for a great story, one of the best I've read in a long time. Running Wide Open is a book not to be missed.\" ~ Christine Fletcher, author of Tallulah Falls and Ten Cents a DanceBook 1 in the Full Throttle Series",
