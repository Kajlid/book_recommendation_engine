  "description": "New Release! Price is for a limited time only!When Lauren Drake takes a job redecorating a house, she never dreamed her life was going to change so drastically. She is given a room with a large mural on the wall depicting a world much different from her own. One day she steps through the mural into Starfane. In this strange and beautiful world she finds herself having to choose between two men – one very good, and one very bad. In the meantime, she is working desperately to help a man in her own world find out why he has lost the ability to feel. Lauren finds love, desire, anguish, and danger in Starfane…but she never could have imagined the real truth behind the mural and the three men in her life.ExcerptHis fingers caressed her arm softly and she shuddered with a mixture of fear and pleasure. She was way over her head with this sorcerer and she knew it.“Please, Marque, I need to go. I made a big mistake in coming here. Please let me go.”“Of course, I would never keep a woman here against her will. But, then, I’ve never had a woman here who wanted to leave. And I don’t think you really want to leave either, do you, my sweet?”Her legs felt like they had turned to water and she wasn’t sure that they would hold her up much longer. How had she gotten herself into this situation? She wanted so desperately to leave…and so desperately to stay.“I-I don’t know,” she stammered. “I’m not sure what I want.”He smiled and lightly brushed his finger across her cheek. “I know what you want, and I am willing to give you everything you desire. Come into my house.”",
