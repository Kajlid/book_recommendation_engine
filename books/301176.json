  "description": "Although anyone can feel the power of the Holy Ghost and be guided by it, it's not until baptism that we are promised the gift of the Holy Ghost: the Holy Ghost will stay with us at all times if we are worthy to receive Him. This is a promise so incredible that at times it can be hard to wrap our minds around, much less apply. What, exactly, does it mean to have the gift of the Holy Ghost daily, and how can it help us?Following up David Butler's bestselling Almighty and Redeemer, this engaging book for teens walks readers through the various roles the Spirit takes in our lives. From the comforter to witness to guide to companion, Spirit helps readers learn what the Holy Ghost can do for them, how to recognize His promptings, and how to use His promises and privileges in their lives on a day-to-day basis.",
