  "description": "The outlaw life is all Adam knows, it's all he's ever known. He was born into violence and he’ll likely leave this world in a pool of blood. That is, unless he can change his destiny and do the unthinkable; take an outlaw MC and steer it onto the straight and narrow.  Kari is a Trauma Nurse at Saint Joseph’s Memorial Hospital and if there are two things she doesn’t like; it's the smell of bikers and the sound of motorcycles. They remind her way too much of her abusive ex- boyfriend and biker with the Harbinger’s MC. When that relationship crashed and burned Kari vowed to never get involved with another biker…ever.  Until she meets Adam, the tattooed bad ass of the Sons of Ash Motorcycle Club.  Kari wields her razor intellect and sarcastic humor like a deadly blade bent on keeping men out of her life; especially bikers. So why is it that yet another biker can so easily derail a budding romance with mister right---a respected, baggage free ER doctor? Is it because when the chips are down the bad boys always take care of business?  When an MC war erupts around her, Kari finds herself buried in dead and dying bikers, all from the Sons of Ash. When her sister is kidnapped by the head of her boyfriend’s motorcycle club, Kari is thrust into the middle of a battle she wants no part of and suddenly she is forced to trust the one person she could never trust again.  This contemporary Biker romance contains graphic sexual content and violence. It is intended for mature readers.",
