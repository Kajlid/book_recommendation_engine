  "description": "Baseball player Brett has off-season orders from his team; get into rehabilitation for his shoulder if he wants another season in the Major League. He and his lover Benj take off to the boonies to stay with physical therapist Ralph, a tough-talking, routine setting kind of guy, and Jean, Ralph's Cajun lover, who cooks as well as he loves. Brett and Ralph butt heads from the beginning, speaking two different languages. Ralph wants Brett to be more in touch with his feelings, Brett wants Ralph to give him his therapy and leave him alone. Benj and Jean get along far better, with Jean showing Benj around the kitchen and reassuring him when things with Brett get hard to deal with. Before Ralph can even begin to work on Brett's shoulder, though, Brett is faced with an even more difficult physical challenge, one that does more than threaten his career. He and Benj have to work through some tough issues, making decisions that will affect the rest of their lives together. Their gradual friendship with Ralph and Jean helps them through the tough time, but even their friends' support may not be enough to pull them through. Can Brett and Benj survive the off-season, or will they strike out this time around?",
