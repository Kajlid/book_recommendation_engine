  "description": "Fantasies—we all have them. For some it’s their dream job; others want the wedding, the 2.5 kids, the white picket fence. My fantasies are a bit more...depraved. Dark and sinful, they have destroyed relationships and my livelihood, yet I still submit to them like a slave.  Sex. For most, it’s a natural expression of love, caring, or lust. But there are those of us who can’t stop once we’ve had a taste. Those of us who don’t want to. And the shame of that never-ending cycle will eat us alive...  My name is Evan James, and I am a sex addict.  A Desperate Man is a contemporary erotic romance. The Complete Series contains Volumes 1, 2, and 3.",
