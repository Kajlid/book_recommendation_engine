  "description": "“God, I like him. I like my best friend. Oh, and he has a girlfriend.”   Scarlett has been best friends with Aiden for a very long time. She's almost like a sister to him. Problem is, Scarlett does not see him as a brother at all; far from it, in fact. Her traitor of a heart loves him--yes, as more than a friend. They are polar opposites. She's always been awkward when it comes to anything social, while Aiden, the life of the party, has girls falling at his feet. He is so effortlessly likable. Scarlett can't even hope to compete with all the other girls. Worst, Aiden has a girlfriend: Perfect Hailey. He is crazy about her. While there is Scarlett, always just his best friend. But there are times when she can feel something brewing between them, something more.  Will she gather enough courage to confess her feelings to Aiden, to tell him he's more than just a best friend to her? Or will she shove her feelings right down the drain?  Or will that something she feels between them, prove to be something she dare not hope it to be: something else, something more, something special?   A Flirtationship will draw you into the intricate tapestry of confessions, betrayals, friendship, and love.  Give their story the chance it deserves. Buy your copy now! You won’t regret it.",
