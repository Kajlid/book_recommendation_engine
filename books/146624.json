  "description": "Women's Fiction Romance - Recommended Age 17+   This is not your every day perfect love story wrapped in a pretty bow. It's raw, real, beautiful, and heartbreaking. It touches on issues of depression, bipolar, and an epic love story that everyone hopes to have, and might even have, but forgets in the chaos of mundane every day life. This is a REAL love story based on actual events of a man who loved a woman too deeply and a woman who loved a man the only way she could.  \"Gah! This book! I don't even ... I can't ...\" ~Kari (Amazon Reviewer)  \"This book is beyond amazing and I like that Dani doesn't shy away from the darker issues such as the depression that Lennox suffers with!\" ~Tasha (Amazon Reviewer)  \"Dani Hart's A Firefighter's Flame will have your chest so tight with emotions even the hardest of people will succumb.\" ~The Devious Book Harlot  \"Ms Hart writes so eloquently I was crying toward the end and smiling at the same time. This is a stirring story about not taking for granted who you have in your life as they can be tore away in a heartbeat. 5 teary fangs.\" ~Paranormal Romance & Authors That Rock  \"This is a genuinely raw story that will bring you to tears. It isn't very often we get to follow the journey of such a real character. One who struggles with love, loss, children, temptation, death and HONESTY. Painful, gut wrenching honesty!\" ~Staci (Amazon Reviewer)  BLURB If you dig into the deepest parts of your soul, what would you find? Happiness, pain, love, regret, peace, sorrow? Now imagine experiencing all those feelings at once and then nothing at all. These were the average days in the life of Lennox Ashford.  Lennox walked a fine line between truth and deception, love and lust, and most of all, pain and happiness. A line had been drawn between highs and lows, testing her stability on a daily basis. She lived in between the grays of right and wrong, not knowing which way to sway. Strength was supposed to come from within, but being broken exposed her weaknesses instead.  She grew up believing in love and believing in Dean. He protected her when she was weak, picked her up when she fell, and fought for her when she couldn’t. They lived for each other, and eventually, for their children.  High school, college, marriage, children, and many rocky days had taken a toll on their marriage, deepening Lennox’s depression and screaming for a way out. She needed something. She needed a change. Fate intervened and the change she got was not what she expected nor wanted.  A tragic moment will test her already wavering strength and leave a permanent scar on her conscience. Follow her journey of rediscovering love and searching for her own fairy-tale ending.",
