  "title": "How To Eat A Human Being",
  "description": "The latest collection of short horror stories from Dan Dillard, author of Demons and Other Inconveniences and Giving Up The Ghost. Recipe? Two parts evil, one part dark, fill the rest with fear. Add a dash of sarcasm and serve it with a beer! The title comes from a poem that is a tongue and cheek look at a cooking class for the cannibalistic. \"Refractions\", a story of a writer who finds his reflection in the mirror to be somewhat of a hassle. In \"Organ Donors\", an ambulance driver harvests his clients for a dark purpose. And \"Eye For An Eye\" shows a man can go mad after losing his wife.",
