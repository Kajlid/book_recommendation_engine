  "description": "Though Vivienne Strauss’ Little Birds Big Adventures is a work with many important themes, the art alone is more than enough to please any viewer. Softly colored, the lovely little birds stand out as if alive and perched in someone’s backyard. In fact, everything that appears with her birds looks as if it belongs to a typical family of the last century. The cars, clothing and household items of that time appear so accurately they bring to mind childhood memories of a long-ago life now all but forgotten. Little Birds Big Aventures is a book of captioned collages. Each collage features a bird or birds with a familiar object such as an old toaster or suitcase that tells a story of the past. A tiny flock of little birds around a leather-textured Philco portable radio or other birds emerging from one of those greenish-yellow dryers remind us of the appliance world we have left behind. Vivienne Strauss’ lovely art book also reveals her birds in those stylistic steel cars of the 1950s. which have been sadly replaced by the contemporary all-look-alike plastic substitutes.” – Robert L.
