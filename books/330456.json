  "title": "Freeing Tibet: 50 Years of Struggle, Resilience, and Hope",
  "description": "In March of 1959, a 23 year-old Tibetan youth named Tenzin Gyatso burst onto the world stage. Fleeing his native country to govern in exile from India, the Dalai Lama would go on to become one of the great leaders of our time. Then, in March 2008, the diplomat, icon, and winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize was blamed for inciting violence in Tibet's traditional capital of Lhasa. From the national uprising in 1959, which cost more than 85,000 Tibetans their lives, to the rise of the Tibetan freedom fighters; the aftereffects of Nixon's historic visit to China, and preparations for the Dalai Lama's successor, this seminal history offers an insider's view of the 50-year struggle for autonomy. Based on interviews with CIA and political insiders, this epic story gives readers a new understanding of a conflict that continues to fascinate the world.",
