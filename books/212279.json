  "description": "Rachel’s only flying back to Sioux Falls because it’s her brother Justin’s college graduation. The last thing she wants to do is confront her painful past or the people who made it that way. Florida’s her home. Other than her beloved little brother, her friends are her “family.”Native-Floridian Andrew is Rachel’s friend and play partner. Having been burned recently by an ex, he’s not in a hurry to commit. Fortunately, neither is Rachel. But as the weekend progresses and misadventures abound, the two take chances neither expected. Especially when a sudden death in Rachel’s extended family forces her to spend far more time with them than she’d planned.When an unexpected ice storm traps them in Sioux Falls for the week, the heat rises in their hotel room. Now if the two can survived a myriad of self-inflicted accidents—including attack vibrators and an unintended off-label use of hand sanitizer—they might just be able to survive anything.",
