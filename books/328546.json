  "description": "His romantic weekend in ruins, shy twenty-something artist Perry Foster learns that things can always get worse when he returns home from San Francisco to find a dead body in his bathtub. A dead body in a very ugly sportscoat--and matching socks. The dead man is a stranger to Perry, but that's not much of a comfort; how did a strange dead man get in a locked flat at the isolated Alton Estate in the wilds of the \"Northeast Kingdom\" of Vermont? Perry turns to help from \"tall, dark and hostile\" former navy SEAL Nick Reno--but is Reno all that he seems?",
