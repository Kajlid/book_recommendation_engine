  "description": "Ireland, 2010, and austerity is biting. When downbeat and disaffected Noelie Sullivan finds his missing punk records for sale in a charity shop in Cork, it seems like a lucky break until he discovers documents inside one of the sleeves, alleging that missing local man, Jim Dalton, was murdered twenty years ago. In spite of himself, Noelie is drawn into the story of Dalton's disappearance and uncovers a link between the missing man and a powerful family of brothers, the Donnellys, who have ties to Danesfort, a former industrial school near Cork. What Noelie doesn't know is that Special Branch are watching his every move and they have a vested interest in making sure that he doesn't discover the truth. Topical and brilliantly plotted, this is a gripping political thriller about power and the abuse of power from an original and exciting new voice who already has a track record as a prize-winning short story writer",
