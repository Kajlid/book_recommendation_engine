It becomes even more so when she discovers a tiny, unwanted stowaway, five-year-old Sadie Beck, in the back of her Jeep two nights in a row.When Kate realizes Sadie may be in real trouble, she vows to protect Sadie’s innocence at any cost. They develop a deep connection on their frantic journey across state lines and over spiritual borders, but as Kate rips through the complex landscape of moral choices her prior transgressions have left her egregiously unprepared to handle, you may begin to wonder who’s saving whom.At once hilarious and heartbreaking, Chasing Kate is a raucous voyage of self-discovery, fueled by an original and unconventional love story, wending down the road to redemption.",
