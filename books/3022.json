  "title": "Yven",
  "description": "The dream that brought Maladrid and Yven together also tore them apart, but their tale isn't nearly over. When Yven, Queen of the Hohmara, discovers the truth in the story Maladrid left behind, she sets out with her childhood friend, Dordin, to fight the darkness in Lochydor and accept the fact that the man she feels destined to love will never be hers. The second installment in the \"Tales of Dominhydor\" series reunites the fellowship formed in \"Maladrid\" and introduces a few new faces, including one that seems a bit too familiar for the Queen's comfort. An arduous journey of strength and emotion, \"Yven\" brings dream to reality as the battle for Dominhydor truly begins.",
