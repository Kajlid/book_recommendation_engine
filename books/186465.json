  "description": "\"Gabrielle Calvocoressi is a wonderfully talented poet.\"â€•Eavan Boland Whether in the title poem, spoken by those who lived longingly and vicariously through the famous missing aviator, or in \"Circus Fire, 1944,\" which intimately recounts a haunting New England tragedy, Gabrielle Calvocoressi uses her prodigious gifts of imagination and empathy to give voice to the hope and heartbreak of small-town America. In painstaking, vernacular verse, she conveys the ambitions and failings of a distraught populacein the edgy jazz portrait, \"Suite Billy Strayhorn,\" for example, or the enthralling, interwoven sequence, \"At the Adult Drive-In,\" which conveys, at once, a personal and communal corruption. Penetrating and compassionate, The Last Time I Saw Amelia Earhart portrays, with a storyteller's arc, the troubled landscape of the left-behind.",
