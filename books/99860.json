  "description": "The bigger the mistake, the more tempting it is ...When Nadia Kinsella meets Jay Tiernan, she's tempted. Of course she is. Stranded together while a snowstorm rages outside ... who would ever know?But Nadia's already been together with Laurie for years--they're practically childhood sweethearts.

I mean, you wouldn' t want to do something that you might later regret...",
