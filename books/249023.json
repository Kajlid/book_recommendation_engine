  "title": "To Afar From Afar",
  "description": "This collection hinges on the image of a globe. Composed as three long poems in the second person interrupted by a visual fragmented movement. The modes address (to afar/from afar) are informed by distances made by war and globalization. With collage, maps, lyric nonfictions, storytelling, chants, sonnets, treated screenshots, a sestina, and new family pictures of old places - this book addresses displacement, memory and the darkness and light they bring.",
