  "title": "Authorship: Publishing Your Book On Your Own",
  "description": "This book is for all those authors who dread publishing their books whether it be in printed or electronic format or both. I have published well over a hundred books to all the major printers and distributors, so it came as a surprise when I recently became aware that some excellent writers are put off self-publishing themselves because they find the task too confusing and difficult and so they pay others to do it for them. I can understand this if an author wants to save time and so the purpose of this book is to help those who would like to do the job themselves, but don't know how. It is actually very satisfying to conceive the idea for a book, write it and then publish it yourself all on your own, and with the help of this book, that is exactly what you will be able to do. Inside you will learn how to publish to all the major distributors like Amazon, iBookstore, Barnes and Noble, Lulu, Nook, Kindle, Smashwords and XinXii.",
