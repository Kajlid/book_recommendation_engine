  "description": "Every girl likes a sharp dressed man, and Kassie is no exception.Graham “Hollywood” Caverly feels the chemistry with Kassie Anderson in the emails they’ve been exchanging through a dating site. When they finally meet in person, and that online chemistry proves to have real-life sizzle, he knows she’s the one. He couldn’t be happier when their first date, at an annual Army Ball, goes better than he could have imagined. Until Kassie drops a bomb.Kassie doesn’t want to approach Hollywood on the dating site, but threats to her family leave her no other choice. She definitely doesn’t want to fall for the man. But fall she does. Hard. After she admits the ruse—and after some understandable anger on both their parts—Kassie wonders if, in Hollywood’s arms, a happy future is within her grasp.But her past always finds her, and in Kassie’s case, that’s a dangerous proposition—because she’s connected to an old enemy of Hollywood’s Delta Force team. Very intimately connected… And it will take Hollywood, his Delta brothers, and even some outside help to do what should have been done the first time—eliminate the threat once and for all.** Rescuing Kassie is the 5th book in the Delta Force Heroes Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.",
