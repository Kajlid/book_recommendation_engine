But then…No longer a nerdy nobody, I’ve now been acclaimed Sovereign Emileia, ruler of the Martian colony Nuath, and in the nick of time. But at what cost? Life seems pointless without my soulmate Rigel, but everyone expects me to just shake off my heartbreak and assume my new responsibilities. I go through the motions, doing what I must, until an unexpected discovery brings me a glimmer of hope for the future. Now I’m determined to do whatever I can to salvage the happy ending I’d given up for lost—if it’s not already too late.Starfall is the electrifying conclusion to Brenda Hiatt’s original, award-winning Starstruck series.
