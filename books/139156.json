It was a decision that not only saved their friendship, but it was one that would change Tyler Rushing’s life forever. For the past couple of years, Tyler was known as being one of the UFC’s most memorable and sexy heavyweight fighters. Now he has the chance to win the title and claim the fame he so deserves. Having all the women he wanted was the highlight of his days; at least until Kacey Andrews walked through the door of his gym. He couldn’t keep his eyes off of her; there was an innocence about her that sparked his interest and he wasn’t going to give up until he had her. Little did he know that Kacey Andrews wasn’t a stranger … she was part of his world; he just didn’t know it. It was a secret she’d worked hard to keep hidden.Kacey spent years trying to get away from the fighting world, away from the man who was hated among the MMA elite … her brother, Kyle Andrews. Unfortunately, she was brought back into it when Tyler’s relentless battle for her heart won her over, drawing her in. The only problem is that secrets never stay buried forever. In the end, Tyler will have a decision to make, and it’s one that could possibly destroy his and Kacey’s life … forever.",
