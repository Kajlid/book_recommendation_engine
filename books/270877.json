  "description": "How can you stand for something when you don't remember who you are? Kaiden Dyran is and always has been a liar. This has been clear for years, and seems to hold true even now despite his muddled memories, as he leaves his teammates behind to search for a family he barely remembers, and a clue to who he is. But returning home may end up doing more harm than good. Desperate to reestablish her control in the Bane's absence, the Empress has sent those loyal to her to hunt down all the Gifted, and those who side with them.Faced with an ultimatum that leaves him reeling, Kaiden finds himself directed back to the friends he's abandoned -- if they will even take him back. Reconciliation is a difficult path, and one he's not yet sure he deserves.With the Bane still unaccounted for, and the team racing to find the Gifted before the Empress does, can they find a way to work through past grievances in time for their final stand, no matter what it may cost them? The easiest road is not always the best one.",
