  "description": "Meet Calliope Dancer: confectiontionaire extraordinaire with abilities to connive, control, and correct everything she contracts for and more. Or she thought until a spider and a lawyer catch her in their web, and her candy helps not at all to get her beyond their wall. The police are unamused and her client unsatisfied. Now what can she do?What starts out as a favor for a friend soon turns into a very strange and dangerous assignment from a client that Calliope wishes she had never heard of. Good and evil weave a tangled web that only a very old and crafty being seems to understand. Maybe it is just a dream from too much sugar and chemistry. After all, life can’t be that strange – can it?",
