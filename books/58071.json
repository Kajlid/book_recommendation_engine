  "description": "In a cloud of red, everything changes. Violet Green is hidden in the army ranks on the northern front. No one cares about the north, and no one remembers that she is the illegitimate daughter of the king… until someone blows up the Grand Palace and kills the entire royal family except Prince Achtee. Years before, the prince sent an assassin to kill her. Now, the king is dead, and Violet is summoned to face a fate that can’t be avoided, but not everything is as it seems. Spies are everywhere. Her new assistant Lana has yet to prove her trustworthiness. Plus, Achtee's assassin resurfaces at the most unwelcome time. Before she realizes it, Violet gets tangled up in a role that has strings attached to things she doesn’t even know exist.",
