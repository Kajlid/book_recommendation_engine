  "description": "I thought being abducted by aliens and auctioned to the highest bidder was the worst things could get. But I was wrong. Because the man who bought me is unimaginably dangerous and sinfully sexy– a big, brooding vampire alien.When he sees a bruise on my cheek, he kills the man who hurt and sold me, nullifying his purchase. To keep me from returning to the auction, we have to get married.We're complete opposites. I'm a cheerful and optimistic dreamer who always sees the best in people. He's a guarded and gruff smuggler who always expects the worst. Yet we'd both be lying if we said we didn't crave each other– body, heart, and soul.But I want to return to Earth and he wants to return to his life of solitude... even if we both wish our marriage of convenience was real.Craving The Alien Vampire is book 1 of the Alien Alpha Mates series and is a 20,000 word-long novella. There is no cheating, no cliffhanger, and a happily ever after guaranteed!",
