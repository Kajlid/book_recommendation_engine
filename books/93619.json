  "description": "Existence has a billion faces, each one an universe coexisting with our own. In one such universe, a man named Rafe has learned to walk between the worlds. Rafe can walk through the shadows of the worlds. Anything that he can imagine, he can find in the worlds that might be. During his wandering, he has met other Walkers. Some of these have been called gods by our ancestors. Odin, Zeus, or Enlil, Brahma or Kali, all of these awoke to the truth of infinite worlds, and learned to travel among the worlds with purpose. The world lines encompass all possibilities and all possible worlds. There are an infinite number of worlds in which humans, and some who are nearly human, live. Beyond these worlds are the ones that twist the mind into madness, worlds where the rules are not the familiar ones that we expect. Far from the places of humanity, there are places where, in all the universe, there are no places to stand, where even the stars have never formed, and some in which the hydrogen that fills our universe can never be. Far beyond these worlds are places so incomprehensible that the eye refuses to see there, and the ear cannot hear there, places that are beyond madness, where the mind dissolves with the merest experience. In this place which is neither dark nor light, where no rationality or order is possible, there are things that live beyond time and space, things that hunger for all things. The Scourge is from this darkest place, and it slowly intrudes into the shadows of order, bringing madness to both Man and world. It falls to the Walkers in Shadows to unite, and to seal the way against the Scourge, before the stain of the Scourgeâ€™s touch can twist all worlds everywhere into madness.",
