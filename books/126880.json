  "description": "When everything in life has been against you, who can blame you for not playing nice with others? My name is Wednesday. For the last seven years I have been abused and used by a sadistic bastard named Klein. Now he wants me dead- only he doesn't have the balls to kill me himself. Alvin, who was sent to do Klein's dirty work, decided to save my life (repeatedly) instead of taking it. But no matter how much someone cares about you, they can only do so much...can only go so far. You are your only real shot at coming out on top. Sometimes reclaiming your life requires a body count. -Wednesday Valentine",
