  "description": "Our stories are a gift to you. In a world where victims of trauma continue to silently struggle, Healing Shatterproof makes the truth audible. Each of the fourteen authors in this anthology reach into painful memories not for the sake of reliving them, but rather to share how in places of great sorrow and suffering, a most noble courage can awaken. To demonstrate that joy can be found even after the darkest of days. To show how truth-telling can break a person free from pain and lead to healing of heart and soul. In these pages, you'll encounter stories of discrimination, abuse, loss, mental health struggles, and addiction, stories of people forced into secrecy and invisibility. Despite the best efforts of circumstances, abusers, or a culture that would have them stay silent, the writers in this collection did not disappear. Instead, they found themselves to be courageous, resilient and powerful. They also found a true and essential part of themselves that could not be destroyed, a part that is, as it turns out, shatterproof. These stories are their gift to you and a reminder of the essential, indestructible heart in each of us.",
