As a settler girl, she'd seen her family die, one by one, on the grueling trail west. Stolen by renegade Indians, she'd grown to womanhood with an Indian family. Now that the Indian maiden she's become is ready to wed, she longs for only one man, Soaring Hawk, whose golden body and raven hair fill her nights with dreams of passion. She sees in his eyes that he longs to awaken her to womanhood in his arms. But, even as she gives her heart to him, her mind questions the wisdom of her actions. For, if his father destroyed all she held precious so many years ago, how can she trust Soaring Hawk to give her lasting love now?",
