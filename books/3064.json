  "title": "Taking Tea at the Savoy",
  "description": "Thè, té, cha, chai—tea is a universal beverage. It links the solemnity of the Japanese tea ceremony and the sustaining high tea of British school children; it can be green or black, fragrant or smoky. To take tea at The Savoy is to combine tradition with all the elegance and sophistication that befits one of London’s great hotels. Anton Edelmann, The Savoy’s Maître Chef des Cuisines, offers exquisite recipes with tales that conjure up leisure time in a bygone era, set against the romantic story of tea and its journey to the West. Here is afternoon tea at its most stylish—aromatic brews, delicate porcelain, impeccably presented dainties. Indulge in feather-light palmiers or cinnamon madeleines. Savor delicate cucumber sandwiches or fragrant honey and ham biscuits for an al fresco summer tea, or luscious cakes to chase away winter doldrums. Taking Tea at the Savoy is a book to inspire endless afternoons of delight.",
