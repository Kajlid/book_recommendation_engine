On Monday nights, his housekeeper is off and Marc doesnâ€™t like casseroles. He orders Chinese and gets a musical voice on the line that calls to him.To his delight and surprise, the guy on the phone delivers his food and is his destined mate.Unfortunately for Marc, Colin Callahan thinks the only reason Marc could want him is biological -- he has to like his mate. Colin has a scarred face and thinks no-one could love him as he is.Can Marc convince him otherwise?",
