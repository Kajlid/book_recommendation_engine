  "description": "Life isn't always a walk in the park, but when Patrice takes her Pomeranians to the park after a rough day at the office, fate steps in. An unlikely hero comes to the rescue when one of her dogs gets loose. Short, pale, and kind of cute, Seth doesn't have a lot of confidence with the ladies, but he hits it off with Patrice. But some things might be too good to be true. While Patrice wonders if Seth could possibly be \"the one\", fate steps in again with a horrible twist. Will it be a deal breaker or just a storm before bright blue skies?",
