  "description": "Kyra doesn't believe in fate. She's been fighting the idea that she has any kind of destiny, but when she returns to the small, coastal town of Sutton she finds herself on a course that was written long before she existed. It is a course that will rest the fate of the world upon her shoulders. Descended from an ancient race that is destined to guard the gateway between our world and the next. It is up to Kyra and her new friends to stop the evil that threatens to consume our world. Which is not easy when you find out that monsters really do exist and you are at the top of their \"most wanted\" list. With a demon and a hellhound stealing her heart will Kyra walk away or be forever bound?",
