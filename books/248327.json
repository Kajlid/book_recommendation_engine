  "title": "Plays 6: Semi-Monde / Point Valaine / South Sea Bubble / Nude With Violin",
  "description": "Philip Hoare, in his biography of Coward described Semi-Monde as his \"most daring play to date. In a chic Parisian hotel, a series of sexual pairings take place through rendezvous, arguments, infidelities and reconciliations: sexual deviance is undisguised ... set in the bisexual 1920s, the play could easily be populated by characters of Coward's society.\" Point Valaine is \"the drama of a lurid episode of lust in the semi-tropics ... unmistakably the work of a master of the stage\" (New York Times); South Sea Bubble which concerns \"the Governor's lady in the Isle of Samolo who plays with native fire, nearly gets her wings singed, bashes her native admirer with a bottle and at one of those Coward next-morning-at breakfast scenes slips her way out of the scrape with feline grace.\" (Manchester Guardian) whilst Nude With Violin is a witty comedy about art fraud.",
