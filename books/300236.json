  "description": "What if somebody finally wrote to his high school alumni bulletin and told...the truth! Home Land is a brilliant work from novelist Sam Lipsyte, whom Jeffrey Eugenides calls \"original, devious, and very funny\" and of whose first novel Chuck Palahniuk wrote, \"I laughed out loud--and I never laugh out loud.\"The Eastern Valley High School Alumni newsletter, Catamount Notes, is bursting with tales of former students include a bankable politician and a famous baseball star, not to mention a major-label recording artist. Then there is the appalling, yet utterly lovable, Lewis Miner, class of '89--a.k.a Teabag--who did not pan out. Home Land is his confession in all its bitter, lovelorn glory.Winner of the Believer Book AwardNew York Times Notable Book of the Year",
