  "description": "Is God fair? Bruno Papazzi doesn't think so. If fact he's pretty pissed off about the whole idea. It is especially during his annual fishing trip to Wheeler Lake Lodge with his buddies that it becomes clear that God is just playing with people. His people. Unfairly. What with God killing off his fishing buddies and then sending him a jelly-bellied next door neighbor to torment him with his childish, suburban property line wars. Is God fair? Bahahahaha. To Bruno, not only is God not fair, but his parenting of humans is absurd. Sure, Bruno has his own issues. Who doesn't? He's just a bit obsessive, a bit opinionated and perhaps even a bit too judgmental. Well who wouldn't be with the idiotic clients he has, with his wacko neighbor, and frankly with just the everyday stupidity he has to deal with. Silently Bruno is in a constant struggle to understand the frivolity of a God who seems more interested in tormenting him than in helping him. Ultimately however, this is the story of how life's unexpected pain and pleasure guided one man's journey to peace.",
