Judging by a bloody branch, Miss Meredith Llewellyn assumes it was an accident, until she learns that the limb didn't break off--it was neatly sawn. But as she searches for a killer, Meredith wonders if her eyes are playing tricks on her. How else can she explain her foggy images of Kathleen pointing to the flowerbeds? Without the help of the lazy constable or her petrified teachers, Meredith will have to find a link between flowers and the killing, take heed of her own safety, and get an education--in murder.",
