His dark charms are sweet on the lips but poison to the souls of those who give in. Poison to his spirit too, until he encounters a girl with a secret who might be the first to steal his heart.Eve doesn’t trust the opposite sex. Men are, after all, only interested in themselves, and breaking the hearts of poor unsuspecting girls. So when beautiful blue-eyed Sal is suddenly everywhere she goes, Eve knows he’ll bring her nothing but trouble; what she doesn’t know is just how much.Eve is about to discover that there are dark forces at work in the world, and everything she thought she knew about herself is a lie. As she is swept into the hidden realm of temptation demons and the fallen angels who control them, terrible sacrifices loom on the horizon.Will a demon who’s only ever known lust, and a girl who finds it impossible to trust, fight their fears before it’s too late?",
