  "description": "When his parents get a gander at the sex tape sent by a blackmailer, they offer Kendall Turner a few weeks of \"rest\" in a cushy clinic. No, he says, and hotfoots it across the lawns of the family estate. KT isn't his own worst enemy anymore; there's a new candidate for the title. Suddenly, Kendall's on the lam, trying to outrun a murder rap. Helping -- by locking KT naked in their motel room -- is his cousin Turn. KT has some he manages to censor himself only when he lies, he's been in love with cousin Turn since forever, and he really would rather kill himself than get more rest at another clinic.",
