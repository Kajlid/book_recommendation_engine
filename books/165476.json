  "description": "Sora has always known loyalty. Above all else, she fights for the Order she belongs to, lives to protect it and its subjects; as an Asha, a warrior priestess, it's what she was born for, after all. But things become more complicated when she is charged with the protection of a young girl, one whom there is more to than meets the eye. As Sora comes to know her, as well as the dangerously charming mercenary she is forced to work with, she finds that colors and shades of gray begin to seep into her previously black and white world. After years of simplicity and rules, the change is just as tempting as it is terrifying. Meanwhile, there is an old darkness on the rise, and as Sora discovers hidden sides of herself, she starts to realize that the world she thought she knew might not be as it seems. In the end, there will be nowhere to hide, and Sora's loyalty, heart, and conviction will be put to the test.(This book has some mature content)",
