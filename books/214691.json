  "description": "We go together like champagne and whiskey. Now we're married! Olivia Gage Carter is the poster boy for rude, rugged, and obnoxious. He’s the town’s mechanic. When he’s not giving me a hard time about my car, he’s mocking my city girl ways. He's a small town roughneck with a dirty reputation and a mouth to match. I'm a city girl. We go together like champagne and whiskey. People told me he was trouble. But that didn’t stop me from craving his filthy promises that make my blood pound for hours. Or having full body shivers whenever he says my name. This joy ride’s gone too far. Now we’re married—by accident—no less. The town’s most ineligible bachelor is my husband. Oh, and I’m pregnant. —— Gage The last thing I need is a wife… Especially a high-maintenance one like Olivia Stewart. I’ve got no patience for a demanding, feisty city girl who thinks she can walk into my business and order me around. But now that I’ve tasted her, I can’t get her out of my mind. She may be a burr in my side but she’s as sweet as honey. When she’s not driving me crazy, she’s driving me wild. One Some puffed-up rich boy from San Francisco thinks she’s his, and he’ll make my life hell if I don’t give her up. Good luck with that. I can’t be bought, and I’m not giving up my wife and baby. He wants a fight? This means war.",
