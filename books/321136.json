  "description": "They called him Stone Cold.Once upon a time, I called him my pen pal.When I wrote to Callum Rose five years ago, I never expected a response. He was an up and coming rock star, afterall, and I was just a shy seventeen-year-old. He did write back though, and through hundreds of emails, we became best friends.Until the day we unknowingly broke each other’s heart.It’s been three years since our last email. I’m all grown up with a new job at Good Music, and finally have my act together. But then Callum Rose walks in the door, and I’m instantly thrown back to the days when he meant everything to me.The thing is...he doesn’t know who I am. He’s never seen my face. And this Callum Rose lives up to his stone cold reputation.That is, until one night, he sees me in another man’s arms, and decides to claim me. Then there is nothing cold about him.Callum becomes a man on fire for me, introverted, awkward, chubby Wren Anderson. He’s obsessive, possessive, and kind of stalker-y—and I like it...a little too much. The problem is, he still doesn’t know I’m the girl who walked away from him or the reason behind it, and I’m afraid when he finds out, I’ll be right back in the cold again.",
