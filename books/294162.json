In this wicked game who will survive?Author's Note: The Sekten Series is a dark romance series that needs to be read in order. It is intended for mature audiences since there is a lot of graphic content, and it might not be suitable for you if you are easily triggered. Some books will be darker than others, but all are triggering none the less. This is a dark world, so read at your own discretion.",
