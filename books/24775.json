  "description": "From one of Australia's most popular authors, here's a fresh, fast, laugh-out-loud-funny story of boys being boys at school-camp.\"Adults won't find this very tasteful. Sorry, it can't be helped, it's what happened.\"Mark Ryder gives us the good, the bad, and the messy in this antic account of his friends' misadventures during a week of school-camp in the Australian outback. Camp is everything the boys expect and more--there are caves to explore, mud fights, bad showers, great food, flashlights, hidden candy, wombats, and leeches. Then disaster Mr. Cromwell (a.k.a. Crom the Bomb, or simply The Bomb) arrives as a substitute chaperon! \"Cromwell at camp is like Darth Vader at your birthday party. How could this happen?\" But in the end,it's what Jonah, Nicko, Wormz, Azza, Mitch, and Mark do to The Bomb that sets off an explosion. . . .",
