  "description": "The bicurious cop and his sharp-dressed man… Detective Christopher “Topher” Carnegie is unlucky in love. He either tries too hard, doesn’t try hard enough, or hasn’t found the right person yet. But recently, he’s started seeing Julian Fine, his sister’s best friend, in a new light. If there’s one thing a fabulous tailor knows, it’s how to take a person’s measure. Julian recognizes a straight man when he sees one, but that doesn’t stop him from falling head over heels for the unattainable man. Just a few short days and one shared bed… When a white lie backs Julian into a corner, Topher steps in to save the day. He’s worked plenty of undercover assignments before, but pretending to be Julian’s boyfriend during a family wedding might be his most dangerous mission yet. Julian challenges everything Christopher knows about himself, and soon, reaching for each other feels as natural as breathing. But can their newfound feelings survive the real-world challenges they face? There’s only one way to find out.",
