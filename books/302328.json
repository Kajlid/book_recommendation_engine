  "description": "This is all his fault. Him, Nick Geary, the bad boy who kissed me senseless against his car a month ago, awakening the sleeping sex beast inside me, only to treat me like a little sister ever since.Before Nick and I locked lips, I had no idea I could feel hungry for someone's kisses.I would give up cupcakes for life for a chance to have Nick be my first, but he's got one rule--No V-Cards.But he has to feel the same pull I feel, he just has to--the kiss we shared was hot enough to set fire to a glass of sweet tea. All I have to do is figure out a way to change his mind...Nick's the one who brought this wild, new curiosity inside me to life, and I'll be darned if I'll give up on my bad boy before I find out if our second kiss is as hot as our first.And if we happen to fall madly in love along the way, well...stranger things have happened. Right?Virgin Seeks Bad Boy is a \"losing it\" romance previously published as Wild For You. It has been heavily revised and expanded for this new edition.",
