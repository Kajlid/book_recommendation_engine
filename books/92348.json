  "description": "Haunted by the violence of their ancestors and the price they were made to pay for it, the Druids of Axelom have sworn never to return to war. Thus, when the Myrkra invade their borders, King Olvan knows the only way to keep the oath and ensure the safety of his people is for them to flee their forest home and make for the new world of Gullick. Now, in their quest for freedom, the Druids must face not only their fears of the vast ocean, but the threat of disunity, the pain of loss and the possibility that they may have brought the war along with them.",
