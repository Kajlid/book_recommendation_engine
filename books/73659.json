  "description": "Six feet from hell is where it all started. A coal mine accident in the hills of Southwest Virginia has unleashed a deadly toxin that not only kills the living, it brings them back as ravenous zombies. Follow the men that try to escape the chaos in the first book of the Six Feet From Hell series.*AUTHOR'S NOTE - EDITED FROM ORIGINAL VERSION, GRAMMAR AND SYNTAX HAVE BEEN GREATLY IMPROVED, STORY HAS NOT CHANGEDThis is my take on the zombie apocalypse and what I would do. The characters in this book are all coworkers of mine that have inspired me to write what we might do in the situation presented. The locations are all real, the people are all real, the only thing fictional is the zombies....or are they?",
