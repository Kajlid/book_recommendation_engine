  "description": "It's been seventy-five days, and Amy still doesn't know how she can possibly exist without her best friend, Julia—especially since it's her fault that Julia's dead. When her shrink tells her it would be a good idea to start a diary, Amy starts writing letters to Julia instead. But as she writes letter after letter, she begins to realize that the past wasn't as perfect as she thought it was—and the present deserves a chance, too.",
