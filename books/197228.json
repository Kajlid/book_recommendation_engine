  "description": "Rock musician Jimmy Brandt has quit music for a quiet life. But after a random act of kindness, he is rewarded with the ‘Vortex Winder,’ a device which grants him a new special power each week. Each power leads to unexpected results.  Driven by the Vortex Winder, Jimmy makes an amazing journey. From surprise You Tube fame, to a love affair in Germany and a nightmare stint in a foreign prison, the adventures of Jimmy Brandt lead him to an unplanned destiny.  At times comical, intriguing and frightening, The Vortex Winder is a cult classic.  Also featuring a rock soundtrack album by the band Lighthouse XIII - sold separately to kindle format.  ‘From humble beginnings, the story builds and draws you ever deeper ... one of the most entertaining books of the 21st century.’  Jeremy Loughhead, Trianza Review.  ‘The Vortex Winder itself is a great concept – I want one! But after reading the tales of Jimmy Brandt I’m not sure if it’s a blessing or a curse.’  Gabrielle Glover, Cadenza House.  Reminded me at various times of John Christopher, Douglas Adams, Neil Gaiman, Donna Tartt and Lionel Shriver - but ultimately Smith has a style all his own.  Eric Torday, Readers Week",
