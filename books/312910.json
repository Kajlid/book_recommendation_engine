  "description": "A funeral, a murder, and a wedding.A King still sits at the head of the table, but it’s time for a Queen to take over.After all, everyone knows she’s the most powerful on the board.All sides are laying their pieces on the playing field, making alliances, and maneuvering pawns into place when a new player slinks out from the shadows to join the game. Let’s just hope our new allies know how to play.The only question is, what am I willing to lose to get what I want? Is there a price too high?Because to take a King, everyone must make sacrifices.The Sacrifices We Make is a full-length reverse harem novel and is the second in the Maven of Mayhem Series, and it is advised to read The Secrets We Keep first. It is a why-choose romance, meaning our leading lady has multiple love interests and does not have to choose to find her happily ever after. MM builds throughout the series. Please be advised there are graphic scenes of violence and sex that may offend some readers. Proceed with caution.This is book two of three in the series.",
