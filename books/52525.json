  "description": "Balloons and streamers? Carvel cake? Those might be standard fair for your average birthday party, but Whitney Blake and Sophie Mitchum are anything but average. I'm Laura Finnegan – thrift store junkie and scholarship student at Tate, our posh all–girls high school in Manhattan. I'm not like Whit or Soph, but that doesn't stop us from being BFFs. But then they started tuning in to the all–Sweet Sixteen, all–the–time channel. Now tempers are flaring, Prada bags are flying, and guys are being tossed around in vicious tug–of–war battles. Whose Sweet Sixteen will reign supreme?",
