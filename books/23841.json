  "description": "Charting Killoffer's violent odyssey through a world overflowing with his many selves, 676 Apparitions is a spectacularly ambitious attempt to roll back the constraints of autobiography and graphic narrative.Originally published in French by L'Association in 2002, this is widely recognised to be one of the most important European comics of past years, and was nominated along with Jimmy Corrigan and David Boring for Best Album at Angoulême in 2003.This edition has been completely relettered by the artist.",
