  "description": "These poems embody a journey of transformation of the Christian soul, fueled by Michael's own metanoia and hunger for growth in faith. His spiritual conversion is witnessed within the four-year period of this work, culminating in a mature and renewed desire to uplift others through the imagery of words. Through the names and order of his poems, Michael uses the Divine inspirations of the Holy Spirit to reflect an evolution of faith. Leveraging the clever lens of rhyming poetry, he represents various phases of growth and has organized this work into that specific order. This begins where his soul experiences inner healing and was tilled into fertile soil by the Lord, seeded and planted with new growth, and bore forth fruit. Through a period of waiting on the Lord, Michael began to gather his poems into a cohesive work, sharing with us the fruits of harvest of his growing zeal for love of Christ. Michael-isms include such colorful phrases as: \"Make me the dirt around your tree of Good Hope. I'll hold in the water that sustains other's growth\" \"In the universality where time holds no part, God knows His children who love from the heart\" \"We seek to beat a different drum from whose control no headlines come\" \"Begotten one, Perfection's Son, sent to defend; There's power in the name of Jesus! All knees must bend\" \"We believe what's not and hide what's wrought from shadow's cart\" \"No soap on a rope for this specious disease; From a rich man's prison, God save me please!\" \"In Satan's last battle the family falls without the protections of tradition's walls\"",
