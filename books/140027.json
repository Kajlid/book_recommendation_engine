  "description": "Worshipped, envied, desired, and feared by all, Siena Hamilton reigns over Temperley High. She and the Starlets may still be healing from the unfortunate and horrible events of that night, at the end of last year, but nothing can shake her place as the head of Temperley’s elite. The Starlets are nothing if not adept at dealing with traitors, and Siena is the most ruthless of them all. There is only one person who could possibly get in her way…Romy, former Starlet, is back, and no one is happy about it, least of all herself. She’s changed now, though. She’s trying harder to be normal, to blend in and keep the secret of what really happened that night safe and hidden. But when your former best friends are untouchable, and you’ve betrayed them, you don’t just get to come back—especially if you’re beginning to think they might not have been your friends in the first place.",
