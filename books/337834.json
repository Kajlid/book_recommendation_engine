  "description": "The stern doctor broke my heart years ago.\n\nNow we’re holed up in a safe house for the holidays.\n\nDr Raul Ossani is the last man on earth I want to hide away with, even with a price on my head. Sure, he can stitch me up if something goes wrong—but what about my bruised heart? What about my damn pride?This is a small, quiet house. We’re trapped here together, all alone.It doesn’t help that the doctor keeps staring. That his touch lingers. That his body clearly wants me, even if his heart and brain disagree.Maybe I’m looking at this the wrong way.Maybe revenge is a dish best served… seductively.\nSilent Knight is a short and steamy instalove story, starring a repressed doctor and his mafia princess.\n\n*Each book has an HEA, but the Very Merry Mob series is best read in order.*",
