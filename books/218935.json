  "description": "\"Queen Jane's Version, The Holy Bible for Adults Only\" (QJV) is an outrageous parody, chapter and verse, of the King James Version (KJV). Throughout the text, graphic icons flag the most scandalous scriptures, while contemporary language (including epithets and sexually-explicit slang where appropriate) exposes and holds up for ridicule all the flaws, errors, contradictions, debaucheries, atrocities, obscenities, and absurdities that fill the \"original\" KJV. Though the QJV is often radical, cynical, sarcastic, blasphemous, and bawdy, the purpose of such an approach is to inspire people to live life for life rather than for death, for reality rather than for mind-crippling myth. Subtlety often makes its humor cunningly deceptive, and its variety of writing styles mirrors the many differences of tone and temperament in the \"original\". As a whole, it is an iconoclastic, biting, often shocking satire that mocks religious hypocrisy and the gullibility of hard-core believers.",
