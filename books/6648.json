As the settlement at Sydney Cove grows under the enlightened administration of Governor Lachlan Macquarie, so too the Mannion family see their fortunes prosper at their Nepean property. The longings of young Miles Mannion echo the colonyâ€™s efforts to spread to the west - beyond the barrier of the Blue Mountains.An outstanding literary achievement, meticulously researched and deeply felt, The Timeless Land trilogy remains an unrivalled portrait of the earliest days of European settlement in Australia.
