Was he sleepwalking?” “Oh, God!” said Elisa, her arms squeezing Roland tight to her chest. “He was trying to let it in!” In 1904, M. R. James published The Mezzotint; a macabre short story about a picture that has a chilling tale of its own. This novella explores the horrifying events told within that picture. Anningley Hall – a large country house in Essex – is home to Arthur Francis and his wife Elisa. Arthur is obsessed with his new printing press and so consumed by his desire to make a name for himself as a mezzotint artist that he is oblivious to his wife’s increasing desperation and loneliness.

And their three-year-old son is in contact with a dark presence that seems intent on entering Anningley Hall…",
