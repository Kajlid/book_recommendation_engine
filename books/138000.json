That's the question for Lawton Rastor, the billionaire bad boy from Detroit, after he lets the girl of his dreams not just slip through his fingers, but run away, fast – and with good reason.  How do you resist a guy who's irresistible? That's the question for Chloe Malinski, the world's most overqualified waitress, after a nightmarish night leaves her vowing to avoid her fantasy guy for good – no matter how hard he works to win her back.  Chloe finds Lawton impossible to resist. Lawton finds Chloe impossible to forget. But finding that place to belong isn't easy when neither one knows where the other truly comes from.  A full-length novel of 82,000 words, Rebelonging concludes the two-part Belonging series that began with Unbelonging. This new adult contemporary romance features mature content, sexual situations, and adult language. It's not advised for anyone under the legal age of consent.",
