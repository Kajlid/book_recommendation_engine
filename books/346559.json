  "title": "The Night Fairy",
  "description": "What would happen to a new night fairy whose wings were accidentally chewed off by a sleepy hungry new bat? Flory, acorn-size, with a single small sting spell, finds the world very big and dangerous. Depicted in the lush back garden of an old giantess, garbed in delicate softly tinted petal gowns, she fiercely practices her sting, swings a thorn dagger, bribes always hungry squirrel Skuggle, and seeks to ride an iridescent hummingbird - to transform her nature into a day fairy instead.",
