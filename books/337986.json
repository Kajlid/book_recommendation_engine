  "description": "“The threads of Peter Lovesey’s new Peter Diamond mystery,  Upon a Dark Night , twist up so neatly they make a perfect hangman’s noose—another triumph of plotting from this master of the classic puzzle form.” — The New York Times Book Review  A young woman is dumped, injured and unconscious, in a private hospital’s parking lot. She is an amnesiac with no memory prior to her discovery by hospital personnel. Detective Inspector Peter Diamond of the Bath homicide squad is unwilling to become involved. He has other, more important cases to solve: A woman has plunged to her death from the roof of a local landmark while half the young people of Bath partied below, and an elderly farmer has shot himself. Are these apparent suicides what they seem, or are there sinister forces at work? And might the amnesiac woman hold the key to both cases?",
