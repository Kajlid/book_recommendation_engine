  "description": "Dara, one of the Simmasi Royal Rangers, is tasked with escorting Prince Shaelon across the Simmasi Kingdom. It proves more challenging than either one could guess when they are beset by assassins trying to make sure the Prince doesn’t reach his grandfather’s army. As her King knew she would, Dara goes further than her original orders, offering to both protect and fight beside Shaelon as he leads the army his grandfather assembled to reclaim their ancestral throne. The army is up to the task if Dara can just keep Shaelon alive long enough.",
