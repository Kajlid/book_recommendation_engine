  "title": "Sense and Sensuality: Erotic Fantasies in the World of Jane Austen",
  "description": "Enter into the erotic fantasies of Jane Austen fans in this new anthology. This is the way the Regency should have laced with magic, flagrant sexuality, and the triumphant power of true love. Join five talented authors as they journey through the era of men in tights and women in corsets with a twinkle in their eyes and some magic up their sleeves. This collection features stories of Regency dandies in love; lifelong commitment to the powers of darkness; bookish spinsters blundering into sex magic; and Fanny Price being brave! All incredible, all lushly erotic, and all worth reading.",
