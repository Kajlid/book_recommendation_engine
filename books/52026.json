  "description": "Miss Bianca began to take more interest as the little green snake continued his story. \"The Ranee's page,\" he added, \"is in the elephant lines waiting to be trampled to smithereens at the next full moon on account of his sniveling into Her Highness's sherbert!\"And so intrepid Miss Bianca, her sense of justice outraged that such a dire punishment can be meted out for such a trifling error, begins to plan and scheme an urgent rescue mission, which must be the strangest and most exotic yet.Only this time she will need every ounce of tact, every measure of courage and all the wits she could possibly muster.",
