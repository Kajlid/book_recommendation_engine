  "title": "Mr Bison's Journal",
  "description": "Take an acerbic, irreverent British man, add a small family and a job with lots of travel, and transport the whole lot to the United States. Mix liberally with the kind of humor you're not supposed to share at mealtimes, and spoon out into a book full of observations and bite-sized wit. This is Mr. Bison's Journal, the long-awaited, laugh-out-loud first book from one of the most interesting and rudest new comic writers to emerge in recent years. Ideal for reading on planes, at bedtime, or even on the toilet, and since it wasn't written by JK Rowling you won?t need to bend at the knees just to pick it up.",
