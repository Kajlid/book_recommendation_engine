  "description": "The wintry Scottish Highlands is the setting for Jackie Ivie's magical new novel of a man and a woman who battle the elements and each other to learn that the season's greatest gift is love. . .\nA Reluctant Husband\nCaught in a furious blizzard, battle-weary Myles Donal has only two options: die alone in the snow, or make his way home by order of his sire to marry a woman known as the Harridan of the Highlands. The warm glow of light in a small croft will only delay his fate. . .\nA Rebellious Bride\nKendran is not about to share her hard-earned shelter with anyone, especially not a man! Running away from an arranged marriage was her only chance at freedom--and she'll not forfeit it to another arrogant male. . . even one as devilishly attractive as Myles Donal. . .\nA Wedding To Remember\nSnowbound and equally stubborn, Myles and Kendran engage in a battle of wills that quickly becomes a passion too fiery to ignore. \"Wedded bliss\" may be an abhorrent concept to both of them, but true love is not so easily denied. . .",
