Something needs to change.She knows exactly who's going to help her.Women fall head over heels for laid-back, confident Wyatt, but all he cares about is surfing.

When Hannah offers to run his social media in exchange for lessons, it's too good to pass up.He'll coax the pretty bookworm out of her shell, but they'll do it his way.Disastrous surf lessons, dive bar karaoke, a romance-only bookstore and a sparkly dress that makes her feel beautiful--spending time with Wyatt is nothing like Hannah expected. But he's all wrong for her... right?A spicy, hilarious small-town friends-to-lovers romantic comedy with a guaranteed HEA.This is the second book in the Queen's Cove series, but can be read as a standalone.",
