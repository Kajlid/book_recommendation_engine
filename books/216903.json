  "description": "Some days, it’s just not worth getting off the couch.  All I wanted was to enjoy the day in the company of a beautiful woman I’d met the night before. Then Tully came knocking. Sure, she had a job offer. And yeah, the guy she was with looked decent enough. But then he started talking about puzzle boxes and exchanges in abandoned buildings in the dead of night.  I mean, that sounds fun. Right? What could go wrong?  If you’re already answering that question, then you’re one step ahead of me. Thanks for making me look bad.  Anyway, the next thing I know I’m up to my nose hairs in double-crosses, Canadian hitmen, femme fatales, and mysterious runways in the middle of nowhere. Why can’t things ever be simple—or at least involve lots of bacon and/or whiskey?  Too much? Yeah, that’s what I thought.  Who am I, you ask? No one special. Just another face in the crowd, a cog in the machine...an average Joe.",
