  "description": "General Lance Reynolds needs Molly’s team for a clandestine operation. The only problem? It kicks off in one week, and the Syndicate needs cleaning up once and for all. \n\nSo what is a girl to do?\nGo on the offensive, of course.\nBut with the ultimate take down planned for the bad guys of Planet Estaria, you know it’s going to be EPIC.\nBut at what cost?\n\n\n--- PLEASE NOTE ---\n\nInside this book is cursing, amusing cursing, but cursing nonetheless. If bad language offends you, perhaps this book is not for you.​\n\n​\n\n\nSet on the foundation laid by the Kurtherian Gambit Series, Awakening tells an entirely new story in the Age of Expansion--when the Etheric Empire is fast becoming the Etheric Federation with all of the trials and tribulations that come with bringing together different peoples, systems, and ideals.",
