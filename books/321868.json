  "description": "Imagine leaving your life behind, and with it all traces of civilization. From the moment Ember Maddox opens the elegant embossed envelope, informing her that she has been matched, her life will be forever changed. With nothing but the wilderness gear provided by her new Master to shield her from the elements, and a box of ritual items she isnâ€™t sure she knows how to use, she finds herself at the Lodge, a place of where survival instincts and ritual magic are the law of the land. Ember may find it natural to leave her inhibitions behind, pinned beneath her new lover in the sacred grove, but when the brutality of nature threatens to destroy her safety and her sanity, she can only hope that her instincts will keep her alive. It takes nerve to brave the wilderness and explore the Lodge, but keep your wits about you. Once the first snow falls, there is no escape. Content Warning: This story is intended for mature audiences. Contains themes of graphic sex, substances, impact, bondage, bdsm, blood, and natural violence.",
