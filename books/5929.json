  "description": "In a desert town on the road between L.A. and Vegas, all hell has broken loose . . .In a bedroom community populated by good cops and bad cops, a retired police officer and his wife have been brutally tortured and slain. A wildcase with no apparent rhyme or reason, it has caught the attention of the FBI . . . and Hollywood billionaire, ex-Delta Force operative Rail Black, who called the slaughtered pair his friends.With his frighteningly efficient skills and more money than he could ever spend, Rail believes in helping people he cares about--even if it means clashing with the government's enforcers. But this wildcase has toxic tendrils rooted in a distant past, snaking through a shady megachurch, through Sin City, and into shadowy places halfway around the globe. And the precious blood already spilled is nothing compared to the deluge to come--with Rail's own added to the mix if he gets too close.",
