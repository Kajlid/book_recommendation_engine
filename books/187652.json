  "description": "The Next American President is a novel with a message, actually two books in one. The fictionalized and highly interesting story of a regular, middle class, every day American guy becoming the next president of the United States through a strange twist of fate, is interspersed with a well researched documentary on the serious problems that threaten our way of life in modern day America, and how a real American, not a professional politician, would go about addressing and solving these potentially disastrous conditions.",
