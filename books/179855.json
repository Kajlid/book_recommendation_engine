But now, I'm holding so many memories I'm not always sure which ones are actually mine, any more. Some of them are sensitive; all of them are private. And there are those who are willing to kill to access the secrets I'm trying to bury...A classic Parker tale with a strong supporting cast of princes, courtiers, merchants, academics, and generally unsavory people.
