My life in Sundance is more dangerous than ever–the shifter attacks on me haven't slowed, I'm battling enemies within the Blacke group, and now there's a powerful new beast with the ability to climb inside my head, hunting me.In the past, I sat back and waited for my enemies to attack. No more. This time, I'm taking the fight to them.For readers who enjoy urban fantasy with a side order of romance, fast-paced action, and a dash of humor.",
