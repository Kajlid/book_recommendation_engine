  "description": "‘You in Us’ explores the story of Aarav Saxena, an ordinary looking teenage boy with an unexpected mystery and persona. The story starts with Aarav’s entry into a college, where he meets Aditi, the love of his life. Though everything seems normal, the story takes a mysterious turn with the entry of Aarav’s childhood friend Tanya (member of rich elite class, but down to earth). Aarav spends a few months of his college life with a secret about himself. A secret, which no one else knows, except Tanya.The story explores the different views on love and how it changes with different characters. It is not a common story in which a boy falls for a girl, but instead it tries to explore the real meaning of love and how it is more than just 4 words. It’s about the big difference between love and true love. It’s about how love always finds a way.",
