  "description": "The snow has melted, flowers are blooming, and the Easter Beagle is on his way! At least, according to the ever-trusting Linus Van Pelt. Charlie Brown, Lucy, Peppermint Patty, and the rest of the Peanuts gang are a little skeptical. \"Good grief!\" crabby Lucy says. \"There's no Easter Beagle!\" In the vein of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, this Easter classic, based on the television special, features the beloved characters created more than 50 years ago by cartoonist Charles M. Schulz. Peppermint Patty is perennially aggravated with Marcie, Sally is still lovelorn yet litigious (\"Never trust a man with a blanket,\" she fumes. \"Get me my lawyer!\"), and Charlie Brown is disappointed once again in his holiday hopes.",
