  "description": "Ever wonder why people close to you behave the way they do? Kefira does. Enlisted as a child and living out the vicarious dreams of her adoptive mother as a covert-ops sleeper, Kefira fights against a ticking clock. Flashbacks provide sanctuary from the political intrigue, adding depth to the real-to-life personalities of Kefira's team. In her attempts to unravel the political intrigue behind world-threatening events, Kefira - the orphaned child of top-secret Mossad operatives killed by a bomber in Buenos Aires - confronts more than even her training can cope with, yet she intuits her way to disentangling multiple threads to plans for a chemical weapons attack on Israel in the making. Kefira’s investigations expose not one but two world domination plots, including the machinations of a Russian oligarch’s greed and traces of a covert Chinese espionage plot to exploit mind control.\"Tsunami Connection\" is an espionage thriller that’ll keep you awake at night. It combines intricately painted descriptions that reviewers say, “put a picture in your mind's eye,\" and the story of a determined thirty-something woman’s struggle to find her place in an inhospitable world.
