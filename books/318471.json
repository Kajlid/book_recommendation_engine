  "description": "\"... ghosts like wilting roses need to be sheared down so the living can thrive.\"In her world of townies and tourists, eighteen-year-old Sabiha Boz finds herself in the middle. Not quite one, not quite the other. When it comes to life and death she’s in the middle of that as well. She can see ghosts, they can see her right back, and just like the living, they all want something. Sometimes a talk, a kiss, or a message to take to a loved one. And just as her mother taught her, Sab’s answers range from no, no, and at what price?But when the ghost of the town’s dearly departed homecoming king comes to her for help, maybe her prices can be negotiated? He has a hold on her one that she can’t quite explain herself? But his spirit is also wanted by another. A grim reaper in Italian leather shoes and a warrant for the athlete’s soul. Will she bargain for a boy she barely knows or does her deep-rooted connection to him dredge up much more than the dead?Secretive townspeople, talismans, and a haunted ship plague the pages of this paranormal urban fantasy. Where things aren’t always as they seem.",
