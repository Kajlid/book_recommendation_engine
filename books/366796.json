  "description": "Everyone needs something funny to stick in their pocket to read on the train, or on a lunch break, or in line at the DMV. This is that something. Jeffrey Brown sets aside the sappy sentimentality of his autobiographical comics to bring you this subtle and subservise, laugh-out-loud, giant-size Small collection of gag cartoons. Enjoy.",
