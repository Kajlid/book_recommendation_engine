  "description": "The future can’t hold back the past.   Octavia Vail was unaware of her life before being found on a barren Connecticut road as a young child. The locals were shocked that she only spoke Latin and at the dead greenery and livestock around her. Her only possession, a mysterious ring, may have something to do with it. And when the ring’s crest matches a picture of a man who lived centuries ago, Octavia knows she must find out more about him.   Victor Logan Marchette, a vampire who’s lived for over 600 years, is the CEO of a Philadelphia hospital that deals with blood diseases. The first 200 years of his life are a mystery to him, but he’ll soon find out the horrifying reason why. Meanwhile, Octavia begins work as a nurse in the same hospital, and the sparks with Victor begin to fly.   But Victor is betrothed to another, a vampire from a wild clan, under the orders of the vampires’ governing body, Cabalistis. And when vampires in both clans discover Octavia’s presence – and the hidden danger she represents -- it’s all-out war.   Born of Sin is the first in a thrilling paranormal romance series. In a world of darkness and strife, the light of love is all that stands against it. And even for the most hardened vampires, that light… is the true meaning of eternity.  *A re-release of Blood Thirst, An Eternal Romance, and a sneak peek of Book 2.",
