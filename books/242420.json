  "title": "Return to Alpha",
  "description": "Forty years in the future, planet earth will suffer from horrendous climate changes due to global warming. Forty years from now, haunted survivors will also be recovering from seemingly endless waves of decimating plagues that came from uncontrollable biological weapons.Then, one crisp April morning forty years from now, a strange spaceship lands on a Jamaican beach carrying six aliens. Four of them claim to have the same father, and he was from our earth, Alpha-Earth. Their father is Dr. Malcolm Renbourn, the only man to have lived on three earths in the multi-verse; two of the aliens are his children from Beta-Earth, two from Cerapin-Earth.How would we Alphans react to this news, an unexpected awareness that our planet shares cosmic space with at least two other earths? How can we adapt to hearing there are many gods and goddesses in the multi-verse, not one creator of everything? Would we be accepting of alien humans who talk about radically different cultures from anything we know? How would we treat these ambassadors bringing with them what is, for many, unwelcome realities? Would we treat our cosmic cousins and neighbors any better than Beta or Cerapin did their father?Return to Alpha is the sixth book in the criticaly-praised Beta-Earth Chronicles following The Blind Alien, The Blood of Balnakin, When War Returns, A Throne for an Alien and The Third Earth.",
