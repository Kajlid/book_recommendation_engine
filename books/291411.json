  "description": "Iâ€™ve spent my entire life undercover. When the director of Spy School asks me to go undercover at the academy, I know this is going to be my hardest assignment yet. I have to fool agents to who are trained to find people just like me. I have to lie about everything. My age. My name. Even my life. There is only one rule I live by, and that is no attachments. So why am I finding that rule is harder to live by?  The Undercover Life is the first book in the Spy Academy Series.
