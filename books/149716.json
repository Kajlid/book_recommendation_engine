  "title": "My Precious Life",
  "description": "Pain and poverty paved the way to peace and spiritual prosperity in the life of the author, Patricia Ann Boyes, ordinary person. In this memoir, she takes us from a three-year-old child witnessing her mother's brutal beatings, to a seventeen-year-old suffering the throes of childbirth; through a bitter marriage breakdown, and on to new love, entrepreneurship, and a battle with cancer. This memoir will not compare with that of the rich and famous or with the extraordinary drama of the Malalas of the world, but it may compare in some ways with the lives of other ordinary people who also have a story to tell, lessons to learn, and obstacles to overcome. It's a story of believing God's promises and learning life's lessons. Someone once said, \"Don't die with your words or your music still in you\" The author has taken this advice.",
