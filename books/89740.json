Which is why her attraction to former Navy SEAL Maxwell Ackerman doesn't make a lot of sense.

Janet and Max take the plunge, willing to see if the give-and-take of their unexpected relationship can satisfy their deepest desires. Until ghosts from their past emerge, threatening to destroy the delicate balance of power before their love can find a way to tip the scales.",
