  "description": "In the heartwarming yet sizzling sequel to The Man Must Marry, Ben Sinclair falls for the one woman he had never expected to loveâ€”and learns about the son he never knew he had. He'll play by her rules until she falls for him...hook, line and sinker. When an anonymous letter stuns shipping magnate and confirmed bachelor Ben Sinclair with the news that he has a teenage son, he's determined to make good on the past. But Emma Sands doesn't trust him. The beautiful, fiery blonde has raised her nephew in the peaceful woods of Maine since he was five, and just because fifteen-year-old Michael is the spitting image of his tall, handsome father doesn't give Ben the right to march in and change their lives forever. Or so she thinks, until his return mysteriously unearths a dangerous small-town secret. With Michael's help, Ben will do whatever it takes to prove to fiercely independent Emma that he can be the fearless protector she never knew she wanted... and the passionate lover she always thought she could resist.",
