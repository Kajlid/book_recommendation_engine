He longs to correct mankind’s problems and break the curse of social ills, poverty, religion, and politics that divides our world into the “haves” and “have-nots.” A self-made multi-billionaire, Billy reasons that if he becomes President of the United States, with the great power of that office, his dream will become a reality.
