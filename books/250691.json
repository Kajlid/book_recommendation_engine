  "title": "I'm Perfect, You're Doomed: Tales from a Jehovah's Witness Upbringing",
  "description": "Raised as a Jehovah’s Witness, Kyria Abrahams’s childhood was haunted by the knowledge that her neighbors and schoolmates were doomed to die in an imminent fiery catastrophe; that Smurfs were evil; that just about anything you could buy at a yard sale was infested by demons; and that Ouija boards™, even if they were manufactured by Parker Brothers™, were portals to hell.When Kyria turned eighteen, she found herself married to a man she didn’t love, with adultery her only way out. \"Disfellowshipped\" and exiled from the only world she’d ever known, Kyria realized that the only people who could save her were the very sinners she had prayed would be smitten by God’s wrath. Written with scorching wit and deep compassion, I’m Perfect, You’re Doomed manages to be hilarious about the ironic absurdity of growing up believing that nothing matters because everything’s about to be destroyed.",
