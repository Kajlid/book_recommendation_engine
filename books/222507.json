  "description": "\"I DRINK, FIGHT, AND LIVE LIKE A MAN-\"The great black-whiskered rogue lunged at me like a great bear as he sought to drag me into his embrace, but as I wrenched out my sword he seemed suddenly sobered by what he saw in my eyes. As if he realized at last that this was no play, he gave back and drew his own blade.He wielded his sword with strength and craft, and well for me that I had learned the art from the finest blade of all. My quickness of eye and hand and foot was such as no man could match. Blackbeard sought to beat me down by sheer strength, but this availed him no better, because woman though I was, I was all steel springs and whalebone, and had the art of turning his strokes before they were begun.\"Bitch!\" he roared in swift fury, his eyes blazing. \"I'll have you for that! You drink, fight and live like a man,\" my enemy mocked,\"BUT SHALT LOVE LIKE A WOMAN!\"Cover Illustration by Stephen Fabian",
