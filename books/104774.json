  "description": "THE QUESTION invites readers to consider this If you could have the answer to one question, what would you ask . . . and who would try to stop you from asking it? To what extremes would they go? THE QUESTION is a thriller that explores the nature of thinking, a method powerful enough to answer very complex questions . . . perhaps powerful enough to solve the universe's most beguiling unknowns. THE QUESTION is an adventure story . . . a fantasy . . . fiction that you may wish, may believe, may know, is true. The narrative occurs in the present, with scenes in California, Washington, D.C., Paris, Shanghai, New York, and Afghanistan. The story is aimed at high-school and older readers and contains some graphic violence and occasional sexual allusions. The plot is action-oriented with an element of scientific fantasy, similar to Jack Finney's \"Time and Again.\" The prose is crisply written, professionally edited, and organized into movie-scene chapters. THE QUESTION is ideal reading for anyone who is curious . . . for those who gaze into the cosmos at night and wonder . . . for those who look into the mirror and imagine . . . for those whose hearts beat faster when confronting the unknown . . . for readers who enjoy a fast paced, contemporary thriller that inspires them to think.",
