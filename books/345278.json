  "description": "Melody Logan had only just found a safe harbor when a new storm set her adrift all over again.... Melody had always believed that her mother, Haille, and her dear stepdaddy had died in tragic accidents. That belief had brought her to stay with her secretive Logan relatives on Cape Cod. But everything changed when a friend spotted Haille's picture in a catalog, igniting Melody's hope. Could it be true that her mother hadn’t perished in a California fire? Could she be alive but in desperate trouble, unable to reach out?The dream of finding her mother seemed as fragile as the scrap of paper that served as her only clue. Even as Melody was swept into a pampered life as a guest in a Beverly Hills mansion, nothing could prepare her for the devastating moment she stood face-to-face with her mother. Haille’s cold, stone-like gaze and initial denial of recognition shattered Melody's heart. Why had her mother pretended not to know her? Why had she faked her own death?Though Melody’s beloved Cary called to her from Cape Cod, she knew deep down that her mother needed her now more than ever. Beneath Haille’s broken promises and faded dreams, Melody clung to the hope of uncovering the truth about her past. Only then could she chart a path to a safer, brighter future—a future she could truly call her own.",
