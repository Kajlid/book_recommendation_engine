Then grew stronger.The music stopped, the room emptied, and Baxter Richardson opened his eyes for the first time in months. He should have died from his involuntary plunge off a cliff. But he’s alive, and mortal danger remains. Familiar enemies stalk him. New ones hover close at hand.Meanwhile, haunted by accusing apparitions and the tightening dragnet of criminal investigation, Baxter’s wife, Rena, is losing her patience. And quite possibly her mind.Caught in the middle of it all is Alexia Lindale, a lawyer forced to find her way through deceptive alliances, uncertain romances, and courtroom intrigue. It’s a struggle of life and death…and life everlasting.",
