  "description": "(Alternate cover edition of ASIN B0CHHBZJ6C.) What if two Ivy League boys were dropped into a James Bond movie? Harvard University, 1941 Will Shaw and his friends are typical American students, still celebrating the end of the Depression and dreaming about a future filled with success. The war in Europe is far away and someone else's concern. Until it isn't. Compelled to do their part, Will and his best friend enlist, but Uncle Sam has other plans for these boys. Will's classes become consumed with learning German, understanding topography, and secret uses of radio transmitters. When Thomas, a handsome Naval officer, steps onto campus, Will's heart spins nearly as quickly as his head. Crimson is a slow-burn MM Romance wrapped in a 1940s thriller, a first-in-series that sets up many grand adventures to come.",
