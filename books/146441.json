  "description": "Talia Riven is twenty-four years old, afraid of the dark, doesn’t drive, oh, and she barely survived being murdered along with her family when she was a child. As an adult, the terror she experienced still haunts her as she desperately struggles to maintain the safety of her average life. Good student, loyal girlfriend and supportive best friend, Talia is all that she needs, or is she? Talia’s high school sweetheart, Ben, and her best friend Nicole, do their best to protect her from danger--both internal and external. Their dynamic is idyllic and smooth until Evan enters the picture. Tall, dark and mysterious, his obsession with the supernatural threatens to alter the very identity that Talia has carefully constructed for herself. Haunted by his own past, she finds a kindred spirit in Evan. He awakens an unexpected desire in Talia--a desire for change and answers to question she forgot she had. As he leads Talia and her friends on a search for the unknown, innocent fun quickly turns dangerous.",
