  "description": "Charlotte Ritter is a survivor and so much more. As a highly caffeinated go-getter busy raising three teenage kids on her own while juggling a full-time job at a family law practice, Charlotte has always dealt with things one day and one cup of coffee at a time. It’s not always easy, especially with a highly autistic teenager and a new, snarky paralegal that was recently hired at the firm, but she manages. Then one day her average but hectic life gets turned upside down when her boss asks her to do some simple research for an adoption case. Charlotte’s talent for connecting dots that most people don’t see, leads her to believe there may have been an abduction that no one even knows about. Has she gone off the deep end or is she right and two people’s lives may be at stake? The only person who believes her is her close friend and co-worker Cole. The deeper the unlikely pair look for the truth, the worse things seem to get as Charlotte’s tenacity leads them down a very dangerous path. Pour yourself a cup of your favorite coffee and check out the first case in the Charlotte Ritter Cozy Mysteries.",
