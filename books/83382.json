  "description": "Ashlee Bishop is a bar owner. She was a happy bar owner until a bunch of pixies turned up demanding protection money. As a garden-variety human, she knows she doesn't have the ability to deal with the pixies, so she calls in the Paranormal Protection Agency to sort the problem out.What she doesn't expect is for the pixies to come back before the agency can get to the bar, or the hot as hell werewolf who shows and starts teaching pixies how to fly. The hard way.She certainly doesn't expect to be able to command his wolf... or to have to when the shit hits the fan.",
