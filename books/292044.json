  "description": "A new cover edition of this ASIN can be found here.\nI gave the rumor mill fodder for a lifetime the day I walked away from a lucrative music career without explanation.\nPeople can talk all they like; my record stores are my lifeblood now, and I’m devoted solely to keeping them afloat in the digital age. There’s just one little thing distracting me: an earth-dwelling sunbeam named Owen Harper. I don’t know what I was thinking when I hired him. In fact, maybe I wasn’t thinking at all. Quirky and excitable, he’s a walking, talking danger to fragile objects. His energy alone could power a small country. That’s never been my style. Hell, I was probably cutting my first album while he was cutting teeth. He wants a music career, and I’m done with all that. We couldn’t be on more opposite paths. He’s other things, too, though. Things that keep me up late at night. Things that make me forget I’m supposed to be simplifying. And damn does he love to push my buttons. Now I’m struggling to resist his pull, drowning in the memory of his skin under my hands, his mouth on mine. His laugh. When a long shadow from my past comes calling with an offer I’d be stupid to refuse, there’s more on the line than the survival of the shops I’ve dedicated the last fifteen years of my life to. Because those fragile objects I mentioned earlier? One of them might well be my heart. Resonance is the second book in the Rhythm of Love series, and can be read as a standalone. It’s a steamy slow burn bisexual age-gap, boss/employee romance with lots of banter and two obstinate heroes who really, really don’t want to want the very thing they both need.",
