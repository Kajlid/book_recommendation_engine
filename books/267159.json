  "description": "Suppose that a few of our present inventions had been made earlier, and others not discovered at all? How would the last century have evolved differently?This is the story of Oswald Bastable, a Victorian captain who found himself in such alternate worlds. It is based on notes handed down to Michael Moorcock from his great-grandfather. It's a story of a world of empires secured by airships, and a Chinese genius who invented the means of overthrowing the West's power!",
