Jothy Rosenberg has heard this his whole life, starting at age sixteen when bone cancer led to the amputation of his right leg.

And in the business world, when working in a reliable position failed to quench his need for risk taking, he plunged into entrepreneurship.In Who Says I Can t , Rosenberg teaches by example how everyone can overcome life s obstacles. He shows that when the world says you can t, courage and determination prove you can be more than good...considering.",
