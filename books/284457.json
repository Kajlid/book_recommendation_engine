  "description": "West: As the CEO of one of the most lucrative venture capitalist companies in the country, I climbed the ladder of success with three things in my pocket: 1. The willingness to sacrifice any social life in favor of hard work and long hours. 2. The knowledge that taking the right risks always pays off. 3. The desire to see pride overflowing in my grandfather’s eyes. After his death, I doubled down, throwing everything I had into work, but there’s only so long I can ignore the promise I made years ago.  Rush: Being a Marine was exciting, intense, and I loved every second. But after years of service, I traded it all for a quiet life back in my small hometown. When my parents announce they’ve sold their vineyard on a whim, I’m blindsided. And when I find out who bought it, I’m furious. The last person who should be inheriting my parents’ legacy is a spoiled rich boy who doesn’t know the first thing about growing grapes. But maybe first impressions are wrong. Maybe quiet and uncomplicated aren’t everything they’re cracked up to be. And maybe some risks are worth taking after all.",
