  "description": "The three bodies found in the Potomac River quickly convinced veteran Homicide detective Harry Picard he was up against something he had never seen before. The victims had much in common; they were all blonde women who had died violent deaths - and all were markedly emaciated.Slowly conflicting leads filtered in: one of the women was a prostitute...another the daughter of a diplomat...a black limousine with a hulking driver, also in black, had been seen picking them up...the car was traced to a man who had come to Washington, D.C., from Europe, by way of England, Malaya, and Canada. Could Picard find, and stop, this monstrous killer?",
