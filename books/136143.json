  "description": "'This is the food my parents ate and their parents ate ... It is an acquired taste, especially one acquired through centuries of discrimination.'A landmark publication in Marathi, Shahu Patole's book Anna He Apoorna Brahma was the first ever to document Dalit food history through the culinary practices of two Maharashtrian communities--Mahar and Mang. Fashioned as a memoir with recipes, it explores the politics of maintaining social divisions through food along with a commentary on caste-based discrimination--what food is sattvic (pure) or rajasic (fit for a king), what is tamasic (sinful) and why.Now translated as Dalit Kitchens of Marathwada, this book presents the poor man's patchwork plate, one devoid of oil, ghee and milk, and comprising foods not known to savarna dictionaries. It also examines Hindu scriptures that prescribed what each varna should eat--and questions the idea that one becomes what one eats. From humble fare to festive feasts, the recipes carefully woven into the narrative show you the transformative power of food in connecting communities and preserving cultural identity.",
