  "description": "Hal Lemirda had never belonged. But then, he was never meant to. A chance discovery and a ruined life changed everything, returning Hal to his rightful place and unlocking the powers that he had only barely been aware of. Among his own kind, unleashed to wage a secret war without restriction or control, he inadvertently sets himself on a path that will ultimately risk his own ruin. Cold and emotionless, unrestrained by conscience or morality, Hal finds him being driven further and further from his own kind. Influenced and ultimately corrupted by newfound allies, his closest companions are forced to save him from his own addictive personality and the grip of an enemy they had never known existed. As shadowy forces bring their influence to bear, Hal and his companions are forced ever deeper into a conflict they are ill-equipped to fight.",
