Ye’ll do well tae remember it whilst ye’r kneeling at my feet, and I’ll make certain ye count yerself blessed for the privilege.”Clay MacDonough appears to have it all–sinful good looks, success, and a woman whose sexual appetites match his own–but he wants more. Determined to win the complete surrender of the submissive who tests him at every turn, Clay is willing to give up almost anything to have her–including his family legacy. Dara Sanderson is convinced she’d found the man of her dreams, swearing he must be her soul mate from a past life. Clay is her best friend, and a perfect fit in all the right places, yet how can trust be built between them when he’s shrouded himself in ever-increasing secrecy? With a wee bit of help from a mischievous fae, whose presence in any century can’t be explained, Dara finds herself hurled two hundred years in the past, and cradled in the arms of Angus MacDonnchadha, a magnificent Highland ancestor. Angus’ mannerisms and dominant nature are confusingly familiar, but this Highland laird swears they are married and is demanding nothing less than her complete obedience. Taming his willful bride is foremost on Angus’ mind. Binding him to her in a permanent claim is his compulsion. Together they unlock the secrets of the passage of dominance and submission and discover the key to their future truly lies in the past.Wicked Wicked Passage is a stand-alone novel which features explicit sex, and bdsm elements such as bondage and spanking.
