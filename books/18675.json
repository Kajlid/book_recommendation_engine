  "description": "Persephone's Wings by Sahara Kelly Do yo believe in fairies? Persephone Jones didn't. Until one day she woke up in Fairyland to find herself surrounded by them, loved by them and touched to her soul by one in particular. Could he be her mate? to find out, she needs her wings. And you won't believe what she has to do to get them. Wingin' It by Sahara Kelly When a slick chick fairy from Manhattan takes an unscheduled trip to Europe, more than her wings and her pierced navel are flying. Ripple is out of her country, out of her depth, and in the arms of one incredible lover - Philippe Pinot Noir. Ripple knows he's a real special vintage, but probably not the one for her, since the politics of the French vineyard fairies are confusing, to say the least. The Chardonnays are inconsistently gay, the bees aren't as busy as they should be, the Cabernet Sauvignons and the Merlots cause nothing but trouble - and the Gewurztraminers? They make the Marquis de Sade look like a softhearted dust bunny. It's gonna take all this gal's New York ingenuity to straighten out the tangle of the vines that separates her from Philippe.",
