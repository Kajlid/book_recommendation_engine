  "description": "It’s said that your life flashes before your eyes when you die.It must only happen to those whose lives are worthy.Clearly, Bailey’s life is not. Unwanted from the day she was born, and then discarded, Bailey’s only plan in life is to make it through to the next day. But one hopeless night, one wrong decision, and one pull of the trigger changes everything. Not just for her, but for Nate DeLuca too. Born into a world of crime, he had his entire life planned out for him. He wasn’t supposed to find her that night.He wasn’t meant to capture her, either.And he sure as hell wasn’t meant to save her. Sometimes villains are born. And sometimes… heroes are made.",
