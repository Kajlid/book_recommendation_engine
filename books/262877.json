  "description": "Visit the Sidhe Gardens they said. It will be worth it they said. That’s all well and good, but what they failed to mention was that a harmless conversation might lead to scary red eyes and soul separation. But hey it’s just another day in the life of Lexi Helyanwe. So if I’ve got to drag a reluctant man around the Everlasting by his hair to find my way back to my men, so be it. I know I’m a girl on a mission, I just can’t seem to remember what that mission might be.  Join Lexi on her fourth adventure as she gets caught up in the moment and ends up paying for it in the end. Lucky her, sexy Drakes just keep falling at her feet. And what else is a girl do, but bring them all home and have a little naughty fun.",
