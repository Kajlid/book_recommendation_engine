  "description": "Shan Westin -- half-Chinese, half-American, one hundred percent kung fu badass -- is on a mission to recover five mystical jade animals before they fall into the wrong hands. Over 15 years ago, Shan's mother led a secret society of female martial artists sworn to protect the statues. When the Jade Circle lost four of the five statues during a murderous attack on their sanctuary, 12-year-old Shan's destiny was sealed. It was she who carried the remaining tiger statue all the way to America; she who felt it clawing at her with the need to recover the crane, snake, leopard and dragon. The Circle was destroyed that night, and Shan hasn't seen her mother since. Shan has grown up under the tiger's unforgiving influence and the shadow of her mother's legacy. Her quest to recover the statues takes her to upstate New York and Ian Dashall, a geeky but brave archaeology professor, and then on to France and England with Ian at her side. Finally, on a secret island off the coast of Hong Kong, Shan overcomes torture, betrayal and deadly tigers in order to battle the man who destroyed the Jade Circle. But even as she faces off with him, she loses hope. How can she possibly succeed where her mother had failed? Juno is a new imprint from Wildside Press.",
