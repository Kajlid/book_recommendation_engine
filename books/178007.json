  "description": "Drop-dead gorgeous alive, Matt Brenner had never lacked for feminine attention. Undead, he’s even more potent. Immortality would be stellar, if only he accepted his life as a vampire. Matt and fellow vamp, Richard Hiatt, have created a BDSM empire catering to vampire/Doms and willing donor/subs who trade sexual ecstasy for blood. The clubs have made Matt’s existence manageable, if uninspired. Inspiration comes in the form of Catherine Temple, a beautiful and trusting co-ed, he feels obliged to rescue from a wanna-be Dom.Matt’s made it a rule not to get emotionally involved with human women, and he sticks to it. Cat is the woman who can entice him to break all the rules. Almost one hundred years as an immortal in Los Angeles has left him wrecked by his decadent lifestyle. Paralyzed by a terrible sense of ennui, he hungers for a lost passion for life. That is, until he meets a young woman who inflames every inch of his passion.",
