  "description": "In this story of environmental injustice not seen since A CIVIL ACTION and ERIN BROCKOVICH, young Scott Dominquez of Soda Springs, Idaho, went to his job at Evergreen Resources - an acid fertilizing production facility - on the morning of August 27, 1996. By eleven o'clock that morning, he had been pulled from a poison-storage tank, barely alive and severely brain-damaged. Saddened and outraged by what had happened to Scott, EPA Special Agent Joseph Hilldorfer began a relentless battle to bring the Evergreen's owner, Allan Elias, to justice. Elias had used the tank to store cyanide and phosphoric acid - the chemicals used by the Nazis for their \"Final Solution\" - all the while, assuring his workers that the tank's contents were safe.",
