  "description": "As I saw my new-born baby’s face for the first time I tried desperately to capture her face in my mind—to stamp it onto my eyelids. As she was taken from me I knew I might never see my daughter again.   38 years later…  ‘You were adopted’. Three short words and Sabina’s life fractures. There would forever be a Before those words, and an After.  Pregnant with her own child, Sabina can’t understand how a mother could abandon her daughter, or why her parents have kept the past a secret.  Determined to find the woman who gave her away, what she discovers will change everything, not just for Sabina, but for the women who have loved her all these years.  From the bestselling author of Me Without You comes another touching, beautifully told story about the pain of separation and the enduring strength of love.",
