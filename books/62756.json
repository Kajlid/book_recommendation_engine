  "description": "Preston Marshall's idea of a perfect date ended with his partner strapped to the bed. And in his lofty social position, that was one stance he couldn't be known to take. It just. Wasn't. Done.And so Preston withdrew into himself. By day he threw himself into his job as a highly visible corporate executive. But by night, he became a social recluse.Until inspiration came: If he approached his fantasy like he approached a business deal, he could live his life without losing his company.On the other side of the world, with her own set of motivations veiled by a searing past and another language, Irina Senko was just the woman to enter such a deal.One year.Total surrender.No boundaries. No apologies.",
