  "description": "High resolution surveillance footage clearly showed Joshua Briar walking onto the campus of Walton University in broad daylight and shooting neuroscience professor Edward McSorley.  The bullet ricocheted off a metal plate in McSorley’s head and struck an innocent college girl, killing her instantly.  The pundits called it the strangest murder ever recorded. The prosecutor called it an open and shut case. They were both right.  The only problem? Joshua was innocent.  Now, three years into his life sentence, Joshua experiences a powerful occipital-lobe seizure—wild hallucinations flash before his eyes, visions of McSorley conducting strange, frightening medical experiments on him.  McSorley vanishes from Walton University, and a strange new corrections officer named Slaven confronts Joshua with questions: Did you merge with the pivot? Are you working with the enemy?  A vast conspiracy has followed Joshua into prison, and soon he can’t tell the difference between his nightmares and reality.  FROM THE EDITOR  Fans of Wayward Pines take note: you'll want to check this one out.  Haunting and surreal on one page, achingly wistful on the next, Prison of Souls is a powerful debut by Xander Gray. As Joshua Briar's trip down the rabbit hole stretches deeper, he reaches the places where science and spirit intersect. The narrative's questions are suspenseful and introspective by turns, including everything from \"What is going on?\" to \"What does it mean to be human?\"  Fascinating, harrowing, and thought-provoking, Prison of Souls is the sci-fi thriller you've been looking for.  - Adam J. Nicolai, Editor",
