  "description": "Fleeing from an abusive relationship in Pennsylvania, Kirsta Linden leaps at the opportunity to research Louisiana's bayou country for a colleague. She quickly finds herself embroiled in a century-old conflict at the reputedly haunted Lost Oaks plantation. Sean McLeod, the handsome, recently widowed owner of the property, appears at times attracted to Kirsta, but at other moments almost threatening. When strange things begin happening, Kirsta suspects Sean of trying to undermine her, while he seems to think she's having a breakdown from her violent past. She must face her feelings for Sean, and a chilling, dangerous reality that threatens her sanity, her blossoming love affair, and her safety. Will Lost Oaks be the place she spends her life...or the place that ends her life?",
