  "title": "Along the Red Dirt Road",
  "description": "The uplifting historical mystery rooted in the American Civil War/Great Depression era about secrecy, scandal, friendship, & truth.It is 1933, and a pandemic of homelessness, joblessness, despair, and financial ruin grip the nation. Wind and drought ravage the central plains, and an ambitious new president takes office. Under such circumstances, Annie Young, her parents, and a dog named Bitsy abandon the Dust Bowl for a fresh start back east. Still harboring deep wounds from the Civil War, there are strange undercurrents in Hillview that defy reason or virtue. The innocent girl is befriended by Miss Mittie, an old woman marked by scandal, and a ragtag boy from ages past. Both are hostage to an untold story â€” one that Annie is compelled to reveal. Fortified by curiosity and two kindred spirits, Annie pursues her goal, one that may change the course for many who are yet to travel the red dirt road of life. And so it begins, in the historic beauty of the Shenandoah Valley at the very apex of the Southern Rebellion. The road takes us to the parched and impoverished Midwest, then back to the valley in 1933. Too long, old prejudices and secrecy have poisoned the community. It is time for the truth to come forth - to empower her descendants, her kindred spirits and all who may be touched by this tale.",
