  "description": "Anthropology professor Brian Avery, his assistant, Travis Dillman and the professor's estranged daughter, Sarah Gallagher have found a series of 5,000-year-old petroglyphs near Chicxulub, Mexico that speak of the beginning of the fifth world - the one that is to be ushered in after December 21, 2012. Their efforts at deciphering the code are disrupted by a category 5 hurricane, a vengeful ex-wife and the interference of more than one Maya god. Even with the help of an aged nagual (shaman), his son and granddaughter, the group is hard-pressed to overcome these disruptions in time to fulfill an earth-changing destiny.With a bevy of malevolent and benevolent gods, spirit guides, history, and just a bit of grisly murder and mayhem, Cipher places our heroes in jeopardy and mind- and body-taxing situations again and again, all leading up to a catastrophic climax that gives new meaning to the literal translation of Chicxulub as \"Tail of the Devil.\"",
