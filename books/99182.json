  "description": "'Logan and Lauren' is a stand alone story with NO cliffhangers or anything like that , but it is SHORT!!! It's the perfect length for a quick read before bedtime or for waiting for a doctor's appointment. When Logan Crenshaw comes home from work one day and finds out that his wife is keeping a secret from him, he goes a bit crazy. So he steals her off to the Caribbean where he finally figures out what's been troubling her. But unfortunately, not before he loses his cool and goes completely territorial.Excerpt:Logan tightened his hands in Lauren's hair and her eyes flew open. He could see it clearly, her arousal, the drugged look that had always fascinated him so much. He encircled her wrist in his hand, and locked it behind her back in a swift move that imprisoned her. \"You like that, baby?\"\"Yes.\" Her eyelids fluttered; he knew that she was barely able to hold them open.He rewarded her answer, stroking into her, in and out, and in again. He stayed there, deep within her, and when her eyes closed completely, he dropped his lips to her ear and sank his teeth around her lobe. \"You're mine,\" he said in an uncontrollable hiss. \"That hasn't changed.\" He took another slamming stroke and then stilled again inside of her. \"That will never change.\" He bit down on her flesh. \"You understand me? Never.\"",
