  "description": "An excerpt from the book-On one of the hottest days of the summer of 1853, in the shade of a talllime-tree on the bank of the river Moskva, not far from Kuntsovo, twoyoung men were lying on the grass. One, who looked about twenty-three,tall and swarthy, with a sharp and rather crooked nose, a high forehead,and a restrained smile on his wide mouth, was lying on his back andgazing meditatively into the distance, his small grey eyes half closed.The other was lying on his chest, his curly, fair head propped on histwo hands; he, too, was looking away into the distance. He was threeyears older than his companion, but seemed much younger. His moustachewas only just growing, and his chin was covered with a light curly down.There was something childishly pretty, something attractively delicate,in the small features of his fresh round face, in his soft brown eyes,lovely pouting lips, and little white hands. Everything about himwas suggestive of the happy light-heartedness of perfect health andyouth--the carelessness, conceit, self-indulgence, and charm of youth.He used his eyes, and smiled and leaned his head as boys do who knowthat people look at them admiringly. He wore a loose white coat,made like a blouse, a blue kerchief wrapped his slender throat, and abattered straw hat had been flung on the grass beside him.",
