  "description": "In the Hesperia Territory, revolution never wins. Fledgling reporter Mila Ray should know—for generations, her ancestors have died trying to overthrow their insidiously tyrannical government. For the last 200 years, Hesperia has beaten its people into complacency—but for those who are paying attention, the banned books, the work camps, and the Hesperia Domestic Safety Act that allows Hesperian officials to arrest almost anyone who dares to look too closely, have not gone unnoticed.She’s determined to find another way.A whistleblower shares chilling government secrets and begs Mila to go with him to the Belgae, a small but growing group of insurgents who intend battle. She agrees — but the plan goes terribly wrong, and Mila must run from a sadistic Hesperian agent who has his own twisted agenda for her.As she plunges into the crevices of her society, a chance encounter reveals a powerful new ally that would allow Mila a chance to incite a revolution unlike any Hesperia has ever known… or watch history repeat itself.The debut novel from Leah Noel, While Cerberus Sleeps is a dystopian story with a philosophical feel, a great fit for fans of Emily St. John Mandel's Station Eleven.",
