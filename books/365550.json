  "title": "The Wind Won't Know Me: A History of the Navajo-Hopi Dispute",
  "description": "For the past twenty-five years, our countryâ€™s last Indian war has been raging in the Joint Use Area around Big Mountain and Coal Mine Mesa, Arizona. There Navajos are pitted against their Hopi neighbors--and against a United States government that has divided the land between the two tribes and then decreed that Indians living on the \"wrong\" side must move. With the narrative sweep and emotional veracity of a great novel, Emily Benedek recounts the tortuous progress of the Navajo-Hopi land dispute and portrays the lives it has consumed.",
