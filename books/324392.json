  "description": "The newest series by USA TODAY bestselling author Bella Jewel, coming 2022...Firstly, let me make this clear, I didn’t come here for drama.I came here to escape, to unwind, to relax in paradise.This place is meant to be everything epic the world can offer.A ranch, run by hot tattooed mountain men, that has been made into a retreat.An escape from the world, from all the stresses of daily life.Not only do you get to interact with said gorgeous men, but you get to be involved in the everyday running of the ranch, that is when you’re not hiking, fishing, riding horses, and relaxing.We’re the first group to camp hot stuff, and for what seems like the shortest time, it’s bliss.Hot, cowboy bliss.Horses and mountains, rivers and campfires. It’s exactly what I need.Don’t get me started on the man who seems scarily into me, even though I’m about as fun as a stone on the ground.I’m also as ugly as one.Okay, that’s a bit over the top.I’m not ugly. I am, however, nerdy.Men like him don’t look at girls like me…right?I have curves and glasses and my hair isn’t Sunkissed blond.Still, everything is going beautifully…until a body shows up.As if we’re in some sort of bad romantic comedy.One of my people…mine…is dead.Murdered.And now my little vacation has turned into a god damned murder mystery.With hot men, a camp full of nerds, and a whole lot of unanswered questions.This should be fun.A bloody good time, if you will…",
