  "description": "Alan, a Gen-Xer with obsessive-compulsive disorder, is randomly targeted at a local dive bar outside Chicago with a synthetic drug called Red Phase. This particular narcotic, with an effect similar to the common street drug \"bath salts,\" prompts its users into manic and ultra-aggressive behavior, spanning a half-life of 1-2 weeks. After leaving his part-time job as a standardized test scorer, Alan meets a friend at a local dive bar for a beer. This is where a group of college students randomly \"roofie\" Alan's drink with Red Phase, causing Alan to perform an atrocious series of murders he doesn't even realize he committed until the discovery of alarming physical evidence in his home the next morning. Upon Alan's aforementioned realization, he contacts a former undergraduate classmate and friend, George, who is a defense attorney in Chicago. After a quick phone conversation, George commutes to Alan's house and convinces him it best to turn himself in, but under the umbrella of his counsel and protection. While Alan is sitting in lockup, sleeplessly wrestling with his OCD, The Hand, an underground black bloc group of military-skilled insurgents, liberates him from confinement. After Alan is transported to their underground compound nestled in the recessed boroughs of \"Old Chicago,\" he meets the leader of the domestic terror cell and discovers it's responsible for the creation of Red Phase. Consequently, this brotherhood plans to mass-distribute the synthetic drug during the height of the G20 Summit in Chicago, hoping to throw the city into a chaos of apocalyptic proportions.",
