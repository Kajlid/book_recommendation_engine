  "description": "\"A dark, precise insinuating novel that rewrites pop history into something like a perfect wish come disconcertingly true.\"—Dennis Cooper In the early 1990s, a band called ‘Triangle’ is a cult item on the post-punk music scene. Karl is the brilliant but troubled vocalist, haunted by past violence and present danger, torn between chasing fame and desiring oblivion, between men and women, music and silence. As the band makes waves with the obligatory alcohol, sex and blurred reality, Karl starts to fall apart. Based on the life of Ian Curtis, lead singer of Joy Division, From Blue to Black is a passionate novel about rock music and its world. Born in 1963, Joel Lane lives in Birmingham, England. He is a prize-winning poet.",
