  "description": "‪Saving myself for marriage, not hardly.‬‬Saving myself for someone who will make my heart race, most definitely.In theory it's a good plan, however even the best-laid plans fall through. Seeing him, being around him, alerts all my senses and I dream about being his, wrapping myself in his arms and never letting go. The only problem – he sees me as his sister. My name's Ava Evans and I'm in love with my older brother's best friend, Nate Garrison.   Burying myself in work for the past two years, avoiding any thought of her, has worked, until now. She's everywhere, in my dreams, in my gym, and in my heart. I'm not sure when I fell in love with Ava Evans, but I am completely in love with my best friends baby sister. At first she was too young for me and that made it easy to stay away. Now, it's a struggle to keep my distance.  How am I supposed to resist her when I can’t escape her? If he ever found out, it would ruin our friendship. Even with that knowledge all she would have to do is... Just Say When.",
