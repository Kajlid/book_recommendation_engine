  "title": "The Clockwork Man",
  "description": "Several thousand years from now, advanced humanoids known as the Makers will implant clockwork devices into our heads. At the cost of a certain amount of agency, these devices will permit us to move unhindered through time and space, and to live complacent, well-regulated lives. However, when one of these devices goes awry, a \"clockwork man\" appears accidentally in the 1920s, at a cricket match in a small English village. Comical yet mind-blowing hijinks ensue.Considered the first cyborg novel, The Clockwork Man was first published in 1923 â€” the same year as Karel Capek's pioneering android play, R.U.R.",
