  "title": "Comic Art Propaganda: A Graphic History",
  "description": "Comic Art A Graphic History is a fascinating visual history of some of the most outrageous, and unbelievable and politically charged comics ever published. As one of the most effective and powerful forms of communication, it comes as no surprise that comic art has been misappropriated by governments, self-interest groups, do-gooders, and sinister organizations to spread their message. World War II comic book propaganda-with Superman, Batman, and Captain America raising war bonds, and bashing cartoon Japanese and Germans-was so ubiquitous that there was barely a US comic untainted by the war effort. The sub-textual sequential art continued well into the Ciold War, with both sides producing comics extolling themselves and defaming the enemy. \"The book covers Sex, Drugs, Race, Politics, War and Religion. Strömberg’s historic overviews of each subject and encyclopedic knowledge make for a breezy, informative read.\"-- The Huffington Post",
