  "description": "Avery Clavens is an average, somewhat socially awkward woman who works as a research assistant in a New York library. At least that's what everyone who knows her believes. In actuality, Avery was caught doing something wrong in her youth by a secret government agency, and when faced with either jail time or being recruited by the agency, she found orange really wasn't her color.After seven years of nothing too exciting happening in the office, she is forced to go undercover with an agent she's pretty sure speaks the English language as interpreted by Martians. It doesn't help that she feel drawn to said agent, or that there is a weird spark anytime the two of them touch.Can the two of them stop arguing long enough to get their man? Avery doesn't know, but dealing with Agent Barnes definitely isn't in her job description.",
