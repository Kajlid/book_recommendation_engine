  "title": "The Jellyfish",
  "description": "Odette is a hip, young twenty-something with her own place, a steady job at a local bookstore, an adorable pet rabbit, and a burgeoning crush on a cute girl in the neighborhood. But Odette is haunted by something only she can see... A jellyfish. A jellyfish that floats in her eye, blocking her vision. It's a seemingly minor annoyance... Until one day there are TWO jellyfish. Showcasing stunning and inventive artwork by Boum ( Boumeries ), The Jellyfish is a tour-de-force of graphic storytelling, a powerful, occasionally terrifying story of facing the thing that we fear the most, and finding a light to guide us through the darkness.",
