  "description": "In one blinding flash, the very fiber of her existence is shredded. For criminal lawyer and single mother, Stacie Gustafson, a dependable career, a well-organized life, and an immaculate image, had always been her armor. Without it sheâ€™s left exposed and struggling to create a new existence for her and her daughter. No matter how hard she tries, she is unable to avoid her history.  All it takes is one look at the blue-eyed woman, for Nicolas Flynn to be transported back ten years. Sure, her appearance has changed, but then so has his, since he turned his life around. His devotion to his small-town law firm is tested with the arrival of this bittersweet blast from the past, making for a persistent distraction. One that drags along more trouble than she left behind.",
