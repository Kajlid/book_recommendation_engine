  "title": "The Good People: New Fairylore Essays",
  "description": "Whether called \"the good people,\" \"the little people,\" or simply \"them,\" fairies are familiar from their appearances in Shakespeare's plays, Disney's films, and points in between. In many cultures, however, fairies are not just the stuff of distant legend or they are real creatures with supernatural powers. The Good People presents nineteen essays that focus on the actual fairies of folklore―fairies of past and living traditions who affected, and still affect, people's lives in myriad ways.",
