  "title": "The Other Side of Eve",
  "description": "This enchanting narrative shares two abstract tales as one singular journey. Entwined by action and consequence, the key protagonists are teenagers Evelin Boots and Belleny Vera. Both girls exist and are placed in time across two lands. One is reality as we know it, the other is created as a metaphysical realm where its fate is destined by the energy of the ethereal and the mental health of Evelin Boots. This is a pastiche of the lives of others.A premonition is forewarned. Now itâ€™s a race against time for young Evelin to find solace and peace within herself before her anxieties bring eternal darkness into her life and manifest as tyranny and terror, in the metaphysical realm of Mare-Marie.www.theothersideofeve.com",
