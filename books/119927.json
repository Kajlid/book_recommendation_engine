  "title": "ELT Grammar Book: A Teacher-Friendly Reference Guide",
  "description": "At long last English language teachers have what they’ve been waiting for – a “professional friend” to give a helping hadn’t at all times. A great deal more than a grammar book, this resource is a unique exploration into the areas of the language that teachers, both beginners and veterans, have found troublesome to understand, hard to explain, and challenging to demonstrate to students. Its down-to-earth, reader friendly format gives a fresh, new way of looking at complex material, in turn preparing teachers to communicate better and give more effective examples to students. You’ll find valuable information that you’ve never seen in other grammar reference books!",
