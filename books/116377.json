  "description": "This sequel to Goodbye Junie Moon begins where she left off in Washington, after escaping death threats by army sergeants in Vietnam, and then testifying in Senate Hearings about those that sought to silence her. She had sacrificed her business, and put herself at risk, by succumbing to her conscience and becoming a whistle-blower.In Vietnam she had seen so much death, and so many devastated lives, that now, her one goal was to save a life by adopting one of the many pitiful orphans she had seen living on the streets. This seemed impossible. After all, she was not the usual PTA candidate.A flamboyant, divorced, ex-stripper, suffering PTSD from the Vietnam War, had little chance of meeting the adoptive parents’ stringent guidelines. And even in the 1970’s, such overseas adoptions were expensive. Even worse, she would need to be married! She had tried that once, briefly, and vowed she would never marry again.With no husband, no money, and a lifestyle best suited to the future TV series, Sex and The City, what hope did she have? Her only assets were courage, persistence, and determination. The possibility of royalties from a book she planned to write, about her Vietnam experiences, offered the only real glimmer of hope.Can she change her hedonistic ways? Can she find a husband and become an acceptable adoptive parent?Only time will tell.",
