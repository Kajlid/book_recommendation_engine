  "title": "Alabama - Travelogue by State: Experience Both the Ordinary and Obscure",
  "description": "When locals want the lowdown on what’s going on in their own state…They turn to Amber Richards’ Exploring America series! That’s why travelers are catching on to this invaluable series as well. More than just travel guides, these state-by-state editions, dial-in to the locales, the events, the goods, the foods, sights, sounds, and characters you MUST experience if you want the right to say, “I’ve been there!” It is not a typical travel guide, in the sense that the focus is not about where to eat and where to stay, but rather on where to go and what to experience to get an authentic sense of Alabama. In this edition, Amber collaborates with a local Alabaman to pop the cork on Alabama's rich heritage and history. From well-known attractions and the history behind them, to the obscure less traveled experiences, Ms. Richards delivers the real Alabama to your fingertips!",
