  "description": "Dani\nDani has her eyes set on a singing career, but she’s faced one set back after another. Scraping by on whatever gigs she can get and her night job, Dani needs a break. She’s already decided to take a few days off from the boxing club where she works when her twin sister, Ella, begs her to pull a switch. Dani readily agrees, excited about the access to a recording studio that comes as a perk of Ella’s job as assistant to one of the music industry’s top producers. But when she gets to know her sister’s attractive, grumpy boss, she’s suddenly torn between wanting a music career and wanting the producer who could make it happen.\nTate\nTate knows his assistant thinks he’s an emotionless robot at best and a tyrant at worst. But the truth is, he’s burnt out. He’s tired of the same old thing and aching to find something new in an industry of copies. When his normally quiet and efficient assistant is suddenly acting bright and bubbly, Tate can’t figure out what’s changed, but she’s captured his attention in a way no ever has before. Then, Tate goes into the recording studio after hours and catches his assistant singing in a voice unlike any he’s heard before. When he learns that she isn’t who she’d claimed to be, he’s left wondering, could she be what he’s been seeking all this time?",
