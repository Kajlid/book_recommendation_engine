  "title": "Collectanea: Compendium of Thoughts",
  "description": "Some years ago back in my early twenties I started collecting great thoughts by way of quotes, excerpts from essays, plays, speeches, talks, news articles, poems, movies, and etc... I am now entering my early fifties and I am still continuing to collect these thoughts. I jot them down on notebooks, address books, scratch papers, my iPhone, my iPad Pro, and any other writing instruments I find available at the time which I encounter such thoughts. They have been helping me tremendously to get through the ups and downs of life. By re-reading them over and over, in no particular order, I found these thoughts to be mind soothing and spiritually uplifting. Enjoy this \"Collectanea\", the compendium of thoughts.",
