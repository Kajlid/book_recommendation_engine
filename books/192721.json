From the everyday guy to the cyberworld of a huge futuristic corporation, Spiked explores all the ways men change their bodies, and love each other's bodies, too.

Possession by Jourdan Lane features Lucian and Saaban from the Soul Mates series. What they do might just surprise the whole coven. Laney Cairo's Marginalia pits cutter Bailey and his new love Quint against the government and the big corporations. Will they be able to save Quint? Finally, in Beneath the Mask, by Mychael Black, Lance thinks he's interviewing powerful vampire Triarius, but Triarius has other plans. Will Lance survive the night? Explore a world of skin and ink, of metal and mayhem, where art is not hidden away in museums, but displayed in the gritty underworld of Spiked!",
