  "description": "What happens when everyone around you dies? What do you do first? When the world died in a manufactured pandemic that left only one survivor out of thousands, time is very important and every day matters to some of the littlest survivors. If you live in the middle of a metro area like Los Angeles, there are lots of things that need to be done first and fast. One frightened, shy teacher pulls himself together to start things going to survive and maybe even begin again.",
