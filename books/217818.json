  "title": "Selected Short Stories",
  "description": "This selection of short stories has been made not only to offer a representative and wide-ranging selection of D. H. Lawrence's shorter fiction, but also to trace a pattern of development in the author's career. As Brian Finney writes in the Introduction: \"To follow the development of his stories from the gauche anecdotes of his early twenties to the sophisticated parodies of the genre that he wrote in the last years of his life is like retracing the history of the genre from its pre-Chekhovian social realism and watching it read forward to the verbal play and self-conscious artificiality of postmodernist writers such as Borges and Beckett.\"The selection comprises fourteen short stories, including \"Love Among the Haystacks,\" \"The Prussian Officer,\" \"Odour of Chrysanthemums,\" \"The Border Line, and \"The Woman Who Rode Away.\"",
