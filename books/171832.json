  "description": "Danny Fisk has a secret no one outside his family would believe. Danny sees things others can’t: like ghosts and the future. In his teens, he used drugs to escape his gifts, but with help from his family, Danny cleaned up his life. For fifteen years, he lived the American Dream. He had a loving wife, kids, a great job, and proud parents. That ended when renewed pressure from his abilities drove him back to drug abuse. Now, Danny’s on a mission to save as many as he can from the streets that would destroy them all. Pursued by corrupt cops, drug cartels and his own inner demons, Danny must find a way to survive his gifts. If not, he’ll continue a downward spiral that could cost him the lives of those he’s trying to save. As well as his own.",
