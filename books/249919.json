  "title": "Seven Ways to Die",
  "description": "There are seven basic ways to die. In 1969 Dr. John C. Cavanaugh catalogued them all in his Primer of Forensic Pathology —Case Studies for the Novice M.E. Micah Cody is a 30-something NYPD captain of homicide, who's founded a special unit known as TAZ with city-wide license to take over any investigation at all, with special focus on serial killers. Now its ultimate challenge is on the loose in Manhattan, with three victims already whose causes of death seem like intentional defiance of TAZ's existence — and four to go in four deadly days leading up to Halloween. Chronicling it all with great amusement is the Capote-like award-winning crime writer Ward Hamilton who, egged on by his sexually voracious socialite bedmate, is determined to bring TAZ to its knees journalistically.Captain Micah Cody's Nez Perce name is \"Youngest Wolf\" from his ability to communicate with the animals and read nature's signs. As all hell is breaking loose in Manhattan, the wolves in Central Park howl, the peregrine falcons shriek their warnings — and Micah is listening.****************************************************************When William Diehl died in 2006 he was working on SEVEN WAYS TO DIE based on a coroner’s handbook given him by Illinois Medical Examiner Brett Bartlett, then a client of Atchity Entertainment International. At the time, Diehl left behind over 400 manuscript pages of a novel-in-progress, along with detailed notes and treatment, as well as unfinished chapters, for the rest of the book.“It’s time that Bill’s loyal fans get to read his last, and most exciting, story,” - Kenneth John Atchity",
