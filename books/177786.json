  "description": "As the Dark Powers and their dreaded champion gather their forces, all of Aerisia holds it breath while Hannah Winters, their long-prophesied Artan, continues her quest in the Underworld. Should she overcome its deadly snares, is warfare against the Dark One all that awaits? Or is there a chance for love with the immortal Simathe High-Chief, and a lasting peace for her adopted homeland? To fulfill prophecy, she’ll have to triumph where other Aerisian champions have failed, which means surviving betrayal by friends and contesting the full might of the Dark Powers. To succeed and live, she’ll have to defeat an enemy no one could have predicted with a power no one knew she possessed. Friendship and treachery, love and hatred, faith and despair, and life and death will all be played out on the final field of battle, in an epic struggle not only for Aerisia’s survival, but its Artan’s, as well… ________________________________________________  Books in the Sunset Lands Beyond trilogy:  Book 1 -- Aerisia: Land Beyond the Sunset Book 2 -- Aerisia: Gateway to the Underworld Book 3 -- Aerisia: Field of Battle",
