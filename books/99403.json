Lynn Tyler steams up the pages with passion and desire in the newest addition to her Pack Mates series, Micah’s Refuge .Faced with the choice of hunting down and killing his human lover or being banished from his pack, werewolf Micah is forced to leave everything and everyone he loves. He finds a new pack in Northern Ontario that is willing to give him refuge. Determined to start over, Micah hopes to find a mate he can settle down with in Smooth Rock Falls.Forensic chemist, Shea, rarely gets any down time, and that’s fine with him. As much as he loves his pack, he’s a bit of a loner with no wish for a mate. After all, his slight obsessive compulsive tendencies and a fear of having anyone count on him do not make him mate material. But when a new wolf joins the pack, Shea experiences emotions he’s never dealt with before, turning his whole tidy world upside down.Micah is well aware Shea isn’t looking for a mate and doesn’t know if he should pursue the genius or if he should look for a mate elsewhere. But when tragedy strikes and passion ignites, can Shea just let Micah walk away?Content Paranormal, GLBT, MM, Wolves, Hot, Anal Play, Anal Intercourse",
