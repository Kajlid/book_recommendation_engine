After all, the Bartons had been picnicking by the river when Molly disappeared. One night, Chris views a video he made the day Molly was lost. There doesn't seem to be anything unusual a rest stop, lunch by the river, a hungry squirrel, a familiar ice cream van. But the video harbors an awful secret.
