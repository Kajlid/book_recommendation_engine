  "title": "Twilight of the Mammoths: Ice Age Extinctions and the Rewilding of America",
  "description": "As recently as 11,000 years ago - \"near time\" to geologists - mammoths, mastodons, gomphotheres, ground sloths, giant armadillos, native camels and horses, the dire wolf, and many other large mammals roamed North America. In what has become one of science's greatest riddles, these large animals vanished in North and South America around the time humans arrived, at the end of the last great ice age. Part paleontological adventure and part memoir, Twilight of the Mammoths presents in detail the internationally renowned paleoecologist Paul Martin's widely discussed and debated \"overkill\" hypothesis to explain these mysterious megafaunal extinctions. Taking us from Rampart Cave in the Grand Canyon to other important fossil sites in Arizona and Chile, Martin's engaging book, written for a wide audience, uncovers our rich evolutionary legacy and shows why he has come to believe that the earliest Americans literally hunted these animals to death.",
