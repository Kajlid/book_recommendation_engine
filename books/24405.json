  "description": "Katsu Shinobi isn’t your ordinary princess. For one thing, she’s a Yama, a member of a supposedly demonic race Humans discovered living secretly among them forty years ago. For another, Kat doesn’t subscribe to the icy-hearted principles most royals swear by. She wants to live life—maybe not as recklessly as Humans but as fully as she dares.Accustomed to sharing women, demon assassins Ciran and Hattori introduce Kat to the pleasures of an intense ménage. Neither expects to lose their heart to her, or that Kat's enemies will one day hire them to kill her.Their bid for freedom will pit them against the icy dangers of diamond lands and the alien comforts of a Victorianesque Human world. Most of all, though, this daring trio will need to conquer the threat within. Only when they put all their faith in love will they find happiness together.",
