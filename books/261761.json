To make matters worse, a vicious debate about violence against women inflames the tensions and mounting rivalries in her creative writing group.When a troubled student starts sending in chapters from his novel that blur the lines between fiction and reality, the professor recognises herself as the main character in his book - and he has written her a horrific fate.Will she be able to stop life imitating art before it's too late?At once a breathless battle-of-wits and a disarming exploration of sexual politics, The Body Lies is an essential book for our times.___________________'Gripping and strange in the best possible way: the perfect marriage of risky literary fiction and full-on thriller' MARIA SEMPLE, bestselling author of Where d'ya go Bernadette?",
