  "description": "The world of Fayrie is a world where status and rank is decided by how much power one possesses. The fae and sprite kingdoms have been locked in a cold war against each other for their place at the top for several generations. In contrast, humans fall to the bottom of this system and are considered little more than animals to be enslaved. Lo is a human girl with no advantages nor basic rights. Ardanine is a fae prince set to inherit one of the most powerful thrones in the world. Their paths should have never crossed, but a lifetime of subjugation leaves Lo with no other options but to obey those that wish to use her, getting wrapped up in the intrigues of the royal court. Tied against her will to some of the darkest and most close-guarded secrets of the royal family, obedience alone will not guarantee her survival.",
