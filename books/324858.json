  "description": "I spent the night with a hot, grumpy stranger in an airport hotel.No, not like that. Get your mind out of the gutter. It was just sleeping. And… maybe a little cuddling.Long story short, I embarrassed the heck out of myself. But at least I never have to see him again.Except the universe is clearly out to get me, because Monday morning, I arrive at my new job and who’s the first person I see?Hot stranger himself: Liam Donovan.AKA my new boss.AKA Annie, you are so freaking screwed.While the HR rulebook doesn’t explicitly say you can’t share a bed with your boss, I can read between the lines. And I need this job.Which is why I have to pretend that night never happened. Luckily for me, sexy as Liam—excuse me, Mr. Donovan—is, he’s surly, rude and totally not my type.Or so I keep telling myself.Because I’m starting to think there’s a warm, gooey cinnamon roll with extra frosting lurking beneath that impressive, muscular form.I promised I’d never choose between my career and love.But when a scandal threatens to break, that promise could prove impossible to keep…So That Happened is a laugh-out-loud funny, swoony, closed door romantic comedy. Expect some mild language and suggestive jokes coupled with tons of chemistry and tension, but no explicit scenes.",
