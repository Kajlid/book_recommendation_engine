  "description": "From the outside, Rebecca Wright had an enviable life, and she enjoyed that envy. She had a beautiful house, handsome husband, and a no-limit credit card. What she didn't have was empathy. But, it's never too late in Middle Falls. A lesson that isn't learned in one lifetime can be learned in the next, or the next. Rebecca may need every chance she can get. The Empathetic Life of Rebecca Wright is the tenth novel in the Middle Falls Time Travel series. Like all books in the series it can be read completely as a standalone novel.",
