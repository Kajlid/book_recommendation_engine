  "description": "The Mudhen strolled over and sat on the Camel's gas tank. \"With no trace of egotism,\" he murmured, \"I say I believe I can make her go.\" \"Mud knows cars,\" Froggie said loyally. \"Then let's see him start this crate,\" Rip challenged. \"If I can't make her go I'll give you what you paid for her,\" The Mudhen declared. \"Done!\" Chesse cried. The Mudhen slipped behind the wheel, the motor started and the Camel rolled smoothly down the road. \"Mud, I'm busting,\" Froggie panted. \"Tell me what you did.\" Follow The Mudhen from crisis to crisis, as his master mind turns every predicament to his advantage..",
