  "description": "'[This book is] a valuable contribution to the vital task of getting people to see the business world as a complex, interconnected ecosystem, rather than as a sharp-elbowed race to the bottom.' Rory Sutherland, Vice-chairman of Ogilvy Group UK, and the Spectator's 'Wiki Man'.\nStrategic consultant and social entrepreneur Paul Skinner argues that we have now reached a turning point in history from which creating Competitive Advantage may no longer be in the best interests of an organization.

You will gain access to world-leading techniques to enable you to:· Mobilize staff, partners, collaborators and customers around a common purpose that gets everyone you need firmly on your side. · Foster improved innovation, reach more customers or beneficiaries, build greater loyalty, generate greater income and forge more ambitious partnerships. · De-couple your potential for growth from the level of resource your organization controls.This is an indispensable guide that will help you transform the growth of your business or the impact of your non-profit by bringing the fuller value-creating potential of the outside world inside your organization.",
