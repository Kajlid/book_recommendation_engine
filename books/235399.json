  "description": "Sabrina had a hot sexy night with a bear shifter during her wolf pack's annual barbeque—then never heard from him again. When her Alpha sends her to Ketchikan to track down a murderous rogue, she's surprised to find herself partnered with Karl—the same bear shifter that has been fueling her fantasies for the last year. The attraction is still there, as are insurmountable differences in their personalities and lifestyles.  But their rocky romance has a bigger obstacle—the rogue they track down has gone rabid from a similar magic that's being used to murder shifters in northern Alaska, and the goal this time is to tear apart every bit of good will the wolf packs have with their human neighbors. Divide and slaughter are the enemy's objectives. To save her pack and come out alive, Sabrina will need to do the unthinkable—trust a man with secrets.",
