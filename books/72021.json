  "description": "Maura Reyes survived an almost unbearable trauma—the loss of her family in a home invasion. Two years later, she’s still consumed by grief and acute insomnia, hiding inside her elegant, empty Los Angeles home. No amount of therapy or medication can restore what Maura lost. When her therapist suggests a change of scenery, Maura reluctantly agrees to go on a cruise. But once aboard the luxury liner, she finds herself in a bizarre and terrifying wonderland.On the strange ship Cockaigne, Maura discovers an artist’s homage to “Alice in Wonderland”, complete with Dormouse, Mad Hatter, Tweedledum and Tweedledee. All that’s missing is Alice herself—and Maura, a pretty blond widow, suits the artist’s vision perfectly. Soon, Maura finds herself sliding between past and present, reliving that deadly night in bizarre and contradictory ways. Desperate for sleep, she first questions her memory, then her sanity. Is someone trying to drive her insane? Or is the truth darker and more twisted than she can possibly imagine?A Red Adept Select for outstanding book in its genre.",
