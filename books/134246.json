  "title": "Crowns: Portraits of Black Women in Church Hats",
  "description": "An acclaimed photographer and award-winning journalist provide an intimate look at black women who would rather attend church naked than hatless.For countless black women, a church hat, flamboyant as it may be, is no mere fashion accessory; it's a cherished African American custom, one observed with boundless passion.A woman's hat speaks long before its wearer utters a word. It's what Deirdre Guion calls \"hattitude... there's a little more strut in your carriage when you wear a nice hat. There's something special about you.\" If a hat says a lot about a person, it says even more about a people—the customs they observe, the symbols they prize, and the fashions they fancy.Photographer Michael Cunningham beautifully captures the self-expressions of women of all ages—from young glamorous women to serene but stylish grandmothers. Award-winning journalist Craig Marberry provides an intimate look at the women and their lives. Together they've captured a captivating custom, this wearing of church hats, a peculiar convergence of faith and fashion that keeps the Sabbath both holy and glamorous.",
