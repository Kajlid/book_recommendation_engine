  "description": "God's not dead... but they're trying to kick him out of the public square!Welcome back to Hope Springs . . . where Grace Wesley teaches high school history. She is on the hot seat with the school district after she answers Brooke Thawley’s question about Jesus during a classroom discussion. Suddenly, Brooke becomes a pawn in an epic court case that could cost Grace the career she loves. Tom Endler, a lawyer with the teachers’ union, is tapped to represent Grace in her fight for her First Amendment rights. He finds himself fighting for a cause he doesn’t even believe in. Tom’s research leads him to Amy Ryan, a reporter and former skeptic who found faith while battling cancer and watching the classroom battle unfold at Hadleigh University a year ago. Both are soon on a journey to understand what genuine faith really means, as they fight to save Grace’s job and avoid a court decision that could cripple the free speech rights of all Christians in the marketplace.",
