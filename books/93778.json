  "description": "Alternate cover edition for ASIN: B00G4T1KBYSeeing Micah for the first time in years, Eden wants nothing more than to run and hide. Tall and handsome, Micah is no longer the scrawny kid she remembers. Eden tries to slip by him unnoticed but unfortunately, her body acts on its own accord. In a moment of sheer embarrassment, she throws her arms around his neck, unaware she's just changed her childhood friend forever. With his eyes opened to the realm of angels and demons, Micah soon discovers he has become the Seer, called to save the world from the flames that will cleanse the earth to start it anew. Shy and awkward, Eden stumbles through high school clueless, her guardian angel shadowing her every move, and keeping her safe while she unknowingly “awakens” others to their spiritual gifts. Micah will not only need those Eden has touched to complete his mission, he will need Eden in ways neither one of them thought possible. With angels and demons fighting around them in a battle that began long ago in the ancient City of Enoch, both Eden and Micah must find their own personal courage in order to triumph. For if they fail, they could lose everyone they love.",
