When he wakes up in an insane asylum with no powers and a lifetime's worth of medical records, his whole identity (identities) are called into question. Something is wrong, but is that something Marc Spector himself? Jeff Lemire (Extraordinary X-Men) and rising star Greg Smallwood are calling everything you know about Moon Knight into question.Collecting: Moon Knight 1-5",
