  "description": "Autumn Gilhain hopes that being a founding member of a student artistic society will give her music and her life direction since both are floundering. At the same time, Quinn Gravesend, the greatest composer of the 20th century, suspects his career and creativity are drawing to a close. Over the course of nine months, Autumn and her fellow artists collide with Gravesend, and the seven of them grapple with love and loss, insecurities and genius, dreams and fears. Only one thing is certain: None of them will emerge the same as they were at the start.-----\"Kenyon's characters pursue their daemons, disrupt each other’s lives, and face their ghosts, and ultimately find that the answer is quite natural: Life drives us. A beautiful, profound book.\"—Simone Zelitch, author of Louisa and Judenstaat\"This is a story about art . . . But it is also [about] accepting the mysterious cycles of birth and decay with grace, dignity, and wit.\"—Shawne Johnson, author of Getting Our Breath Back and Eden Ohio",
