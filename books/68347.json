  "title": "The Private World of Georgette Heyer",
  "description": "Georgette Heyer lived in a private world, and created one. A best seller for fifty years, with 57 titles, she never made a public appearance and never gave an interview, maintaining always that her private life was her own, her books the public's concern. It was only after her death in 1974 that her fans learned she was really Mrs Ronald Rougier, wife of QC. Now, almost ten years later , her family have given Jane Aiken Hodge access to the research material that gave some of their quality to her stylish novels of Regency life. Her publishers have opened their files to reveal a formidable, positive person, with strong views and a great sense of style. More than most women, Georgette Heyer made herself the life she wanted, a civilised oasis in a world she disliked. She created a world of manners and morals where laughter is the great corrective an healer. Lawyers and journalist, dons and generals turn to her for escape, along with legions of her grateful readers. Lavishly illustrated from Georgette Heyer's own research files, her family archives and from Regency sources, and enlivened by extracts from her letters and the books themselves, this affectionate life should delight her old fans and attract many new ones.",
