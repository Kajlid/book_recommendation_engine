  "description": "In Batman Sword of Azrael (1992) #1-4, a major new hero was introduced to the Batman mythos. Now, another character is added to the Batman family. Only this time, it's a villain. Bane is the sole survivor of the Venom experiments (first revealed in Batman Legends of the Dark Knight (1989-2007) #16-20), an attempt to create drug-enhanced killing machines. As a result of these tests, Bane has spent a lifetime as the toughest inmate in the worst prison on the South American island of Santa Prisca where he acquired his berserk strength, a savage, calculating intellect, and an unparalleled megalomania. He ultimately sets his sights on Gotham City, and goes gunning for the Dark Knight.",
