  "description": "Britt Anderson is retired. Secretive and fiercely independent, she journeys to Delroi to spend time with her two oldest friends. She doesn’t expect to be dragged back into the spy business when she gets there. But the lure is impossible to fight for a not-so-reformed adrenalin junkie. Danger. Conspiracy. What’s not to love?Unfortunately, there’s always a price and it presents itself as the darkly dangerous Barak Trace. She can’t deny the attraction, but has enough sense to steer clear of the possessive glint in his gaze. Until he somehow manages to merge his psychic abilities with hers. When he’s captured by rebel forces, she has no choice but to go after him. The question is will she be able to free herself once he’s rescued? And will she even want to?",
