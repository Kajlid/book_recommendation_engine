  "description": "When Amelia stumbles upon Marcia and Derrick’s BDSM lifestyle, she doesn’t realize it will lead to her escaping a loveless, dying marriage. She thought that was the stuff of romance books, not real life. Even better, she didn’t realize Marcia and Derrick operated a BDSM club and can introduce her to their friends.Don and Carl are coworkers and platonic roommates. Divorced Carl walked in on his wife’s affair, and never-married Don hasn’t met the woman to make him “risk half his stuff.” The men agree to play with Marcia’s friend as a favor. Amelia’s new to BDSM—the last thing she needs is to get hooked up with a predator.After some obvious meddling by Marcia, the men ask Amelia to be their roommate while she goes through her divorce. Once the dust clears, will she want more from the men, or will they be forced to say good-bye to someone they never realized they needed in their lives?",
