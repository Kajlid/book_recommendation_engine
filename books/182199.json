  "title": "Unclog Your Happiness; A Practical Guide to Living Blissfully",
  "description": "This book is a practical guide to happiness. For those who have read Eckhart Tolle’s The Power of Now, but don’t know how to get there, this book is for you. Through self-inquiry and meditation, as similarly taught by Ramana Maharshi, Gary Weber, and more, you can eliminate anxiety, depression, anger, and enter in the present, happy and content. There has been a lot of research on transcendental meditation in recent years. New scientific studies using FMRIs have advanced the field of neuroscience. Self-inquiry has been shown to boost dopamine and opioid levels in the body, creating happiness that won’t fade with time. Throughout the book, Unclog Your Happiness, these studies are cited to provide both proof and further reading. Meditation through self-inquiry works by removing labels that we have attached to ourselves. These labels are self-limiting beliefs, causing our unhappiness. Depression, anxiety, loneliness, anger, and more can be removed just by stopping the process of labeling.",
