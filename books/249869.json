  "description": "Saint Rossi was born with a silver spoon, but he left it in the dust the day he took off on his bike to become a founding member of the Sinister Knights, their purpose to protect and defend the lives of women around the world. He's known as the club flirt, charming dimples and a rogue grin, but when a dark, curvy beauty falls into his arms, he's blindsided by the primal urge to protect this woman at all costs. Like an imprint on his soul, his only purpose in life is to make her his. Adelina de los Angeles never expected to fall in love with one of the men that saved her from a grim fate. Born into a poverty-stricken community, life with the Sinister Knights is beyond her wildest imagination, and spending every day with Saint has wooed her heart into falling, one innocent touch at a time. But flying too close to the sun can cause permanent scars and even the sweetest fairytales have villains. Soon Saint will be forced to defend the future he's determined to have with the only woman that's ever mattered.Warning: Saint and Adelina are a force of nature; she's free-spirited, he's ready to tie her to him for eternity. Hold on for a wild ride with this alpha hero and the woman he's hellbent on giving everythingâ€”even his badass biker babies. If you're in the mood for a growly caveman who will stop at nothing to claim what's his, then the Sinister Knights men are for you!",
