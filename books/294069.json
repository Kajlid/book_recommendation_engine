But the world has other plans.  They thought they’d reached a safe community. What they’d found was a powder keg with a lit fuse.  Their hardest lessons are only just being taught.  With love comes sacrifice. With sacrifice comes pain. With pain comes sadness. With sadness comes anger.  School’s closed. Today is graduation day, and there’s just one thing left to learn:  With anger comes revenge.",
