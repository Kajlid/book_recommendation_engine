  "description": "Poems of Reality: The Experiences of Life expresses real life experiences in the form of poetry. It will take you to a place where you never thought you could go. Some people may feel different emotions while others can relate to the experiences of life translated through poems of reality. Some people may feel the betrayal, and reminisce on their trials and tribulations. While others may transcend to a level where they can feel the pain, passion, compassion, and fear in a different light. We have all loved and lost. But can we all say that we have all learned and grown from our experiences? The messages delivered in Poems of Reality: The Experiences of Life will make most people see things through a very different perspective.",
