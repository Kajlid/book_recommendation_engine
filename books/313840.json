  "title": "Courage in the Congo: A Doctor's Fight to Save the Pygmies",
  "description": "This book is the remarkable true story of a young doctor who brings hope and healing to the Pygmies in the Congo rainforest. These unforgettable accounts detail the trials and hardships endured to improve their lives. For 27 years, he faced danger and challenges from corrupt officials, hostile soldiers, witch doctors, cultural beliefs, oppression, and betrayal. Dr. Jerry trained \"barefoot doctors\" to treat patients in villages connected only by footpaths through the jungle. He worked tirelessly to build schools and boarding homes for the Batwa Pygmies, whom he described as the \"poorest of the poor.\" Dr. Jerry promised his family that he would write a letter each week. He shared the \"good, bad, and ugly\" as Jerry wanted readers to know the successes and failures. The story is based solely on the letters Dr. Jerry wrote. It is likely one of the longest histories of the Pygmy people, as told by someone who lived with them. The unique story coincides with world events such as the outbreak of AIDS, the Rwandan genocide, the overthrow of President Mobutu, and the Congo wars. You will be inspired by how one man's extraordinary courage changed the lives of thousands of these most oppressed and impoverished people.\" Dr. Jerry Galloway was both compassionate and courageous in times of extreme danger. He was creative in finding solutions for what would seem to be the impossible. In life, few leave a lasting impression, no matter how brief the encounter. Jerry was one of those people. His story needs to be told.\" - Ernest \"Ernie\" Ross, Education Congo â€“ President",
