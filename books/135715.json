  "description": "When the Nicholas family first sees the derelict old house near London that has been left to them in Aunt Deb's will, they are sadly disappointed. Thirteen-year-old Roger's disappointment is greatest, since, having moved place to place all his life with his gifted actor-father, he longs for some measure of stability. Then Roger and his father discover under peeling wallpaper and rotted paneling traces of a much older, more graceful house, and their misgivings disappearâ€” until, that night, the house is filled with a sound of wild grieving that Roger traces to an empty room.",
