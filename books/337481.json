  "title": "The Animal Activist's Handbook: Maximizing Our Positive Impact in Today's World (Flashpoint",
  "description": "Matt Ball and Bruce Friedrich take the plight of the world's animals seriously and have dedicated their lives to ending their suffering. The Animal Activist's Handbook argues that meaning in life is to be found, quite simply, in turning away from the futile pursuit of \"more,\" and focusing instead on leaving the planet a better place than you found it. The critical component of creating a better world for all is thoughtful, deliberate, and dedicated activism that takes suffering seriously. The authors build a ground-up case for reasoned, impassioned, and joyous activism that makes the most difference possible, and suggest a variety of ways to live a meaningful life through effective and ef?cient advocacy.",
