  "title": "The Permit",
  "description": "A Department of Homeland Security intelligence team has identified a new, incredibly dangerous terrorist cabal. It’s the most serious domestic threat to national security the U.S. has faced since nine-eleven. In the past decade, it has killed more Americans than al Qaeda murdered on nine-eleven.\tThese terrorists are deeply entrenched in our society. They look like us, talk like us, live in our neighborhoods and, for the most part, pass for respected citizens. But they are killing Americans throughout this great country—and becoming more powerful every day.\tTheir code name is INDIGO.\tCheckmate, a covert counterterrorism team, has the advanced-technology weapons and agents to neutralize INDIGO, but very little time to do so. If Checkmate fails, America will erupt in armed rebellion…and may not survive.",
