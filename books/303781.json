  "description": "Is it possible to crush on a voice?My favorite thing to listen to is Juniper Love’s podcast show, Go Sports!. Hearing her uninformed, teasing commentary on every game she watches makes me laugh—even when it’s my team she’s talking about. I might be her biggest fan.I thought Troy Tipton was just a nice guy with a gorgeous smile. Until I learned he was a fan-favorite NFL star quarterback. The same one gracing magazine covers with his irresistible dimples. The same one I mock on my show.When we start dating, the explosive chemistry we share is impossible to ignore. But can we keep our opposing careers from ruining what we have before we even begin? Or will we let them destroy everything good that’s between us?---------------------------------------------Mister Dimples is written within the Mister Moneybags world by Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward where you'll get to see many familiar faces again.",
