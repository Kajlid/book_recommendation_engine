  "description": "The Kingdoms Fall series tells the story of the First World War from the perspective of two British officers recruited into the fledgling Secret Intelligence Service. As David Gresham and James Wilkins pursue their missions for Great Britain, they see (and some times cause) events that shake the very foundations of Europe. In the first novel of a planned three part series entitled “Kingdoms Fall: The Laxenburg Message”, David Gresham, a British Lieutenant from Manchester who has fought on the front lines at Ypres, and Captain James Wilkins, youngest son of Lord Bartlett and fresh from Eton College, are recruited into the Intelligence Service following the British landing on the Gallipoli peninsula in 1915. They are sent to Greece to prepare for the British landing at Salonika, rescue Serbian King Peter, and plot to destroy the Hapsburg dynasty in Austria-Hungary.
