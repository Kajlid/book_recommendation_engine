  "title": "Torched: Afterburn",
  "description": "This is a full-length novel (no cliffhanger) in dual POV. It is a sequel to \"Torched\" and meant to be read in sequence. Warning: Contains crude language, explicit sex, and gory violence. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Ah, \"happily ever after\"... The chapter in a story where everything is wrapped up in a pretty little package.  Unfortunately, life doesn't always work that way. Sometimes, what seems like the end is only a beginning.  Torch and I had overcome a mountain of obstacles by clinging to our love for each other, and somehow we'd made it down the aisle in one piece. But real tests of perseverance often don't come until the dust settles, when it's time to ditch the glow and get back to everyday minutiae. And when every day is spent living in the shadows of the Iron Serpents MC, things are bound to get dicey in no time.  Outlaws don't believe in fairy tales, only themselves; the lucky ones also have each other. By taking Torch's promises of honesty at face value and marrying into the club, I'd been given the gift of unbreakable bonds. But promises are easier said than kept, especially when up against an onslaught of relentless storms.  This isn't just a continuing story about love. It's a tale of loyalty, strength, sacrifice, and struggle. In other words, it's about family.",
