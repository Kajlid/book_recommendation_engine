  "title": "Miranda's Tower",
  "description": "It is an old building in the country, part castle, part palace, and poorly kept up by her venal uncle and brittle, self-indulgent aunt. Miranda has no desire to visit, but little choice in the matter. When she is shown to her high, tower room, she is at first delighted, thinking her relatives have tucked her away far from them to spend the necessary time until she left. But she soon discovers her tower room will be her home for much longer than she had expected. Her scandalized, social climbing family have had enough of her impudence, enough of her embarrassing notoriety.Robbed of all her possessions, locked away naked, Miranda will face her family's best efforts at behavioral modification. And the tall, stern, powerfully built Albert will be her teacher in obedience, discipline and submission. At first outraged and rebellious, boredom, loneliness and hunger work their way on her. Bit by bit, Miranda finds herself giving in, consenting to their degrading demands, humiliating herself for a few choice morsels of food, surrendering her privacy, her pride, her body for books and televisions, and giving her unquestioned obedience to her stern, patient trainer. And by the time her cousins join Albert in her her stricter discipline sessions, she has been seized by an irresistible sense of masochism and submission. With desire thriving on pain, she is desperately aroused by what should outrage her. Overcome by her own inner heat and lust, she prostrates herself before them and submits to their every perverse whim. Her aunt and uncle will be most pleased with their new, obedient body servant -- for a time.",
