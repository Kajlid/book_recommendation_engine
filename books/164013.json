  "title": "The Genesis Question: Scientific Advances and the Accuracy of Genesis",
  "description": "“Everyone knows the Bible teaches scientific nonsense” is a commonly held misconception. When pushed for examples, many point to the early chapters of Genesis as proof—creation, the Flood, 900-year life spans. And science has largely been silent on the subject—until now. Examining recent, leading-edge scientific discoveries, Dr. Hugh Ross explores how these very chapters hold some of the strongest scientific evidence for the Bible’s supernatural accuracy. Like never before, The Genesis Question integrates the accuracy of both science and the Bible—without compromise—giving skeptics and believers common ground and opportunity for dialogue.",
