Ellie travels with her younger brother to the wilds of the Klondike gold rush to save the family farm. She's prepared for hardship on the trail, but not for the sparkling blue eyes of Duke Masterson, a charming saloonkeeper. And Duke is surprised to find that Ellie and her apple pies are more valuable to him than all the gold nuggets in Skagway, Alaska. Now if he could only overcome Ellieâ€™s fear of losing her newly-found independence and win her heart.
