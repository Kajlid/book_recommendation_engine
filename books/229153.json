  "description": "BOOM! Studios and DC Comics team up to bring together Lumberjanes and Gotham Academy for the ultimate friendship-fueled crossover event. Written by Chynna Clugston Flores (Blue Monday), and illustrated by Rosemary Valero-O’Connell (Laura Dean Keeps Breaking Up with Me) Jenna Ayoub, Maddi Gonzalez, and Kelly & Nichole Matthews (Toil and Trouble), this is a run-for-your-life-from-skeletal-monsters mystery that leads to lifelong friendship! When a teacher at Gotham Academy goes missing, it’s up to Olive, Maps, Colton, Pom, and Kyle to figure out what is happening and how to get her back. With only an outdated birthday invitation as the clue, they find themselves in the middle of the woods with no idea of where to start. With the sudden appearance of the Lumberjanes—April, Jo, Mal, Molly, Ripley and Jen—who are on the hunt for their missing Camp Director, all clues point to an abandoned cabin with more secrets than cobwebs. \"...a match made in comic heaven, as everything from the book’s creative team to its deliberately structured plot strikes early gold.\" - IGN",
