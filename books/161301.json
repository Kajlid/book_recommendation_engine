  "description": "Curiouser and curiouser . . . Hard times force sixteen-year-old Olli and her brother to move to sleepy Horizon Creek, and Olli’s biggest worry is that she, once again, won’t fit in. And she doesn’t. But when a mysterious shadow lurking in the woods draws out a strange power within her, she fears she’s losing her mind. Add to that tall, dark, and smoldering Brend, who can only speak in riddles, and she’s sure she's gone completely bonkers. Yet day by day, Olli pieces together the truth. And what she finds changes everything she thought she knew--about the town, her family, even her own reflection. So when the shadow emerges, taking one life and threatening to take more, all Olli needs to do to save the mad boy she loves is to step through the looking glass and become the girl she sees on the other side . . . And believe in a few impossible things.",
