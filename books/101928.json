She was about to marry Henry Daniels, the man of her dreams -- or so she thought.

Through all of this, he must face his demons, and Elaina must decide whether she can accept who he is. Henry is determined to fight to the very end to make their sexy, mercurial relationship work no matter what staggers in their path.Along with their ragtag band of survivors, they must travel south to face Henry’s fears.
