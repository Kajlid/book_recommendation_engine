  "description": "Who am I? I’m every woman’s worst nightmare. A taker of lives. You can call me Lucifer.  Luc “Lucifer” Bontrager is a nomad in Lucifer’s Legion Motorcycle Club. Traveling chapter to chapter, he brings in big money kidnapping women, training them and selling them over the border. He’s heartless, brutal and all business.  And then he meets his match.  Lilith. Every man’s worst nightmare. A taker of lives. A sociopath on the run.  Inked up with satanic symbols and verses, she’s fearless and completely insane. Luc can’t train her, he sure as hell can’t ship her over the border to the cartel boss waiting for her, and—for the first time in his life—he can’t bring himself to put a bullet in her head either.  She’s his worst regret.  Her words and cold, calculating eyes haunt him. She’s the devil on his shoulder, reminding him of all his sins. He should’ve killed her when he had the chance, because when the unthinkable happens and Luc falls for the young, innocent girl he’s training, Lilith seeks her revenge, targeting the only girl he’s ever wanted to keep as his own.",
