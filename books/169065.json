But when that skeleton suddenly becomes a hot, romantic, and business savvy vampire named Varo…sometimes things can get better. That is…until his infamous older brother shows up, and their centuries old sibling rivalry threatens her chance at true love. Can their love survive her conniving ex-fiancé, his vengeful brother, and the Curse of the Seven 70s?",
