  "title": "How Marbles Roll",
  "description": "If you've ever played with a marble, you know how beautiful they can be. This tale is told from a new perspective and one you would least likely suspect. Follow this story of adventure and friendship, of caring and giving. This story also includes a brief description of the setup and rules to play marbles. How Marbles Roll is targeted at younger children who are early readers. The sentences are relatively easy with photographs to help tell the story. This short picture book would be most suitable for children up through fourth grade, but the game itself applies to all ages that are able to use marbles, although this may depend upon your own child's progress. The story was developed to learn about friendship, giving, sharing, and acceptance by traveling through the virtual eyes of a marble.",
