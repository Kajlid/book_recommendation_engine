  "description": "I don't need a rockstar to be my knight in shining armour. Especially one who already had his chance.\nMy first love broke my heart when I was sixteen. James Tyler was everything I’d ever wanted, until he up and left. That’s what I get for falling for a musician whose plans for world domination never included me.My second love, photography, would never let me down.Or so I thought until I discovered that making it as a music photographer is a lot harder in reality than in my dreams – and my savings account can only take a beating for so long until I have to swallow my pride and start grovelling to my arrogant, estranged father.And if things couldn’t get any worse, James is back…Arriving with a job offer I shouldn’t refuse, and a confession big enough to send shockwaves through the past, he throws my entire life upside down. But I don’t care how successful his band is or that he insists I’m the one for him. If he thinks I forgive him tossing me aside ten years ago, he’s got another thing coming.To anyone else, James is a second chance wrapped in muscle and black ink. Too bad for him, I’ve never believed in second chances.Winning Nia is a full length steamy rock star romance. It is the second book following the Rhiannon men and the second in the True Platinum Series. Can be read as a standalone. If you love obsessed rock stars, determined independent heroines who want to solve their own problems and childhood sweethearts getting a second chance, then Winning Nia is for you. Get it now!",
