  "title": "Love in the Time of a Highland Laird",
  "description": "They say accidents happen for a reason... \nWhen she was accidentally pushed into a wormhole, Allorah ‘Al’ Maines never imagined she’d be thrown back in time, land at the feet of a gorgeous Highlander… and be taken as his prisoner. Al is awestruck by the savage Scot who chained her up in his dungeon. But once she emerges from her cell, she finds herself even more captivated by the roguish Highlander he’s transformed into. An undeniably enticing manifestation of all her secret fantasies. Ones she’s tempted to explore. However, regardless of what the fairytales say, Al knows passion fades and lust dies. Keeping her heart intact and planning for a future on her own is the only way their story can end. If all women in the twenty-first century were as stubborn as Allorah Maines, Keir MacCoinnach wept for the future of man. Nay, he despaired for them. She’s utterly obtuse, difficult, aggravating… and quite possibly the most fascinating woman he’d ever met. Al offers him an intriguing peek into the future. Keeping her by his side is the key to the knowledge of the ages. Keeping her in his bed and in his heart is the key to a life of love and joy. But can Keir convince Al to share that life with him before she walks away forever? Can he prove to her the passion they discover between the sheets can surpass anything she’d ever found between the pages of her favorite novels?",
