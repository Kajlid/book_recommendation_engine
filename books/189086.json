  "title": "Everybody Cheats",
  "description": "Love is beautiful. Love is incredible. And we will never experience true love if we continue to believe that our worth and value is dependent on our relationship status. It's OK to be single. We have time. But being alone is not easy for most people, and that's why this book is here. We cheat because we're unhappy. We cheat because we're unsatisfied. We cheat because we settle and we settle because society tells us it's better to settle than to be single.But true love does exist. And we can find that perfect person for us. All we need to do is read this book to examine the terrible decisions we make when it comes to love. It's only after we understand our decisions that we are able to change our behavior and our outlook. In turn, we can have that fairy tale ending we all desire, but only if we learn to love ourselves first.",
