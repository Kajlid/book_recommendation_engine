  "description": "The only compendium of 62 hilarious, captioned \"phallographics\" created exclusively for the movie Superbad.Everyone who has seen the blockbuster comedy hit Superbad will recall the outrageous phallic foolery featured in the movie, inspired by the character Seth's obsessive drawings from the third grade.When Evan Goldberg, Superbad's co-writer/producer, called his older brother, David, about a job on the movie, David had no idea that he would tap into the unexplored world of phallographics. The brilliant results are these 62, full-color, laugh-out-loud drawings that will surely tickle your funny bone. Some of these illustrations were featured in the end credits of the movie, and audience members are still buzzing about them! Many of these clever depictions are exclusive to this novelty art volume.",
