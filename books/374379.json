  "title": "Help For Troubled Destinies",
  "description": "Help for troubled Destinies begins with examination of what God did for us in the beginning, the foundation of empowerment laid for us to excel, where we missed it and God's follow-up rescue plan. This background approach clearly shows us that we were empowered to succeed from the beginning as revealed in man's encounter with God in Genesis Chapter 1:28. There God blessed man and He gave him five faith commands to be fruitful and multiply, replenish the earth, subdue it and have dominion. From this perspective the book goes on to express the fact that because man had been positioned to excel he ought not to experience troubled destinies. Several of these were examined for the readers' attention and solutions to them also proffered. It concludes with testimonies that God is beautiful for every situation.",
