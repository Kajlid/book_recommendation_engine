  "title": "The A-Zs of Worldbuilding: Building a Fictional World From Scratch",
  "description": "Worldbuilding is the ultimate act of creation for speculative fiction writers, but how exactly do you worldbuild? You ask 'what if' and use each answer as a springboard to more questions and answers about your fictional world.In The A-Zs of Worldbuilding, that ‘what if’ process is broken down into 26 themed chapters, covering topics ranging from architecture to zoology. Each chapter includes a corresponding set of guided exercises to help you find the ‘what if’ questions relevant to your story’s world.Fair warning, though: worldbuilding is addictive. Once you get started, you might never put your pen down again.",
