  "description": "H. P. Lovecraft ranks amongst the most important speculative fiction writers of all time. First published in the Summer 1924 edition of Weird Tales, 'Imprisoned with the Pharoahs' fictionalizes an allegedly true story, told to Lovecraft by escape artist Harry Houdini. Many of the finest stories of magic and fantasy, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. We are republishing these classic works in affordable, high quality, modern editions, using the original text and artwork.",
