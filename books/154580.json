  "description": "SINS OF THE FATHER…Jack Coltrane grew up with his father’s red-haired tomboy ward Meredith Fairfax chasing after him, always begging to tag along in his adventures during the years they resided at Coltrane House. Jack was variously annoyed, flattered, and as the years passed and childhood faded, both he and Merry sensed a slow change in their relationship.Friendship, blossoming into love. Love for each other, and a combined love for Coltrane House, fast falling into disrepair by his neglectful father. But one day the estate would be his, and Jack and Merry would make it beautiful again, raise their children there, and live happily ever after.Theirs was the perfect dream, until Jack’s father took him aside to tell him something that sent his son fleeing from Coltrane House, away from Merry, perhaps never to return. Ah, love… why is it never easy?Oh… and then there’s Jack’s quite singular friend from America, and possibly a pair of matchmaking ghosts. Ghosts? Well, certainly – why not? Everyone loves a happy ending!",
