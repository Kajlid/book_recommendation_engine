But Cross was harboring a terrible secret - one that helped ruin the life of an innocent girl and almost ended his own.Finally out of the hospital, Cross is flailing, scarred in both body and mind and stifled by the weight of the secret he still keeps. The only way to absolution lies in a Mexican convent, and going there could cost him everything.If there's anyone who knows what it's like to screw up big time, it's Meredith Kinsey. Just a few years ago, Merri was an ordinary girl with a job at her college newspaper and white picket fence kind of dreams. Now she's holed up in a Mexican convent, hiding from a drug lord who thinks he owns her.What happens when the only way out of hell is with the son of the man who put you there? They say love conquers all, but does it really?",
