  "description": "Liz Jones moved to Scarlet Cove six months ago for a fresh start away from her detective life in the city. In that time, she has opened an arts and crafts shop, adopted a dog, made friends, and even found a farmer boyfriend. When she takes on her latest project of forming an art group, she does not expect it to land her back in the middle of another murder investigation, but that is precisely what happens. With the gallery's tyrannical owner, Katelyn Monroe, on holiday, Liz's best friend, Nancy Turtle, suggests they host an exhibition of their work in her absence. When Katelyn returns from her holiday early and shuts down the exhibit, it immediately results in her murder. With all of Liz's newly formed group, including Nancy, in the frame, she feels obligated to uncover the truth behind the killing. Between fake paintings, secret love affairs, and bitter rivalries, it seems every one of Liz's art students has a motive for killing Katelyn, but can the retired detective put her retirement on hold long enough to uncover the truth before a second slaying?",
