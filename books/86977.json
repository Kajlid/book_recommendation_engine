  "description": "Can a man from the 21st century survive in 1847? Murdered on his birthday, August Myles finds crossing over is nothing like heâ€™d ever heard, read, or imagined, and learns he has not earned a ticket to Paradise. In a grand experiment, the members of the Divine Council gave August another chance. Or did they? With all the limitations of a mortal, he is sent back in time with an impossible mission - an adventure filled with triumph and tragedy, courage and fear, sex and violence, happiness and heartbreak - a grueling journey on the Oregon Trail. And with all the needs and passions of a mortal, August must also battle the advances of two gorgeous women during long months and close encounters. One woman just wants to seduce him. Another falls in love. But for August Myles, carnal knowledge is forbidden. Is there no justice?",
