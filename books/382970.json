  "title": "Six Feet Under or Up in Smoke: The Aussie Way of Death",
  "description": "From bush undertakers to ladies in white, this is a fascinating, yarn-filled and sometimes poignant look at how Australians experience the \"last great event.\"There is no profession more indispensable to the community than that of the funeral director. It is a calling that demands our respect and confidence. While most of us will do anything to avoid meeting our local undertaker, we sure want to know what happens when our time has come. Jim Eames lifts the lid on just what goes on behind the doors of the funeral parlor, at the graveside, when the smoke goes up, and everything in between.",
