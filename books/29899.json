  "description": "Itâ€™s 1904 and 'Meet me in St. Louis.' is the watchword of the day. William Deming is excited to be covering the event for his newspaper, the Utah Gazette. Arriving in St. Louis, he takes a room at a boarding house near to the big event. That's where he meets Misha Rumiantseva, the nephew of the owner. William finds himself instantly drawn to the beautiful and very pale young man, but he has to be cautious--gay men cannot be forward about their attractions, society is not quite so open-minded about such things.A spark has been struck between them which cannot be denied, and they meet in secret at the World's Fair, losing themselves among the many fairgoers. But William begins to learn that all is not as it appears to be with Misha. He cannot find him during the day, and he can't get answers from his aunt as to his whereabouts. William tries to control his jealousy when he learns that there have been others before him. But things get out of hand when one of Misha's former lovers is found dead at the World's Fair--and Misha is accused of his murder!Can William prove the innocence of his lover? Or will this be an affair which lasts only as long as the World's Fair itself? Is love strong enough to conquer prejudice and the jealousy of a lover spurned? Will William be sorry that he ever came to the World's Fair?CONTENT ADVISORY: This title includes scenes of rape/near rape.",
