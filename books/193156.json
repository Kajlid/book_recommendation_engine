  "description": "Harper Hall finally has everything she ever wanted. Thriving paranormal PI business? Check. At least some control over her psychic ability? Check. Smokin’ hot ex-slayer fiancé? Check.  But Harper’s plans to grab the first ordained Elvis impersonator she can find and marry Noah Riddick on the Vegas strip—sans drama—are shot to hell when her old business partner shows up and makes her an offer she can’t refuse. And if she tries? Well, let’s just say she might not live long enough to regret it.  In the course of their elopement from hell, Harper and Riddick find themselves entangled with the paranormal mafia, dodging creepy vampire ménage action, and participating in the supernatural equivalent of Fight Club. First rule of paranormal Fight Club? There are no rules. And, oh yeah, don’t die.  Seriously, what’s a girl gotta do to get her happily ever after?  Semi-Human can be read as a standalone, but works best if read as part of the Harper Hall Investigations series (Book 1: Semi-Charmed). This book is intended for mature audiences. This book is not intended for anyone who doesn’t enjoy smart, snarky heroines and dark, brooding heroes, and who doesn’t appreciate a plethora of nerdy pop culture references. For the rest of you: happy reading!",
