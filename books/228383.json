  "description": "Micah Swaeler doesn't fit in. Anywhere. His family hardly speaks to him, his friends come and go, and he can't quite figure out how to love somebody. Or how to be loved.Until he does. And when he does, he learns how much support he's had all along.Micah's story is told in a series of short stories that take place from the time he is four until the time he is thirty-four. While the stories go back and forth through time, each one reveals something more about things that have happened to him, things that he's done, things that he's told himself. Each story explores identity through family, athletics, friendship, sexuality, of one man's transition from being a victim to being a survivor.Eventual HEA for a slightly broken, definitely imperfect guy who is kind of lovely. Bisexual love and sex stories interspersed throughout.Available here: http://archiveofourown.org/users/Ergo...Trigger warnings: child physical and sexual abuse.",
