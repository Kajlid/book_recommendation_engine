  "title": "A Woman Who",
  "description": "A Woman Who is a delightful collection of clever, almost surreal drawings revealing women feeling all the strange and specific things they feel - as conjured up by artist/writer/filmmaker Rebecca Miller, who draws each image with her eyes closed. Bored, sexy, angry, amused, ambivalent, overwhelmed, curious, so serene they can barely speak - these women come straight from the unconscious, and you'll recognize them at once. A woman who has so many things to do that she can't bring herself to do any of them. A woman who is flying for the first time. A woman who was okay a second ago. A woman who would like some attention but isn't sure how to get it in a subtle way. A woman who is worried she's so happy she'll never have another idea. They're all here- in the perfect gift book for all the women in your life.",
