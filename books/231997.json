  "description": "Rock Pierce is not the kind of man you’d want to cross. So when the woman he loved chose her family over him, he had only one goal in life, to make her pay. Ashley Stahl was a shy insecure young woman until she met the dominant self-assured Rock who teased her out of her shell and showed her a love she never knew could exist for someone like her. But then her wealthy father found out about the affair and through threats and other underhanded tactics, forced her to choose. To save the man she loves, she had to make a decision that will break both their hearts. Now five years later he’s back and set on revenge. Will he give her a chance to make things right? Or will his need for vengeance destroy them both and diminish all that they once shared?",
