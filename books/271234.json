  "title": "The Story of a Soul: A New Translation",
  "description": "This popular translation of The Story of a Soul includes every word of the original text, retaining the charm of the landmark autobiography of St. Thérèse of Lisieux. Robert Edmonson’s accessible and engaging translation captures the vibrant spirit of the young woman who desired nothing more than to be a humble flower that would gladden God’s eyes. St. Thérèse's autobiography was first published soon after her death in 1897 at the age of twenty-four. Combining delightful descriptions of family and community life with a sense of humor and intense devotion to God, it was an instant bestseller. But earlier editions often excluded passages, and refined her use of the French dialect often spoken by peasants. This edition of The Story of a Soul · A complete and unabridged work, longer than most other editions available today · A beautifully designed interior, with a larger font size for easier reading · A fresh, lively, non-technical translation that will appeal to a wide readershipThe most popular saint of the first half of the twentieth century, St. Thérèse of Lisieux—\"the Little Flower\"—was declared a Doctor of the Church in 1997 by Pope Saint John Paul II. Her simple approach to spirituality, which in essence meant doing even the most mundane tasks with great love and joy, has inspired millions of people all over the world.",
