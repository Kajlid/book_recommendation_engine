  "description": "The Cerebrals are a tribe so elusive that most believe them to be imaginary. Like vampires, they live on an isolated Scottish island and drain languages from peopleâ€™s minds. The few who have encountered them fear losing their speech and vow never to mention them again. No one on the island can even imagine the sinister plan behind the thefts. With powers so vast, these thieves have hidden their secrets from the world for centuries. Until now!  When sixteen-year-old Daniel moves with his sick mother to the island, he discovers the Cerebrals are somehow connected to her loss of speech. Being a speaker of English and Irish Gaelic, Daniel is now under constant threat of being attacked and losing a language himself.  With his friends, Connor and Jenny, Daniel is poised to unravel the secrets the tribe has been keeping from the world. The shocking scheme is unveiled when Daniel sneaks into the Cerebral village. Now, he must not only save his mother but also stop the tribe from systematically destroying all languages in the world.",
