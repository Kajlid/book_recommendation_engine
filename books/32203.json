  "description": "Etienne never thought getting his pocket picked could lead to a first date. He knows the second he catches punk boy Brady's eye that the guy is pure trouble, but Et can't resist his wicked sense of humor, pretty face, cold hands -- and the \"piss off\" swagger when Brady's on stage with his band doesn't hurt, either.From Rimbaud to Buzzcocks to Malbec to handcuffs, they introduce each other to their favorite pleasures, and the chemistry is unstoppable. But Brady disappears in the night, won't give Etienne a phone number, doesn't talk about his past; Etienne's never known someone so hungry for affection but with so many trust issues. Et would give all he has, but he has the feeling Brady needs saving from something before he can take what Et offers.Then, the \"something\" shows up: Brady's dangerous family, all of them more than human -- including Brady, who has the ability to supercool matter with the slightest touch. Throw in the family talent for criminal activity, and it's an explosion waiting to happen.Et wants to help him escape his past, but if Brady keeps disappearing, he may not get the chance.",
