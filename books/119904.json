  "description": "Looking away, I asked as nonchalantly as my rapidly beating heart would allow, \"So you're the kind of guy that believes in fairy-tales.\" \"I am. And you're the kind of girl that believes in the reality of here and now.\" \"When you're pregnant and living with your brother and his wife, reality seems like a safer place to stay.\" Suzanne Quincy was raised by an abusive mother and an apathetic father. In an effort to escape her upbringing, Suzie chooses the numbing effects of drugs and alcohol--and the accompanying lifestyle. She reaches a crossroad when she discovers she is pregnant. Will she listen to the world and abort the baby, or will she listen to the conscience she has ignored her entire life? The choice she makes sends her down a path of self-discovery. This story is about choices and consequences, laughter and tears, and finding the truth in the midst of it all.",
