  "title": "Bad World",
  "description": "Warren Ellis and Jacen Burrows, the creative team of the critically acclaimed Dark Blue, bring to life this sick decent into the foulest reaches of the world we live in. A world of beauty in the eyes of many, but to bleeding-edge writer Warren Ellis, a world filled with evil, sin, decay, and filth. A Bad World indeed. Told in a unique format of text and illustrations, Ellis explores the far edges of humanity, the people who are hanging to reality by the thinnest of threads, and those that are simply off their rockers. This complete collection features a gallery of the stunning artwork of Jacen Burrows and a new introduction by Warren Ellis.",
