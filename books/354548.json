  "title": "Murder on Lexington Avenue",
  "description": "When a wealthy businessman is murdered, Detective Sergeant Frank Malloy is assigned to investigate, even though the crime is out of his jurisdiction. The reason he soon realizes, is that the man has a deaf daughter—and it is well known that Malloy’s own son attends the New York Institution for the Deaf and Dumb. The victim sent the girl to a rival institution, with different views on the deaf, and was an influential supporter of their program. So it is possible that the killer might be affiliated with his son’s school. Or it might be a family member. Or a business rival. It’s a difficult case—but one that Malloy is sure will not involve Sarah Brandt. Until the new widow goes into labor while he is interviewing her, and refuses to send for her own physician... So Malloy calls upon Sarah. Finding herself in an unfamiliar world, where those who can hear refuse to listen to those who cannot, she must determine who is right and who is innocent before she and Malloy can ever hope to find the killer.",
