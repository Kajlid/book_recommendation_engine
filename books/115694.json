  "description": "Recently widowed Robin Light runs Noah's Ark, a Syracuse pet shop specializing in puppies and parakeets, bunnies and boas. Robin can't resist rescuing a stray kitten - or finding the vicious killer who set her up to take the rap... for murder. The package looked innocent enough... until it was opened and the rare, saw-backed viper attacked. By the time Robin got her co-worker to the hospital, he was dead, the cops had unearthed a small fortune in her shop's heating vent, and she'd been fingered as the prime suspect in a particularly nasty murder case. Now, as Robin struggles to clear her name and to keep Noah's Ark afloat, she finds herself following a trail strewn with corpses... straying far from her pampered pets and into a den of venomous secrets where someone stalks her with the cold-blooded skill of a cobra... someone coiled and ready to strike.",
