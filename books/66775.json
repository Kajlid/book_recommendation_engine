  "description": "[Menage Erotic Menage a Trois Romance, M/F/M, HEA] Everything Red Armstrong knew about relationships is called into question when he stumbles upon his roommate Fredrik Nieminen and his girlfriend Liz Langer going at it hot and heavy and Liz invites him to join them. Struggling with recovering from a knee injury, the young defenseman doesn't know what to make of his attraction to Liz—after all, she's his teammate's woman, right? As an older player, Fredrik's been around the rink a time or ten, and he knows he has an awesome thing going with Liz. He envisions a future with her, but isn't sure how their interludes with Red fit into the long-term picture. Liz thinks Fredrik's her forever-guy, but her sudden attraction to Red is causing doubts. The more they play together in the bedroom, the more their outside lives—and emotions—become entangled. When the unthinkable happens, all three must take a hard look at what they want and make some surprising decisions in the process. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
