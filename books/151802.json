  "description": "The life of a Providential Lady is not all its cracked up to be. At nineteen, Vishnue Gaylinn-Brinhouff's life of Providence is turned upside down when she discovers a scandal about her lineage that could destroy not only her Manor, but the government of her world as well. In order to keep the peace on Renou, Lady Vishnue must conceal her secret from everyone, including her own father, and the man she loves. But just when she is about to come to grips with the devastating news, the first attempted murder, in the history of Renou, occurs on her own Manor, spiraling her into further chaos. Not only does the attempt take place on the grounds of Brinhouff Manor, less than a week before her joining ceremony, but the victim happens to be her intended, Lord Iesslian. Accused of the act by her soon-to-be mother-in-law, Lady Reinna, Vishnue is forced to flee from her planet in order to spare the lives of those she loves. What she doesn't know, is that Lady Reinna has plans, and they include more worlds than her home planet of Renou.",
