  "title": "And Then Run",
  "description": "And Then Run follows the life of anti-hero Jerome Esterson. Jerome has everything - looks, money, women, friends. And yet he seems to be fighting a losing battle with reality.The novel takes place in two time periods. One, when Jerome is a 25 year old maverick entrepreneur, with limitless passion and rockstar charisma. In the second time period, Jerome is a blunted 39 year old lobbyist, who also happens to be a blunted serial killer.Parental Advisory: This is an X rated novel, with heavily objectionable content, including sex, violence, a psychopathic lack of morality. Jerome combines the hardened, relentless predation of Humbert in Lolita with the brute violence of Dexter. This books is offensive in many ways, and not for everyone.",
