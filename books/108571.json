  "description": "A MAN HATED BY HIS WIFE, HIS CITY... AND HIS KILLERIn Margaret Frazer's latest medieval mystery, the \"pious and perceptive\" ( New York Times ) Dame Frevisse accompanies her prioress on a visit of mercy to a nunnery. St. Mary's nunnery is a place of prayer and healing for women - so it is surprising to see a man sprawled out in the cloister garden. Dead. Less surprising, to Dame Frevisse, was the identity of the victim: Master Montfort was not particularly liked by anyone in the town of Goring. Even his own wife and clerk despised him. And as royal escheator he was trying to settle a heated dispute between a wealthy woman and her supposed nephew.Now Dame Frevisse must step in and untangle the fortunes and felonies in a rivalry of wealth, family, and politics. But the true challenge will be putting aside her own feelings and serving justice for the murder of an unjust man...\"The devout yet human Dame Frevisse is back... another well-wrought tale of intrigue and murder. History aficionados will delight and fans will rejoice that the devout yet human Dame Frevisse is back....\" - Publishers Weekly\"A wonderful series. Frevisse, with her common sense and humor and tang of salt, is one of my favorite sleuths.\" (Sharon Kay Penman, author of The Queen's Man )\"Meticulous detail that speaks of trustworthy scholarship and a sympathetic imagination.\" ( The New York Times )\"Full of the richness of the fifteenth century...Margaret Frazer's tales are charmingly and intelligently contrived.\" ( Minneapolis Star Tribune )",
