  "description": "I've made a lifetime of bad decisions, but I always land on my feet. Every damn time. My father says that's the problem. But he says a lot of things about me, none of them very nice.I finally have a chance to show him, to show everyone, I'm more than a pretty boy who parties hard with his parents’ money. My business partner Enzo and I have developed a product that will change the world.There's just one snag. Ada Flemming, the FDA official who controls our company’s fate, is the most compelling woman I’ve ever met. Even though it could cost me everything—my friendship with Enzo, my business, and my one chance at redemption—I can’t seem to stay away from her. Pursuing Ada might be the biggest screwup of all—the only bad decision I don’t bounce back from.But it’s too late to start making safe decisions now.",
