  "description": "From USA Today Bestselling Author Ella Fox  As far back as the records of Jacob Channing's family go, no one has ever gotten divorced. That's because each and every Channing was lucky enough to find their soulmate-- and most of them found their partner early.  At thirty-two, Jake's just about given up on the whole thing- until the night he goes back to work to grab a file and finds the girl of his dreams shaking her hips while cleaning his office.  Amber never believed in soul mates until she met a certain tall, dark and handsome CEO. This pancake-loving cleaner is about to find out that happily ever after arrives when you least expect it.  This steamy insta-love novella will melt your heart and your reading device!  Erotic Intentions are short, sweet, insta-love books that are meant to steam up your reading device and melt your heart. No drama, no angstâ€” just lust, love and some smoking hot love. * * * Please note that Amber's Allure was previously published under the pen name Evie Harrison in 2017.",
