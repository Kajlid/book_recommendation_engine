  "description": "I’M NOT SUPPOSED TO LOVE HER, BUT I DO… For years, I’ve watched Hannah Chase grow from an awkward teenager into a beautiful young woman. But then she took off for college and never looked back—until three years later when she shows up on my doorstep, heartbroken and alone. Welcoming her home is my first mistake. My second is allowing myself to get too close to her. But I do.  HE’S THE ONE MAN I CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON… When my mother kicked me out, Ryan Ebersole came to my rescue, and he loved me like his own daughter. I’ve always seen him as more, though. Much more. Too bad he refuses to even acknowledge our undeniable attraction. But when I’m ready to give up, he gives in, and I’m finally getting everything I’ve ever wanted.  ONE BAD DECISION RUINS EVERYTHING… When my daughter walks in on me buried balls deep in Hannah, she freaks out and gives me an ultimatum: stop screwing her best friend, or she’s out of my life forever. Unable to lose my only child, I make one bad decision after another. Now, I’m desperate to make things right with both of them. If it’s not too late.",
