  "description": "All humans have a complex colony of microorganisms living in our guts. This microbiome influences our health, our thinking and our moods. If you can change someone's microbiome, can you control their thoughts? That's the plan of Thom Elliott, a power-mad tech titan who wants to create a new world order where humanity is ruled by Sekai, the most powerful artificial intelligence ever created. His weapon is Glorp, a nutritional energy drink beloved by the tech community that secretly includes genetically engineered microbes to transform human gut flora.Finder is a brilliant detective who hates people. He might agree with Elliott that an AI could do a better job of running the world. But when Finder's own microbiome is contaminated with Elliott's brew, it's up to him and his chimera sidekicks to stop him.",
