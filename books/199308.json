  "description": "\"When you save a girl, you save generations. I see this as the one bright shinning hope in a world that is marching toward moral self-destruction,\" said President Gordon B. Hinckley. Heavenly Father treasures His daughters, and through His prophet has encouraged them to be a force for good in the world. President Hinckley's words of encouragement and counsel to women are paired with beautiful visual images in this lovely gift book. A perfect companion volume to Sister Hinckley's Small and Simple Things, the book is a thoughtful reminder to women everywhere of how much God loves and needs them.",
