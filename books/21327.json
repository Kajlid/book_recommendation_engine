  "description": "Like mother, like daughter? Or will Jenna Ranger give up on love and romance? Book four of this humorous romantic comedy series continues this popular contemporary romance saga and explores it through a younger generation.If asked, 30 yr old Seth Carter could not have recounted a single moment since heâ€™d met her that he had not loved the stubborn, self-centered, and admittedly spoiled 28 yr old Jenna Ranger.Jenna admits to having her fair share of faults, but Seth is far from being the perfect man. No rational woman could want to invest in a relationship with someone who so obviously loves his cell phone more than he does her. How can she let herself love someone who chooses his work over everything else?",
