  "title": "Clean Energy Common Sense: An American Call to Action on Global Climate Change",
  "description": "In her first book, Clean Energy Common Sense, NRDC President Frances Beinecke issues a plainspoken, heartfelt call to action on global warming. As Robert Redford writes in his forward, this little book -- for believers, skeptics and everyone in between -- just might help change the world. This is, in many ways, a new kind of book, written in the moment, using very current information, and produced on a sharply accelerated schedule so it can become part of the conversation when it matters most - as the Senate takes up climate change legislation and the world looks to Copenhagen for the UN climate change summit in December. This little book documents the problem, sets forth solutions, and challenges each of us to do our part of embrace a clean and sustainable energy future, today and in the years ahead. Doing so, Beinecke convincingly argues, will help put Americans back to work, reduce our reliance on foreign oil and create a healthier planet, for ourselves and for our children.",
