In Believe in You , the six Cimorelli sisters share their experiences and accumulated wisdom on everything from dating and friendship to faith and family. As Christina, Katherine, Lisa, Amy, Lauren and Dani tour the world with their music and read their social media messages, they meet and hear from thousands of girls sharing their hearts. Now, in Believe in You , the sisters are connecting with young women who have the same concerns. The teen years may be difficult, confusing, awkward and scary, but it's a lot better when you have someone to go to for advice and some positive, encouraging words. Reading Believe in You is like receiving a big hug and the assurance that you never, ever have to try to change who you genuinely are to be like someone else. You are amazing and unique!",
