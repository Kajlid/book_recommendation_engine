  "title": "Sunbathing in the Rain",
  "description": "This title tackles the subject of depression, an illness that seems to be the defining malaise of the early 21st century. The overall structure of the book moves from dark to light, telling the story of the author's recovery, its different strands allow a variety of tones and subjects to be explored, from the profound to the frivolous. Part memoir - drawing on her own experiences, both adverse and encouraging, as a depressive and an alcoholic - and part guide or companion, the author unpacks her dark memories, and re-embarks on a journey that nearly killed her first time round. She survives, again, and shows how others might, too.",
