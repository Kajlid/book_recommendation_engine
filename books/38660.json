  "title": "The Sunne in Splendour",
  "description": "He was the last-born son of the Duke of York. He would become the last Plantagenet King of England. He is perhaps the most controversial monarch ever to rule that island nation. Certainly the most vilified. He was Richard III.The Sunne in Splendour reverberates with the sound of truth as it re-creates the life of this most complex and compelling man. Five hundred years after he died, Richard is still a figure of controversy and his story still fascinates and casts a spell. Filled with the sights and sounds of battle, the customs and lore of daily life, the rigors and risks of Court politics, the passions and infidelities of the high born, and the touching concerns of very real men and women, The Sunne in Splendour brings to life this gifted man whose greatest sin, perhaps, was that he held principles too firm for the times he lived in and loved too deeply to survive love's loss.Combining the accuracy of the historian, the logic of the lawyer, and the insight of the novelist--all of which she is--Sharon Kay Penman resolves the mystery of Richard III and provides absorbing drama.",
