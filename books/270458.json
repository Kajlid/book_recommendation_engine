  "description": "Wolves? Check. Magically floating books? Check. A bloody mystery years in the making? …uh, check? All Addie ever wanted was a normal life—to graduate college and get a good job so she can support her fortune-telling, tarot-card-reading mother. Her plans are shot to heck when she finds out her mother has been keeping a very important secret from her.As in, Addie is a shifter. A wolf shifter. And not only that, but she’s special because female shifters are rare, prized in most packs. Unique because shifters as a whole are a dying race, and it’s up to females like her to further their kind.Thrown into pack life, Addie knows she’ll be able to walk away from it anytime she wants, which is what her mother did twenty years ago, but after meeting the pack—more specifically the wolves she’s supposed to mate with—things get complicated. Maze, Dylan, and Landon. Three very different shifters, yet each one of them stirs Addie’s inner wolf. When one of her intended mates goes missing, Addie realizes the pack is caught up in something dark and sinister. Someone or something is hunting the wolves, taking them one by one. Death is not the only thing to fear in Crystal Lake… Limitless is the first in a magical, action-packed shifter trilogy, where the heroine will not have to choose between love interests. Why choose?",
