I’d go along on their tour and play nanny for the most adorable little girl I’ve ever seen. the band would get one of their founding members back. A win for everyone. Until Jake learns more about me than I ever wanted anyone to know. And I learn more about him than I could’ve imagined.When life separates two souls, leaving them beaten and bloody, can love forge them into something stronger? When the storms of their past threaten, can their love remain as bright as a shooting star in the rain?",
