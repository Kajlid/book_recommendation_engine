  "description": "Rusty Diamond could hide no longer on the beaches in Maryland. His past had finally caught up to him, all of his mistakes come wrapped in a package, beckoning him back to the wild life he lived, and left, in Las Vegas. Someone wants Rusty to pay for what he did years before, and if Rusty is going to survive, heâ€™s going to have to take the fight to the desert.Rusty was once the hottest act on the strip, a magician who could command sell-out crowds for his death-defying act. But with bigger risks came bigger enemies, and Rusty has accumulated one of the biggest Vegas has to offer, a mobster-turned-politician, who has every resource available to not only close the curtain on Rusty, but to make him suffer beforehand.",
