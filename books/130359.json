  "description": "It started as whispers on the internet so unbelievable that by the time zombies showed up on the doorstep of Main Street America, the plague was unstoppable. Armies were slaughtered, governments fell, and the world as we had known it was gone. The vaulted accomplishments of humanity lay beneath the festering heel of a zombie horde.Over a century later, the hidden city of Vigilance still thrives. A sanctuary against the many dangers of the new world, it is protected by an elite warrior caste known as “Hunters”. These guardians scour the wastes for supplies and recover what they can of the past. Contained within their secret archive are stories that provide valuable historical insight into not only surviving the fall, but clues that might one day help humanity rise from the ashes.",
