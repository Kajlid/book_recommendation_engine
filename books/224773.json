  "title": "Raw Deal: The Untold Story of NYPD's Cannibal Cop",
  "description": "*OPTIONED in February 2019 for a motion picture* \n\"When, if ever, does a thought cross the line and become a crime?\"\n  RAW DEAL is the untold story of former New York City police officer Gil Valle, who in 2012 became known throughout the world as “The Cannibal Cop.” It is part the controversial saga of a man who was imprisoned for “thought crimes,” and a look into a world of dark sexuality and violence that most readers don’t know exists, except maybe in their nightmares.  After Valle’s arrest, media coverage exploded in a frenzy of lurid tabloid headlines and stories about the cop charged with planning to kidnap, torture, rape ...and eat ... women, including his own wife. But here’s the fascinating part; there was no such plan in reality. Valle was simply engaging in his own private fantasies, albeit fantasies that are abhorrent and grotesque, and for that he was thrown into prison.  Valle faced life in prison for his charges, and served 21 months for nothing more than having online chats about his fantasies. He was finally exonerated of all charges.  RAW DEAL raises the question of when does thought become a crime? A question that goes beyond his perverse sexuality to answers society must deal with in order to meet the challenge of terrorism. It will challenge the reader’s beliefs about free speech, the right to privacy, and government’s role in watching over us.  WARNING: This book contains graphic fantasy material of a sexual and violent nature. It is intended for Mature Audiences.",
