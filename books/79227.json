  "description": "Anna loves math, and her boyfriend, Mike. Will she have to choose between them? Anna Conway sometimes wishes her relationships would come as easy to her as math does. A natural math talent, Anna is at odds with what's expected of her as a teenager in the 1950s. While Anna aspires to leave her small town for college to study mathematics, her parents want her to follow the more traditional path of getting married and starting a family. Anna's never really thought of dating before, but when she meets Mike, their relationship takes off and goes further than she'd ever expected. Now it's up to Anna to make her future happen. But how will she choose? In beautiful prose, Sharelle Byars Moranville explores the importance of believing in dreams in order to make a difference. A Higher Geometry is a 2007 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.",
