  "description": "Mason Dupre has resigned himself to never being loved. Silver Whitney has fallen under a spell -- the spell of graceful, ante-bellum Rosewood Plantation. But it is the spell cast long ago over Mason Dupre that prevents Silver from writing the book she has traveled hundreds of miles to complete. Mardi Gras, the interference of a ghost, and the heavy New Orleans air swirl around Silver and Mason as they struggle to solve and understand the mystery that keeps them both bound to the plantation and a vengeful curse.",
