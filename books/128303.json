Though recently spotted in the Faroes, he’s probably not done yet…The book is chock full of remarkable charity attempts, heart-tugging reunions, rare sightings of unusual birds, stunning rescues, bizarre competitions, staggering coincidences, detectorists’ finds, stunning restorations, talented children and oddball record attempts. And so much more, all written in a wry entertaining style by a master of the written word.",
