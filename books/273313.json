  "title": "Lug Your Careless Body out of the Careful Dusk: A Poem in Fragments",
  "description": "Drawing from the paintings of Susan Rothenberg, Gwyneth Scally, and Eric Fischl as well as from the photography of Allison Maletz, Joshua Marie Wilkinson’s  Lug Your Careless Body out of the Careful Dusk  is a book-length poem written in small fragments. Comprised of seven sections, the poem is formed as much by the poet’s travels through Turkey, the Baltics, and Eastern Europe as it is by the movies of Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Krzysztof Kieslowski, and Bill Morrison. The painters Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud are here alongside whispers of Emily Dickinson and Wallace Stevens.  Lug Your Careless Body out of the Careful Dusk  is a book of cinematic images and fragments, of small stories overheard and quickly abandoned, of hidden letters and phone booths, and of ghosts who return with questions. Born and raised in Seattle’s Haller Lake neighborhood,  Joshua Marie Wilkinson  is the author of one other book of poetry,  Suspension of a Secret in Abandoned Rooms , and the chapbook  A Ghost as King of the Rabbits . He holds an MFA from the University of Arizona and an MA in film studies from University College Dublin. Presently he lives in Denver, Colorado, where he is pursuing his doctorate in English and creative writing and completing his first film.",
