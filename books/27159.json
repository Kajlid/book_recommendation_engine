  "description": "NEW YORK TIMES & USA Today Bestselling Author Tina Folsom presents: A Scent of Greek (Out of Olympus #2) When the god of wine and ecstasy, Dionysus, callously dumps his latest conquest, the mortal Ariadne, the goddess Hera has had enough. She robs Dionysus of his memory to teach him a lesson in humility. Ariadne is deeply hurt after Dionysus dismisses their night of passion as \"just sex\" and doesn't want to see her anymore. When she finds him bloodied and beaten and suffering from amnesia, she quickly forms a plan to get back at him. As she pretends to be his fianc√©e, Ariadne makes Dionysus believe he loves her. But the longer the charade continues, the more difficult it becomes to really see who teaches whom a lesson. And what if Dionysus gains his memory back? Will there be hell to pay for her deception, or can a mortal woman truly win a god's love?",
