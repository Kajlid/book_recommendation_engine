  "title": "The Mirror of Love",
  "description": "This epic poem recounts the history of same-sex love, revealing a hidden side of Western culture through the lives of its greatest artists. Sappho, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, Oscar Wilde, and many others are woven into this rich, visceral piece. Originally written fourteen years ago, The Mirror of Love sprang from Moore's activist heart as a reaction to Britain's controversial anti-gay law, Clause 28. In the past, Mirror has been translated into both a comic book and a stage production, but Top Shelf presents it as it was meant to be, a hardcover book illustrated with over forty full-color photographs from acclaimed artist JosE Villarrubia. Included in the 128-page special edition is an essay about the poem and its previous incarnations, an index of characters and places, a selection of classic poems quoted in the text, and a bibliography.",
