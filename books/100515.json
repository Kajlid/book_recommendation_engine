I was in so much pain and my body was starting to convulse with chills. I must be going into shock like Ryder said. I saw Andrew and Ryder talking, but I couldn't hear them anymore, my hearing was fading as unconsciousness grew inevitable. Andrew gave Ryder a nod and Ryder bit into his own wrist. I saw his bloody wrist approaching my mouth as everything around me was fading to black. I held on as I tasted the salty blood enter my mouth and swallowed it down. I took a few more gulps as I stared up into Ryder’s blue eyes.“That’s it, drink as much as you can.” Ryder said. I took a few more gulps before I passed out.",
