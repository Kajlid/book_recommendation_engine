  "description": "\"Dear Mr. Rogge\" is a three-act play, both funny and uplifting, about the Chinese writer in detention, He Depu. It received a commendation in the BBC World Service International Writing Competition of 2008 and was produced as a stage play by the Geneva English Drama Society in 2012.In 2008 the imprisoned He Depu fought off depression and illness to smuggle out a letter challenging International Olympics Committee President Jacques Rogge to walk from the Birds Nest Arena to Beijing Prison No. 2 to check the truth of his dubious claim that the Olympics would be a catalyst for only good.The truth was that the Games caused Beijing's inmates only increased physical and mental torture. He Depu had already survived beatings and deprivation. Dangerously, the very fact of being sponsored overseas by an NGO emboldened him but he now risked possibly lethal retaliation with his daring appeal. Chinese diplomats in Geneva warned NGO advocates that the prisoner would pay a high price for his continued resistance.In an eerie mirroring of events in China, his Swiss advocate at the Human Rights Council was pressured by her senior colleague to buckle under Chinese diplomatic threats and tailor her activism to a dysfunctional UN bureaucracy to avoid more suffering for the prisoner and his family. Might humanitarian persistence prove shortsighted, self-defeating or even selfish? The outcome of He Depu's courage is both astonishing and inspiring, with a lesson for anyone being told by any institution to \"play the game\" and deny the truth.",
