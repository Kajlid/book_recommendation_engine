  "description": "Elizabeth Bennet, Bridget Jones and now Chloe McKenzie. She is far from being perfect. So does she deserve Mr Right? Mr Right & Mr Wrong - Two men, one girl. Old dilemma. New century. (romcom) Choosing the right man can be a real headache, especially when a tough agronomy course at Imperial College comes on top of that, not forgetting a part-time job at a florist’s and a mother desperate to marry you off. Have I mentioned a stalker who keeps sending roses, and a Professor who thinks it’s fine to bury you under an extra pile of academic papers? Arrrgh! Blake may be cute and charming, but Terrence is no less attractive in his business suits. What is a poor girl (and a potential spinster) to do? Dating both of them is the right thing if you listen to Trish and that’s exactly the way Kurt handles his men. Party after party, you have to deal with these bouts of guilt mixed with hangovers while mulling over the same dilemma over and over again - Blake or Terrence? Terrence or Blake? Finding my Prince Charming was my aim for a long time, finding two of them — wasn't. Think, Chloe, think! Mr Right & Mr Wrong is a wonderfully warm and witty yet thoughtful chick lit romantic comedy, from which you will not only pick up tips on the intricacies of London dating, but also discover a few moral and ethical aspects of plant neurobiology. Not so much chick lit as chic lit, offering sophistication alongside Chloe’s amusing complications. Book 2 called 'Mr Right for Kurt and My Other Experiments' is expected on Amazon Kindle on April 15th, 2016. More fabulous, more scandalous!",
