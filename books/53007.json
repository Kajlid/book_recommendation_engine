  "description": "Letters to Carol were written to make it easier for me to face my abusers and to move on with my life. Glenda Bixler is indeed right. This book is a non-fiction memoir, a true-life story of one woman's harrowing abuse. In elementary school, during the late 1960s, classmates called me \"The Blob.\" My mother made fun of me. She imitated my looks for my siblings while she disassociated me from my real name. With the early loss of my beloved grandmother, I had no protection from my brother's abuse, which hurt me primarily on multiple levels. One day, inside my bedroom closet, I developed dissociative identity disorder, better known as multiple personality Disorder. I began hugging myself, promising to develop protective mechanisms to help me deal with daily trauma. It also helped me tolerate cruel, insulting behaviors by believing I could rely on my alternate universe to help me soothe my inner pain. When I recognized how much better I felt, I could appropriate tolerance by relegating all my abuses to another part of my mind. Following a terrifying bout with homelessness, my last personality emerged to tell my story, proving forgiveness was the component that would ultimately put a rest to my trauma and set me free. I am most honored to present to you my letters to Carol.",
