Mary goes rogue, and with Zach's help, attempts to aid an underground group of drones. But standing in her way are the police, bounty hunters, a senatorial candidate haunted by a dark secret, and her own evolving humanity. On top of everything else, someone is trying to kill her. It's not long before she discovers Zach is right. Freedom isn't all it's cracked-up to be.",
