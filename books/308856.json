  "description": "I ran. I ran as if my life depended on it â€” I dinna ken what had happened tae him.The men who surrounded us, including my brother, the Earl of Breadalbane, had ripped me from his arms. They told me I would never see him again. They told me that he would die for having met with me in secret, for having sworn tae marry me, for taking me tae his bed.I raced through the gates and made it tae my mother's chambers and dropped tae my knees in front of her. \"Please, I beg of ye, help me.\"______________________________Thus begins the story of the antihero, Mairead, and her adventurous and sometimes malevolent heart. The mother of Magnus Campbell, she was born at Kilchurn Castle in 1651. Her rise through history is entwined with the history of the Campbell clan, the art of Picasso, the roaring 20s in New York City, and ultimately, weaves with the time-traveling kings from the 24th century.A historical story with glimpses of the genre-bending, century-twisting, action-filled adventure to come, Lady Mairead is a standalone prequel to the Kaitlyn and the Highlander series.",
