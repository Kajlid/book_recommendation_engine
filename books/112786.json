  "description": "Mercy’s actions may have finally caught up with her and the consequences dire. The demon she freed with her dagger may prove to be more dangerous dead than alive.  With determination that has no bounds, Mercy sets out on a quest to make things right. No matter the price or at the cost of her own life, she will persevere and is determined to have no mercy for anyone who gets in her way.  Thrust into another realm on a promise that seems meaningless now, she will find her heart in an unexpected place. Love will conquer all, and the two will become one if they are all to survive.  But… one decision may derail her plans.",
