  "description": "“Let me tell you one thing, Beast: if your Prince ever returns, watch his back. There are thousands who would gladly throw daggers at it.” And Belle would be first in line.  Ten years ago, he was Prince Aiden, heir of Jereena, at the top of the world – now, they call him Beast. Aiden has landed on his feet, his exclusive club is the place to be, he makes hundreds of thousands a night. What else could he possibly want?  Belle grew up during the Anarchy, and the corrupted system screwed her, big time, but she managed to get by. Then, her stupid brother goes and steals from the Beast, who demands her as payment. Well, her, a pile of cash, or her sister – option two and three aren’t acceptable.  ---  Beauty and the Beast is the third volume of Not quite the Fairy Tale, however it's a standalone. I do recommend reading at least Cinderella, first, to \"get\" the world... but it's not necessary. Believe me, you'll enjoy it regardless. Beware of strong language and sexual situations.",
