  "description": "\"Spy vs. Spy\" has been one of the most popular features in MAD Magazine since 1961. The diabolical duo of double-crosses and deceit (one dressed in black, the other in white) have continued to one-up each other until death do they part. The Spy vs. Spy comics collect here were hand picked by The Usual Gang of Idiots to provide the maximum amount of idiotic espionage!",
