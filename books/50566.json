  "title": "Went the Day Well?",
  "description": "'Went the Day Well?' is one of the most unusual pictures Ealing Studios produced, a distinctly unsentimental war film made in the darkest days of World War II, and nothing like the loveable comedies that later became the Ealing trademark. Its clear-eyed view of the potential for violence lurking just below the surface in a quiet English village possibly owes much to the Graham Greene story on which it is based, though as Penelope Houston shows, there remains a mystery about the extent to which Greene was actually involved in the scripting. Or perhaps the direction by the Brazilian born Cavalcanti, a maverick within the Ealing coterie, is the chief reason why 'Went the Day Well?' avoids the cosy feel of later, more familiar, Ealing films. This book offers an attractive and astute view of British cinema in its heyday.In his foreword to the new edition, Geoff Brown pays homage to Penelope Houston's astute study of the film, and places the book in the context of the changing critical views of the film. Brown discusses the non-English qualities of the film's narrative, and the extent to which Cavalcanti brought a European sensibility to the film's very English setting.",
