As the years pass, new growth and beauty are left in the wake of her constant travels. One day, Karmen risks her life for love and nearly dies. The consequences of her choice force her from the sanctuary she helped to create. After an awakening, she exists in a harsh civilization where innocence is but a distant memory. Will she be able to adapt to her new surroundings? Or will she perish along with the splendor she once knew?
