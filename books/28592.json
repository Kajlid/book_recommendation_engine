  "description": "Horse breeding just ain't what it used to be. There's always been ornery mares, ornery customers and, well, stallions. But FE Booker has sworn off the human counterparts of the latter and is the epitome of the modern independent business woman. Until, that is, it all falls apart. Tack thieves, horse thieves and heart thieves all raise their heads at once and it appears that she has to build even higher the walls she has constructed around herself all her life. It takes a forced hiatus from her work for her to discover that all along she's gotten by with a little help from friends old and new, and that if she just lets go a little she can find happiness in the arms of the person she most resists. Love, horse breeding and petty thievery. Not necessarily in that order.",
