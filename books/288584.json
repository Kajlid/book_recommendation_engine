  "description": "\"You can't help the feelings you are experiencing. You can't stop the thoughts from popping into your head. BUT, let me tell you what you can do, Daniel.\" Dr. Hannah leans forward like he's about to tell me some great secret. \"You can choose not to act on those thoughts and compulsions you are having. Isn't that great news?\" I stare at him. Does he think I'm dumb? If it were that easy, wouldn't I have stopped already? It's his senior year, and everything seems to be going well; captain of the soccer team, perfect girlfriend, student body president. But there's something most people don't know about Daniel. He's struggled with OCD for as long as he can remember. When Daniel's parents inform him that their marriage has ended, his carefully controlled life starts to fall apart. An avalanche of circumstances threatens to take him under. Slowly, he loses control of his perfect world and of himself. Will he learn to navigate his new reality, or will he fail?",
