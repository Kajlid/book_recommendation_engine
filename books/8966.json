  "description": "Great mystery. When Vance’s doorbell rings during the dark hours of the night, he doesn’t yet suspect that he is about to tumble into an adventure far beyond his wildest dreams. The final will of Charles Darwin is stolen, and Vance’s quiet life is a thing of the past. And when he falls in love with the sister of the thief, and when she then disappears… his detecting instincts are in full action. Together with his one-eyed dog Eugene, Vance sets out on a journey for the truth. This leads him to a place he would never have thought he would visit.A mystery thriller that exposes the uncanny schemes of a religious organization that stops at nothing, not even murder. An action-packed detective story with a surprise ending.Highly rated by its fan-base (e.g. at Goodreads)… but utterly disliked by some religious people. Don’t read this if you are a religious fanatic! “A great book for all lovers of intrigue, humor, and man's best friend.” “I loved the character Vance, the love story is so well written.” “Great atheist story telling, intelligent and funny. It reminded me of my days in California.”",
