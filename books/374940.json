  "title": "A Kitten Called Moonlight",
  "description": "Martin Waddell and Christian Birmingham's nostalgic picture book about an adored pet is also a tender celebration of family storytelling. \"I'd like my story again, Charlotte said. The one I like best, about Moonlight and me.\" Once, Charlotte's mother tells her, a very small white kitten was alone and lost. But then a little girl, driving along the coast with her mother, saw two eyes shining brightly in the darkness. \"I know who saw them!\" says Charlotte, and together she and her mother describe a cold winter night by the sea, a lost kitten, and a brave rescue by moonlight. Martin Waddell's magical story and Christian Birmingham's luminous paintings tell a warm and evocative tale--one sure to inspire young children to chronicle some of their own family adventures.",
