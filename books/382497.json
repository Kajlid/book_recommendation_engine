Sired by Renata, the Queen of the Rosso Lussuria, Epiphany willingly played the role of the queen’s beloved petuntil the day came when she was cast from the Renata’s bed and lost the queen’s protection from the Elder vampires.Epiphany has done her best not to become a target, trying to remain as inconspicuous as possible, like a long-forgotten memory huddling beneath the mantle of Vasco’s power, her one true friend among the Rosso Lussuria. But now Renata has called Epiphany forth to face the Challenges that will elevate her clan status to the ranks of the Elder. But Epiphany has few friends and many enemies, and the chances of surviving the Challenges are slim.Surrounded by harsh vampire politics and secret ambitions, Epiphany learns that an old enemy is plotting treason against the woman she once loved, and to save all she holds dear, she must embrace and form an alliance with the dark.",
