  "description": "Portia Richmond had been obsessed with fashion her entire life. Growing up in South Los Angeles, she was only miles away from the most expensive houses in America and enough wealth and materialistic goods to make anyone jealous. Her mother was hard working as a custodian at Los Angeles International Airport, while her father worked two jobs as an electrician to keep the roof over the heads of Portia and her two sisters, as well as food on the table. Another factor of Portia’s parents stood out – her mom, an African American natural beauty married her father, a white man with blonde hair and hazel eyes. Portia was exotic in her appearance having beautiful golden brown hair and hazel eyes, her long limbs looking modelesque since she was in junior high.",
