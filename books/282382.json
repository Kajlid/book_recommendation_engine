  "description": "A Non-Shifter Mpreg RomanceMilo When I fled to the city with my daughter, I thought I’d never feel safe again. It took everything for us to get out alive. I trusted too easily back then. I believed in fairytales like Fate and true love. Then he swoops in, trying to save me. My friend’s estranged older brother; rich and brooding and hot as hell. He’s raising his little boy all alone since his wife died. I think he’s a little bit broken, just like I am. He works his way under my defenses. Makes me trust him. Fall for him. Too bad I don’t believe in happily ever after anymore. The past always catches up.  Jason Cold. Detached. Heartless. My reputation doesn’t bother me. All I care about in this world is my son. Until him. The sweet omega who always has a smile for everyone he meets… Apart from me. Becoming his landlord is just the start. I’ll do whatever it takes to show him we’re meant to be a family. Nothing will keep us apart. Not my disapproving family. Not his abusive ex. Because I protect what’s mine. And this omega? He’s mine.  Guarding Hope is book 3 set in the Misty City omegaverse, where gruff alphas meet feisty omegas, and mend their broken hearts. Sweet, super-steamy, with no cliffhanger endings. Each book can be read as a standalone.",
