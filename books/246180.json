  "description": "Lucy Maria Boston's thrilling and classic time fantasy tales of Green Knowe, an ancient English manor house and its grounds whose setting was based on her own long-time home of The Manor at Hemingford Grey, have been entertaining readers of all ages for decades.This book was renamed Treasure of Green Knowe for the American reading market. However, its original title when published by Faber and Faber in the UK, The Chimneys of Green Knowe, bears a much closer relationship to the whole series in its reference to the changes in the architecture of the house and how each resident or visitor experiences them, as well as the love, friendship, time, and loss all deeply embedded in the building itself. There's a treasure, naturally, that's been missing for centuries, but for Tolly, Susan and Jacob, the three main protagonists of this instalment in the series, the discovery of what happened to that treasure, how it happened, and where the item in question might be in the present time, are all but incidental to the journey towards finding it.This book was adapted into the film From Time To Time, released in 2009, which starred Dame Maggie Smith as \"Granny\" Oldknow, Alex Etel as Tolly, Eliza Hope Bennett as Susan, and Kwayedza Kureya as Jacob.",
