  "description": "Directly, simply, and forcefully, Jrgen Moltmann here presents his reflections on the Spirit and the spiritual life that were the essence of his prior book, The Spirit of Life . In this short, accessible work, he combines a deep personal faith with admirable learning and experience. Moltmann views the Holy Spirit as the power of new life, which enlivens body and soul, spirit and mind. In the Holy Spirit we experience the presence of God, community among people, as well as between humans and all created living things on earth. Beginning with his experiences as a prisoner of war, Moltmann anchors his reflections in a theology of lifeand the Spirit as renewer of lifewhich ties biblical perspectives to contemporary manifestations, hope to holiness, creation to community, and spirituality to prayer. Moltmann at his best, this little theology stimulates the experience of the Holy Spirit in one's own life.",
