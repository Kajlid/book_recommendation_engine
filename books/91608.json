When she grows up, she plans to be a real artist in New York City and never get married. Addie’s best friend is Carla Mae Carter, whose family lives next door. Addie’s worst friend, for as long as she can remember, has been annoying Tanya Smithers, who plans on becoming a ballet dancer. She’s always twirling around or striking a dramatic pose to remind everyone how talented she is. Addie definitely does not have a crush on Billy Wild, even if he is tall and cute and has dark, curly hair and blue eyes. She’s way too busy with her art for such silliness. Anyway, Tanya likes Billy—and they can have each other as far as Addie is concerned. But after Christmas break, the seventh-grade class gets a new teacher, Mr. Davenport, who has movie-star looks and studied art in college and even takes a special interest in Addie’s paintings. Addie starts to notice a strange feeling in her stomach when she’s around the handsome young teacher. Is this what love feels like? Is this what all the other girls have been giggling about? Addie suddenly starts to care about wearing dresses instead of jeans and getting her hairstyle just right. Will Addie get her moment with Mr. Davenport at the Valentine’s Day dance? Or will her true king of hearts be someone in her class—someone she never expected?",
