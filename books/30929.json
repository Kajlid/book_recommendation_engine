Please look at my Revised Edition for the in print book of Demon Vampire.***Thank You***For fifty years, Zack has loved Kyli. Until one fateful day, she was gone. Their romance was everything a romance should be. They met, an attraction kept them together, they fought, they broke up, they longed, they reunited, and in time they married and were able to seek out all the joys life had to offer. Destiny bought them together and fate was cruel enough to tear them apart.  Nothing could keep them away from each other. Not pain, distance, time, or blood. Especially when you aren't human.  Even still, there is a regret in Zack's heart that remembers what happened on that day. It asks for the feelings Zack wishes he could let go. It offers him all the power in the world, if only to take hold of his soul.  For Zack, the past is a fresh, wet, injury that he recalls every night.This is his memory. This is the story of the Demon Vampire.You can find the new book here:http://www.amazon.com/Demon-Vampire-R...",
