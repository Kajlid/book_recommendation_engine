  "description": "The last thing Sid remembered was being enlisted to protect a vulnerable young woman in the coastal town of Sea Haven. Then, as if in some nightmare, he was lost in the swirling currents of the ocean, and sucked deeper into a freezing black eddy. Just as quickly, he was saved–pulled ashore by a beautiful stranger. Her name is Rikki, a sea–urchin diver in Sea Haven. Soon they will be bound by tantalizing secrets, which will engulf them both in a whirlpool of passion and danger.",
