  "description": "From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Kristen Proby comes a new story in her With Me In Seattle series…  Sabrina Harrison hates being famous. She walked away from show business, from the flashing bulbs and prying eyes years ago, and is happy in her rural Oregon home, dedicating her life to her non-profit.  Until Hollywood calls, offering her the role of a lifetime. In more than ten years, she’s never felt the pull to return to the business that shunned her, but this role is everything Sabrina’s ever longed for.  Now she has to get in shape for it.  Benjamin Demarco’s gym, Sound Fitness, continues making a name for itself in Seattle. And now, he finds himself with the task of training Sabrina, getting her in shape for the role of her life. He’s trained hundreds of women. This is his job. So why does he suddenly see Sabrina as more than just another client? His hands linger on her skin, his breath catches when she’s near.  He knows better. Soon, she’ll be gone, living her life. A life that doesn’t include him.  **Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**",
