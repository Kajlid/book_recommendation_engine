  "description": "If Morgan thought her life was tough before--what with a drug-addicted, klepto brother and a cradle-robbing mother--it just got worse: Her friend Jason took his own life. Morgan copes--or tries to--by attempting to piece together vague clues that might explain Jason's suicide. Making matters worse, she can't help but feel responsible somehow. Sometimes she thinks maybe Jason had the right idea all along. This fourth book in the TrueColors teen fiction series deals with the important topics of grief, suicide, self-worth, identity, and handling tragedy.",
