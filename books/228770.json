  "description": "As the son of a formidable Breed warrior, Aric Chase has been devoted to the Order all his life. With his training completed, all he needs is one successful mission before he can join the fight to destroy the Order's chief nemesis, Opus Nostrum. His rare ability to daywalk lands Aric an assignment in Montreal, where he learns he's to be teamed with another new recruit, a beautiful but tough-as-nails Breedmate named Kaya Laurent. Independent and driven, Kaya wants nothing more than to become a full-fledged member of the Order. Having grown up in squalor and neglect on the streets of Montreal, she longs for the close-knit family she's found during her training to be a warrior. Eager to prove herself, she is thrilled to be given the chance at a key operation--even if she must share the mission with an arrogant, far-too-seductive Breed male who's practically Order royalty. Their unwanted partnership soon erupts into a desire neither of them can resist. But when Kaya's past reaches out from the shadows to call her back, she must decide between protecting a dark alliance that could shatter her dreams of joining the team and a truth that could not only forfeit Aric's faith in her, but bring the enemy right to the Order's door. Contains mature themes.",
