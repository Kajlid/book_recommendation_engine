  "description": "3 erotic Nun tales of mischief and Domination.  When a lone nun guarding her cloister comes across an unconscious young man in the grip of fever... are the extents of her care a sin if her heart is in the right place? When a young courier delivers his final parcel for the day to a church, he must make some unexpected decisions. Is it better to heed his fearful instincts or perhaps just do as he's told? While serving a community service term, Terry has sworn to follow the straight and narrow, but when a group of nuns come to help the shelter, will a young innocent nun prove that the street life is not the only crooked path? Or that the young and holy are not as innocent as they may seem...  Each story contains elements of true events!",
