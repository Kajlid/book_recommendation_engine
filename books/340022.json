  "description": "The New York Times â€“#1 bestselling author and psychic Sylvia Browne and her son explore the ways in which spirits, angels, and God celebrate Christmas in Heaven and how the celebrations compare to those on Earth. Questions such as Are there presents and the exchanging of gifts? Do heavenly spirits decorate? and How is Jesus honored? are discussed, as is the idea of giving gifts from the heart, like the spirits and angels in heaven do, instead of giving store-bought goods. Information is also provided on the role of religious ceremonies in heaven and how they differ from the ceremonies of the living.",
