  "description": "Bennett’s firm hand is everything I need…except maybe Archer’s gentle touch.I’m in a downward spiral…see what I did there? I'm a grade A screw up and everyone knows it. I'm just waiting for the day the entire band kicks me to the curb. When the band manager, Archer, hires his ex-boyfriend Bennett to keep me from screwing up while the band is on hiatus, I may have finally met someone who won’t take my attitude lying down. With the three of us cooped up together for weeks on end, I have a feeling things might get interesting.* This is an MMM romance. Beat of Their Own Drum is the third book in the Replay series. Each book in the series will focus on a different band member getting a second chance at love. Each book can be read as a stand-alone.",
