  "description": "When Sloan Kennedy is handed a pink slip from her employer and her fianc√©, she takes a job as a receptionist at a local public radio station, quickly becoming immersed in the goofy world of broadcast journalism students perfecting their British accents, gossiping busybodies, flaky bosses, and uber pledge drive fans. Sloane must pull it all together as visiting radio personality Sebastian Kohler arrives, complete with an insane list of Green Room demands, including a specialty breathe mint, rumored to help squelch Mr. Kohler's notorious halitosis. When fighting coworkers lock themselves in the bathroom, Sloane realizes that she may have to go on-air to interview Mr. Kohler and help reach the pledge drive goal.",
