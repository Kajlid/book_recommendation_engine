  "description": "Guts, the feared Black Swordsman, finishes his desperate battle with the monstrous Count, cutting and blasting the hideous abomination to gory scraps. But Guts won't even have time to clean his gigantic sword when the Count's agonized pleas activate the mystical talisman Behelit, summoning the Godhand, five demon lords of immeasurable power. Guts' journey so far has been a long road of pain and death, but that's a walk in the park compared to fighting his way out of hell itself! And for their help, the Godhand have a price to extact from the Count, a price too dear for even such a heartless monster to consider!Created by Kenturo Miura, Berserk is exactly what its title advertises; a savage, gruesome, and often humorous roller-coaster ride, inspiring the internationally popular anime series. If you're looking for graphic fiction to take home to Grandma, this ain't itâ€”unless Granny smokes cigars and rides a Harley!",
