  "description": "Life in Sugartown hasn't always been easy, not for an ex-con like Elijah, and certainly not for Ana, who grew up desperate for a way out.Meeting Elijah changed all that; Elijah changed a lot of things.You’d think that after three years together and the worst behind them that life would be a walk in the park, but Sugartown’s sexiest couple may be about to face their biggest obstacles yet.Between failed marriage proposals, a trampy ex-lover and a tempting new biker, Sugartown is suddenly not so sweet. They’re head-over-heels in love. It should be simple—but it rarely is.Will they make it down the aisle to the happy ever after they deserve? Or are some relationships just destined to fail?Intended for an 18+ audience. Contains explicit sex, violence, a crap-tonne of profanity, and naked encounters with disastrous outcomes.",
