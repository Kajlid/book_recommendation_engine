  "description": "A new dark romance novel from the New York Times bestselling author of Prisoner…  I came from a place of dirt floors and holy scriptures. They told me the world outside was full of sin, and the first night I escape, I find out it’s true. Ivan saves me, but he does more than that. He takes me. He makes me his own girl.  My conditioning runs too deep. Ivan sees what I am.  That’s the thing about showing a mouse to a cat. He wants to play. And it’s terrifying, even for me. Because the only thing darker than my past is his.  ****************  Author’s Note: Pretty When You Cry is a STANDALONE dark romance novel. It's set in the sexy Stripped series world but can be read alone. Not intended for those uncomfortable with the subject matter or under eighteen.",
