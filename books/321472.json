Mary believes that the ghost is her father who gives her the power to heal others. When Mary begins to help others with her powers, strangers hoping to be healed show up at their house. Mary’s efforts to help them turn tragic and Mary must turn to her family and her music to find answers to the losses in her life. The story is told from alternating perspectives of three main characters. Mary tells her story through her diary as she talks to her imagined father about the changes in her life. Mary’s mother, Rachel, reveals to Mary the secrets of their family, and her history with Mary’s father who was killed in what appeared to be a racially motivated drive-by shooting. Jonah Culpepper, who lives next door, talks to his dead wife, Esther, about Mary, and how she has given him a reason to live.",
