  "description": "Twenty-five-year-old Quint Holt has the weight of his wolf-shifter family’s ranch on his shoulders. As the only child, it is his duty to keep the ranch out the hands of the Tiptons, a pack of shifters who have been trying to gain the Holt’s land for generations. There’s only one problem—for as long as Quint can remember, he has been fantasizing about the oldest Tipton brother, Cy.  So far, Quint has been able to keep his distance from the man of his dreams, but when Cy asks Quint to meet him in private, Quint can’t keep himself from agreeing. Is Cy setting him up in order to take the Holt ranch, or does Cy feel the same attraction Quint does? Will this secret encounter lead them to a future together and the end of the Holt-Tipton feud, or will their families and unknown forces create more chaos and havoc and tear them apart? Find out the answers to these questions as Quint and Cy come to understand and face the dangers and obstacles that lay ahead for the both of them. They will soon learn if love does conquer all.
