Finian Alexander is one scandalous tabloid photo away from catapulting his acting career onto the A-list. All his bad boy persona needs is an agreeable member of the paparazzi to give him a friendly boost. But vacationing out in the middle of nowhere, the only photographer he knows is way too scrupulous for her own good. Or is she? Hailey Summer is desperate for cash—so desperate that she's willing to do just about anything with her photography skills to save her family's cottage and keep her secrets hidden from her sisters. So when sexy and arrogant movie star Finian makes her an offer, Hailey can't resist. But does his proposition take things too far? And when their plans begin to unravel, will Finian and Hailey find the limelight too blinding? This is the first book in the complete Summer Sisters series, written by New York Times bestselling romance author Jean Oram.",
