  "description": "“...Ron Potter skillfully subverts the memoir genre with MOOSE: a deeply absorbing, sometimes spiritual, often psychedelic journey through space, time, and the events that shape his life and death.”What if time is a construct? What if you can ignore time and allow everything to happen at once? And what if you master the skills of journeying in and out of past and future moments, reliving events that happen, or maybe don't, or won't happen... And what if you realize you've broken the model, thereby changing events, creating alternate outcomes, and you change yourself, and not for the better?This is what I do/did and you will discover how I do/did it, with the help of Mick Jagger, a few teenage friends, a dead cousin and my own deceased father, whom I hate/hated/will hate/love.When I begin my journey, I join my stoner teenage buddies on our epic journey to the Rolling Stones concert at Rich Stadium in Buffalo.I wouldn't change a thing. But when I guide my sixteen-year-old self to have sex with that beautiful woman I failed to make out with the first time, it's literally life-changing. Her ex-husband's biker friends murder me. In my disembodied state, I become a spirit guide to myself. It complicates when I start to see the flyers, energy-seeking blobs of energy, and I realize that infinity is calling me. I am destined to sail past the eagle, the consciousness-devouring entity at the end of the world. But before I can depart on my definitive journey, I must fulfill my destiny; I must resolve how to save myself from my now murdered self.Believe it or not, there is a happy ending.",
