  "title": "The Turn of the Screw",
  "description": "The Turn of the Screw is a subtle and unconventional ghost story that concentrates on the psychological rather than the actual. It is open to widely different interpretations. Are the ghosts a real danger to the children or merely imagined by a lonely and susceptible woman? But what is certain is that the novel exerts a chilly and lasting power over the reader's imagination.",
