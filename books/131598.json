  "description": "At 16, Davey's stuck between becoming the man his father wants him to be, and leaving behind the child he was. Before Davey gets a chance to grow up, however, his placid life is destroyed when his parents are murdered and his family farm “reclaimed.” Neighboring farmers try to care for Davey by engaging him in their community of clubs, church, and boarding school, but one night Davey escapes, embarking on a harrowing trek away from civilization and toward revenge and redemption. Ian Holding’s tense, sparse prose, vivid sense of place, and searing portrait of a boy in a situation almost beyond imagining make this an unforgettable debut.",
