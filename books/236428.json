  "description": "The young detectives call Alan Auhl a retread, but that doesn’t faze him. He does things his own way—and gets results.He still lives with his ex-wife, off and on, in a big house full of random boarders and hard-luck stories. And he’s still a cop, even though he retired from Homicide some years ago.He works cold cases now. Like the death of John Elphick—his daughters still convinced he was murdered, the coroner not so sure. Or the skeleton that’s just been found under a concrete slab. Or the doctor who killed two wives and a girlfriend, and left no evidence at all.Auhl will stick with these cases until justice is done. One way or another.",
