  "description": "Sometimes life deals you a very hard hand.  When Brett Thompson is forced to deal with a family tragedy, his nicely ordered life changes overnight. Not only does he have zero parenting experience, he is not a fan of sticky, messy, or chaotic—the very definition of “kids.” He loves his niece and nephews, but can he handle four of them on his own?  Four.  F-O-U-R  Jordan Butler would do anything for his best friend of twenty years, including stepping in to help out with Brett’s four new rugrats. He handles disorganization much better than Brett does. That’s what friends do, right? Friends take care of friends. But sometimes a friend needs more than a hug.  Sometimes messy chaos turns into treasured moments.  And sometimes stolen moments and children’s smiles make you realize that for the first time ever, you have the opportunity to have it all.",
