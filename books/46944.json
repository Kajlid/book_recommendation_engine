  "description": "On a rainy, windswept night along a slick coastal road Hayden Ryan wants nothing more than a chance at a new beginning. She’s hoping to put enough miles behind her to escape the grasp of her former boss, Jeremy Dochenko. Jeremy’s already tried to have her killed once before. And now, too tired to go any farther, she pulls off the road until the rain lets up. When she wakes to flashing lights in her rear view mirror, the last thing she needs is the suspicious, watchful eyes of Deputy Sheriff, Ethan Cody. Like his father, Ethan Cody sometimes uses the shaman in him from his Chumash heritage to “read people.” The minute he sees Hayden Ryan on the side of the road, he senses enough fear and danger in her to set up roadblocks. His cop instincts tell him to avoid her like the plague. But avoiding her is difficult, especially when she decides to stay in Pelican Pointe. Soon mistrust on both sides turns to a love neither one saw coming. Will they be able to trust each other in time to prevent Dochenko’s henchmen from destroying what they have together?",
