  "description": "A collection of 80 short and very short stories, which writer John Minichillo calls \"short brilliant playful poetic blasts: a baby's first word is 'Hitler', the Greek God Mars donates his divine seed to a fertility clinic, a portal turns spiders into flowers, The Serious Writer buys an iPad, a mother burns, an autistic child listens. Marcus Speh, a German writer living in Germany, has a better command of English than just about anyone. His short pieces are sometimes personal, often poignant, and always perfect.\"",
