  "description": "In McElhaney’s newest tale of science-fiction suspense, we meet Declan Stringfellow – a man single-handedly taking out his revenge on the organized crime ring in Richland. The cards seem to be dealt in his favor until a car accident lands him in the hospital. But don’t close your eyes for a second…In the blink of an eye, he goes from being in a hospital MRI scanner to being aboard a Colonial Establishment Cruiser 300 years in the future. He wakes up in a different body, and it’s the identical body as 21 other people who all find themselves equally as confused. How did they all get here and where are they going? From the Xulon Award winning author of \"Mommy's Choice,\" \"One Crazy Summer,\" \"Event Horizon,\" and \"Saving Brooksie.\" Now Scott McElhaney is making all his novels available to Kindle readers at the very accessible price of only 99 cents.",
