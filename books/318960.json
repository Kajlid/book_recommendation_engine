  "description": "Will his daring debutante rescue reveal the traitor to the crown?\nLily Davies' first—and final, if she has anything to say about it—Season in London is mercifully coming to an end. Exhausted by the parade of balls, importuning gentlemen, and the endless dismissal of her suspicions about a certain captain, Lily wants nothing more than to return to her quiet life of country walks and intensive study. Unfortunately for this bluestocking, she is besieged en route to Derbyshire and kidnapped by a highwayman.In London to assist his brother, the brand new Earl of Talbot, Captain Nathan Jones is on the hunt for the traitor to the crown. But when it becomes clear that Miss Davies' life is very much in danger, Captain Jones is dispatched to ensure the reluctant debutante travels safely. Escorting her safely home will also give him the perfect opportunity to question Miss Davies about the highly dubious gifts she's been receiving from the French.As Captain Jones becomes the unlikely hero to a very uncooperative damsel in distress, he quickly learns that rescuing Miss Davies is only the beginning of his troubles. One unfortunate compromise leaves this pair with no choice but to head for the altar, and the unnecessary distraction just might ruin his opportunity to uncover the identity of the traitor once and for all.",
