  "description": "The fun and mischievous daily adventures of head mutt Earl and his kitty chum, Mooch, take center stage in Patrick McDonnell's Mutts collection, A Little Look-See . As with McDonnell's previous collections, the always-adorable Mooch and Earl can be counted on for hearty laughs and endearing moments as they share their pets'-eye views when \"their peoples\" are not around. In A Little Look-See , we learn through Earl and Mooch that yes, animals do practice those irresistible expressions that melt our hearts, and we witness a not-so-dignified debate over the age-old question of who is dogs or cats?The creative style and classic charm of Mutts earns McDonnell the admiration of loyal readers, prominent national organizations, and fellow cartoonists, as well as frequent comparisons to cartoon-strip greats such as Peanuts and Calvin and Hobbes . In 2000, McDonnell received the National Cartoonists Society's highest honor, the Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year for 1999. With a following that spans 20 countries, Mutts has also garnered notice internationally, winning Germany's prestigious Max & Moritz Award for best international comic strip. Go ahead and take A Little Look-See at the spectacular world of Mutts .",
