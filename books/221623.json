  "description": "Schneider Wrack Was Dead.Until he wasn't. Convicted of a crime he's almost completely sure he didn't commit, executed, reanimated, then pressed into service aboard a vast trawler on the terrible world of Ocean, he was set to spend his afterlife working until his mindless corpse fell apart. But now he's woken up, trapped in a rotting body, arm-deep in the stinking meat and blubber of a sea monster, and he's not happy. It's time for the dead to rise up. From the stench and brine of Ocean to the fetid jungle of Grand Amazon, Schneider's career as a revolutionary won't be easy. But sometimes a zombie's gotta do what a zombie's gotta do.",
