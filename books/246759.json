  "description": "**A Russian Bratva standalone spin-off novel. Giovanna Rossi was born an Italian Mafia princess, by blood only. Raised to be nothing more than a toy used to satisfy men’s pleasures. She was always available for a price. She never dreamed to hope for anything other than physical relationships. Aidan O’Neil was once an Irish Prince, next in line to his father’s throne. He grew up to despise what his father stood for. After all, he helped bring the Irish king to his knees. His devotions now lie with the newly formed union between his Irish mob and the Russian Bratva. An arrangement meant only to release physical tension, turns into so much more—it turns into everything. When a broken prince meets his match in a broken princess, their bond cannot be denied. *Recommended for readers 18+ due to Language, Violence, and Sexual Content.",
