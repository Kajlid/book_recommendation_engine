  "description": "Life at Full Throttle transports the reader into the unpredictable world of the AD/HD adult in a manner that is highly engaging, while providing insightful and well-researched information on this topic. As a clinical psychologist, Dr. Avery has evaluated over two thousand individuals for AD/HD, and has developed a well-grounded understanding of the type of information that is most helpful to AD/HD adults, as well as a style of delivery that is well received and appreciated by AD/ HD clients and their families. Having lived with this condition her entire life, and being a mother who has parented two children with attention deficits, Dr. Avery speaks of AD/HD with both insight and humor.",
