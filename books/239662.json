  "description": "500-mile road trip! Mission? Get over the guy you kinda-sorta hooked up with. Problem? He's your new road-trip companion.Bribed by her bestie to go on a stupid soul-searching road trip to get over The Turd, Jane is sooo not into spending four days visiting tacky Florida stops and, ugh, journaling it. A librarian hiding behind the stereotype, she'd rather veg and read, thank you very much.What could make it worse? Oh yeah. A hunky, charming playboy, begging for a ride. You might wonder why that would be worse, because, c'mon--hot guy? Except this hot guy is The Turd, the player this whole trip is meant to help her forget. RISKING IT is a steamy, standalone romantic comedy from RITA Winning and USA Today bestselling author Angela Quarles with a happy-ever-after and no cheating or cliffhangers, with some bonus stops at wacky Florida tourist traps. Warning: there's a scene where guys get all hot and sweaty playing the ancient Irish sport of hurling, just sayin'.",
