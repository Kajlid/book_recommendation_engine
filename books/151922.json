  "description": "Your heart will be captured by these beautiful stories in \"Pet Tales.\" From two to four legged and feather and fur, our pets have always had a special place in our lives and hearts. They are with us in good times and in bad times, and they always know how we feel. They give us attention and love when they sense that we need it most. We tell them everything and they sit there and listen! It is unconditional love. We always know when they want a walk, need to go outside, want a treat or just to be petted. We spell words because they know what certain words mean! They even have a Christmas Stocking hanging from the fireplace mantle! We give them baths. They come back all clean and sometimes with sweet ribbons. They take the first opportunity to roll in dirt. They ignore us sometimes pretending not to care, but they know the sound of our tires when we drive in and then greet us. We see their faces getting white hairs and sometimes they have a challenge in getting up.... Then there are special service dogs that are priceless! They give hearing, sight, confidence, and motion to those in need. They are companions to all. When the time comes that we lose them for whatever reason, our heart aches due to the fact that we just lost a family member. We believe in Rainbow Bridge...enjoy these special stories from the heart that are near and dear to us. Enjoy these Unforgettable Faces and Stories!",
