  "description": "Spiked with a blue pill. Out cold for long time. Days spent sparko. When you come round you’re different. Full on ramped up grey cells maxed. Genius. But blud, trying to dig up an ultra famous corpse was maybe a bit too clever. . . \"Kiss My ASBO\" is a crackling drama of underclass, urban youth.  Given an experimental drug by an ex-military relative, its lead character finds himself evolving new mental skills and insights to aid survival in an environment and society in which he previously felt unwelcome. Pushing the boundaries of language and offering a fresh perspective, this innovative debut novel is sink-estate 'grime fiction'.",
