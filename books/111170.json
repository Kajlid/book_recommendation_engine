  "description": "Following Alexander \"Ace\" Burnell's relocation into New York City after his father's suicide, he encounters Aurora Garland and a new set of friends who lead him through his junior year at his new high school. What he discovers from his interactions with Aurora, however, is that nobody knows much about her. Ace learns that she has a highly destructive personality and bits of that personality begin to influence him as well. Caught up in a violent storm of reinventing himself from the loner that he once was, Ace embodies an intrepid heart to conform all while Aurora's quiet desperation grows louder.",
