  "description": "When a teacher is found dead, having apparently committed suicide, his friend Pierre Hoffman takes over class 4F and finds himself responsible for a group of strangely subdued, well-behaved and yet menacing pupils. Assuming their behavior to be a response to the trauma of their teacher's death, Pierre Hoffman at first takes it easy with the precocious class, refusing to share the other staff members' hostility toward the children. Over the weeks that follow, however, he receives a series of signals and warnings that cause him to question the motivations of his pupils and the circumstances of his colleague's suicide.",
