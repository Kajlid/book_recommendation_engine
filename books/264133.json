  "description": "Legend has it that without its ravens the Tower of London would crumble into dust and the kingdom would fall, so there are always at least six ravens living at the Tower. Another resident, Yeoman Warder Chris Skaife, is the Ravenmaster, responsible for the birdsâ€ safety and welfare. Chrisâ€s love for his charges is obvious from his light-hearted account of their work together and his character sketches of the seven Munin, Merlina, Erin, Rocky, Jubilee II, Gripp II and Harris.",
