  "title": "Civil War Dogs And The Men Who Loved Them",
  "description": "Sallie, Jack, Tip, Mike, Calamity..... These are just a few of the dogs who faithfully followed their masters through the Civil War, some right to the front line. There were spy dogs and hospital dogs.... messenger dogs and prison dogs. Some were wounded and returned to the front. Others were not so lucky. There were also the dog-lovers, such as Generals Pickett, Asboth, Barksdal and Custer, and also Presidents Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln. These are but a few of the stories in this delightful book. Also included is a Civil War photo gallery of the men and their pets as well as a chapter about modern dogs of war honoring those canines who followed their Civil War counterparts into war, some of them serving in Operation Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom. Over 100 images.",
