  "title": "Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea",
  "description": "Award-winning journalist Carl Zimmer collaborates with leading scholars to tell the compelling story of the theory of evolution—from Darwin to 21st century science Darwin’s The Origin of Specie s was breathtaking—beautifully written, staunchly defended, defiantly radical. Yet it emerged long before modern genetics, molecular biology, and contemporary findings in paleontology. This remarkable book presents a rich and up–to–date view of evolution that explores the far–reaching implications of Darwin's theory and emphasizes the power, significance, and relevance of evolution to our lives today. After all, we ourselves are the product of evolution, and we can tackle many of our gravest challenges –– from lethal resurgence of antibiotic–resistant diseases to the wave of extinctions that looms before us –– with a sound understanding of the science. Evolution is an indispensable asset to any serious reader with an interest in the life sciences, a passion for truth in education, or a concern for the future of the planet.",
