  "title": "Revealing Whiteness: The Unconscious Habits of Racial Privilege",
  "description": "\"[A] lucid discussion of race that does not sell out the black experience.\" --Tommy Lott, author of The Invention of RaceRevealing Whiteness explores how white privilege operates as an unseen, invisible, and unquestioned norm in society today. In this personal and self-searching book, Shannon Sullivan interrogates her own whiteness and how being white has affected her. By looking closely at the subtleties of white domination, she issues a call for other white people to own up to their unspoken privilege and confront environments that condone or perpetuate it. Sullivan's theorizing about race and privilege draws on American pragmatism, psychology, race theory, and feminist thought. As it articulates a way to live beyond the barriers that white privilege has created, this book offers readers a clear and honest confrontation with a trenchant and vexing concern.",
