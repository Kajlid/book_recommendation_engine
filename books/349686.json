  "description": "August Faison and his gorgeous young daughter Genevieve are seasoned swindlers who rove across time in search of new victims to fleece. Now the most precious pigeon of them all has fallen into their laps, in Jerusalem, at the time of Jesus Christ. Dr. Owen Vannice is far too innocent and far too rich for his own good. A fabulously wealthy paleontologist, he finds himself stranded in the Holy City with a rapidly growing baby dinosaur in tow. And Simon is a disillusioned disciple whose master has been kidnapped uptime by colonists from the future. When a desperate act of sabotage brings them all together, their lives are drastically transformed, for Genevieve is falling in love with ‘Dr. Nice’ against her better judgement, and is even willing to double-cross her father to get him.",
