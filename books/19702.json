  "description": "At the edge of the Butterfly Nebula, beyond the last portal, lies Periphery Station. Last haven, recovery hospice, tourist mecca, and cathedral in space. All sorts of people come to Periphery armalcolite prospectors, star rangers, survivors, and renegades. The portal brings word of other galaxies—and other realities. Time, distance, and motive have different meanings here. Marcher Lord Press produces science fiction and fantasy novels with a spiritual edge. Here, six Marcher Lord Press authors—plus the publisher himself—show their skills with short fiction. If you like the short stories, you’ll love the award-winning novels. Marcher Lord Press is the premier publisher of Christian speculative fiction. Come for the adventure. Come for the discovery. Ether Ore.",
