  "description": "THE PIAZZA - BARTLEBY - BENITO CERENO - THE LIGHTNING-ROD MAN - THE ENCANTADAS - THE BELL TOWER - THE TOWN-HOâ€™S STORYThe short stories of Herman Melville are considered today to be among the small masterpieces of American fiction. BILLY BUDD, Melville's posthumously published novella, is a classic tale of innocence, evil, and murder that depicts the rivalry between a simple, handsome young sailor and a demonic superior. BARTLEBY is the subtly comic tale of an apathetic scrivener, and BENITO CERENO is the story of a Spanish sea captain caught up in a slave revolt on his ship. Included in this volume are THE PIZZA TALES as well as THE TOWN-HO'S STORY, a chapter from MOBY-DICK. By turns haunting and comic, and always compelling, these fine stories convey the diversity and grandeur of Melville's talent as well as the depth of his themes.--back cover",
