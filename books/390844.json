  "description": "One of the founders of surrealism, Benjamin Péret lived a life resistant to any aesthetic or political compromise. Though he was the writer most admired within the surrealist group itself, very little of his work has been previously translated. This, the first authorized collection, assembles his finest work—his novel, Death to Pigs and to the Field of Glory, poems, polemical and critical writings, and unclassifiable works like \"Natural History\" and \"The Round-the-World Calendar of Tolerable Inventions.\"This volume will also include the first detailed biography of Péret to appear in English, based on sources only recently brought to light. Octavio Paz has described Péret's writings as \"among the most original and most savage of our era.\" Breton wrote, \"Humor here gushes from its source.\"At last, the source is available in English.",
