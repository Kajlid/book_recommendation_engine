  "description": "SEEING THE MIRACLE IN A FLOWERA book for the soulWhen we set free the light within us, we release our light back into the worldâ€”we awake the World Soul, the Spirit of Gaia, by our own awakening. To heal and transform the world, is to invoke the magical and mysterious power hidden inside us.Flowers are the personification of purity, beauty and love. They bring healing and give us joy. They make us feel good and help us celebrate meaningful moments in our lives. A flower may bring a smile or invoke a tear. They are transformative and eternal. Flowers grow wildly in the fields and woods, in our gardens, and even in the cracks of a city pavement.To gaze upon a flower is to behold the wisdom of life. How miraculous, that something so bountiful and free upon the earth, is also the source of spiritual understanding.Wander at leisure through the garden of these living pages. Gaze through your inner looking glass -- and there you will come to know the language, the wisdom and the miracle of flowers.\"If I had a flower for every time I thought of you...I could walk through my garden forever.\" -- Alfred TennysonColour illustrations are best enjoyed by reading the paperback version or viewing on a colour-screen device.",
