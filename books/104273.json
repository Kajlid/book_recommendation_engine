  "description": "In serious need of a vacation after their last laser-beam-filled exploit, Lily, Jasper, and Katie have dashed off in their Gyroscopic Sky Suite for a restful sojourn at the Moose Tongue Lodge and Resort, a stunning spot filled with roaring fires, Cocoa Splurges, and many fine displays of taxidermy. But in a bizarre turn of events, a number of other children’s book heroes also happen to be unwinding at the vintage mountain retreat, including the dim but well-built Manley Boys, the boy-crazy Cutesy Dell Twins, and Eddie Wax from the little-known classic Stumpy Rides to Glory. And then there are the adorable mystery-solving Hooper Quints, who, along with a wealthy heiress’s priceless diamond necklace and numerous mounted animal heads, have suddenly gone missing. Meaningless coincidence? Or could it all be part of a nefarious plot involving duct tape, some Bavarian folk pants, and a slew of counterfeit dinner coupons? Tough to say, but one thing’s for sure: Katie, Lily, and Jasper are the only swell youngsters around who can solve this spine-tingling mystery",
