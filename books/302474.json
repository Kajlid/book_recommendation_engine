  "description": "A steamy fantasy Cinderella retelling novella you won’t want to miss. There’s darkness rising from the lands plaguing the werewolf race. The nobility are tied up every Wednesday night at the breeding club trying to procreate. Will the insatiable werelock prince find his mate so together they can balance and restore the kingdom?A werewolf kingdom without enough power of a mated werelock leader will eventually fail. When the land is healthy, the supernatural wolves are healthy. Unfortunately, many inferior bloodlines in the kingdom have already succumbed to disease and lost connection to their wolves. True mates may never be found. Without interference, over time the werewolf gene will die out.The crown prince doesn’t have a mate, but this doesn’t stop him from having to satiate his demanding wolf. His father has devised a sanctioned Royal Breeding Club where alphas dominate to increase seminal transmissions amongst the nobility with whom royal mates are most likely to occur, thereby increasing the chance of werewolf procreation. Is the picky prince able to do his duty?",
