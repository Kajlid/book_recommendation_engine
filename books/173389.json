  "title": "The Introvert Charismatic: The Gift of Introversion in a Noisy Church",
  "description": "The modern Christian world – most notably in charismatic and evangelical circles – often seems dominated by extrovert behaviour. Those who are easy with exuberant worship, relish large crowds and are recharged by fellowship seem to set the tone. Introverts – those who recharge their batteries in private – can sometimes find charismatic culture a bit shallow, loud, driven or insensitive, but still love the things that God is doing. Those whose faith is at its most meaningful in private worship or one-to-one conversation can easily feel excluded – as if they need to shout before God will move in power. Is introversion a sin to be forgiven, an illness to be healed or an oppression to be defeated? \"It is none of those things,\" emphasizes Mark Tanner. \"Introversion is a creation gift. It is part of the image of God.\" This book will be a means of freedom to those who read it: It is right to worship God with the personality you have been given; the Holy Spirit wants to use introverts; the world and the Church need them – they are a gift.",
