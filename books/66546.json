  "description": "A menacing evil, vile and deadly has come to manifest within the opulent city of Asim-dar! Tasked with what at first seems the simple quest of taking the life of a wealthy nobleman who supposedly stands upon the brink of throwing the world into chaos, Quillan, the Lion of Vashtan, soon finds his straight forward mission far from the easy undertaking he had first envisaged. Encountering everything from a shape shifting wizard to a beautiful slave girl Quillan strides through his pre classical world like an unstoppable juggernaut to produce a fast paced adventure filled with barbaric brutality, fiendish sorcery and squash buckling sword play aplenty. Will the mighty Lion of Vashtan succeed or will the demon god known as Kerberos once more rise up to spread its vile shadow over the world?",
