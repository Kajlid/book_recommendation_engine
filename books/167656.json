  "description": "Book Two of The Wode\n The King of the Shire Wode. That is what they will call you... Home razed by Church edict, loved ones struck down by treachery, Rob is left for dead. Taken by the old druid master into the deeps, Rob survives to emerge as driven leader of a band of tight-knit outcasts, claiming the forest as their own and wielding the Horned Lord’s vengeance with silent, deadly arrows. Gamelyn has fled England, only to return after finding new identity and purpose—but no absolution—on Crusade. When the two boyhood lovers next cross paths, it will be in a brutal, blindfolded game of foxes and hounds, one which pits Templar assassin against Heathen outlaw. When Rob discovers Marion is also still alive, the game turns. History will chronicle Robyn Hood and Guy de Gisbourne as the deadliest of enemies, but the reality is complicated—and infinitely more tragic.First Edition published by Dreamspinner Press, September 2013",
