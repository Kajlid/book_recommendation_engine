  "description": "Failed RV salesman, William Bozwick, thought things could not get any worse, as he slipped into a world of quiet dejection. His only source of joy was applying makeup, putting on a costume and becoming ‘Bilbo the Clown’ to entertain the children at the local hospital.With the aid of an elderly, hotrod-driving nun known as Sister Sledge, he is given the ability to see into the spirit realm. What he sees puts him in a desperate struggle for the soul of a young girl. With no skills, no plan, and little hope, this failure of a man must stop powerful demonic forces from stealing her soul and unleashing an ancient evil upon the earth. The one thing he knows for sure is that, ‘it’s time to start clowning around.’",
