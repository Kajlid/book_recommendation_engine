Do you still have any dreams left to chase? Do you even want to?  Chris’s happily ever after was more of a nightmare than a dream.  But that was a long time ago. These days, she lives a full life. She dates sometimes. Just because she’s in her fifties doesn’t mean she’s forgotten how to have fun. But a love of her own? That might just be a dream too far.

He’s made more money than one man could ever need. He’s rebuilt the bridges he burned with his daughter. He’d even go as far as to say he’s content.  But falling in love again? That’s not even a wish for him, let alone a dream.  Until he meets Chris …  Pick up your copy of this heart-warming romance today and you’ll laugh and cry as these two figure out whether old enough means wise enough to love again—or whether a happily ever after at their age is just a dream too far.
