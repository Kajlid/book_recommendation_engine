  "description": "Single Dad. Second Chances. Meet Mack in the newest STANDALONE novel from New York Times bestselling author Penelope Ward.   They called him Mack Daddy. No, seriously, his name was Mack. Short for Mackenzie. Thus, the nickname. Perfect, right?  So was perfect. The perfect physical male specimen. At the private school where I taught, Mack Morrison was the only man around in a sea of women. Everyone wanted a piece of the hot, single father of the sweet little boy.  I became a woman I didn't recognize, someone riddled with jealousy, because they didn't know that--to me--he was much more.  They didn't know about our past.  He'd chosen my school for his son on purpose, because Mack and I, we had unfinished business.  As my friend, Lorelai, so eloquently put \"Unfinished business between two people who are clearly attracted to each other is like an eternal case of blue balls.\" And I was suffering in pain from my case. I was still intensely attracted to Mack. I tried to resist him, immersing myself further into a relationship with someone else just to protect my heart.  Not to mention, getting involved with a parent was strictly against school rules. But seeing Mack day in and day out was breaking me down. And soon I might be breaking all the rules. Author's note - Told in alternating points of view, Mack Daddy is a full-length standalone novel.",
