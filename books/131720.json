  "title": "Lone Wolf",
  "description": "She lives alone in a ruined house in the middle of a forest. Beyond is a world destroyed by plagues and change... This is the Shifters' World: a world where you can't trust anything, and where some humans may be something more, something different.  So when a strange man appears on her territory, she is right to be wary. She's right not to trust the powerful urges he inspires in her. She's right not to trust her gut instinct that something is amiss.  The first story in a powerfully sensuous, and very explicit, shape-changer series from the co-author of paranormal erotic romances Seduced by Moonlight and The Touch.",
