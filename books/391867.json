  "description": "Jeremiah is a simple man with a love for farming, ill suited for his life as a Soldier. But war has fallen upon the realms of Men, and vicious Northmen have invaded, sweeping aside age-old empires and changing the world forever. After being captured by the enemy, Jeremiah agrees to transport young prince Tobias to a monastery in return for his freedom. The Soldier and the Prince discover a mutual attraction, one that frightens the repressed Tobias but warms Jeremiah within. Their hearts will face battle, pestilence, and certain death before they can find love.",
