How can two people have so little chemistry outside the bedroom when they fit together so perfectly in it?When their friends strand them in a cabin to \"work things out,\" Bri’s not sure whether to kill him or put the industrial-sized box of condoms they find to use. Bottom line—Ryan’s career military and hates the tiny town she loves. He’ll leave, just like everyone else in her life. And if she’s foolish enough to give him her heart, he’ll take it with him.",
