  "description": "The prince is dead, and dragons are the stuff of storybooks.That is, until a great shadow passes over the edge of the Tangled Forest. Rumor sent an intrepid adventurer to a tower in the middle of the woods, and the story he carried back changed Prince Zephyr is alive, and he’s being held prisoner by a giant beast of a dragon.The prince disappeared more than a decade ago, and the kingdom mourned his loss and set his crown on the wheat-blond curls of the young princess. But now, the race is on as every knight in the kingdom and the lands surrounding it have come to slay the beast and bring the prince home.Macarius has travelled from the Western Wastes with nothing but his horse and trusty sword, but he isn’t interested in saving a scrawny prince—he wants to meet a dragon. If he happens to save the prince and take him home, then that will just be a happy accident. Or maybe an annoying one, since Prince Zephyr isn’t nearly as happy to see his savior as he should be.Zephyr and the Western Wolf is an MM fantasy romance featuring one oversized drake, a young mage at the end of his rope (or vines, as it were), and a warrior determined to bring a miracle home for his people... or at least, one miraculous man. It was originally published on Burns & Fawkes's Patreon page as the 2023 Fantasy Romance.",
