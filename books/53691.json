  "description": "\"We couldn't care less about what a tiny minority of people think they know. We own the media, we own the courts. Hell, we own the whole bloody system, everything. There's no stopping what we're doing, Terry. Surely you've understood that by now.\" Just days after Carl Palmer introduces his new girlfriend to his cousin Terry at a family get-together, where he reveals explosive information he has discovered about the pandemic and the vaccines, he disappears into thin air. This forces Terry to delve into the world of 'conspiracy theories' and uncover the truth behind his cousin's disappearance whilst undergoing a soul-searching journey of his own. Exploring the themes of self-empowerment, anti-conformity and loss of innocence, Fangs of Deception is a gripping psychological thriller that offers a dystopian vision of a world in which both the mainstream media and world governments are pawns in a nefarious globalist plan for humanity.",
