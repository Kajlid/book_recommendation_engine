  "description": "\"Compelling! Gripping! The One-Eyed King will play on every emotion you have, taking you on a roller-coaster ride of anger, excitement, tears and victories.\" -APRIL M. REIGN, Amazon Bestselling Author of the HASH series\n\nIn a futuristic world still reeling from the ashes of protracted nuclear warfare, there are levels to humanity. With the planet's scarce resources severely depleted, survival of the fittest is once more the way of the world. But when one ruling order decides who is fit, equality is history and oppression is the new normal. Into this chaotic world hostile to the disabled, a blind orphan boy is thrust. Iori is kidnapped by an unlikely resistance and trained for many years as the ruling order gets closer to discovering their whereabouts. These soldiers literally can't see and this handicap has become their greatest strength. Not only are their other senses heightened to the point of giving them superior fighting skills, but they also represent the only hope for a human race with a peaceful, true and just vision for the future. As he comes of age, Iori will learn that sometimes, it is necessary to fight fire with fire. The One-Eyed King delivers a unique vision of a future society that could resemble our own. Inspired by defining works such as The Road, Gone, the Divergent trilogy, and The Hunger Games series, fans of the sci-fi and dystopian genres will enjoy this frantic and frenetic adventure replete with mystery, believable characters of every moral inclination, and unforeseen outcomes.\"A spectacular, compelling tour de force in the science fiction fantasy genre, The One-Eyed King held me spellbound on every page.\" -EVE PALUDAN, Amazon Bestselling Author",
