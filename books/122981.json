  "title": "The Paranormal Ranger: A Navajo Investigator's Search for the Unexplained",
  "description": "A Navajo Ranger’s chilling and clear-eyed memoir of his investigations into bizarre cases of the paranormal and unexplained over the course of his illustrious career serving the Navajo Nation.Stanley Milford, Jr., was raised with the inherent belief that the supernatural regularly touches our lives. Growing up between multiple worlds and cultures, as a Native American with parents and family of both Navajo and Cherokee descent, he was raised to respect his roots with a firm upbringing in traditions from both tribes.That would serve him well when he joined the fabled Navajo Rangers, who are equal parts police officers, archeological conservationists, and historians, responsible for overseeing the massive 27,000-square-mile Navajo Nation. When Milford first became a ranger, he handled mundane, everyday cases such as cattle inspections and domestic disputes, but that quickly gave way to utterly bizarre and shockingly frequent cases of mysterious livestock mutilations, skinwalker and cryptid sightings, unidentified aerial phenomena, and malicious hauntings.In The Paranormal Ranger, Milford recounts all the stories from the logical, factual, and serious perspective of a law enforcement officer. Far from the tinfoil hat and conspiracy crowd, Milford’s Native American worldview and investigative training provide a chilling, realistic perspective on what logic dictates should not be possible.",
