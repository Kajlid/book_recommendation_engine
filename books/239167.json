She shouldn’t exist. She doesn’t deserve to exist. But her desperate hope for freedom just won’t go away.Then a mysterious foreigner climbs into her tower seeking refuge. He should be terrified of Rapunzel, but he wants to help set her free. What kind of madman would ever want to help someone like Rapunzel?And who is Rapunzel, really? A woman, or a killer?--Hidden: Rapunzel’s Story is the second book in the Destined series, a series of overlapping fairy tale retellings all set in the same magical world.
