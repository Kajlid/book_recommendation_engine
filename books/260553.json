  "description": "The moment she spies the rugged hunk in the faded jeans at the airport, Ellen knows she should run for cover. Instead, she throws caution to the wind and plunges into a sizzling affair with the gorgeous cop. Between romantic dinners, sensual limo rides, and a perfect night of passion, Ellen is living every woman’s fantasy. Until she’s caught in the sights of a deranged stalker, and the divorced single mother is suddenly turning to N.Y.P.D. detective Sam Schaefer for her very survival.…Soon Sam’s taking a bullet meant for Ellen, and racing against time to stop a killer from hitting his target. Keeping Ellen safe will take everything he’s got. Earning her trust could be a mission impossible, as two wary hearts team up for a summer they’ll never forget—and a sizzling adventure that could get them both killed…or give them everything they’ve ever wanted.",
