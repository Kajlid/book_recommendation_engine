  "description": "\"Maybe it's time to set aside intellectualism and celebrate the wonders of things that can't be explained.\"  The Earth has stopped rotating and no one seems to notice or care, except for bleeding-heart super model Venetia DeMille. While Mother Earth begins to fade into a silent death, Venetia clings to hope. She solicits the help of a scientist to help, but no avail.  Not to be hindered in her quest to save the Earth, Venetia sets out on a journey around the world to find like-minded people and caring souls - an exuberant youth, a magical healer and a man of God. Although together they are able to rekindle faith, their effort still does not provide results. It is a mysterious meeting of four horsemen that carry them to the east where they experience a connection to the earth and each other.  Could the forces that gather with their united efforts prove to be the remedy to save the planet?",
