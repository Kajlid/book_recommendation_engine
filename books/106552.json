  "description": "Hemlock has retreated back into the shadows of the Warrens, content, for a time, to gather her strength. But she knows a new enemy is returning to the City--a titan of the past with an ambition to rule with an iron hand. When rogue wizards move against the eastern mountains, it becomes clear that DuLoc's campaign has begun--even if the man himself has not yet arrived. Gwineval marshals the forces of the City to resist DuLoc's plans, but Hemlock feels she must take a different path. She makes a decision to forgo the initial campaign to pursue what she hopes will be a greater boon. But she doesn't anticipate another dark presence standing between her and her goals. She must face this unanticipated foe in order to advance her plans to save the City.",
