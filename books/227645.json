  "description": "George Orwell was first and foremost an essayist. From his earliest published article in 1928 to his untimely death in 1950, he produced an extraordinary array of short nonfiction that reflectedas it was for Yeats to versify or Dickens to invent.\"Facing Unpleasant Facts charts Orwell's development as a master of the narrative-essay form and unites classics such as \"Shooting an Elephant\" with lesser-known journalism and passages from his wartime diary. Whether detailing the horrors of Orwell's boyhood in an English boarding school or bringing to life the sights, sounds, and smells of the Spanish Civil War, these narrative essays weave together the personal and the political in an unmistakable style that is at once plainspoken and brilliantly complex.Contents:The SpikeClinkA HangingShooting an ElephantBookshop MemoriesMarrakechMy Country Right or LeftWar-time DiaryEngland Your EnglandDear Doktor Goebbels - Your British Friends Are Feeding Fine!Looking Back on the Spanish WarAs I Please, 1As I Please, 2As I Please, 3As I Please, 16Revenge Is SourThe Case for the Open FireThe Sporting SpiritIn Defence of English CookingA Nice Cup of TeaThe Moon Under WaterIn Front of Your NoseSome Thoughts on the Common ToadA Good Word for the Vicar of BrayWhy I WriteHow the Poor DieSuch, Such Were the Joys",
