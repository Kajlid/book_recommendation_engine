  "description": "Wyoming WildcatTragedy had sent music superstar Amanda Callaway to the Wyoming mountains to heal. What she found was another battle to fight... Quinn Sutton. Snowbound at his ranch, Amanda was glad Quinn was unaware of her real identity. With a chip on his shoulder the size of the Tetons, the rugged mountain man had no use for the opposite sex -- especially city women who ran in the fast lane. But what Quinn didn't realize was how special his world seemed to Amanda. Battling his misconceptions about her, she vowed to prove she shared the same old-fashioned values... and desires. When he learned who she was, though, would she lose him forever.",
