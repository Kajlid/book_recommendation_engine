  "description": "The gorgeous San Diego, California resort coast of La Jolla is not always what it appears as nineteen year old Paxton Reinhart soon will discover. Paxton has lived a cautious and relatively dull life, never venturing far from his Kansas home. But on April 9th, everything changes as he inexplicably awakens on this beautiful coast, not knowing how he got there or why. He soon embarks on a one day dangerous journey, running from a nameless, power hungry villain through actual locations, all the while drifting between the real world of beautiful beaches with beautiful women and an other-world of strange beasts and melting buildings.It's a one day discovery of self, filled with victory, pain, joy, romance, death and life. A perilous day centered around a most unusual, invisible, growing entity - The Ploncedite. What is it? What is it for? Does it bring death? Life? Both perhaps?",
