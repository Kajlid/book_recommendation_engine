To save her kingdom from the vicious prince, she plans to marry him, make him king, and then murder him, so that she can take the throne herself. But as she grows closer to securing the crown, traitorous desire stirs.Beyond the storm of passion, intrigue, and betrayal, a greater evil rises in a forgotten realm.
