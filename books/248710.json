  "description": "James Baldwin’s final novel is “the work of a born storyteller at the height of his powers” ( The New York Times Book Review ). “Not everything is lost. Responsibility cannot be lost, it can only be abdicated. If one refuses abdication, one begins again.” The stark grief of a brother mourning a brother opens this stunning, unforgettable novel. Here, in a monumental saga of love and rage, James Baldwin goes back to Harlem, to the church of his groundbreaking novel  Go Tell It on the Mountain , to the forbidden passion of  Giovanni’s Room , and to the political fire that enflames his nonfiction work. Here, too, the story of gospel singer Arthur Hall and his family becomes both a journey into another country of the soul and senses—and a living contemporary history of black struggle in this land.",
