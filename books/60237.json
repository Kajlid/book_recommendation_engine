  "description": "Jaime Leighton has had some pretty unremarkable sex in her lifetime. So when she rubs a bottle of wine and a hot, half-naked tattooed man appears in her bathtub, offering three fantasies, he's pretty hard to resist. Dionysus claims to be the Greek god of ecstasy, wine and madness-and he can breathe underwater. Thus begins the best three nights of Jaime's life. They also turn out to be the most dangerous, when the evil djinn who cursed her new sex partner attacks. Now Jaime must come to terms with her growing feelings for the god and break the magic spell inked into his arms before the djinn snatches away both her love and her life.",
