  "title": "To Love An Invisible God",
  "description": "Is it really possible to love a God we cannot even see? Can we really love Him as we love another Person? A Person who can listen to us and respond to us? A Person who can know us far more intimately than any human being ever can?TO LOVE AN INVISIBLE GOD is a book that will take us on a journey of discovery and love. In a very simple manner, it will try to answer some of the questions we may have about having a true friendship with God. It will also cite some examples in the Bible, in the lives of saints and in the author's own spiritual journey.This book will not contain everything that can satisfy those who are searching for answers. I think there is no book that can ever contain all that can be known about God. But a book may, by God's grace, show us a glimpse of Him, and that may be enough to make us search for Him in all the many places He could be found.",
