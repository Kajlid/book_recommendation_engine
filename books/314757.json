  "title": "Owning My Crazy: Learning To Overcome Trauma",
  "description": "Are you a survivor? Do you want to break generational cycles of neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse and/or substance abuse? Do you want to find the best version of yourself? This book can help you with all of these things. Let me tell you how.Who this book is for:This book is for anyone who believes, or wants to believe, that they can find true peace and happiness within themselves. It is for anyone who has ever found themselves asking big questions and finding no answers. It is for anyone looking to heal and truly overcome the hurdles life has thrown at them.Why I can help you:I am not just a girl with a master’s in social work; I am also a survivor. I know that being survivors means that we are left with scars that are sometimes ugly and messy. I know that as we learn to overcome, we find our biggest challenges in our own minds. I know that we create ugly narratives to fit ourselves in a box created by generational trauma. I know what feeling crazy feels like.What this book is not:This book is not a step-by-step guide to healing; it is my story. I’ll bring you along on the ride through my childhood and adolescence. Then I’ll show you what a lousy job I did at making decisions throughout adulthood, when I finally had the freedom to think for myself. My “stinkin’ thinkin’” (as they say in twelve-step programs) was holding me back from truly reaching happiness and peace. Finally, I’ll show you my truth and how I began to acknowledge that I had a lot left to learn. You will see me confronting my own mind and will hopefully be inspired to face your own truths and own your own crazy.",
