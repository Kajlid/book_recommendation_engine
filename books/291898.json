  "description": "They say guys canâ€™t get bullied. Man, were they wrong.    Another lie vicious girls feed to young, impressionable boys when they're growing up. I've been bullied my entire college career. Hunted and haunted by none other than the Sorority House girls on campus.  Three dates. That's all it took.  Three dates with one of their girls and my entire college experience is flushed down the toilet. Forget the public dumping. Forget the humiliating tactics to ruin my reputation. They keep coming for me. Keep gunning for me. Keep wanting to ruin my life.  And now, I find myself wrapped up in another one of their girls. A sweet, innocent, doe-eyed girl.  A girl I'd walk through hellfire and brimstone for, just to have another second with her. A girl I'd withstand torture for, just to hear her voice in my ear.  Even if it's the torture of the entire Sorority House cult.   A Bad Boy Bullied Romance Series I Hate You I Hate You A Little Bit I Hate You A Little Bit More   Note: This is book 1 of a 3 part series. The story will end on a cliff hanger.",
