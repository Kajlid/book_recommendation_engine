  "title": "The Wizard of Roaming Hall",
  "description": "Set in the mythical kingdom of T'yrie Eliese, \"The Wizard of Roaming Hall\" is a rollicking fantasy tale about a young Chantling named Duck Ducaine who has just begun his apprenticeship under the Enchanter known only as \"Eli.\" While out fiddle-faddling one day, Duck bears witness to an amazing natural occurrence that will prove to alter not only his life, but the entire course of the kingdom’s history.Sensing Duck is no longer safe in his tutelage, Eli sends him on a journey to Roaming Hall, where the most powerful magician in all the Land has dwelt in solitude for hundreds of years. Along the way, Duck meets a genteel Dragon, an overworked Dwarf, a history-loving Great Wolf with plans of conquest, and even a monstrous, duck-eating cave worm. Once he reaches Roaming Hall, things unfortunately get worse… much worse.Full of sorcery and swordplay, adventure and danger—not to mention a healthy dose of bald-faced, unabashed humor—and culminating (as all Ben's books invariably must) in a dynamic showdown between the forces of good and those of evil, \"The Wizard of Roaming Hall\" sets the stage for the multi-part, epic \"The Three Kinsmen.\"",
