  "description": "It’s Christmastime. A magical sleigh ride, a fairytale proposal, and Donna is engaged to be married. However, few people make it to their forties without baggage, and Donna is no exception. As if dealing with the fallout of her daughter’s surprise announcement, getting her new business off the ground, and planning a wedding weren’t enough, she has to cope with an ex-husband stirring the pot and an old flame of her fiancé’s with more on her mind than memories. It’s an uphill climb from “Will you marry me?” to “happily ever after” for Donna and the people she loves.",
