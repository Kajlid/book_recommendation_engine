  "title": "Tiger's Heart: The Story of a Modern Chinese Woman",
  "description": "Aisling Juanjuan Shen was born to illiterate peasants in a tiny farming hamlet in China’s Yangtze Delta in 1974. Pronounced useless by her parents because she wasn’t good at planting rice, she became the first person from her village ever to attend college. After graduating with a teaching degree, the government assigned her to a remote and low-paying job that she was expected to hold for the rest of her life. But she wasn’t satisfied—and she bought her way out of her secure position and left for the special economic zones of southern China, in search of happiness and success in the business world, eventually immigrating to the United States. In this memoir, Aisling chronicles her rise from rural poverty to a successful career, illustrating the massive economic and social changes that have taken place in China over the past several decades. Her story is emblematic of a new generation of Chinese women who are leaving the rice paddies and government jobs in order to enter the free market and determine the course of their own lives.",
