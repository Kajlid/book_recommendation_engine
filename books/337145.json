  "description": "1986. If David hadn't missed his train and if Rob hadn't been in the kitchen when his mother was baking a birthday cake, they might never have met. Both found themselves sitting at the same table in the cafe on waterloo station and got talking. There was an instant rapport between them, despite their differences. David twenty eight with a good job and a house all to himself, Rob more than ten years younger and homeless. The solution to the latter seemed obvious... But was David, who'd admitted his homosexuality when asked, just being a good Samaritan or were his motives suspect? And why had Rob left home?",
