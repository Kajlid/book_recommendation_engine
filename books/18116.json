  "description": "It's a new year and a new look for Batgirl as superstar artist Dustin Nguyen joins the creative team! Stephanie Brown's second semester at Gotham U. starts like any other - new classes, new allies, a vigilante stalker - everything a gal could want! But what Gotham City's Batgirl isn't prepared for is the arrival of the mysterious \"Order of the Scythe.\" Who are they, and why have they set their sights on her? \"The Lesson\" begins here! The \"Order of the Scythe\" has drawn first blood, framing Batgirl for a crime she didn't commit. Can she outrun Gotham City's Finest long enough to prove her innocence? The birth of Batgirl's gallery of rogues begins here as \"The Lesson\" continues! Batgirl has been given her first sanctioned Batman Incorporated assignment solving a series of high-profile kidnappings, and she's thrilled! Well, she was - until Robin decided to ride shotgun. Can the Dysfunctional Duo stop fighting long enough to save the children of Gotham City's elite? Patience may be a virtue, but can Batgirl stand still long enough to stop a super-speedster foe? \"The Lesson\" continues as the mysterious Order of the Scythe unleashes its first weapon in their war on Batgirl - Slipstream!",
