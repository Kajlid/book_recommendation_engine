  "description": "What if you were hired to protect one of Hollywood's most valuable assets—and she disappeared?  Richard Braddock is a former Green Beret captain and founder of Star Shield Security Group, a premier celebrity protection company. Married to the woman of his dreams, Braddock is enjoying the best of what success has to offer—until things go horribly wrong. His top client, an A-list actress working for a major studio on a big-budget action movie, suddenly vanishes...along with her Star Shield bodyguard.  With the studio threatening to ruin his career, Braddock scrambles to assemble a team with law enforcement, military, and even criminal backgrounds that will do whatever it takes to find the star before she turns up dead.  Their investigation explores the actress's secret life and uncovers an ingenious adversary fueled by revenge, who forces Braddock to make choices that could haunt him the rest of his life—if he survives.  Using a first-person narrative, in the vein of authors such as Robert Crais and Raymond Chandler, David Elliott draws from his personal experience as a film industry professional and a private investigator to craft a page-turning thriller that delves into the obscure underbelly of Hollywood.",
