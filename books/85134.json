  "description": "When Scott Devin buys a struggling car dealership in semi‐rural Western Australia, the last person he expects to see in charge is a stiletto‐wearing, mini‐skirted foreperson — exactly the distraction a struggling, male‐dominated workshop doesn’t need! But there’s more to TJ Stevens than meets the eye.TJ Stevens has two major goals in life: to preserve her grandfather’s heritage and to protect her teenage rehabilitation program — and she’ll go to any lengths to do it. Scott Devin’s presence is a threat to everything she’s worked hard to achieve, so keeping him at arm’s length shouldn’t be a problem … or will it?",
