  "description": "Close enough to touch... He's their secret admirer, wooing them with phone calls, love letters, and special gifts. From a distance, he admires them. Desires them. Despises them. And when he gets close enough, he kills them all. Close enough to kiss... Adams County, Alabama, is a small, friendly place where everyone knows each other - but not well enough, it seems, because Sheriff Bernie Granger has a serial killer on her hands, a total psycho who first romances, then stalks, kidnaps, and kills his victims. It's Bernie's first big case, a chance for her to prove herself to her new partner, Memphis police detective Jim Norton, but it won't be easy. This killer is uncannily smart. It's as if he knows what Bernie is thinking. And his next move is more than shocking - it's chillingly personal. Close enough to kill... A terrifying game is underway. A desperate hunt has begun. Bernie is determined to stop a twisted serial killer at all costs. But is she getting nearer to catching him - or being drawn ever deeper into his deadly web?",
