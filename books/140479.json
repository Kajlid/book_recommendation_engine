Instead, he finds himself caught in a web of intrigue, plots and conspiracies beyond his wildest imagination. His only hope lies in the company of the unlikely band he has come to associate with. E'El'Gar, a highly chaotic and free spirit pixie, realizes that life isn't just all fun and games any more as danger starts to come at her from all sides. Even with a new set of allies, the highly excited fey's fate is sealed. Eclavarda returns with a vengeance. This time, she is bound and determined to prove herself. But the question is, to whom? Her loyalties are torn as her insight of being used as a pawn only comes too late. This book continues the epic adventures of the Orbbelgguren series.",
