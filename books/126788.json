She wants to think things over, but things are never that simple at her old home town. The two Vampire brothers are still as mysterious as ever, and let's face it, very intriguing to her. But her brother Jeremy looks like he is going to be trouble, and she really does just need a break and time for thought. Seeking for answers to deep questions, Elena finds herself travelling a rather strange detour even for a recently turned Vampire.",
