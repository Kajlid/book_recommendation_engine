I'll probably never write a cookbook like this again, but I can assure you this is a classic that will arm you with the skills to create wonderful meals, shockingly fast.I've taken inspiration from around the world, embracing the flavours that we all love, playing with classic chicken, steak and pasta dishes, looking at Asian-inspired street food and brilliant Moroccan flavours, bigging up mega salads and so much more. I'm basically trying to represent all the types of food that you, out there, are buying into. And these are some of the quickest and easiest meals I've ever done.These recipes have been tested and tested to ensure this book is a reliable companion for you, and hopefully your family too when you pass it down. I think you're going to really love it - I'm so proud of it.It's far and away the most balanced and exciting everyday cookbook I've seen - and if you liked 30-Minute Meals, this will knock your socks off.",
