  "description": "A smuggler stays one step ahead of the law until he's forced to choose between life behind bars or certain death for betraying his ruthless boss. As the 1970's melt into the 80's, Staten Island is loaded with gangsters and wannabes. It's where Tommy, a world-class schemer, smuggles to earn the money he squanders. The Italian gang he's with joins forces with a ruthless Russian, who takes command, enlarging the enterprise. The expansion catches the attention of an ambitious DA, who is about to run for Mayor and despite the intensifying heat, the gang ups the stakes. The DA, embarrassed by botched opportunities to lock up the Russian, obsessively pursues a way to shut down their activities, amping up the risk. Complicit Witness is Dan Petrosini's third published novel.",
