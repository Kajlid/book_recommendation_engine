  "description": "Seeing is believing... The only thing more troublesome than a Cynster man is a Cynster lady who believes love is not her destiny. Famously known in London society as the Matchbreaker, Henrietta Cynster has an uncanny skill in preventing ill-fated nuptials ... not in falling victim to Cupid's spell. But when she disrupts one match too many, she feels honor bound to help dashing James Glossup find a suitable bride for a marriage-of-convenience--a task infernally complicated by the undeniable, unquenchable attraction that flares between James and Henrietta, who continues to believe she will never fall.",
