  "description": "Noxus City is full of criminals, and Nikolai Babin is one of them.He parades as the city’s saving grace, free from the torment his family spreads, while inside, he’s as sick as those he heals.He’s meticulous. Calculated. He uses the shadows to hide his every step. And until now, he’s never made a mistake.That is until he meets her.The one who he was only meant to use.Noxus City is full of innocent faces, and Dominique Jones is one of them. Though she was born into the dark, she uses the power of the sun to blind those to the shadows within her.She seeks more than the world has to offer and has yet to met with anything capable of giving her such.That is until she meets him.The one who was only meant to use her.Two shades of the same darkness, though one is seeking to purge themself from it while the other thrives in it. To allow the desire to win out would mean losing it all.But with everything to gain, it just may be worth it.",
