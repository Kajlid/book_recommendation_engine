  "title": "He's Greater Than You Know - Essays for a Doubting Christian",
  "description": "A doubting Christian challenged participants in a chat room to answer five questions that, to him, made Evangelical Christianity seem incoherent. Internet apologist Phil Weingart responded out of his own wrestling with the faith, and \"He's Greater Than You Know\" is the result. Weingart respectfully declines the pat answers taught in Evangelical circles, finding instead coherent explanations for hard questions from his experiences with God and from practical readings of the words of Jesus and the Apostles. His answers embrace honest inquiry and modern science, honor the historic orthodoxy of the Christian faith, and provide a sound, intellectual basis for a living relationship with a real and active God.",
