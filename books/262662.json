No, I’m a coward. They’ll do whatever it takes to help each other and I’ll simply do whatever it takes to survive, no matter what the cost. But there’s one alien who refuses to accept my outlook on life. As a matter of fact, he’s determined to change my mind.  Dax I know I am the only male who will be able to pull Vivian from the darkness consuming her. Finding an opportunity, I decide to steal her away from the others, if only for a short while. What she needs is adventure, a little fun and excitement to remind her of all the beauty there is in life. I try to tell myself this is all just a game to lift the human’s spirits, but deep in my core I know my feelings for Vivian will change me forever.  Dax and Vivian begin their journey with an innocent enough adventure, but just as they start to find love in one another, an evil crime lord rips the pair apart. Without Dax to light her way, Vivian plunges back into darkness. Her alien mate’s life hangs in the balance and she is forced to fight for both his survival and her own. What lengths will Vivian go to to protect the male she loves? And will her actions prove her to be the true monster in this tale of ALIEN ASCENSION.",
