  "description": "'THE PUNK FACTOR is a kick ass story that will grab your heart in a fierce punk rock grip and not let go. I loved it!'Jennifer Mathieu, author of MOXIE\n\nSeventeen-year-old Frankie is obsessed with what everyone else is thinking. She can keep up with the chat - from feminism to boys with tattoos - but when it comes to her own ideas, it's not so easy to hide her lack of confidence.With the help of her best friend, Haruna, Frankie forms a punk rock girl band to attract the attention of Doc - her spiky-haired, joint-smoking ex-boyfriend. She's got it all sorted; the Instagram page is live, the handmade posters are everywhere, and the band even has a first gig lined up (even if they are playing to a handful of retired bingo fans). But in her efforts to make the band a success and get Doc to notice her, Frankie starts to care less about what he thinks and more about how much she loves making very loud music. She finally feels a glimpse of who she can be, independent of anyone else.Then one day, Doc decides he is going to win her back . . . Punk is nothing without the freedom to be exactly who you want. But what if you're not sure who that is yet? Can you make your own noise when everyone else seems so much louder than you?",
