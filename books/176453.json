  "description": "In the tangled bog city of Nannandry, Priloe Sharpe’s life is worth only what his pick-pocketing skills can buy him. The entire planet of Grünholtz is now one big colonization failure and run completely by rival gangs. Hope of a better life is nonexistent - until the day off-worlders show up in the marketplace with a shiny piece of tech, which Priloe artfully snags. In a race for his life, Priloe must save his sister and somehow leave the planet, risking everything for a new life in the cloud city of Léger Nuage.  Cutpurse introduces Privateer Tales fans to the Tipperary Solar System where Liam Hoffen and his crew plan to make their new home and where they will start a whole new set of adventures. In the tradition of McFarlane’s novellas, Cutpurse provides background and intersecting story line for the next Privateer’s story. Where are Liam and his crew – and will they arrive to save the day?",
