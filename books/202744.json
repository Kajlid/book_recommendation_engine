  "description": "In Sparrow Falls, Louisiana something weird is always going on. Things are never normal and they are seldom peaceful for long. It is a hub of murder and mayhem, ghostly apparitions and just plain weird people.Nick Lange left his hometown behind twelve years ago, dreams of making it big somewhere else looming bright in his mind. What he got instead was a drug habit that led to a long prison sentence for a crime he did indeed commit. Newly released and with nowhere to go, Nick heads home to Sparrow Falls, land of the freakish and the bizarre, with hopes of rebuilding his life in the town he tried to leave behind.Nick’s quiet new life is soon interrupted when he learns about the newest happenings in town. Since August, things have gotten extra peculiar and not long after Nick’s arrival back in town the murders start. Brutal, senseless killings that leave the victims mauled beyond recognition... and partially eaten. The townspeople whisper that it’s something that hides under the bed or lurks in the closet, waiting and hungry.Nick, ever the skeptic, says it’s only a man and that’s bad enough because whoever—or whatever—it is, they’ve got Nick in their sights. Nick’s never been one to back down from a fight and that’s a good thing because as the dark gets deeper, it becomes a vicious game of live or die. One that Nick isn’t sure he can win.Tick. Tick.",
