  "description": "A passion to stand ignites in the hearts of the Alburnium people.... The time has come to band together and stop the evil ruler from taking over Denovo and Wilderland, but the friends of Aloblase are still scattered across the land. Sacrifices will need to be made and promises broken if they hope to keep the cities intact. Alyra and Tarek’s patience wears thin with the lost remnant of Curians hidden in the mountains of Tarest. Locked away in the dungeons, Tarek is ready to bring the mountain down on the stubborn Wisdom Keepers while Alyra hopes to reach a peaceful solution. However, the suspicious Curians have their own way of dealing with trespassers. Lotari and Stitch struggle with the choice to wait for Darnel to make the first move or attack head-on before the evil lord's forces reach the borders of Wilderland. Jerin and Katrina work to fortify the borders of the ancient Halls of Knowledge. Hope that the Curians might soon return are hindered when Racah’s supporters threaten all they’ve worked hard to build in the city of Denovo. Ignited is the fifth installment of the White Road Chronicles and includes the bonus story A White Road Tale novella #4.",
