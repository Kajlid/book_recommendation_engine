  "description": "Christmas is Treva's favorite time of year, especially the preparations -- finding the perfect tree, decorating the house, and making presents for her family. But this year is different. Small things are disappearing, then some of the presents themselves. Treva is mystified, until early one morning she sees a small creature scurrying across the snow, carrying the Christmas pudding. Treva races after it into the forest where her adventures are just beginning. . .Christmas Trolls is a glorious celebration of the season as Treva confronts two irresistible trolls who don't understand Christmas. Jan Brett's exquisite paintings set against beautiful, intricate borders give readers a magical Christmas full of surprises.(Look closely at the borders for glimpses of the trolls' special little helper -- and he's not an elf!)",
