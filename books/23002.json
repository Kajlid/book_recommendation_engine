  "description": "It takes a special kind of soldier to kill a man at a thousand meters. But for Captain Pete Miller, one-third of an elite Army Ranger sniper team, zeroing in is nothing compared to coming out. Pete’s been nursing a year-long crush on team member Mitchell Walsh, but even with DADT on its last legs, he continues to guard his heart and his unit’s cohesion.After all, there’s no room for distraction in the field. Especially on their latest mission, a five-week recon through the ass end of the Colombian jungle. They have orders to assassinate the head of the Morales drug cartel. One bullet, quiet and clean. No firefight, no witnesses, no hint of American involvement.But the mission goes FUBAR when Pete is captured by the enemy. Try though they might to persuade him, he refuses to give up his team. Luckily for Pete, his team refuses to give up on him either, and the mission he thought would cost him his life might instead buy him a whole new future with the man he loves.Download the story, read it here or find it in Don't Read in the Closet, Volume 3 or Don't Read in the Closet: GayRomLit Retreat 2011 Special Edition.",
