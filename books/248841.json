  "description": "This is an anthology of all three books in the Kitty Play Book 1: Candice is one of many pets that her master keeps in his basement kennel for his enjoyment. Tonight she gets to come out to play to prove herself worthy of being a full time house pet. Only taken out once or twice a week, she'll do anything to be picked for service. Book 2: Mila wants to please her master deep in the basement of the Gothic mansion she calls home. But what she doesn't know is she'll be visiting the mating room, a room with tools and corrals to keep their pet lineage going for their master's business. It's an honor to go in the room, so long as she pleases her master, and does her duty. But she shudders at the thought of failing and the unknown that goes on behind closed doors. Book 3: Gia has been a bad pet, spilling water in her cage and now Master is showing her his displeasure with a punishment fitting the crime.",
