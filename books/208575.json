  "description": "Just when you thought Tales From The Crypt couldn’t get any scarier, the Crypt-Keeper, the Old Witch, and the Vault-Keeper return with four more all-new \"fear-y tales\" to frighten the Bejeezus out of you! A man receives telepathic signals from a young beautiful woman, but it all turns out terror-ably wrong in “Glass Heads.” And speaking of dangerous women, wait ‘till you meet “She Who Would Rule the World,” with powers far beyond those of mortal men! She makes the Frankenstein Monster look like a pussycat! Plus a couple of Voodoo tales that’ll make your head spin ― right off! “Chicken Man” and “Voodoo Redeux.” Too scary? Don’t worry, the GhouLunatics are always on hand to get you through the gruesome goings-on!",
