  "title": "Motherhoodwinked - An Infertility Memoir",
  "description": "Born in 1981, shortly after the first IVF baby, Anne-Marie Scully grew up in a world where infertility is a problem everyone assumes can be fixed. Named for the frustration Anne-Marie felt when realizing that becoming a mother was not a given and that IVF was not a guaranteed 'Plan B', Motherhoodwinked documents the pain and the shame of life as an infertile woman. But Motherhoodwinked is more than just another trying to conceive memoir, it is an important social commentary on the impact infertility has on the lives of those going through it and how the modern digital age has both helped and hindered the journey.With heartbreaking honesty Anne-Marie takes us on a journey from her initial optimism and excitement at finally trying for a baby and fulfilling her lifelong dream to become a mother, through to her increasingly complex pregnancy plan, her experiments with holistic therapies, the NaPro program and finally her experience with ICSI and IVF.Sometimes sad, sometimes laugh out loud funny Motherhoodwinked offers both couples going through infertility and their support networks coping skills for how to survive this lonely journey, that actually affects one in six couples.",
