With word that his love Tira and her friend-in-battle Delphinade are imprisoned in darkness, Druid Baytel is torn between love, and loyalty to the Citadel.As cross-currents of missions verge on failure, suspicion undermines devotion, and conflicting loyalties emerge, Baytel's battle-tested Companions unite in response, realizing they must employ all of their intelligence, courage, good humor and loyalty to face forces they do not yet comprehend.And the land itself rumbles ominously.What happened to the Tree Faeries?And where is Baytel?",
