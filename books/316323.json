  "description": "Welcome to Make5WishesHana just doesn’t fit in. At school, she feels like the invisible girl. (“No. Not invisible. Being invisible would’ve been cool. I just wasn’t worth noticing.”) And at home, she avoids her parents’ arguments by retreating to her bedroom, where she spends hours online, playing the part of various cool, smart, sexy, and popular alteregos, and kicks back with her all-time idol and very best (though only in her imagination) friend, rebel rocker Avril Lavigne. One night she runs across a mysterious website called Make5Wishes. Somehow, she can’t click away–and before she knows it, she’s ordered a package guaranteed to make dreams come true. But will it end up being a Pandora’s box? It all depends on the lovable but wily demon inside. Is Hana sure she knows what she wants? And does she know that what you want can be very different from what you get?",
