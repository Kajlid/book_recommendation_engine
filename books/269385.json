  "description": "Sixteen years ago my parents were mysteriously killed and I was plunged into the hell that is the streets of Victorian London. I survived by my wit and talent for fixing and building things and eventually found a home repairing clocks, but my dreams were always haunted by my past. Now, just a month from my twenty-first birthday I have made two discoveries. The man responsible for what happened to my parents, walks the streets of London, protected by an ancient evil, and second, thereâ€™s a power within me that I will use to extract my revenge.",
