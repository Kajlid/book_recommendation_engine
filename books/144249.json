  "description": "In a darkened hall in a plain white box of a building is the painting of a young woman in an old-fashioned frame. It is discovered by Ning, the daughter of an artist, dreaming of becoming an artist. She knows nothing of the woman in the portrait, and yet those intense eyes draw her. It was as if Ning saw through those eyes and noticed the inner vision of the artist who left her mark on the canvas.",
