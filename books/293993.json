  "description": "You’re cordially invited to the wedding of Maximoff Hale & Farrow Keene, and according to Celebrity Crush—the ceremony for this American prince and his tattooed bodyguard is going to be the event of the century.  There will be no wedding crashers.  Including but not limited hateful people, rabid fans, nosy paparazzi, and other so-called media.  There will be no drama.  None whatsoever. Because when you put three famous families and their hot bodyguards together, nothing will go down.  There will be no fighting.  No brawls, fists flying, verbal slingshots, or rifts that tear into craters. Lovers only!  Everything will be perfect.  Nothing will go amiss during the happiest, most anticipated occasion of the year. But then again…  They don't call it the Hale Curse for nothing.
