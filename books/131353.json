  "description": "“Suddenly the sky overhead is alive. From east and southeast, west and northwest, large black birds fly, travelling in their groups of hundreds, swirling, cawing, interweaving, dancing a greeting in the air. The sky is thick black feathered. We watch in awe as they combine and dissipate above our heads, as though we are lying on the bottom of the ocean, looking up at the surface world. Then, without signal or warning, they circle the heart of the wood and land in hidden roosts. Silence falls once more.”After months of feeling lost and burned out, a chance encounter with crows begins an adventure in the dark woods – inner and outer – leading to a strange and powerful initiation.Three-time Nautilus award-winning author Lucy H. Pearce’s previous best-selling book Burning Woman was an initiation of fire, She of the Sea an initiation of water and Crow Moon is an initiation of earth and air, a way back to the heart of ourselves through wild revelation.Strikingly illustrated by the author, with contributions from over thirty women – artists, healers, authors – midlife women who have also been called by the strange magic of crows at decisive moments in their lives.Enter the dark woods. Follow the crow, the moon and the mushroom on a journey of transformation and remembering.",
