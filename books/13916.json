  "description": "Described by The Times on its first publication in 1865 as 'an excellent piece of nonsense', Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has gone on to become one of the most popular books ever written, loved by children and adults alike and translated into over 125 languages.In Tove Jansson, Carroll's classic finds an illustrator worthy of its enchantment and surreal beauty. Jansson is renowned worldwide for her hugely successful books about the inhabitants of Moomin Valley. What is less well known is that she also devoted her unique gifts to illustrating Alice's extraordinary adventures.Over forty years after her interpretation of Lewis Carroll's masterpiece was first enjoyed by Scandinavian readers, Tove Jansson's beautifully realised edition of the original text of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is finally made available to an English-speaking audience.",
