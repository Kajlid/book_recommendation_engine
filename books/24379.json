  "description": "Finding love is finding where you belong.Mackenzie Milcrest–Miss Mac to her students–is a high school English teacher, comfortable with her job, her life, and her place in the world. The only thing she loves more than her students is a good book and a quiet night alone to cozy up and read. She’s happy…Or, at least, she thinks she is.Daniel Evans is a world-famous writer—and for good reason. Over ten years ago, when he was still a teenager, his first book became a runaway hit, and readers have not stopped asking for more ever since. Now, a decade later, he’s rich. Charming. Handsome…He’s also suffering from a massive writer’s block.Desperate to shake things up, Daniel employs the help of his publisher, who only has to pull a couple of strings to get him a front-row seat to his next novel’s setting: a public high school.All he has to do is sit in Mac’s classroom every day and shadow her every move.Strictly in the name of research, of course.The problem is, Mac can’t keep acting like he’s invisible. Not when the pull he has on her grows stronger every second.Falling in love with Daniel Evans is not in Mac’s lesson plan, but can she ignore how beautifully their stories intertwine?",
