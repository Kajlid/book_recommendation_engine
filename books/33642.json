  "title": "The World of Fairies",
  "description": "Mercurial, indulgent, and fickle, fairies dwell in an otherworld that appears to us occasionally...if we are lucky. Gossamer Penwych has seen and heard them, calling out to her--and so, on these pages she can bring them vividly to life. Through the magic of folk and fairy tales, stories of the author's own invention based on traditional lore, and lavish illustrations, we can enter their mysterious universe. Each legend reveals something special about fairy habits and behaviors, and about different types, from bestial in-your-face beings to ethereal, formless spirits. All contain a little lesson learned by mortals who have come in contact with these fantastic creatures. Encounter Star Maidens from the Native American culture; Asrai, nocturnal water spirits from Scotland; changelings, ailing fairy children left in place of stolen human babies; pixies, mischief-makers found mostly in southwestern England; and many others. Every one will charm and enchant you. A Selection of One Spirit Book Club.",
