  "description": "Housing estates, council estates or \"schemes\" as the Scots refer to them are places where you can find a broad cross section of society. There are the salt of the earth folk. People who will cross the street to help a friend, a neighbour and even a stranger. These folk know the true meaning of the word community, to them it is not just a politician’s buzz word but a way of life. This is what happens when you have thousands of people living in close proximity. These are places where everyone knows everyone else’s business. However, in every barrel there are a few bad apples and the same applies to our estates.The Longcroft tales is a series of short stories that deals with those folk that live on the margins within these communities. The drug dealers, addicts, football hooligans, the bent coppers and the misguided. Not always bad people something just down-at-heel or unlucky. As the series progresses I hope to give you a full colour high definition vision of the Longcroft estate and it's many and varied denizens. There will be laughter, tears, highs and lows.I hope you enjoy my tales. The first story, A Good Day, deals with a drug addict who finds himself with a decision to make. Does he commit a selfless act or take advantage of a lucrative opportunity? Why do flash cars keep parking outside? Why are the new neighbours so quiet?",
