  "description": "The story about how Hades kidnapped Persephone when she was picking flowers? Totally false! Zeus made that story up to make himself look better. What else would you expect from a total myth-o-maniac? The truth is, Persephone was trying to escape her overprotective mother, Demeter. King Hades, Ruler of the Underworld, is here to set the record straight.",
