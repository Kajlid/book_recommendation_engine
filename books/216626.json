  "description": "Great Big Schoolhouse is lovingly remembered by generations of American children whose first day at school was undoubtedly made easier by Scarry’s warm, friendly, and comforting classroom. Huckle’s life changes forever as he joins his classmates on the school bus; meets Miss Honey, his sympathetic teacher; and learns the alphabet, new vocabulary, numbers, the days of the week, and the hours of the day. Of course, there’s recess, show and tell, anda few unexpected adventures, too! Young readers are welcomed in, as they’re asked to help some of Huckle’s friends answer Miss Honey’s questions.Beautifully produced, this is the perfect gift for any child approaching school age—and the flip side of the dust jacket hides a fun a Richard Scarry A-Z wall poster.",
