  "description": "School-leaver Skye plays guitar in an all-female Chronic Cramps band. Joining the punk/indie scene is easier than FTM (female to male) transitioning: from Skye to Finn, from girl to transman. 'f2m;the boy within' was the first YA novel about transitioning co-written by an ftm. It has also inspired a comic graphic novel 'The Boy Within' which is currently being created by two transmen Ryan Kennedy & Sam Orchard. 'F2m;the boy within' will be included in the Australian National Library exhibition on significant YA novels in September 2019.",
