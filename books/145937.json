  "description": "Kaylie was just out of high school and still a virgin when she noticed someone following her. Wherever she went, she heard it: the sound of a purring motorcycle behind her. It wasn't always the same guy, but she knew they were always there for him.  Devlin McRae.  He was the head of the local MC club and as mean as a snake. At least that's what people said. She'd waited on him a few times at the diner and he'd always been polite and tipped extremely well. He was gorgeous too, tall, built and blond with boyish good looks. She hadn't minded a bit when she'd felt his eyes following her around the restaurant.  But being followed all the time like this was disconcerting. And lately, the bikes had been getting closer, less secretive, more obvious. What would she do if Devlin ever caught her?",
