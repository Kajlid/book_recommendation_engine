  "description": "Life in London for Lesley was everything that a young woman could desire: elegant clothes, a full engagement book, a wide circle of friends. Yet, on the spur of the moment, Lesley suddenly adopts a four-year-old child.\"If I'd known what I was taking on I shouldn't have done it. . . .\" Little did she realize then that the child, Pat, was to govern the whole course of her life. Leaving her London flat, she takes refuge in a country cottage and here, after an acutely trying period of readjustment, life falls for the first time into its true perspective: Lesley discovers for herself the precious distinction between pleasure and happiness.",
