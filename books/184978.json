  "description": "If you could travel through time and space, what would that power do to you-to your soul? Imprisoned and left to die during WWII, American G.I. Floyd Sandburg finds what could be deliverance in the form of an ancient artifact, the Lens, which allows him to traverse time and space. After catching the attention of the Organization, a mysterious group that may run governments from behind the scenes on Earth, Floyd uses the Lens and crash-lands in an incredibly strange world. Separated from the Lens, Floyd must evade capture and a gruesome death at the hands of hedonistic, bloodthirsty giants and the extra-dimensional entities who control them...the same who run the sinister Organization. Floyd's very soul hangs in the balance as he is thrown into the middle of a conflict spanning ages. He questions reality, convinced he is dreaming while suffering a slow death in that Nazi prison. Can his brother, Chase, convince him what is real and help him find the truth in time to save not only Earth, but his own soul? \"What has been, will be...\" Whichever path he takes, his choice will have consequences of Biblical proportion.",
