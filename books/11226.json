  "description": "No one can be like Jesus yet we can all be like Jesus. In all of history there has never been--and never will be--anyone like Him.In this extraordinary book, devout Christian and internationally acclaimed speaker, author and sports executive Pat Williams reveals the pure essence of Jesus. Although Christianity teaches that Jesus is God, most people lose sight of His humanity. Through the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, Williams helps us understand who Jesus really was--His mind, His wisdom, His love, His humility, His courage and His goodness. The story of Jesus' life is told powerfully and dramatically and the meaning of his teachings is compellingly brought home through contemporary stories of people who exemplify what it means to be like Jesus.The Jesus of this book is truly the Jesus who lived and identified with us and with whom we also can identify. Williams provides persuasive and provocative insight on how to truly be like Jesus through His teachings and this living example of genuine love, forgiveness, prayer, obedience, service, humility, integrity, leadership, and more.This uncomplicated and fascinating work will enable readers to learn from Jesus' life, understand his words and build his traits and character qualities into their lives. The quintessential book on how to live a better life and create a positive and lasting effect on the lives of others, How to be Like Jesus may be the discovery of a lifetime.",
