  "description": "W. C. Tuttle (November 11, 1883 â€“ June 6, 1969) was an American writer who sold more than 1000 magazine stories and dozens of novels, almost all of which were westerns. Lucky Pardners book Lucky Corrigan rode into El Pintado late one afternoon and took one of the rooms above the saloon. He didn't look much like the man who had walked to the main gate of the penitentiary only two weeks before. The hundred dollars he had been given when he came out had multiplied on a roulette wheel, and he had bought himself a new outfit of clothes, plus a horse and saddle. Before his arrest Lucky Corrigan had been reputed the best bronc rider in the state, a top-hand with cows, and also a top-hand in a fight with gun or fist. His name was not a nickname.",
