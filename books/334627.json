  "description": "In this groundbreaking collection Cecilia Tan blurs the very definition of sexuality and redefines the future of erotic fiction.She delves deep into the world of dark fantasy in a powerful collection of stories that interweave the supernatural and science fiction with the fantasy of daydream; she brilliantly combines noir erotica at its most potent with startling sensuality to shatter the physical and emotional boundaries of sex. These stories, some never before published, range in style and texture from the warmth of magical realism to disturbing modern gothic -- showcasing a rich and varied exploration of sex in worlds that might be earthtly -- to tales of the human fantasies and magical dreams to which we all succumb. From the critically acclaimed, otherwordly \"Pearl Driver\" to \"The Game,\" all of Tan's stories celebrate the body and sex, revealing the positive emotions behind even the darkest desires.",
