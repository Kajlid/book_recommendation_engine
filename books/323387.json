  "description": "\"Lost paradise: from mutiny on the bounty to a modern-day legacy of sexual mayhem, the dark secrets of Pitcairn island revealed\". Other editions of the same book are entitled 'Pitcairn, Paradise Lost' and 'Trouble in Paradise'.Pitcairn Island - remote and wild in the South Pacific, a place of towering cliffs and lashing surf - is home to descendants of Fletcher Christian and the Mutiny on the Bounty crew. \"In 2000, police descended on the British territory to investigate an allegation of rape of a fifteen-year-old girl. They found themselves speaking to dozens of women and uncovering a trail of child abuse dating back at least three generations. The trials would tear the close-knit, interrelated community apart, for every family contained an offender or a victim-often both. The very future of the island, dependent on its men and their prowess in the longboats, appeared at risk. The islanders were resentful toward British authorities, whom they regarded as colonialists, and the newly arrived newspeople, who asked nettlesome questions and whose daily dispatches were closely scrutinized on the Internet.",
