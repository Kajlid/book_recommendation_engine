  "description": "Normally the brilliant young artist Bryan Touhey liked women to be disturbing. But no quite as disturbing as his strange and lovely companion at lonely Pellings Manor. Sinister enough was her abject enslavement to the master of the manor, the handsome, cold-hearted Colonel Hawkins. Even more disquieting was her passionate belief in the occult. Her dark experiments in black magic. The uncanny ways her prophecies had of coming true. No wonder Bryan felt a chill run through his body the night she held out her arms to him. Did she want him as her lover, or her victim?",
