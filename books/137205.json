  "title": "Great Change for Life",
  "description": "I've rarely seen books telling people what must really happen to a person wanting great change for life, one bringing true righteousness, the way of the God of the Bible, one working for every kind of change, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and physically, for an end result of righteousness, peace, and joy, in the Holy Spirit, a condition necessary in the kingdom of God. It's about change that lasts forever and keeps one safe forever. Great Change For Life inspires everlasting change in the heart for those who truly want change. It may promote fear on the one hand but love on the other, as two feelings needed in the right order, to instill hope for a future life. Great Change For life, I believe, will bring real spiritual results to the life of a sincere and serious reader.",
