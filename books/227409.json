  "description": "A continuation of the series, the characters in the book have gone through life changing experiences, some it has changed for the better, some for the worst? How are these characters dealing with and coping after these life changing events? How has Christina recovered from being raped at a party? How is Michael dealing with the summer months being homeless? So many things have happened since the first book, it's only fitting that you read part 2 to the series of The World We Live In. This is a book where these characters continue to chronicle their lives and the struggles they deal with on a daily basis.",
