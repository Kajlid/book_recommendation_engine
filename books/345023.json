  "title": "One Marriage and Three Weddings",
  "description": "Although Harry Sanderson has lived on a ranch in northern New Mexico with Mike Pruitt for many years, he still doesn’t know how to describe their relationship—even to himself. Are they live-in lovers? Partners? Boyfriends? There isn’t a word to adequately describe their mutual devotion and his quiet, deeply held feelings for Mike. Mike is no help. He thinks that what they share is a marriage, but Harry knows better. Weddings aren’t for the likes of men like them… until a gay bar, missing lube, and a drag queen show him that he might be wrong.",
