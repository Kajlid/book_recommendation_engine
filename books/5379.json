  "description": "Michaela knew it was a stupid idea to stay at her lover’s lake house just days after being dumped by the woman, but she found herself there anyway. The trouble is that she isn’t the only visitor – Trisha, another of Michaela’s lover’s conquests has invited herself around, just when Michaela wants to be alone. Worse, this feisty newcomer seems to delight in pushing Michaela’s buttons and soon she doesn’t know whether she wants to strangle Trisha – or kiss her. Then there's the distraction of the weird lights over the lake at night, and the haunting sound of a child's laughter, when as far as they know, there isn't a child for miles. Michaela's convinced something is going on and Trisha is looking at her like they should find out what. But what happens when two headstrong women start digging up long-forgotten secrets and can they pull together long enough to survive finding out?",
