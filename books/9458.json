Scorching hot trouble wrapped up in a drool-worthy package.And he’s looking at me like I might be his next meal.But I’m almost free of my toxic marriage and have sworn off men entirely. So all I see when I look back is temptation served up with a heaping side of heartbreak.The man is hard to trust—and even harder to resist.Make that impossible. Because Theo is persistent. And no matter how hard I try to freeze him out, he melts my icy exterior and pulls apart all my defenses.Over a drink in a small town bar, I blurt out my deepest, darkest secrets. Then I spend the singular hottest night of my life with him.He worships my body. He makes me blush. I come alive beneath his hands.Then I tell him to forget it ever happened. I want simple, and with him it all feels complicated.It was supposed to be a one-time thing.A secret.But that little plus sign is going to make this secret impossible to keep.",
