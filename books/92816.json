  "title": "Poco Bueno",
  "description": "POCO BUENO is the story of every man's fantasy - escaping the life-numbing prison of his nine-to-five existence. Stokes is a 31-year-old executive in the lucrative Texas oil business. His marriage to the boss's daughter is on the skids and his true love, an over-restored 70-foot Hatteras fishing yacht, has him panicking in debt. Following his heart, and the naked-truth of his fun-loving, boat captain sidekick, Jean Paul, the two fishing buddies throw caution to the wind on a quest for genuine adventure and meaning. Like the ever-churning margarita blender on board the boat, Poco Bueno is a crazy blend of thirty-something angst, bikini-clad willful women, testosterone-fueled antics, and off-the-charts fishing. Based on the very private, but oh-so-real, million-dollar Port Oâ€™Connor Offshore Invitational Fishing Tournament held off the coast of Texas, this book might very well be the next great American western, albeit a watery one! Yes, this is a novel about fishing - fishing in one of its most savage and primordial forms - but it is really a story about the ultimate inevitability of what life serves up and our ability to eat well at the feast.",
