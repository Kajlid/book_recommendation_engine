  "description": "Hunter Damon got jilted at the altar and fired from his job within 60 seconds. With his assumed ‘perfect-life scenario’ now destroyed, Hunter takes a long cathartic drive before getting a hotel room hundreds of miles away. Waking up the next morning, Hunter realizes there’s nothing left for him back in his hometown, and decides to keep going on what becomes a metaphorical and literal Odyssey. But he’s not alone on his journey. Along the way, Hunter is joined by the spirit of his dead father, who pops-in periodically to offer sage advice, observations from the Other Side and other Universal wisdoms. With no plan, and little direction, Hunter Damon unknowingly relies on fate and the open road to deliver him to his ultimate destiny.",
