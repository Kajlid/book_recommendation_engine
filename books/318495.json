  "description": "The tiny town of Indigo, Texas, is the perfect setting for China Bayles to teach a “Colors to Dye For” workshop. With artists flocking to the countryside in growing numbers, Indigo is coming back to life. Only one person stands in the way of the town’s revival: longtime resident Casey Ford, who has decided to sell his profitable mining rights. Once the deal is done, Indigo will be dead and buried. But when Ford winds up dead himself—from a shotgun blast—China, along with her best friend Ruby, embark on their own investigation into the murder. Before long, it becomes chillingly clear that Indigo is a town with more than its share of dark secrets—secrets that someone thinks are worth killing to keep.",
