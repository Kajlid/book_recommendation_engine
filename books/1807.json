  "title": "Little Red Hood",
  "description": "A minimal, edgy, and hugely entertaining retelling of the story of Little Red Riding Hood including a style of illustration that falls somewhere between graffiti and high artStylish and very funny, this book retells the famous story in an unexpected way. The wolf is still big and bad, but he also happens to be really, really dumb. Little Red Hood questions the wolf's personal hygiene before tricking her predator into his demise. This is one savvy little red hood.",
