  "description": "Saturday Night Cocoa Fudge is the coming-of-age story in an era of bobby socks, poodle skirts and the freckled-faced girl that wore them. It's also about the Deep South and sweetly flawed women who taught her what she was meant to be and what she was not meant to be. Their corner of the world was filled with folklore, superstition, and mystical ideas. Her grandmother believed and practiced most of these, passing them onto the next generation. The little girl's life was populated with strange relatives, quirky neighbors and mysterious bible verses that could stop the flow of blood. Being a member of this bizarre family made life worth living. These people were so fiercely loyal in their love for her, for each other, she felt they deserved to have their story told. \"Gloria has written some southern style, real to life episodes that are sure to entertain you in her Saturday Night Cocoa Fudge. Be careful how much you laugh - they could have happened to you.\" - Dusty Richards, Spur Award Winning Author\"With wit and wisdom, Gloria Teague takes us back to the innocent days of childhood in this delightful little book peopled with glorious eccentrics.\" - Charles W. Sasser, author of God in the Foxhole and Devoted to Fishing.",
