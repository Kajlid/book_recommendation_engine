  "description": "The first full-length volume of poems in a decade by former poet laureate of the United States Donald HallIn The Back Chamber, Donald Hall illuminates the evocative, iconic objects of deep memory—\"a cowbell,\" \"a white stone perfectly round,\" \"a three-legged milking stool\"—that serve to foreground the rich meditations on time and mortality that run through his remarkable new collection. While Hall’s devoted readers will recognize many of his long-standing preoccupations—baseball, the family farm, love, sex, and friendship—what will strike them as new is the fierce, pitiless poignancy he reveals as his own life’s end comes into view. The Back Chamber is far from being death-haunted but rather is lively, irreverent, sexy, hilarious, ironic, and sly—full of the life-affirming energy that has made Donald Hall one of America’s most popular and enduring poets.",
