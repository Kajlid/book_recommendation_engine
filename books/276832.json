  "description": "If history repeats itself, the future may come more than once.Three generations after the end of the famines and plagues that were the end of history now known as 'The Elide,' when the Long Wars are little more than legend, a depopulated world has renewed itself again.The earth's abandoned colonies in the heliosphere are flourishing and independent, while the 'remnant' peoples of the earth have reorganized under weakened governments without armies.Trade between the outer nations and the earth has increased steadily as fears of lingering viruses fade and the demand by the former settlements for the earth's natural resources and raw materials like wood, fertile soil, and specific minerals, continues to grow.In a mere three weeks of the year 2162, John Holt, an aging paladin in the now dwindling Order of Pelagius, those sworn to defend surviving civilization, attempts to keep his own honor while fulfilling his duty and resolving past mistakes, even as he confronts his own future.Called upon by a Wilmer Wright, a former knight and now local sheriff, to solve the mundane murder of a cattleman in New Hampshire, John is beguiled once more by the sheriff's daughter, Glenys, as he finds himself entangled in the breaking of a local slave trade, snared by the correcting of a wrongful death he may have caused, and obligated to investigate another.Unknowingly at first, he must confront a greater power working to dominate the Myriad nations of the earth and the independent states of the heliosphere, even as a previously vanquished foe seeks revenge amidst a clash of history and circumstance, using railguns, railroads, dirigibles, steam trucks, and river barges, and with the help of a horse named Rosie.",
