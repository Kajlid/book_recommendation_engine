  "description": "One lucky man would win her hand... A lady of London breeding, Emma Van Court never expected to be left widowed and penniless in the Scottish village of Faires. But when a fortune is promised if she remarries, the pretty schoolteacher finds Faires' motley assortment of eligible men scrambling for her attentions from the local cowherd to an obnoxious baron!  One sweet kiss would seal their love...  James Marbury, Earl of Denham, was urbane, sophisticated....and utterly at odds among the muddy roads and thatched roofs of Faires. He had come after hearing of his cousin Stuart's passing and was exasperated to find his maddening, tempestuous love for the widowed Emma was as strong as ever. With bachelors coming out of the woodwork to woo her, James sees only one solution offer himself to her as a temporary husband...even if secretly he longs to make his \"I do's\" last a lifetime.",
