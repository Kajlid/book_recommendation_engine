  "description": "A war for resources is raging in Southern Sudan. Tribal warriors, Janjaweed raiders and foreign mercenaries struggle for power over the oil-rich lands. Corporate greed fuels the conflict as oil companies scramble to secure vital resources. In the name of profit, villages burn, children starve and refugees are slaughtered. When PRIMAL operatives interdict an arms shipment bound for Khartoum they find themselves snared in a battle to save a fledgling nation. Bishop and Mirza wage a guerilla campaign, challenging Chinese influence in the region. The response is brutal and the PRIMAL team find themselves pitched against a capable and well-resourced adversary. The conflict drags them from Sudan to Shanghai, then back to Abu Dhabi before vengeance is finally realized.",
