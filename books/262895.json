He has no time for romance and doesn’t think he needs it. He applies to Celestial Mates, willing to take the first available female, even a flat-faced, ugly human.  What he gets is a woman whose mind challenges him and patience humbles him.  He brought her to his planet under false pretenses. Now he hopes he can make it right before she leaves for good.  This is a stand-alone story with a growly, sweet alpha, one stubborn human woman, a HEA, no cheating and no cliffhangers.",
