  "description": "My once perfectly orchestrated kingdom is crumbling and it’s all because of her. Rory may have disappeared, but like a flame, light will always shine brighter in darkness.She grew up believing she only ever had herself, and maybe at one time that was true, but not anymore. She’s one of us now. I may be on the outs with the hellhounds but that doesn’t mean she’s allowed the same generosity.The pieces of our story are as flawed as they are fragmented but not unfixable. There is power in being broken.I will find her, even if that means I have to do it alone. Rory may have given up on us but that doesn’t mean we’ve given up on her.We stick together. That’s our rule. Our law.BROKEN HEIR is the highly anticipated follow-up to Shattered Princess and should be read after book one.",
