  "description": "Since childhood, Mallory McCabe has dreamed of falling in love with a hero. And then one saves her life. He’s honest…and blunt. Deadly, but filled with pain. Overpowering, yet ever so gentle with her. Oh yes, she’s found her hero. Taking him to her bed is simply…right. As is losing her heart.  How could she have known he’d want nothing more to do with her?  His indifference hurts. She vows to forget him…then he buys the land next to hers.  Released early from prison, all Sawyer Ware wants is to move to the city and get his life back together. But when a violent gang targets his police detective brother, Sawyer puts his future on hold. After a decade as a Navy SEAL, he won’t—can’t—walk away when someone he loves is threatened.  His task might well be deadly. He sure can’t afford to get involved with a woman—especially his captivating neighbor. Although he hungers to be near her, to enjoy her clear laugh, her easy friendship, and the peace she brings wherever she goes, a relationship is absolutely out of the question.  Why won’t his heart obey orders?",
