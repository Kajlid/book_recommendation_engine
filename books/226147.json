  "description": "One man may be plenty ... but two is the perfect fantasy.  Ever since my best friend scored two gorgeous, brawny brothers who attend to her every need, I’ve been on the lookout for my own twin beasts.  Enter Alex and Lucas Wolf. Huge, identical specimens of male perfection. Easy on the eyes and even better in bed. Double the pleasure, double the ... aggravation!  Stubborn, domineering, and way too bossy. I don’t need that. I'm more than capable of running my own life so I decide to have my fun and move on ... except the twins don’t agree with my decision.  Especially when I’m suddenly in danger, and the Wolf brothers decide they’re the only ones who can keep me safe. I may survive the threat ... but with both of them guarding me day and night, can I withstand the temptation?  This is a super hot MFM ménage romance with a guaranteed happy ending. Though it’s the second book in a series, each story stands alone. Get cozy and enjoy!",
