  "description": "In AMERICAN ON PURPOSE, Craig Ferguson delivers a moving and achingly funny memoir of living the American dream as he journeys from the mean streets of Glasgow, Scotland to the entertainment capital of the world. Along the way he stumbles through several attempts to make his mark-as a punk rock musician, a modern dancer, a bouncer, a construction worker and a stand-up comedian.To numb the pain of failure, Ferguson found comfort in drugs and alcohol, addictions that eventually led to an aborted suicide attempt. (He forgot to do it when someone offered him a beer.) But his story has a happy ending: in 1993, the washed up Ferguson washed up in the United States, which from the age of 7 he had always seen as a beacon of goodness and possibility.Finally sober, he landed a breakthrough role on the hit sitcome The Drew Carey Show, which eventually led to his current night job as the host of The Late Late Show on CBS. By far Ferguson′s greatest triumph was his decision to become a U.S. citizen, a milestone he achieved in early 2008, just before his command performance for the President of the United States himself at the White House Correspondent′s dinner. In AMERICAN ON PURPOSE, Craig Ferguson talks a red, white and blue streak about everything our Founding Fathers feared.",
