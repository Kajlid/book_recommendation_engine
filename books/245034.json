  "description": "After 9-year-old Emmy and her 5-year-old brother Leo go down a mysterious slide, they are magically transported into a land inhabited by ordinary looking beings, each with a unique power to transform objects. The siblings discover that Funville is full of one never knows when something will be shrunk, copied, turned into an elephant, or erased! The pair have fun creatively solving Funvillian problems and learning a thing or two about themselves in the process.While on the surface, Funville Adventures is just a fairy tale, the powers of the Funvillians are a vehicle for introducing children to the concept of functions. Each power corresponds to a transformation such as doubling in size, rotating, copying, or changing color. Children are introduced to the mathematical concepts of invertible and non-invertible functions, domains, ranges, and functionals without mathematical terminology.“You too will want to visit Funville, a delightful land where magical and strangely mathematical powers run rampant!”-Jordan Ellenberg, author of How Not to be Wrong\"Mathematical words can sound scary, but the concepts they describe are Funville Adventures proves this so! See how inherent and natural the powerful ideas of function, correspondence and matching, invertibility, commutativity, identity, and degree are and do so without reading one lick of such jargon! Each and every one of our youngsters is a budding mathematician possessing the play and inventiveness of ideas to explore and thoroughly enjoy the playground of deep mathematics. This book invitation for us all to play!”-James Tanton, MAA Mathematician at large",
