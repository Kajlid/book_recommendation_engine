  "title": "Yildun: Worldmaker of Yand",
  "description": "On the planet Yand orbiting Yildun, the second star on the tail of Ursa Minor below the Polaris tertiary, lives a peaceful but fierce species of empathic, winged humanoids. Yanara’s worldmaker power is her planet’s last defense against the K’tul, a savage intergalactic invader. But her adolescent daughter’s maiden manifestation of her inherited trait threatens to null Yanara at the worst possible time. Will their world survive? How?From the Author, What I Like About the Book:The characters! Yanara, the protagonist, is a kick-a—celestial wizard, funny, witty, surprising. I allowed her to narrate her story, and she allowed me to come along for the wild ride. Her spouses, Mandolen and Frost, are spicy. Their five kids are amazing, one a worldmaker, another a mage, a third a pathfinder, the fourth a future king, and an adopted silverblood. Along with their menagerie of three wolves, a shibal cat, two snowfoxes, a golden eagle, and a lightning dragon (the “lightning” part is essential). Their aerial fighting team, the Furies, their mage team, the Dragoons.The romance and the paradigm of marriage and family. On Yand, marriage is what you put in your marriage contract. Non-binary, multi-racial families are common.Themes of profound courage and sacrifice at the brink of genocide are explored by the main plot of war. I drew from personal experiences to describe the war's devastation to the world and its people, and it was painful to write. Cathartic? Yes, to a measure. No, because plenty more awaits to be told—The world is vivid and exotic, inviting you to dive in and indulge—The story has extensive dialog and exciting scenes and is brilliantly illustrated by Ms Lily Dormishev.",
