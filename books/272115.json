  "title": "Angel Spirit of Retribution",
  "description": "An innocent born with a purpose replete with an inner being and special powers. It is a very different sort of beginning, compounded by the fact that he is unaware that he is an angel and 'chosen'. Think 'Columbo' and 'The Twilight Zone' with sprinkling of 'Touched by an Angel', and King Tutt's tomb. It is a very different adventure of international crime and massive criminal organizations at war, all bent on controlling evil and monetary domination. Add to this, romance, intrigue, suspense, high technology with near sentient computers, all done in the absence of any forms of sex or bad words, and the 'white hats'...well...The 'white hats' as in all scripts, are in conflict with those dressed in black, and there are victories, as well as losses....",
