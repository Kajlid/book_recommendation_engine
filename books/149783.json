  "description": "What did the Dalai Lama say to the pizza guy from Brooklyn? Make me one with everything! It's a familiar joke, muses Lama Surya Das, but it holds a profound truth: that in addition to inner peace, meditation is a path for all-inclusive connection. With Make Me One with Everything, he invites us to experience this expansive dimension of the dharma through the art of intermeditation. If you've ever felt at one with something--your beloved or your child, a wooded trail, a favorite song--then you've experienced intermeditation, teaches Surya Das. Based on Tibetan Buddhism's core insights into the deeply connected nature of who we are, intermeditation offers both new and experienced meditators a fresh new way to commune with every moment on and off the cushion in oneness with our partners, our family and friends, our enemies, those in need near or far, our higher Selves, and Nature itself.",
