  "description": "Taking a break from the chilling, suspenseful stories that the 'Tales From The Backwoods' typically offer, 'An Unlikely Angel' is well suited for all ages and remains one of my all-time favorites. The story takes place during the childhood of Ethan Wolfe, a favorite character from my 'Off Grid' series. I hope that you take the time to indulge in this short read. I am sure you will enjoy. Thank you kindly. ~Backwoods~",
