  "description": "Ingrid Fairheit - mysterious and adventurous heroine from the illustrious and enchanting Podunk town of Dust Veil, Tennessee. Sometimes labeled as brusque, but those claims are completely without merit. Special features include a strong affinity for food, acquired sense of humor, and a radiant, glowing personality to go along with matching glowing eyes. My favorite pastimes used to consist of hanging out with best friend Lesia and secretly pining over other best friend Ty, but ever since I was assaulted by two jerks with a magic space rock, I've had to pick up a few new hobbies - like being harassed by old ladies, studying ancient cultures (human and otherwise), and learning the art of transforming my body into a weapon of vengeance. Now, if I could only get my drunk Aunt off the floor long enough to tell me the truth about my family history and my dad's strange origins. The shadows of Earth's past are slowly lighting up for me.",
