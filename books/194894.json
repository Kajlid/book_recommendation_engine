  "title": "Never Before",
  "description": "it’s something we all seek, and those lucky enough to find it know the true power it possesses; but in this often-disconnected world, it can be exhausting and near impossible to form lasting relationships. Lily Stone and Ryder Bishop are two fragile souls with a shared past of tragedy and pain who find themselves irrevocably drawn to each other. When Lily, a twenty-something editor’s assistant at Jagged Edge Magazine, meets Ryder, an urbane, ruggedly handsome venture capitalist in his thirties, their connection ignites. The intensity of their chemistry binds them together in a passion that’s unlike anything either have ever experienced. Regardless of their commitment to each other, one secret threatens to tear them apart as Ryder struggles with a piece of his past that binds them together on an even deeper level—a secret that could destroy the woman he loves. Never Before explores themes of childhood trauma, staggering sexual awakening, and the healing power, peace, and safety of real love.",
