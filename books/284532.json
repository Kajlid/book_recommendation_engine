  "description": "The Billionaire Book Club Questionnaire  \n#1: Who is your least favorite character in the book?\n Me—Caplin Hawkins. I am an absolute idiot.  \n#2: Who is your favorite character?\n Gorgeous, addictive, insanely challenging Ruby. She’s smart, driven, self-confident, and so beautiful, she makes my chest ache.  \n#3 What is your biggest takeaway from the story?\n Ruby Rockford and I are meant to be. I just have to prove it to her.  For the entirety of my adult life, I’ve been content. Content in my single lifestyle, content in my stressful-but-extremely-successful job as the main corporate counsel for almost every Fortune 500 company in North America, and content in my playful, spontaneous ways.  I had no idea it was possible for someone to change my mind.  The endless women and work are no longer enough, and just as Ruby Rockford told me—it’s about time I grow up.  It’s going to take a strategic attack from more than a couple brilliant minds to win her affection, but luckily, I know exactly where to find the right guys for the job… \nThe Billionaire Book Club.\n  It’s safe to say that I, Caplin Hawkins, the man most women would call The Ultimate Player, have finally met my match, and man oh man, has my end game changed.  I’m coming for you, Ruby. And soon, you’ll be coming for me, too.",
