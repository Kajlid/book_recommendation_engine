  "description": "During the final stages of construction of the Olympic stadium in London, England, an ancient text written by the husband of The Virgin Mary is discovered. Christians around the world rejoice as rival religions defend their dogmas in the face of miraculous events ascribed to the Holy Trinity. Tens of thousands of people around the world are bestowed with a divine blessing to recite their lineage directly to one of the twelve disciples. The Catholic Church reacts and tries to control the facts as other world leaders struggle to take actions that would benefit their own positions. The text, quickly named “The Book of Joseph” sends shock waves around the globe.With the backdrop of the Olympics and the world harmony they instill, God unleashes His wrath upon mankind as promised in the Book of Revelations and does so unlike any theological prediction. For the few who heed the dire warnings, there is peace; for the rest…May God have mercy on their souls.",
