  "description": "THEIR LOVE IS UNDENIABLE… Happily married for four and a half years, Beau and Ethan Walker are ready for the next phase in their lives. They want what so many people dream of: A baby.  THEIR COMMITMENT IS UNWAVERING… Expanding their family with a tiny bundle of joy isn’t as easy for them as it is for the rest of the Walker clan. However, they have options and they’re willing to do what it takes because they’ve learned that the things worth fighting for aren’t always easy, but they are definitely worth it.  THEIR STRENGTH WILL BE TESTED… Despite their deep desire and their endless efforts to start a family, there are outside forces working against them. Some they can see, others they can’t. Every step forward seems to take them two steps back.  Only during their darkest moments do Beau and Ethan realize their true strength comes from the most important things they have: love, family, and each other.  BEAU is the sequel to ETHAN (Alluring Indulgence, 5). While it can be read as a standalone since it occurs nearly five years after Beau and Ethan are married, it is recommended that you read ETHAN to understand the true strength of these two men and the infallible bond of the Walker family.",
