  "description": "Anna James dreamed of only two things in life: to read books and to not die.The day she is offered a scholarship to study literature at the beautiful, exclusive and gothic Endymion College is the happiest day of her life, but soon after arrival, Anna finds it is nothing like the brochure.Instantly thrust into a dangerous conspiracy, sent to live in a haunted dormitory with a captivating rival, Anna struggles to keep control of her only chance at a better life and to maintain her already tenuous grip on reality.Things soon go from bad to worse when a s√©ance goes awry, and finding herself pursued by a terrifying spectre, Anna finds comfort and a kindred spirit in her professor of literature: young, devastatingly handsome and completely off-limits.Anna must find a way to fight both her desire and a relentless supernatural force out for blood, all while completing her work on time to hold on to her precious scholarship.Darkly humorous, crushingly awkward, deeply romantic, Endymion College: A Lesson in Love and Death is a celebration of the books we love and an action-packed, supernatural, feminist, horror story all rolled into one.",
