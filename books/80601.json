  "description": "A fascination with words is the culprit for this bookâ€™s publication. Long nights reading and studying the works of others is what sparked the creative flow. This piece of work is a collective outlet for pain, curiosity, love, hate, awe and confusion. The mere fact that words can be carefully (or mindlessly) strewn together to form timeless art is the reason this book came to be.  This is a tiny chapter in my life story. This is present time, present emotion and present vision. This is a glimpse inside the darkness, a peek toward the pinhole of light. This is the search.",
