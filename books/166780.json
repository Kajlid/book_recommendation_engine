  "description": "A Woman's Secrets. A Man's Search.An Unexplored Realm Of Pure Pleasure. . .Pride. Power. Passion. They are the hallmarks of the shapeshifting Chanku--although not every member can immediately accept these gifts. Some, like Eve, must learn to love themselves before they can fully embrace their heritage. Eve's journey takes her far from Montana and her mate, Adam. What she finds in Florida's steamy climes is another of her kind. Beautiful, mysterious, and extraordinarily sensuous, Mei Chen is also desperate and alone--for she harbors a terrifying secret that will destroy her, unless she can open herself to the power of the pack. . .Oliver knows the loneliness of total isolation, of being unable to share ecstasy with another living soul, so when he accompanies Adam to Florida to reunite with Eve, he is immediately drawn to her vulnerable companion. Mei clearly needs Adam's healing touch, yet Oliver, so long in the shadows, also recognizes Mei as the mate for whom he has been searching. Only when Mei is free to lay herself completely bare, can her Chanku destiny be fulfilled. And when she is ready, no matter what the risk, Oliver will be there to indulge her every desire. . .Praise for the Erotic Novels of Kate Douglas\"HOT, HOT, HOT.\"-- The Romance Readers Connection\"A smorgasbord of sensual delights.\"-- Romance Reviews Today\"I recommend this hot little number for anyone looking for something different and just plain arousing.\"-- Just Erotic Romance ReviewsWARNING!
