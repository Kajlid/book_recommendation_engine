He stood before me; I knew something was off, but I didn’t recognize him in time, and Malik managed to send me to a dark place before they could stop him. Logan’s rage was the only thing that brought me back. But now that he has discovered my location, how can I escape him again? Worse yet, how can I keep my family safe? Because make no mistake, even if I am not strong enough to fight for myself, I will do anything for them. This includes going with my nightmare willingly. How could I have been so careless? For fifteen years, I have guarded myself, trusted my gut, and when I stood face to face with him, every alarm in my body was going off, yet I chose to ignore them. Not only have I allowed Mictulant to hunt me down, but I have brought him to the front door of my new family. Tornado Kenna strikes again, and this time someone else may end up paying the price.LoganCircumstances took her family; fate brought her to me. Can I keep my promise to her and save her life?

Malik better keep running if he knows what is good for him because he will pay for everything he has ever done to her when I catch him. My biggest obstacle in keeping my promise just happens to be the person I am trying to save.",
