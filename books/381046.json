  "title": "My Darcy Mutates...: A Collection of Pride and Prejudice-inspired steamy short stories",
  "description": "What if old Mr. Darcy was still alive... What if Mr. Darcy had a rakish soul? What if Netherfield Park was haunted? What if action of Pride and Prejudice had played out in Egypt? This collection of 14 short stories contains sexy, over-the-top \"pick-me-up\" stories across the historical, fantasy and modern genres. They are not for the faint-hearted. Some may call the stories wild and say that they bear no resemblance to the original, but Wilson finds Miss Austen's characters timeless and inspirational.",
