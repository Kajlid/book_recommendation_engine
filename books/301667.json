  "description": "1837, London: As Queen Victoria ascends the throne, forty-six-year-old scientist and inventor Michael Faraday has a nervous breakdown. We've been told by historians that Faraday pushed himself too hard and he needed to recover. What really happened? He had completed his greatest electromagnetic invention: The Faraday Mirror, and it changed the innovative genius's life. In the attic of his Victorian mansion, Faraday switched on his device, a shimmering portal surrounded by crackling coils of electrified wire, through which, and through his own flickering reflection, he viewed an alien, twilit landscape.1995, New Hampshire: Two teenage brothers, Byron and Colton Oakes, discover the plans for Faraday's fabled mirror between an antique Victorian lithograph and its mildewed cardboard backing. With it is a handwritten warning:  \"This knowledge is forbidden, like the apple to Eve, and like that apple, it may bring you more harm than joy. The Mirror is a powerful invention that opens a gateway to another world, one that we had, of late, jokingly christened 'Wonderland,' but whose secrets can be both wonderful and terrible.\"  The Oakes brothers choose to ignore it.  Journey from New Hampshire to Faerie in this epic tale of science, history, magic, and adventure. Only by uncovering the dark mysteries of their newfound world can Bryon and Colton hope to get home.",
