  "title": "Drunk Tank Pink: And Other Unexpected Forces that Shape How We Think, Feel, and Behave",
  "description": "A revelatory look at how our environment unconsciously yet dramatically shapes the judgments and decisions we make every day.Most of us go through life believing that we are in control of the choices we make, that we think and behave almost independently from the world around us, but as Drunk Tank Pink illustrates, the truth is our environment shapes our thoughts and actions in myriad ways without our permission or even our knowledge. Armed with surprising data and endlessly fascinating examples, Adam Alter addresses the subtle but substantial ways in which outside forces influence us--such as colorâ€™s influence on mood, our bias in favor of names with which we identify, and how sunny days can induce optimism as well as aggression. Drunk Tank Pink proves that the truth behind our feelings and actions goes much deeper than the choices we take for granted every day.",
