  "title": "White Hurricane: A Great Lakes November Gale and America's Deadliest Maritime Disaster",
  "description": "The riveting account of a 1913 storm that paralyzed the heart of America Autumn gales have pursued mariners across the Great Lakes for centuries. On Friday, November 7, 1913, those gales captured their prey. After four days of winds up to 90 miles an hour, freezing temperatures, whiteout blizzard conditions, and mountainous seas, 19 ships had been lost, two dozen had been thrown ashore, 238 sailors were dead, and the city of Cleveland was confronting the worst natural disaster in its history. In White Hurricane, writer and mariner David G. Brown combines narrative intensity with factual depth to re-create the events of the \"perfect storm\" that struck America's heartland. Interweaving human drama, mystery, and historical consequence, Brown has created a vast epic ranging over Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Erie and echoing down the decades.",
