  "description": "I am Blair Sheach. Screw up. Outcast. Wizard.My life will never be the same. Let's just say, new found powers do not a hero make, and I've never been an exception. It was supposed to be a simple case: find the client's deadbeat, cheating husband, collect money, and finally pay my rent. Turns out the wanker is a necromancer hell bent on destroying London. Turns out necromancers are only part of the problem in a city infested by vampires and demons. And magic cops aren't any better at cleaning them up than mundane ones. Then there's me, I'm no one special. Just the last line of defense.I'm out of luck and out of time. And to save my city, the decision I have to make is one I can't take back.",
