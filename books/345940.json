  "description": "The Bishop of Grunewald - A tale of three men taken to a castle dungeon courtesy of lies told by a vindictive woman. The king and bishop want answers and have painful methods for extracting them, but they also have great admiration for the manly strength and defiance of their victims. Can love bloom in a dungeon of torture? The Tortured Secutor is set in 270 AD Rome, where a gladiator freed by an emperor becomes entangled in a web of murder and extortion. He's taken prisoner and tortured by the evil patrician behind the plot. His only hope is with the man who loves him, a physician at the Ludus Magnus, gladiatorial training facility at the Flavium Amphitheatrum. Good citizens are hard at work in an effort to save their tortured secutor, if he can hold out long enough for them to put their plan to action.",
