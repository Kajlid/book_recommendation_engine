  "description": "Twenty year old Olivia Tremaine is the daughter of a very wealthy family. They expect her to fit in and follow the guidelines of her Sector, but she doesn't. Not by a long shot. In Olivia's world, money is power which is why her country is divided into Sectors, separated by wealth. Being from the wealthiest sector, Olivia has a Guardian who was purchased by her parents to protect and care for her. Rowan and Olivia have spent nearly a decade together, but once Olivia is married he will be forced to leave her.  When she is introduced to her future husband, Olivia and Rowan are forced to face their true feelings for each other. Because of Rowan's position as Olivia's Guardian, they are forbidden from being together, and no one in the prestigious Sector is allowed to choose their own partner. The barriers already seem insurmountable when Rowan becomes violent with Olivia's overzealous fianc√© and is forced to flee. Rowan leaves the heavily dependent Olivia to follow through with their plan to stay together. Olivia must find the strength to begin a dangerous and life-altering journey in an effort to reunite with her Guardian, and learn to stand on her own two feet.",
