And life is giving her a lot to write about just now. Daddy up and walked out, leaving them broke. Then Harper's family gets evicted. With Mama scrambling to find work, Harper has to skip school to care for her little brother, Hemingway. Their lives have been turned upside down, which Harper could just about handleâ€•if it wasn't for the writing contest at school. If only she could get up on that stage and read her poems out loud . . .",
