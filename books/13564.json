  "title": "In Transit",
  "description": "IN TRANSIT is a woman-in-jeopardy story, a post 9-11 novel, set in and around the NY-Metro Area. What starts out as a rather naive quest for a 22 year-old \"Jersey Girl\" with innocent intentions of becoming an NYPD cop and \"marrying a man in uniform,\" snowballs into something much more harrowing and ominous. The plot is rooted in the ordinary lives of NYPD career cops, the choices they make (or don't make), and depicts how their fates are often determined by people who hold secrets as dark and as labyrinth-like as the New York City Subway System. \"Rita Del Vecchio is a great, fresh character; vulnerable yet tough . . . IN TRANSIT is suspenseful and rings with authenticity. Ordinary citizens are usually unaware of the role of the transit police and seeing Rita work against the very real backdrop of New York City is a real treat.\"    BARBARA D'AMATO - Agatha, Anthony and Mystery Writers of America award-winning author of AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY   and  DEATH OF A THOUSAND CUTS",
