  "description": "Birdie Boyer was a Florida Cracker. She belonged to a large \"strawberry family,\" who lived on a flatwoods farm in the lake section of the state. They raised strawberries for a living.Through all the hazards of the uncertain crop -- battling against dry weather and grass fires, the roving hogs and cattle of their neighbors -- Birdie dreamed of an education that would include playing the organ. In the end she won not only the title of \"strawberry girl,\" but book learning as well.This is a story full of enterprise and fun and tire excitement of real life in this interesting part of America.Lois Lenski has used again her gift for catching the flavor and drama of life in a remote corner of America. It is the second of a series of regional stories through which she promises to introduce other fascinating and little-known backgrounds to boys and girls. This story will take a place beside her popular Louisiana story Bayou Suzette in the affection of readers.The eighty-four illustrations are distinguished for their action and fascinating detail. They add greatly to this true picture of Florida life at a time when old Florida ways were changing to new.Winner, 1946 Newbery MedalNotable Children's Books of 1945 (ALA)",
