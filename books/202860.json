  "title": "The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus The Christ",
  "description": "This gospel offers a record of the lost eighteen years of Jesus which does not appear in the New Testament. It covers his travels and meetings with various masters and holy men in countries like India, Egypt, Assyria, Greece and Tibet. It also teaches many deeper truths not found in other books and sometimes clarifies or reinforces known teachings in the Bible. Includes chapters on Mary his mother, John the Harbinger, much on his travels and teachings, his betrayal, trail, execution and resurrection, plus a chapter on the materialization of his spiritual body. Said to have been retrieved from the ¿Akashic Records¿, this popular gospel may not be historically accurate in its entirety, but the truths in its teachings are timeless.",
