  "description": "A girl named Miu stumbles upon a mysterious pawn shop. Here, the only item for trade is time itself. Everyone always searches for extra time, but are they willing to exchange something that is more valuable and irreplaceable -- their most precious memories? These memories could be wiped out forever if the borrowed time is not returned. Tokiya, the shop owner, recruits Miu to work part time as a \"Time Mediator.\" Her new boss is sweet, but he has his own motives regarding the time he trades. And Miu must always remember the most important rule: never speak of the shop to anyone.",
