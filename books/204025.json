But instead of the wonderland they expected to find; they find Parkland...a place where Lucky will discover the beauties and brutalities of life. He is introduced to a myriad of characters who will each influence his growth from boy to man. With each character's life showing that fate is determined as much by luck, as it is by will. And, Lucky soon learns that life in Parkland is a gamble of choices. Determined to get out of Parkland, Lucky spots a glimmer of light to a better future, but his plan to get out begins to unravel when he is forced to revisit a murder he witnessed at 13; and as luck would have, he is also the main suspect in a manslaughter case. So with the police and the murders both looking for him, Lucky is forced to toss the dice again and hope they fall in his favor. Come with Lucky as Branch leads his readers through a web of intricately woven stories all leading to one ending, and each connected to one source, Reggie (Lucky) Wheeler. And see where the dice land.",
