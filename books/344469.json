  "description": "The Great Reset and the Struggle for Liberty: Unraveling the Global Agenda is the definitive treatment of the Great Reset. In a scholarly examination, Rectenwald treats the various components of the Great Reset, including the economic system it establishes, the deep history of the World Economic Forum (WEF), the population control “ethics” of the WEF and related globalist organizations, climate change catastrophism, the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (including transhumanism), and the question of conspiracy theory. Rectenwald ends with a nine-point plan for stopping the Great Reset in its tracks, as part of what he calls the Grand Refusal. Far from a conspiratorial rant, The Great Reset and the Struggle for Liberty is a thoroughly sourced account that lays bare the premises and implications of the Great Reset project.",
