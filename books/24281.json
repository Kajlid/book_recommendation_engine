  "description": "These companion stories to my novel Cel & Anna are brief. “The Deep Dark World of Lighthorse Magic” is about Anna Ringer’s employer, a mysterious company called Lighthorse Magic. It has lots of rules. Employees are forbidden to dress in ways that call attention to their bodies. They are forbidden to eat at their desks. They are forbidden to take public transportation.And it is a bad idea to say “Freezlebeezer frazzlebeezer Re! Ra! Ro!”“Tamara Klugman Steps Out” is about a rather dull young woman who receives a vision and blunders out to save the world.“Three Excerpts from the Diary of Joan Holland” is about the pregnant young wife of the unofficial mayor of a village called Rising Sun. She bakes pies and bread. She writes in her journal, “I am in time’s jaws.”",
