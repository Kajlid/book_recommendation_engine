Moondays are mysterious, and if one comes so shall we not turn from the path, less it not come again.Eli with his wolfcub ears hears the call for adventure. Light-footed and full of dancey, Eli follows the path spilled out to him on a great goodnight venture that leads him on marvelous moon-built landscapes and calls on his moon-citizen friends, leaving him sleepy and happy to dream of future adventures.",
