And when she fails to reappear, Nick knows the honeymoon is over before it has even begun.Her trail leads him to Africa, and the deep end of a very dirty Congo war - where it isn't long before the past comes knocking at his door, and Stone finds himself catapulted once more into the dark and brutal world heâ€™d tried to leave behind.As one bloody twist leads to another, his apparently simple quest becomes a journey to the heart of a chilling conspiracy, to which he and his beautiful quarry unwittingly hold the key.",
