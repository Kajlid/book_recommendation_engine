  "description": "The Golden Age of Sail has Returned -- in the Year 2352When his mother dies in a flitter crash, eighteen-year-old Ishmael Horatio Wang must find a job with the planet company or leave the system--and NerisCo isn't hiring. With credits running low, and prospects limited, he has just one hope...to enlist for two years with a deep space commercial freighter. Ishmael, who only rarely visited the Neris Orbital, and has never been off-planet alone before, finds himself part of an eclectic crew sailing a deep space leviathan between the stars. Join the crew of the SC Lois McKendrick, a Manchester built clipper as she sets solar sails in search of profit for her company and a crew each entitled to a share equal to their rating.AWARDS AND RECOGNITION 2008 Parsec Award Finalist for Best Speculative Fiction for Full Share2008 Podiobooks Founder's Choice Award for Double Share 2008 Parsec Award Finalist for Best Speculative Fiction for South Coast2009 Podiobooks Founder's Choice Award for Captain's Share 2009 Parsec Award Finalist for Best Speculative Fiction for Double Share6 out of 10 Top Overall Rated podio books (#3 Ravenwood, #4 Quarter Share, #5 Double Share, #6 Captain's Share, #7 Full Share, #10 South Coast) as of May 20105 out of 10 Top Overall Rated by Votes podio books (#2 Double Share, #3 Quarter Share, #4 Full Share, #7 Half Share, #10 Captain's Share) as of May 2010ABOUT THE SERIES: TRADER'S TALESQuarter ShareHalf ShareFull ShareDouble ShareCaptain's ShareOwner's Share",
