  "description": "I had her and I lost her.That’s what pain and fear does to someone; they make someone run.And Alicia ran far...Taking my heart with her.We agreed we both had things to work on, but to be honest, I didn’t know how to improve.She did.She fought for us. She got stronger. She did what she said.I lied.The truth is... I’m not the man she needs me to be.And I don’t know how to be it.I’m hideous. I’m a monster. My face is abnormal.Who could love a man with one eye?Who could love a man that’s... bad on the inside?I’m a rotten soul.But she turns this rotten soul into something more.She gives me hope.Until she dares to move on from me.And then all hell breaks loose.Make no mistake, she’s mine.And she’s about to learn what happens when someone pisses off a beast.They become the monster they were born to be.But just as I have her, someone from her past comes looking for something that no longer exists.Wedding bells ring in the distance.And they aren’t mine.No one marries her, but me.I, object.",
