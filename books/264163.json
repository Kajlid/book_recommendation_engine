  "description": "The Little family is composed of Mr. and Mrs. Little and their two children Sally and Tommy Little. Together the Littles share in the routine activities of family life in the early 1930 they get dressed for the day, they eat breakfast, and enjoy their chores and playtime together. Children will recognize their lives and enjoy noting the differences between the Littles’ time and the present. The world has changed a great deal since 1932, but it’s fascinating to see that some things haven’t changed much at all!",
