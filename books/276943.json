  "description": "\"She was supposed to trust him with her body and heart, but he didn't trust her with his past.\"  Suzie Kaspar has been a widow for five years. She struggles with her responsibilities as a single mother, but she doesn’t accept help easily. Her late husband was sweet but not strong, and she was responsible for herself and their children even before he became ill and died. After she witnesses her sister’s collaring ceremony, she is both intrigued and intimidated by the lifestyle.  Sadist Captain Connor is an enigma. He is well liked at Club Indigo, but nobody really knows him. Connor is looking for a submissive masochist in the bedroom and a strong and independent woman outside it, but his experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq have left invisible scars he doesn’t share with anyone.  While Connor and Suzie struggle with their relationship, they discover something alarming about Suzie’s son’s best friend. The devastating information will shake the foundations of their relationship and magnify the trust issues they’re already having.  Can Connor show Suzie how wonderful it is to lean on a man and to discover there is pleasure to be found in pain? Can she trust him with her life and her heart, the way she trusts him with her body?
