  "description": "\"The Company\"Truth is stranger than fiction at The Company. Things get especially exciting when the unknown comes wrapped in the gossamer thread of magic and mayhem. On the other side of this shimmery coin lies Love, the protective cloak that gives all we do meaning and validation. Thus, the world of the supernatural is a prelude and backdrop to romance that unfolds in all its glorious colors.A woman uses a love potion to attract a man and repel another, yet gets more than she bargained for when the unexpected happens right where she least expects it.A man, both angel and demon, struggles with his identity while danger lurks around the corner and a new, powerful emotion takes over his being, shaking him to the core.An ambitious account executive is thrust in the midst of an old war between vampires and hunters, a kiss has her float in mid-air, and the world sheâ€™s always known shatters around her.Pre-order today at $.099Amazon: http://amzn.to/1VJwKvPAmazon UK: http://amzn.to/1T21gepAmazon CA: http://amzn.to/1MLr81xAmazon AU: http://bit.ly/1VnWpdBLink to Barnes and Noble: http://bit.ly/245pGLNLink to iBooks: http://apple.co/1XLoSaULink to Kobo: http://bit.ly/1WhgelNScrbD: http://bit.ly/1Vq3fzf",
