  "title": "Injustice: Life and Death in the Courtrooms of America",
  "description": "A man wrongly condemned to death for murder, a crusading lawyer determined to free him, an investigation that reveals corruption at every turn. This remarkable book reads like a page-turning detective story, with one crucial difference: can we be sure that justice wll be served at the end?In 1986, Kris Maharaj, a British businesman living in Miami, was arrested for the brutal murder of two ex-business associates. His lawyer did not present a strong alibi; Kris was found guilty and sentenced to death in the electric chair.It wasn't until a young lawyer working for nothing, Clive Stafford Smith, took on his case that strong evidence began to emerge that the state of Florida had got the wrong man. So far, so good - except that, as Stafford Smith argues here so compellingly, the American justice system is actually designed to ignore innocence. Twenty-six years later, Maharaj is still in jail.Step by step, Stafford Smith untangles the Maharaj case and the system that makes disasters like this inveitable. His conclusions will act as a wake-up call for those who condone legislaion which threatens basic human rights and, at the same time, the personal story he tells demonstrates that determination can challenge the institutions that surreptitously threaten our freedom.",
