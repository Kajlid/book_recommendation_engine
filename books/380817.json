  "description": "Slaves of the StarThe Star has been killing her slowly. I wanted to destroy it at first, but she wouldn’t let me. It’s the future, she said. She’s right--but I don’t care. I only want to save those I love--and they’re in the past.The Star can help me, but it’s a two-edged sword. It may destroy us, but it’s not evil. It’s completely neutral. It’s mankind that is evil, not the Star.Destroy the Star? No. The Star can help me--and those I love. Am I evil? I don’t know. But I’ve already made my choice.Praise for Secret of the Legion“As in his previous novels, Thomas’s characters have a level of depth and intensity that move this story way beyond a Sci-fi thriller, creating a compelling novel that will appeal to all readers.” -- Nancy L. Mehl, Author“As in every book of this series, the battles are so realistic my heart pounded...The writing style is exciting...In many ways, this is my favorite book in the series so far. Highly recommended.” -- Midwest Book Review",
