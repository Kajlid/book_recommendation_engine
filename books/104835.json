  "title": "White Stains",
  "description": "This collection of six sensual, yet explicit short stories is thought to have been written for an Oklahoma oil millionaire, Roy M. Johnson. Anais Nin is said to have paid a dollar per page to produce typescripts of explicit erotica for his own private amusement. In 'Alice' a couple spying on another couple screwing in a public park become involved in a steamy group sex scene. In 'Florence', a New York office girl enjoys sex for the first time sleeping with two men in quick succession! In 'Memories' a man recounts his youth and his teenage initiation into sex by a variety of older women. This facsimile reproduction also contains an explicit sex manual, Love's Cyclopaedia, originally published with the stories. The intorduction by Dr. C.J. Schiener tells the story of the book's first clandestine edition by New York publisher Samuel Roth during the 1940s and all the evidence for attributing this anonymous work to Anais Nin.",
