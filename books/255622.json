His escape route, a water pipe, was later used by the great Odysseus himself to visit Helen, More...whose kidnapping by Priamm's younger son Paris has set off the siege of Troy.In this dramatic retelling of that famous story, the events that followed are seen through the eyes of Asterius, slave to the aging and homesick Helen. Once again those larger-than-life heroes - Odysseus, Hector, Achilles, Agamemnon - stride through the pages of history, all of them, however, including Helen, displaying a hint of humanity that makes their fate all the more tragic.",
