  "description": "Made in America. Outsourced to India. At Home with Herself?A charming yet honest memoir of one Upper West side housewife who finds herself saying good-bye to Starbucks and all her notions of \"home\" when she and her husband are outsourced to Hyderabad. Jenny Feldon imagined life in India as a glitzy yoga whirlwind. Instead she found buffalo-related traffic jams. Jenny struggled to fight the depression, bitterness, and anger as her sense of self and her marriage began to unravel. And it was all India's fault--wasn't it? Equally frustrating, revealing, and amusing, this is the true story of an accidental housewife trapped in the third world.",
