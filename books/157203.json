  "title": "Marcel & Me: A Memoir of Love, Lust, and Illusion",
  "description": "A young divorcee, searching for creativity and her true nature, meets the world's greatest mime, Marcel Marceau, backstage after a performance. Attracted to each other, they write and speak on the phone. He invites her on a one-week blind date that develops into a thirty-six-year liaison of love, lust, and illusion. This book is about what happens when the mistress of fantasy meets the master of illusion. Written in the language of the heart, this story has depth of soul. It is funny, erotic, poignant, and filled with wisdom about life, fame, and relationship. It is about the profound longing for union and the ferocious need for independence, being simultaneously vulnerable and daring. Marcel is portrayed onstage and off, as a friend and lover. Frankl unmasks the genius and humanizes the man. Marcel & Me contains original art by both the author and Marceau, as well as photos, along with a richly evocative read that, in the end, is real.\"",
