  "description": "Bostonian Abby Banes becomes the pampered mistress of a plantation on Georgia's glorious seacoast when she marries the much older Eli Allyn. When he dies, Abby defies Southern tradition to run the plantation alone and to embrace a people's call for freedom. And she never expects the intense emotion that draws her to another man--or to be struck by a passion, fierce as lightning that knows no bounds.",
