  "description": "It was a beautiful afternoon; the brilliant sun was shimmering through the leaves of the walnut tree, the birds were chirping, and the flowers were in full bloom. Would Aslam Khan ever know serenity like this again? There is much that has been left untold when it comes to Afghanistan’s violent history. This historical fiction novel gives an intricate account of the ramifications of the Soviet invasion, subsequent war and ceaseless violence felt throughout the generations by one family. The Walnut Tree uniquely explores a 30 year timeline by compelling the reader to walk in the shoes of each passing generation from Aslam’s family. Get to know them personally and develop an understanding of what life is like in the throes of war. The question is, will any of Aslam’s descendant’s meet a new Afghanistan and experience the peaceful joy that he once knew from under the walnut tree?",
