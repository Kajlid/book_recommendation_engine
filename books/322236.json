  "description": "I’m in love with three men. I’m just not sure if they’re a dream come true or my worst nightmare.It began with hearing voices - another step on my steady descent into madness. It was inevitable, considering the whole town hated me and I was the loneliest person on the planet.I didn’t really blame them. Everyone who got close to me ended up in the hospital. I’d be suspicious of me too.When the three distinct, alluring voices in my head started to appear before my eyes as three distinct, gorgeous men I really started to question everything I thought I knew.They called themselves Dreamwalkers and told me they were hunting the monster attacking all the people around me.They won’t leave me alone.I’m not sure I want them to.But am I the monster they’re after? Or are we all in worse danger than I ever could’ve imagined?",
