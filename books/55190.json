  "description": "Alternate cover edition â€” ISBN: 0141183829'One of the most remarkable artists of our age' - Mario Vargas Llosa. The Book of Sand was the last of Borges' major collections to be published. The stories are, in his words, 'variations on favourite themes...combining a plain and at times almost colloquial style with a fantastic plot'. It includes such marvellous tales as \"The Congress\", \"Undr\" and \"The Mirror and the Mask\". Also included are the handful of stories written right at the end of Borges' life - \"August 25, 1983\", \"Blue Tigers\", \"The Rose of Paracelsus\" and \"Shakespeare's Memory\".",
