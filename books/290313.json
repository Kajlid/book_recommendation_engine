  "title": "Harry and Catherine: A Love Story",
  "description": "\"For years Frederick Busch has been at work on one of the most impressive bodies of American fiction.\"―Reynolds Price Here is that rarest and most satisfying of books: a grown-up love story. Harry and Catherine have been falling in and out of love for many years. She is divorced, determinedly raising two sons, and running a small gallery in upstate New York. He is an ex-newspaperman, a wistful drifter, now assistant to a New York senator. After a long separation, Harry is assigned to find out whether a new shopping mall in Catherine's neighborhood will desecrate an historic black cemetery. Catherine is living with another man, a contractor for the mall who finds both his financial interests and his relationship with Catherine threatened by Harry. With penetrating acuity and generosity of spirit, one of our finest writers brings us what David Bradley calls \"a book people will love and be proud of loving.\" \"Unsuppressed emotion, painful honesty . . . all of it in the most lively and supple language anyone is writing today.\"―Rosellen Brown",
