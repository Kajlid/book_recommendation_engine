Trapped in Hoboken while villains from children's classics run amok, the intrepid trio must find The Book before the Headless Horseman, Long John Silver, and a dastardly Mr. (Teddy) Bear do away with the heroes of their stories. Will the guys make it in time? Or (horrors!) will Alice in Wonderland become Frankenstein in Wonderland?\"Nonstop action and lots of laughs.\" -- School Library Journal",
