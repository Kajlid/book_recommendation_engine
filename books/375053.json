  "description": "True horror is the knowledge that fate has turned against you.A monster is approaching the Bronze Age city of Yarich.It cannot be stopped. It cannot be turned aside.And the monster is…God Himself.Sakal, caravan-master to the \"Melek\" or king of the Canaanite city-state, recounts the tale of the increasingly desperate battle for survival waged by his people against fanatical outsiders – nomads from the desert wielding a terrible supernatural power. As an incomprehensible cosmic force approaches, the city dwellers slowly lose all that they have loved – including, finally, their humanity.A twist in point of view transforms the Old Testament tale of the fall of Jericho into Lovecraftian horror.",
