That’s just little Gael breaking the resolves of two protective Daddies, one shy yet sinful bite at a time.It’s no coincidence Gael Grimes is in Professor Aavik’s class. He’s had a crush on the professor since he first spotted the man in the kink community they’re both part of. According to Gael, Professor Aavik is just super dreamy! Distinguished, charismatic—a total silver fox. But when Gael’s ex-boyfriend ignores the restraining order against him and tries to reach out, another man steps out of the shadows, and Gael is suddenly at a loss for words and can’t describe the intense attraction.Private investigator Joshua “Santiago” Jones has been keeping an eye on Gael for a while as a favor to a friend. Under different circumstances, he would’ve loved to get closer to Gael. The boy’s cuter than words, definitely on the Little spectrum, funny, smart…but this is work. The only reason Santiago has to get close now is to protect Gael from his stalker ex-boyfriend.–The Game Series is a BDSM series where romance meets the reality of kink. Sometimes we fall for someone we don’t match with, sometimes vanilla business gets in the way of kinky pleasure, and sometimes we have to compromise and push ourselves to overcome trauma and insecurities. No matter what, one thing is certain. This is not a perfect world—and maybe that’s why the happily ever after feels so good.",
