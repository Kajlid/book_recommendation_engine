  "description": "Megan meets Sandro at the lowest time of her life-when she thinks her crazy nightmares are symptoms of the tumor that is killing her. But the sexy dragon shape-shifter tells her the dreams are telepathic messages from his missing brother. More than telepathy flares between them. Megan and Sandro burn up the night with sizzling passion, but Sandro won't commit, and Megan wants more than a fling. When Sandro rescues Megan from a dangerous situation, she gives him the key to locate his brother, but he wants far more from her. He wants her body, all ways, all day, all night. But he knows he can't promise Megan any kind of forever.",
