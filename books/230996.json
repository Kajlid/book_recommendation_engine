  "description": "Life in the Winchester household is hardly settled. That’s true for Bay Winchester more than anybody else.Her boyfriend Landon Michaels is away from town on an undercover assignment for the FBI and Bay is struggling not to let worry and unease rule over her life. Halloween is approaching, after all, and Hemlock Cove is bustling with activity. Bay has her hands full even when her heart feels empty.A chance encounter with Landon while he’s undercover leaves Bay exposed… and furious. By the time Landon returns to make things right, things spiral further out of control when Bay is attacked in her own home and wakes to find a dead body on the lawn.The dead woman has ties to Landon’s case and when the investigation is given to the Michigan State Police instead of Landon and Chief Terry, Bay knows she’s in trouble. Between her issues with Landon and his refusal to step away from the case, things are about to come to a head. Landon is determined to protect Bay at all costs, even if it means going to war with the people he once considered colleagues. For her part, Bay has to dig deep for courage – deeper than she ever dreamed, in fact. Faith is key, because Landon needs it and so does she.The final fight is one no one saw coming, and it brings Landon and the Winchesters full circle as they once again find themselves walking into a corn maze looking for trouble… and desperate to protect one of their own.When the end comes, someone Bay loves with her whole heart is in danger, and survival isn’t a given. It’s going to take everyone to save the day. Aunt Tillie has a plan, though, so there’s absolutely nothing to worry about.Right?",
