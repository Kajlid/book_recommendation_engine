The small world he knows is turned upside-down by treachery, war, and destruction. A strange traveler challenges him to take up his role in a mysterious prophecy that beckons and heralds death, destruction, and battle. The quest that he undertakes in order to bring back the Light and vanquish the Dark that taunts him and his friends demands nearly everything of him, but soon, he finds that he cannot give himself away until he has found himself in the One who will bide him well through the storm. The test by fire has begun. There are lines written in between the lines and nothing is understood. Questions plague him at every bend in the road and it seems that enemies and assassins are lying in wait for him beneath every surging wave. Can he stay the wrath of the Blackmantle and save the realm from the doom of the Dark? Will he restore the world to its former glory? Will he succeed in searching out his father who has been long lost at sea? Find out where this intrepid journey will take you in this rousing, swash-buckling, sea-salty tale.",
