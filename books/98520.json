  "title": "Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts",
  "description": "Until the late 1980s it was believed that consciousness could not be investigated by objective experimentation, but today the quest for its biological basis is at the forefront of cognitive research. This book, by a leading researcher in the neuroscience of language and number processing, shows how modern tools such as functional magnetic resonance imaging can pinpoint the physiological markers that reveal long-distance communication networks within the brain, providing data to answer long-standing questions about consciousness.",
