  "description": "Cruz Montes can't believe her DEA Agent brother is abandoning her on a dusty, isolated ranch in West Texas with a cowboy she's never met. Carlos swears Niall is the only man who can keep Cruz and her unborn baby safe but she isn't so sure. One look at the rough ex-soldier and Cruz wonders if she wouldn't be safer on her own.  Rancher Niall Campbell isn't thrilled with the prospect of babysitting his best friend's sister, especially when he learns she's marked for death by an infamous drug cartel assassin. But he swore a blood oath with Carlos in the heat of battle and always keeps his word. He'll defend Cruz and her unborn baby with his life.  Cruz quickly realizes she isn't the only one being followed by a ghost. She's drawn to the haunted Niall. As she chips away at his emotional armor, Niall dares to dream about what it might be like to have a family of his own, to keep Cruz and her baby in his life.  But all those dreams will remain unrealized if he can't protect her.",
