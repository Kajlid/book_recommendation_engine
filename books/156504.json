  "title": "Books under Fire: A Hit List of Banned and Challenged Children's Books",
  "description": "Many things have changed since ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF) was founded in 1967, but not everything: the most beloved and popular children's books are still among the most frequent targets of censorship and outright bans. Limiting access to controversial titles such as Captain Underpants, The Dirty Cowboy, Blubber, or Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark or leaving them out of a library's collection altogether is not the answer to challenges. In this important book, Scales gives librarians the information and guidance they need to defend challenged books with an informed response while ensuring access to young book lovers. Spotlighting dozens of \"hot button\" titles written for young children through teens, this book: • Gives a profile of each book that covers its plot, characters, published reviews, awards and prizes, and author resources; • Recounts past challenges and how they were faced, providing valuable lessons for handling future situations, plus a list of other books challenged for similar reasons; • Provides discussion ideas for planning programming around banned books, whether in reading groups, classrooms, or other settings; • Includes an appendix of additional resources for librarians who find themselves enmeshed in a challenge. With this guide at hand, library managers, children's and YA librarians, and other library staff will be prepared to champion intellectual freedom for young people.",
