Thanks, but I'd rather have a root canal.And a vasectomy.At the same time.But my relief comes in an unlikely package-the gorgeous and feisty Maren. She just so happens to be my friend's sister, so that's not awkward at all.But I'm a man on a mission, and Maren is down to teach me all the ways I've been failing as a boyfriend. Apparently, there are many. And it's all very informative-until I start to catch feels.Now it's not just my reputation on the line, but my heart too. Are these new characters? Yes! Hayes and Maren are brand new characters you've never met and I can't wait to introduce you. Is this part of a series? This is book 1 in a new series about a group of male best friends who own an adult toy company. Get ready for lots of shenanigans, feels, and a swoonworthy bromance. Each book can be read as a standalone.",
