  "description": "Two novellas and one short story make up this collection. In Maybe forever, Nate Jamison gets more than he bargained for when he buys a remote Colorado lodge. Lindsey Archer worries that she and her new boss won't mesh. When they get along a little too well, she wonders how it can possibly be more. In Sometimes, Always, Grayson Jamison knows all about regret and letting go. When Cassie Summers comes back into his life, he promises that this time, he won't let her go. But Cassie has a secret and suddenly understands why long ago, Gray had to choose family over her-- because she is in the same position now. In Second Chance Christmas, high school sweethearts reunite. Nick left to travel the world, but now he realizes, the only thing he's been searching for, is the girl he left behind. Eve gave her heart away once, only to have it broken. When the boy she's always loved returns, she doesn't want to let go of her dreams to chase the past.",
