  "description": "Paul Benjamin, a successful accountant in New York City, is enjoying a three-martini lunch when his home is broken into by a gang of drug addicts. For just a handful of money, they savagely beat Paul’s wife and daughter, leaving his wife dead and his daughter comatose. Grief-stricken and forced to reevaluate his views, Benjamin becomes disillusioned with society and plots his revenge on the perpetrators, whom the police are unable to bring to justice. Armed with a revolver and total disregard for his own safety, he sets out to even the score.Adapted into the 1974 feature film starring Charles Bronson, Death Wish is now a new major motion picture starring Bruce Willis, Vincent D’Onofrio, Elisabeth Shue, Dean Norris, Camila Morrone and Kimberly Elise, written by Joe Carnahan and directed by Eli Roth.",
