Of course life is never that easy for teacher Alex and she finds herself torn between two very married, very sexy, very unobtainable women.  As relationships flourish and fall, Alex finds herself with a difficult choice to make. But what happens when that choice is taken away from her and one of the husbands finds out about the affair?  You, Me and He Makes Three follows the tumultuous journeys of complicated love affairs. Laugh out loud, cry along with them but don't forget to keep looking out for the shadows that lie ahead.",
