  "description": "He thought he knew everything about love, until she made him redefine it. When Eros, the devil-may-care god of love is pricked by his own arrow, he falls for the most unsuitable of mates, a mortal woman he has been ordered to destroy. Without knowing Eros’s true identity, spirited, intelligent Psyche shows the god just what it means to be on the receiving end of his arrows, with all its sweet pain and torment, and all its rapture. Eros soon discovers what love can mean to mortals, what it should mean to the gods, and that he could quite possibly be one of the most powerful beings in Olympus. Not all the gods admire this young upstart’s newly discovered powers. The laws forbid their union, and Aphrodite, goddess of beauty and passion, is determined to see Psyche destroyed. Furthermore, the two must deal with their own doubts about themselves and each other which threaten their fragile relationship as much as Zeus’s wrath. Will Eros and Psyche become the canon of all that love has the potential to be, or will they follow a tragic path, with lessons learned too late to save them? Based on the Greco-Roman myth of Eros and Psyche, the heart of ancient Greece is explored, where the world of imperfect gods and goddesses are fatefully intertwined with the humans they rule.",
