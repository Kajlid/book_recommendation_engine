  "description": "Megan Maxwell is left pregnant, widowed and alone. Her late husband’s best friends step up to the plate to help take care of her and her baby girl. Year’s later Megan ventures back to her husband’s home town in search for a little piece of him. Instead of finding a part of him in the small town, Megan finds a part of her that she never thought she would have to face again. In a twist of events Megan is face to face with both her past and present. She is forced to look deep inside of herself for strength. Mostly, Megan has to put aside her own issues so she can stand by the side of the one person who always made her stronger. She is forced to make decisions that she never wanted to have to make and chose things she isn’t sure if she deserves. Stronger By Your Side is a heart-thumping, page-turning, romance that is riddled with questions about love, loss, hope and fate.",
