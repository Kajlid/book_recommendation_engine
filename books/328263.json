Unless I want to.And light carries me, as if I were another photon, and it lifts me to new heights from which I drop to somewhere new.It’s not witchcraft or science or a miracle. It’s just me.Vanessa and her brother Wesley have harnessed extraordinary magical abilities. Wesley's experiments to determine the forces that control destiny have led him on a journey of discovery, only to be captured and held prisoner by someone coveting his powers. Guided by nothing but a series of coincidences, Vanessa and her friend Saphron travel by starlight to rescue Wesley. But what do the coincidences really mean? And what other powers must Vanessa unleash before she can find her brother?",
