  "title": "Scout Pilot of The Free Union",
  "description": "From Book 1: Captain Frank Eric Russell is captain/pilot of a Valhalla Class Star Destroyer – until there is an embarrassing incident during a diplomatic mission to the border with the Imperium. Disciplined by being transferred to the Reconnaissance Unit of The Free Union’s Star Fleet, he finds himself assigned to an outdated Speedbird Scoutship. The missions are less prestigious, less rigorously overseen – and a lot less safe.  Threats, terror and mortal danger lurk behind every planet and asteroid as Frank tries to survive the life of a Reconnaissance Unit Scout Pilot patrolling the barely defined border between The Free Union and the Imperium during the uneasy truce between the two Galactic Powers.  Frank and his ageing Speedbird are sent on a number of perilous missions around the galaxy, both for the mysterious Colonel Rosto and on normal Space Corps business. On the way he meets a new sentient species, a terrifying space spider, finds himself involved in a deal for new spaceships that goes horribly wrong and finally has to escape the clutches of The Imperium’s Chief Enforcer, the feared Colonel Starker, before becoming involved in a battle as the rivals for domination of the galaxy clash in space.  With everything against him, can Frank and his trusty Speedbird live to run away another day?  Scout Pilot of The Free Union is the first in a new collection of Space Opera novels from noted storyteller Will Macmillan Jones",
