  "description": "Some rules were made to be broken. Some walls were meant to come down...\n My trust in men had been destroyed by my previous employer. I wanted never to be a nanny again. But the story of a broken little girl caught at my heart. I accepted the job and made one unbreakable rule for myself - don’t ever let the boss get too close. Too bad this boss lived to break rules. I didn't want him. I didn't trust him. But he really didn't care. Loving him would mean risking the child who needed me. But how could I hate him when he made me feel so special? How could I resist the passion he was offering? \n If I throw caution to the wind, can we all come out the other side happier than we’ve ever been? Or will the flames burn everything to the ground?",
