  "description": "Billy Rhythm, the quintessential American, teams up with Tharbis Jefferson, a \"Copper Colored Gal\" from the latest Cotton Club revue, to win a dance contest at the Savoy Ballroom. Unfortunately, their competition will stop at nothing to win, including murder. This jitterbug love story is woven between the lives and times of legendary black entertainers, black and white thugs, and the common man in swinging 1930's Harlem. Based on the full-length play, this radio play is perfect for readings and the classroom. Winner of the Jaz Dorsey Fusion Award from the African American Playwrights Exchange.",
