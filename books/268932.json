  "description": "“Have I become a ghost? All I hear is whispers about me. I hear divorcee, adulteress whispered behind my back while you get high fives. Dee please tell me, you never told anyone… about Sam.”The blurb above is from M and Dee, my groovy early seventies pop culture memoir. The reviews describe M and Dee as an authentic sounding, groovy read, which it should because it really happened. So, with that said, instead of me describing the book, below is what the readers have said about M and Dee. \"Ah, the 70s. This book captures well the free spirited, hitch-hiking, back-packing, train riding, grass smoking, free loving, relationship developing era of the early to mid-70’s. The story contains humor, insights, quirks, and romance, but in the end it is a tragedy of the most unusual kind. Don’t try to figure out the ending. You can’t.\" \"Groovy Baby, the characters developed nicely and it really had a good vibe to it and the language was very authentic.\"“A modern day retelling of the classic star-crossed lovers tale,” Amazon review by a US reader.“I loved this story and really got into the groovy 70s scene which was so poignantly depicted.\"Great Read. Great Travel, Domestic Life, Friendship, Romance, Coming of Age, Biographical women's personal memoir",
