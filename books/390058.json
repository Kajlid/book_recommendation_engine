Armed bandits prowl the railway lines in their armed Steam Locomotives, looking for easy marks and heavily armed mercenary engines travel from town to town looking for work in a world where every day is a struggle for its civilians.Erica, an emotionally disturbed girl from England, finds herself joining one of these mercenary teams. What follows is a trek across Europe to where two mighty cities, each representing a different way of life, stand on the verge of a war which will shape the way Europe develops. On one side are the Steam using traditionalists of St Vith, led by the charismatic and cunning General Roosje Cuvelier. On the other stands the mighty Winterscheid Diesel Empire under the iron fist of the merciless Kaiser Sigmund Eisenburg.Two vicious armies, treachery from her own allies and the world's deadliest super-weapon are just a few of the dangers that Erica must face in her journey.",
