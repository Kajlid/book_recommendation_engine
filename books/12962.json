  "description": "If there's one thing that can ruin a vacation, it's running into your ex. Just ask Treflee Miller. If she'd only known that her husband Ty would be here in Hawaii; muscular, sun-bronzed, and infuriatingly gorgeous, she would have brought the divorce papers for him to sign. But life is full of surprises when you're married to a world-class spy.Ty Miller can understand why his wife is tired of playing Mrs. James Bond. He's never home, he's always on a mission, and he's usually surrounded by exotic informants. He has to admit that the perfect spy makes a pretty lousy husband. But for the sake of Ty's security and Treflee's safety, they can't blow his cover. Not here. Not now. Not when his longing is so strong, her lips so tempting, and his enemies so close.",
