  "description": "Matchlines for Singles ( 978-0-9825109-2-6, Barringer Publishing, February 2010) by author and psychotherapist, Dr. Molly Barrow, is a very different approach to relationship self-help that every Single should read. For years we have heard that \"Opposites Attract.\" This book proves that \"Compatibility\" is what makes a relationship last and debunks \"Opposites Attract\" forever. \"Are you a Longline or a Shortline? Get a birds-eye view of your relationship capacity, and that of your partner's, to predict harmony with the unique Matchlines Relationship Compatibility Theory,\" says Dr. Molly Barrow, self-help author who holds a doctorate in psychology. \"Matchlines for Singles is mandatory reading before one ever commits their life, body, finances, or future children's well-being to a new partner.\" Different from any self-help book on the market, Matchlines for Singles empowers readers to understand their past, balance present and future relationships, reduce conflict, and select new partners more wisely. Almost all relationships can improve and some can have a complete turnaround. The Matchline Theory successfully mends troubled relationships and helps \"Confirmed Singles\" find true love and happiness. The book has a companion Matchlines Relationship Capacity Quiz that graphs relationship strengths and weaknesses at //wwwdrmollybarrow.com. Before a Single accepts the next date, takes a relationship to the next level or gives up on a partner, Matchlines for Singles is a must-read to avoid painful heartbreak.",
