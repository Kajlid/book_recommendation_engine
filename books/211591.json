  "description": "Quran and Modern Science : Compatible or Incompatible Multi Coloured Inside Pages! By: Dr. Zakir Naik Illustrated by: idara The Qur'an, however, is not a book of Science but a book of 'Signs'. These signs invite Man to realize the purpose of his existence on earth, and to live in harmony with Nature. The Qur'an is truly a message from Allah, the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. It contains the same Message of the Oneness of God, that was preached by all prophets, right from Adam, Moses, Jesus to Muhammad (peace be upon them). Several detailed tomes have been written on the subject of Qur'an and modern science and further research in this field is on. Insha'Allah, this research will help mankind to come closer to the Words of the Almighty. This booklet contains only a few of the scientific facts present in the Qur'an. I cannot claim to have done full justice to the subject. Prof. Tejasen accepted Islam on the strength of just one scientific 'sign' mentioned in the Qu'ran. Some people may require ten signs while some may require hundred signs to be convinced about the Divine origin of the Qur'an. Some would be unwilling to accept the Truth even after being shown a thousand signs.",
