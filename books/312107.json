  "description": "Chip Connolly was a conscripted grunt in stuck behind enemy lines with a bunch of cyber-uplifted rats and bats. Rats with human speech, but with rat sex, food and strong drink. And the bats were revolutionaries planning to throw off the human yoke -- with high explosive. Then there was the girl they'd rescued. Rich. Beautiful. With a passionate crush on her \"heroic\" rescuer. Her entourage was a screwball Alien tutor, and a cyber-uplifted lemurlike pet galago with delusions of being the world's greatest lover.Of course things only got worse. Seven rats, five bats, a galago, two humans, a sea-urchin-like alien and an elderly vineyard tractor without brakes...against several million inimical aliens. He was going to die.Mind you, not dying could be even more terrible. That girl might get him.",
