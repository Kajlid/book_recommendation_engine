  "description": "A timeless love as dangerous as the sea....For Captain Harry Thompson, the command of the prison transport ship HMS Banshee is his opportunity to prove his worth, working-class origins be damned. But his criminal attraction to his upper-crust First Lieutenant, Garnet Littleton, threatens to overturn all heâ€™s ever worked for.Lust quickly proves to be the least of his problems, however. The deadly combination of typhus, rioting convicts, and a monstrous storm destroys his prospects...and shipwrecks him and Garnet on their own private island. After months of solitary paradise, the journey back to civilization -- surviving mutineers, exposure, and desertion -- is the ultimate test of their feelings for each other.These two very different men each record their story for an unfathomable future in which the tale of their love -- a love punishable by death in their own time -- can finally be told. Today, dear reader, it is at last safe for you to hear it all. This is a revised, stand-alone edition of the story originally published in the Hidden Conflict anthology in 2009.",
