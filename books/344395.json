  "description": "He’s not the only one who likes to bite.Vampires and werewolves don’t date, but Brock doesn’t care. He’s done everything he can to ignore Arianna. She’s arrogant. Gorgeous. Bossy. Intelligent. Add in a deadly side and he’s smitten. Even a warning from Lord Augustus, the ruler of Vampires–and her father–can’t quell his hunger for her. When a deadly threat forces Brock and Arianna into hiding, they give in to the simmering passion that’s been brewing since they met. Alas, danger catches up to them, and a kidnapping leads to a daring rescue that exposes their affair. Can their love survive the prohibition between their kind?",
