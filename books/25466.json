Wells’ classic science fiction tale of the Martian invasion of Earth has enthralled readers with a combination of imagination and incisive commentary on the imbalance of power that continues to be relevant today.No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own....So begins The War of the Worlds , the science fiction classic that first proposed the possibility of intelligent life on other planets and has enthralled readers for generations.
