  "description": "I was born under the shadow of death, and my life since has been intricately entwined with that of the Grim Reaper.\nThey call me the Death Whisperer.One hand fixes; the other breaks.All I have ever known is a life full of pain and suffering, because what the legends don’t tell you about my power…is that there’s always a price.And I’m the one who has to pay it.My powers took my voice from me, and every day, I’m forced to experience unbearable agony. But my suffering doesn’t stop the fae of our realm from using me and my gifts, regardless of the consequences.The princes who rule the various kingdoms are rumored to be cold-blooded and vicious, with no regard to fae life. They take what they want, when they want it, in the hopes of hurting each other in the process.But what if the thing they all want…Is me?Some want to use me, others want to love me, and others still want to destroy me.The problem is, there’s not a lot left of me to use, love, or destroy.Death has whispered to me for years now, and I think it’s finally time I started listening.\nThis is book one of a series and will end on a minor cliffhanger. It is slow-burn and slow-build and has enemies-to-lovers themes (though no bullying). The men of this series are psychotic, possessive, and deranged antiheroes who take what they want, when they want it, regardless of the consequences. They care about absolutely no one...except for the FMC, though they'll have to work hard to win her over.Triggers include—abuse, mentions of past sexual assault (but none in the present), and murder.",
