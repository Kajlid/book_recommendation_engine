  "description": "Embrace your differences. That's what Shree Mandvi's father is always telling her. If only he knew just how different she really is. Being a teenage girl from the Bronx is not what makes Shree stand out at her new private school in Cambridge—it's her ability to turn into a bee. She’ll need her newfound powers, though, when she discovers a map-filled book from the 1600s claiming that there's a mysterious key—and hidden treasure—lost somewhere under the campus of Harvard University. With the help of four freaky new friends, each with their own secret powers, Shree must race to solve an ancient riddle. If she succeeds, she will unlock the final door. But first, she must summon her powers in time to save herself and her friends.",
