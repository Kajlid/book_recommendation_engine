  "description": "This edition is no longer available.The night Logan James subbed for the bartender at his club, he had no idea the love of his life would walk through the door, but the moment he saw Joey MacIntire, he wanted him. The only problem? How to initiate someone so young and obviously innocent into Logan's D/s lifestyle. Logan decides to bide his time and wait for Joey to get to know him better.  Joey MacIntire came to the city to find someone to call his own. Logan James embodies everything Joey could ever want in a man, but while he treats Joey kindly, he doesn't seem interested in anything more than friendship. Still, Joey has hope . . . and many late night fantasies. But after a year of waiting for Logan to give him more than a passing glance, Joey finally gives up. He decides to stop wasting his time at Logan's club and try out the new place across town. Dante's Dungeon is a BDSM club, and Joey is totally unprepared for what he sees there and what he discovers about himself.  When Logan discovers Joey's intentions, he decides he's waited long enough. It's time to claim Joey as his own. Things heat up between the two men and they settle into a life of domestic D/s bliss, but there are outside forces at work-forces intent on destroying Joey and Logan's newfound happiness.
