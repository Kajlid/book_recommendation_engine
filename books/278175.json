  "description": "Six powerful, harrowing, moving interviews with women who knew Anne Frank in the final seven months of her life. Everyone knows the story of Anne Frank – the extraordinary Diary that she wrote during her two years in hiding in the Secret Annexe. But few know how that story ended. Here six women whose lives touched Anne Frank’s in her final months tell their story – of the terrible journey east to Auschwitz, of the daily privations and terror of the death camps, and of the friendships and courage that transcended even the most vile conditions. Anne Frank’s story did not end with the last words in her Diary; it ended alone on a filthy floor at Bergen-Belsen. These women were the lucky ones who lived.",
