  "description": "A debut novel like no other-- touches on the apocalyptic flavors of the times and tells of a history that transcends the past. Why is the Arab world in turmoil? What instigated the Spring of Freedom? There is more to the story than meets the eye... The very fabric of the world is at stake. And , believe it or not, your fate lies in the hands of one book-loving Egyptian teen with an extraordinary heritage . Aya is an Egyptian teenage girl trying to mind her own business and take care of her brother. As their country is swept by the tides of a revolution against a tyrant nicknamed the vile pharaoh, Aya tries to stay adrift. But her blood has something different in store for her. Learning what the Ancients have always known, She joins a battle for truth and freedom-- a battle for Ma'at. It is not just a story, however, it is a world-within-world, and a fresh tantalizing outlook on the events in our modern events. This elegant novella is an introduction to a multi-volume series... The Battle for Maat.",
