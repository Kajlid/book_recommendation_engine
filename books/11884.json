While chasing his dream, he faces mountains and avalanches, giants, bandits and bears, and months of brutal training.

Despite this, he senses he is destined to be a Scout and is determined to make it to the capital on time regardless of what he may be forced to do.Sixteen-year-old Anabar has less than twelve hours to get to the capital city. This is the final test in his training to become a member of the Scouts, a band of ruthless swordsmen sworn to defend their nation.
