  "title": "Discovering Scarfolk",
  "description": "Scarfolk is a town in north-west England that did not progress beyond 1979. Instead, the entire decade of the 1970s loops ad infinitum. In Scarfolk, pagan rituals blend seamlessly with science, children must not be seen OR heard, and everyone has to be in bed by 8 p.m. because they are perpetually running a slight fever.A massive cult hit online, Scarfolk re-creates with startling accuracy the darkest childhood memories of the 1970s, all in shiver-inducing visual form. It's surreal, clever and extremely funny.",
