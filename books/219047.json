  "description": "Lucas Sloane defines beautiful for Reese. Tall and sleek with gorgeous red hair and deep, dark eyes to drown in, it's no wonder that the famous bass player is the hero of many a starry-eyed teenager's dreams.Reese used to be one of those teens. Back when Heaven Sent was no more than the house band for the local club, Purgatory. Back then, it was easy to get to know Luc. To become friends with him. Somehow, Reese found the courage to take heart in hand and confess his love to Luc… only to be soundly rejected. Luc wasn’t gay. Not long after, Heaven Sent left town and skyrocketed into rock and roll stardom.Now, six years later, Luc is back in town for a visit and more gorgeous than ever. Surprisingly, he not only apologizes for his treatment of Reese years ago, he comes onto him. Seems Luc's discovered the pleasures of being with a man and wants to know what it'd be like between the two of them.But Reese can't. He just can’t. He lives the straight and narrow. He teaches high school. He's got a girlfriend. He has a normal life. He can't be gay.Of course, it's really very hard to deny the man who's defined everything beautiful in Reese's artistic mind. Okay. No one has to know about it, right?",
