  "description": "Lady Iskra and her followers have survived the onslaught of demons, forged powerful alliances, and are finally ready to wreck righteous vengeance on the Ascendant Empire. Yet even as they begin their endgame, a new danger arises that threatens to annihilate everything in its path, heretic or no: Tharok, the greatest peril to humanity since Ogri the Destroyer.  THE SIEGE OF ABYTHOS continues the action-packed new epic fantasy series that began with THE PATH OF FLAMES - an adrenaline-fueled debut of sin casting mages, heresy, and cold-blooded betrayal in a land where the deepest buried secrets are finally resurfacing to destroy the world.",
