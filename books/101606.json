  "title": "Music Express: The Rise, Fall & Resurrection of Canada's Music Magazine",
  "description": "The story of Music Express, a magazine that promoted the Canadian and international music scene from 1976 until 1993, is experienced through the unique perspective of Keith Sharp, publisher. During the magazine's seventeen-year existence, it rose from being a small, Calgary-based regional magazine to an international publication. The interviews, anecdotes, and stories covered the golden era in Canadian music with the rise to global status of such icons as Bryan Adams, Loverboy, Rush, Celine Dion, and Triumph. Their stories, as well as many more, are captured together with an array of classic rock photography that provides a unique time capsule.From Sharp's Calgary roots in 1976 to the heady heights of his publication's growth, he details foreign adventures covering the likes of David Bowie in Australia, KISS in West Germany, and Iron Maiden in Poland, along with other high-profile interviews including Pink Floyd, U2, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, and Rod Stewart.",
