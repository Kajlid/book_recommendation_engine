Must be a spell, which I’ll break because I am not falling for him.Despite his reservations—and mine—we team up to go after the evil infesting my hometown. I don’t know about you, but I’ve got a problem with someone who thinks it’s okay to kill people to create a zombie army.Not on this baker’s watch. Time to whip up a batch of awesome to save the world.",
