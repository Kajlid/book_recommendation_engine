  "title": "I Have Heard My Praises Sung In Screams: The Paintings of the Mincing Mockingbird Volume II",
  "description": "Since 2007, painter Matt Adrian's work has focused on one birds. From the delightfully cute to the decidedly sinister, his minimalist avian portraits cast a fresh light on these ubiquitous creatures. Adrian's sharp wit and love for the absurd have elevated the titles of his paintings into a kind of bizarro poetry, taking on man's impact on nature, the tendency towards anthropomorphism, technology and modern human life. Few have dared to stare into the eye of a grackle and ride that icy, crazy blackness out the other side. Matt Adrian has done it. This lovingly assembled book presents the second collection of Adrian's best work.",
