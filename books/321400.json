  "title": "Under The Great Elm: A Life of Luck & Wonder",
  "description": "A lyrical, often astonishing tale of high adventure, of love lost and found, and a lifelong journey of enlightenment. Sweeping from the Illinois countryside to the plains and mountains of the American West, from the cafes of Paris to the Gaza Strip, and from the tropics of India to the rhythms of Broadway, this is a story of hope and inspiration for our time. Reminiscent in tone and spirit of nonfiction novels such as The Razor's Edge by Somerset Maugham, Rich Flanders' memoir is a swift tale of destiny, second chances, mystical synchronicities and interspecies encounters. Laced with a sense of wonder and humor, this is a compelling and unique masterpiece of nonfiction that all readers will enjoy.",
