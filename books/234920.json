Then that stupid alien egg had to blow up and ruin all of it.Now Rachel's brother is in a coma, and they have a tight-lipped raknoth telling them some fresh new hell is about to rain down on their headsâ€”one that gives even the raknoth nightmares. And that's when the strange ship shows up.No one knows where it came from. Only that it seems to be looking for something. And when it turns out that that 'something' might be Rachel and that the ship's mysterious crew are harboring secrets surrounding her mom's disappearance and the raknoth themselves . . . Well, it's safe to say their day's not about to get any less complicated.And one way or another, there's going to be hell to pay.HELL TO PAY is the second book in the Harvesters Series, an alien invasion adventure set on a post-apocalyptic Earth.
