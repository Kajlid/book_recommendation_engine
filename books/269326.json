  "description": "Virgil Flowers will have to watch his back--and his mouth--as he investigates a college culture war turned deadly in this thriller from #1 \"New York Times\" bestseller John Sandford.At the local state university, two feuding departments have faced off on the battleground of PC culture. Each carries their views to extremes that may seem absurd, but highly educated people of sound mind and good intentions can reasonably disagree, right?Then one of the department stars winds up dead, and Virgil Flowers is brought in to investigate . . . and he soon comes to realize he's dealing with people who, on this one particular issue, are functionally crazy. Among this group of wildly impassioned, diametrically opposed zealots lurks a killer, and it will be up to Virgil to sort the murderer from the mere maniacs.Librarian's note: as of 2021, there are 13 volumes in the author's Virgil Flowers series. The last was published in April 2021. It is part of the \"Prey\" series but Lucas Davenport and Virgil Flowers share the billing - \"Ocean Prey.\"",
