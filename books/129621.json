  "description": "The time has come. The witch is in need of an army to control the skyrunners, and she knows exactly what she needs to do. So, a cone army is grown in her lab. The clones are modified. They are strong, unstoppable, and completely emotionless. Only, one of the clones, a boy, is born with human emotions. The boy must train for several years, and learn to fight to the death, all while proving to the witch who created him—and to himself—that he is capable of evil. But the boy longs for freedom, to see the rest of the world, and the universe. When he meets, young Rayner Blake, he forms a plan to escape the witch's army and attempt to live a normal life. Only, little does he know, by doing so, he is putting himself and everyone he loves in great danger.",
