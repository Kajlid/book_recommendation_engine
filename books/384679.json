  "description": "STARbooks Press is proud to present HEELS OVER HEAD IN LOVE by JOHN BUTLER, an erotic novel that will make you think about enrolling in adult education.A college campus where the student body is overwhelmingly male is a good place for a perpetually horny man like John Harrison to be on the lookout for sex partners. Through a combination of daring, directness and diligence, he managed to lure a variety of handsome, hung, and equally horny young men into his bed - like the muscular blond beauty, Cary, the dark, marvelously endowed stallion, Mike, and after a long campaign, he even realized his ambitions with the soccer-playing Adonis, Mark. But it was Dean, a gloriously attractive and oversexed high-school student who gave the young professor the largest thrills. He was as tireless in satisfying his partner's sexual needs as he was in gratifying his own prodigious appetite, and the enormous equipment he used in providing his special kind of rapture was a major factor in the irresistible nature of his voracious lovemaking. His radiant sexuality attracted many other eager studs whom he freely shared with Harrison.Harrison's many lovers often met each other in his bed - often with four or five providing a critical mass of free-wheeling sexual joy - and the story culminates in a vast birthday orgy involving many of his past lovers as well as his current playmates. Tales of movie actors, porn stars, cock-hungry sailors, and athletes flesh out the main narrative of this story, which is a companion volume to the tale of John Harrison's earlier sexual escapades, found in John Butler's earlier STARbooks novel, Boys Hard at Work (and Playing with Fire).",
