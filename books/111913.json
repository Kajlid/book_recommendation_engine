  "description": "**Book 1 of the Wolf War Saga**“There was a time, Rebecca’s father had told her, when wolves could not speak. She wished for that time.”Rebecca O’Conner is the daugh­ter of a hero, a vet­eran sol­dier of The Wolf War. Now, she her­self is a Cap­tain in the Spe­cial Ani­mal War­fare Ser­vice (SAWS), fight­ing against the super intel­li­gent wolves that have all but destroyed humanity, as her father did.The Dogs Don’t Bark In Brook­lyn Any­more spans two peri­ods of Rebecca’s life; the tumul­tuous Brook­lyn child­hood that shapes her future, prepar­ing her for the sol­dier she must become, and her strug­gle to keep her­self and her squad alive as she pre­pares to meet her des­tiny. Her empir­i­cal mind rebels against the chaotic dreams that haunt her, sug­gest­ing a greater path than she can yet com­pre­hend as she seeks to find an end to the war.The enemy is smart, strong and fear­less; the odds are stacked against the human race. Is there hope for us in the war with the wolves? Will human­ity pre­vail and reclaim its place as the dom­i­nant species on Earth? Or will the great demonic hound that stalks Rebecca in her sleep close its jaws over the world and drive us to extinction?",
