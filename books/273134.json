To save humanity from extinction during the new Ice Age, four elemental dragons are tasked to find spirits and return Earth to its natural state.  1. Rise for Her I should send this human female home. But her innocent touch arouses my dragon beast, and he’s not letting her go.  2. Burn for Her I need a woman who lights my fire. Specifically, the spirit who’ll ignite my dragon’s fire element. The problem? Amy couldn’t be any less interested in me. But I'm gonna make her mine. Or die trying.  3. Storm for Her I know Arthur’s end game, but he’s hiding something. Maybe afraid I’ll steal his spirit. He’s right. If I find her first, she’s mine.   4. Fight for Her  He risks everything to save her life with a Cyborg implant. Now she is the most dangerous Cyborg in existence. And she is his enemy.  PLUS Eddy, story #2.5  is included.",
