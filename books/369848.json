  "title": "The Legend of Brynhild",
  "description": "THE definitive (English-language) book on the Volsung-Nibelung cycle of legends. This is good, solid philology not so much a critical analysis of the works but an essential volume on sources, textual transmissions, variations, and so forth. Beside the simple -- but very important -- fact that the story of the Volsungs and Nibelungs is one of the great tragic-heroic legends of the world, what is unique about studying this cycle is the opportunity it gives us for examining the \"same\" legend as it manifests itself throughout an all-but bewildering variety of versions, spread over numerous centuries and across several different geographic regions. Andersson's is a fascinating, highly detailed work.",
