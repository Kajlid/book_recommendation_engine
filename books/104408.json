  "title": "The Cat Rule Book",
  "description": "Of all the cat books on the market, this is the one that will tell you what your cat is really thinking. Cats have been seen as mysterious and inscrutable characters for many centuries, yet they live by a set of rules that have developed through the ages. They make perfect sense once you find out what they are. For the first time in history, one cat has broken ranks to put them into print. Dictated to his human servant, Lucky the Cat has shared the text of The Cat Rule Book in a form that is invaluable for any human who is in service to a cat. For the first time ever, humans are to be allowed into the secret doctrine of cat-ness and to understand why a cat asks for food and then dances round the cat bowl, sleeps in weird places and positions and meows to be let through a door that was just opened for him a moment before. If you only buy one cat book this year, make it this one. No other book will give you as much insight into the mind of your cat than The Cat Rule Book.",
