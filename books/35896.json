  "description": "This is the 2nd Ballantine printing.Cover Artists: Tim and Greg HildebrandtSequel to The War ChiefFrom inside cover of Ballantine first edition:Shoz-Dijiji, the Black Bear... a white man who believed himself to be a full blooded Apache, and who had dedicated his life to a feud against the treacherous \"white eyes\" who had invaded his country and destroyed his family... To the pony soldiers and to white travellers he became known as the Apache Devil, a pitiless scourge who swept in, killed, took his vengeance, and slipped away without a trace. Thus Shoz-Dijiji, the adopted son of Geronimo, was honored in his tribe. And even among his sworn enemies there were those who called him just, and a friend. One of these was a woman--who loved Sho-Dijiji. But she was white--an impossible obstacle to the racial pride of an Apache warrior. So Sho-Dijiji continued to live his life of hate and loyalty and love, of running fights, of massacre and torture; until at last even the tribe of Geronimo signed a peace treaty with the white men--and Sho-Dijiji learned that the woman he loved had been stolen by renegade white outlaws. Then Sho-Dijiji hunted as he had never hunted before.",
