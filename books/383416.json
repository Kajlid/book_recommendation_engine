  "title": "Double Life: The Story of a Fifty Year Marriage",
  "description": "\"I adored Double Life from its opening sentence, and so will you! I laughed and gasped at its inside-show-business stories and was intrigued by the cutthroat advertising and art world gossip. Brilliantly written, filled with humorand occasional heartbreak. I know it's corny, but block out a day to read this book because once started, you won't be able to put this down.\"Joan Rivers\nDouble Life chronicles a fifty-year love story between a top Hollywood executive and a Madison Avenue ad man-turned-acclaimed painter. It's a relationship that was formed at a time when there were no role models for them to emulate. The story begins in a $50 a month walk-up flat in New York and moves to Los Angeles, Palm Springs, and Malibu. The book is filled with stories of the art world and show business: anecdotes about people like Lena Horne, Marlon Brando, Richard Chamberlain, Laurence Olivier, Truman Capote, Katharine Hepburn, Barbra Streisand, Helen Hayes, Bette Davis, Mike Nichols, Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, and many others. All told, it is a funny, moving adventure that tells the true story of a same sex union and how it contributes to the life of all of us.\nAlan Shayne is a former Broadway actor and casting agent who for ten years held the position of president of Warner Brothers Television. Norman Sunshine is an Emmy Awardwinning designer and former advertising executive whose work as a visual artist is widely collected. The authors live in Washington, Connecticut.",
