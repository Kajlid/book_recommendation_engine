  "description": "Our perfect society is tainted.I run because I don’t have a choice. I run for those who can’t, for those inside me.The Three-Faced God should have chosen my fate and molded me according to the needs of my fellow Malthusians. I should have been at least a beta, but never this.They believed changing my body would bend my spirit, making me compliant through their abuse and experimentation. Some submit and die, claiming it’s divine will. I know better. A Malthusian caused this, one of my own kind. They think they’ve won, but I triumph simply by surviving another second, another day. But can I endure alone? Fate is the first book in Malthusia, a dark dystopian mm series where the solution to overpopulation damns those caught up in the theory.HFN ending.",
