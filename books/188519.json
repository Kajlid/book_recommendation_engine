  "description": "Sammy Franklin has always been in touch with her inner sex goddess. She hasn't been afraid of her sexuality since she was a teenager. Only a man has violated her trust. Confused and not really understanding why she feels safe with only one man. The very last man she should feel safe with a biker who's so Alpha he seems to bleed it. Now she needs to decide if she should give in to her passions or walk away.   Animal Harris knows he's not a knight in shining armor but something about Sammy makes him wish he could be. It isn't her smile and it's not the strawberry blonde hair that he's desperate to see flowing across his pillows, either. It's that she wants someone to make her submit and he's just the Dom to do it. Only she's been hurt and he is the last man who should be helping a woman with that kind of pain. He has to decide if he is willing to let her go or if he will let his inner beast have her.   Be aware light to medium bondage. No S&M. Dom/sub relationship.",
