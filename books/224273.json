  "description": "\"This volume may be the best that America has to offer today. Buy this book, read it, treasure it.\"â€• Philadelphia Inquirer The early poems, long unavailable in any edition, sound themes that have always engaged Kunitz: life's meaning, the relation of time to eternity, kinship with nature, and loss, most poignantly that of his father. But despite the power of his poems about loss, Kunitz remains ardent in celebrating life. He fully lives up to his own advice to younger poets \"to persevere, then explore. Be explorers all your life.\"",
