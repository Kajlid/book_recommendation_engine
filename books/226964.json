  "description": "Poised to invade the neighboring city, smarting from the betrayal and eager to avenge the offense, Tenochtitlan was boiling, causing Necalli to glow with excitement and expectation and Miztli to brood and worry about the safety of his Tlatelolcan girl. His troubles in school and the hatred of the notorious local bully did not gain much of his attention, mistakenly so. It all might have ended badly but for the mysterious stranger, a spectacular scar-faced warrior with unclear means and intentions.  In the meanwhile, unsure if her note reached its recipient, Tlemilli tried to do something about it in her typical reckless fashion, determined to let the Tenochtitlan boy know that she wasn’t angry, that he must come and find her again. If to dive into the worst of the politics in the city facing an inevitable invasion was the means to do that, she didn’t even hesitate. However, the actual warring on the streets turned out to be nothing that she might have anticipated, and this time, the imperial wife, her adored sister’s wellbeing was at stake, increasing her determination to find that Tenochtitlan boy and make him help them both somehow.",
