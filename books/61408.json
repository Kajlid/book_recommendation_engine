  "description": "Two men. Spies. An American. A German.The year is 1942. The world is at war.In New York City, the German spy is following Nazi orders, climbing the corporate ladder. He has it all. A loving wife. A good job. A tidy house on Long Island. Everything is perfect. Until one night when his wife discovers his shocking secret. In Germany, one of the U.S. Army’s deadliest commandos parachutes to earth. His mission: wreaking havoc from behind enemy lines. But something goes terribly wrong during his jump, leaving him with a lethal injury and a crucial choice. It’s kill or be discovered. He makes the ruthless decision, killing two innocents without hesitation, knowing he’ll never be the same again.Two years later, sufficiently chastened, the two men independently claw their way back to relevance. Through meticulous analysis, the American learns of the German’s existence. He’s a soldier now, wearing the American uniform, murdering senior officers under the cloak of battle.As the parallel plots converge, the American doggedly stalks the German spy. First to Europe. Then to France. The killings intensify. A major. A colonel. A general.The hunt narrows from division, to regiment, to company. It’s a hunt for a vicious killer. It’s a hunt for the American’s doppelgänger.",
