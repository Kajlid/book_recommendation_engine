  "description": "Guinevere is widely acknowledged as the most extraordinary woman in legend. From golden child to Queen of Camelot to passionate adulterer, her life is a vivid an fascinating saga. In this spellbinding climax to the tale of Guinevere--which began with Guinevere and continued in The Chessboard Queen --Sharan Newman, author of the highly acclaimed Catherine LeVendeur medieval mystery series, blends magic and history to create and unforgettable tale of passion and tragedy.Here we see the discover of Guinevere's affair with Lancelot and her subsequent fall from grace; the near-futile quest for the Holy rail; and the triumph of Galahad in a final battle with the villainous Mordred. Guinevere Evermore is a heartrending portrayal of a failed romance, a fallen woman, and the end of an era. Sharan Newman's reinterpretation of the Arthurian saga is as ambitious and persuasive as The Mists of Avalon and The Hollow Hills --just as memorable.",
