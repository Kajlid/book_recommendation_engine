  "description": "These aren't your daddy's zombies! Everything they grab hold of burns. Everyone they touch dies. Everything they kill comes back from the dead.They are The Melting Dead, wherein Angela Roskowic, a Chicago theatrical director and fanatical horror movie fan, and Professor Paul Rigas, a vacationing geologist, along with a crazy group of innocent, and not so innocent, characters are trapped on a secluded Mississippi River island infested with blood-thirsty incendiary monsters, humans transformed by cosmic radiation, in this B-movie between book covers. A roller-coaster ride; a tale of terror to burst the heart with fear and make the sides ache with laughter.And, as a BONUS for horror fans, woven throughout the prose are references to over 600 horror, science-fiction, and fantasy films. Relish the novel, fight the fear, and find them all - if you dare.",
