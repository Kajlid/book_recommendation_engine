  "title": "The Philosopher's Daughter",
  "description": "Lori Desrosiers' father, a Professor of Philosophy and a Psychiatrist, died young (when Lori was 28) of brain cancer. His life and death are the inspiration for these poems that read like skillfully drawn postcards. The poet's family and thoughts arrive, page by page, in intimate, clear-eyed meditations. This volume invites the reader to witness the poet's journey from girl to woman; from The Philosophers Daughter to Philosopher.",
