  "title": "Dominoes: Part 3",
  "description": "Ardina flees Bakersfield, Jenna is taken to Grass Valley, and Sally succumbs to another breakdown as the trail of fallen dominoes lengthens in part three of this tumultuous tale.  All characters in this novel are fictional and any similarity to a living person is completely coincidental. Please note that all but the ending pages of this book were written in 2012, and the novel was copyrighted before the Supreme Court overruled California’s Proposition 8, therefore references to California’s marriage laws reflect conditions during the time period between the passage of Proposition 8 and the Supreme Court’s recent ruling.",
