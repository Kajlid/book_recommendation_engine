  "description": "THE PERFECT WEAPON HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN.  Jarrod Hawkins is ushered into an underground facility, where the world’s greatest minds use his body for biotechnological research. They use genetic editing, nanomachinery, neural rewriting, and next-generation armor to turn him into the most fearsome weapon on earth. But as they push the limits of human performance and lethality, the facility begins to experience unexpected power outages. Evidence of sabotage appears all over the building, and the security team is plagued with sickening pranks. There is only one explanation—their creation has turned against them.  As the experiment nears its completion, Jarrod struggles to understand his new abilities. His memories have been shattered, but his instincts scream at him to escape at any cost. On the outside, he has become a machine of war, but inside, the remnant of his former self fights for control. As a team of surgeons prepare for a final operation, Jarrod must make a choice: Will he let them take control of his mind, or will he use his enhancements to break free? Will he become a perfect soldier, or the most fearsome vigilante the world has ever known?",
