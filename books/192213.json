  "description": "Michael Kingston had a gift for languages, and at 17 enlisted and was drafted into the secret service, under Hambledon. They engineered the murder of a scientist breeding cholera germs, the arson of a Zepp plant, and the murder of Bodenheim. The death of Hambledon and of a German girl brought the wheel of murder full circle, and Kingston found himself haunted by blue devils when the Armistice came, unable to come to grips with himself or life.",
