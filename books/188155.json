  "title": "Prison post: Letters of support for Peter Greste",
  "description": "While foreign correspondent Peter Greste is free in Australia following his deportation from Egypt in February, he was convicted on terrorism charges in absentia on August 29, 2015. The campaign to clear his name and those of imprisoned Al Jazeera colleagues Baher Mohamed and Mohamed Fahmy continues.After the three were found guilty of reporting false news and endangering Egypt’s national security at the end of the first trial in June 2014, the Greste family set up an email account for messages of support they could print out to take to Peter in prison. The trickle of emails that had begun with his arrest the previous December increased exponentially. Peter was staggered by the range and spirit of the notes.“Whenever I find my resolve wavering; whenever I feel weak or angry or frustrated; whenever I lose sight of the ‘why’, I only need to dip into the huge pile of letters for the answer,\" he said. \"You’ve all given us and our families enormous strength; and for that I am hugely grateful.\"Now, readers will be moved by the emails just as Peter was. They can learn more about the award-winning journalist through the writings of friends and colleagues, and revisit the 400 days he spent in prison through the eyes of supporters. There are letters from names we recognise, like Wendy Harmer, Kaz Cooke, Tracey Spicer and Julie Bishop, and from ordinary women, men and children who hoped that stories from their everyday lives might make Peter's time in prison more bearable.•\tProfits from this book will assist the Foreign Prisoner Support Service.",
