  "title": "John Jay: The Forgotten Founder",
  "description": "As the third century of American history develops, it is essential to renew our knowledge of and respect for the beliefs upon which this country was founded and the great men who propounded them. The most significant Founding Fathers of our country George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, and John Jay. Jay is the least known today; however, in his time, he was considered by many to be the logical successor to Washington as chief executive of the new country. Among the positions he held president of the Continental Congress, minister plenipotentiary to Spain, member of the peace commission which negotiated the 1783 Treaty of Paris, secretary for foreign affairs, co-author of The Federalist, first chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, and two-term Governor of New York. In retirement, he was president of the American Bible Society. This detailed account of John Jay examines his life, his character, and his legacy. A chronology and a bibliography enhance the text.",
