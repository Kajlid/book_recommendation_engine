Sent to sea as a young boy after the loss of his father, Tom knows nothing but life on tall ships, and is determined to captain his own. On shore leave while his ship is being repaired, Tom is struck by the discovery of a delicate glove laced with the unmistakable scent of turpentine.

While Tom’s work breathes life into the world around him through perfectly crafted detail, Catherine’s art is bold and vivid.
