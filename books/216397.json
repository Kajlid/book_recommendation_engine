  "description": "When a distant planet’s ownership is in dispute, conquering aliens turn defiant human males into pampered sex slaves.Frey Bjorkson is an orphan from New World Colony Five. While making a supply run, he’s been captured by a Travian privateer and kept as a pet. Brutalized, he fights to hold on to his sanity and hope of escaping. His hopes are all but dashed when his master loses him to another, scarier male.Having lost his mate, Rone has given up his old military ambitions. Instead, he’s volunteered to pose as a privateer to root out the arms suppliers of the traitorous males trying to overthrow female rule. When he becomes the reluctant master to a human pet, he has little patience for caring for the scared, battered creature. That doesn’t stop him from wanting the boy, and, as he sets about claiming the human as his property, he finds himself getting in deeper than he’d intended.Not only does Rone prove to be kinder, he also gives Frey his first experience with sexual pleasure. The way Rone makes him feel, physically and emotionally, confuses Frey. He fights against his growing attraction even while he struggles to learn just what his master’s true agenda is.As Rone infiltrates the dangerous world of privateers, he reluctantly drags Frey in with him. He tells himself that he needs the cover of being a brutal slave owner, but there is no denying his growing need for the boy. As Rone’s mission heats up, the stakes are high, and the alien master and his captive pet will have to work together to survive.Reader Advisory: This book contains sex scenes of both non-consensual and dubious consent, as well as scenes of violence, abuse and torture.",
