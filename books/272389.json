  "description": "I’m just a girl trying to survive. Dying? Unexpected. Coming back to life? Even more so. Now these four snarky demons are haunting me. Shirtless.  It turns out you can die and live again. At least I can.  When a night out goes murderously wrong, I chose leaping to my death over getting tortured. Except it turns out I don’t die like everyone else.  I’m a phoenix — or so they tell me. Apparently I need training at the Phoenix Academy.  What I really need is to get rid of the four demons haunting me wherever I go, showing up when my heart is beating fast — whether I’m nervous, afraid, or well... other things.  But I also wouldn’t mind learning how to light things on fire with my mind or take out a man twice my size with my bare hands. All things the instructors at the academy want to teach me... if I can survive long enough.  Because there’s something deadly lurking in these halls, and it’s coming for me next.  Welcome to the first year at Phoenix Academy, a place where the paranormal lives — and dies — and lives again.  This paranormal reverse harem contains mature themes, a few violent scenes, and no choosing. Reader discretion advised.",
