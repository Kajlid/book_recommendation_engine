  "description": "Dr. Jeff Jacobs has returned from Russia an American hero, albeit three years into the future beyond his own time. To his surprise, his reception is less than celebratory. In fact, he learns not only that is he the sole person on the planet who knows what he's accomplished, but that the government has somehow adopted his technology to create the U.S. Time Program, a time travel tourism toy for the super-wealthy. And for the first time, a USTP mission has gone wrong and the program leaders need Jeff's expertise to fix it. As Jeff remains steadfast in his plans to learn how his time device ended up in California, the dangers of time travel become more and more apparent. His worst fears are realized and he must navigate a perilous road of deception, mistrust and a reality that could change around everyone without anyone knowing it was happening.",
