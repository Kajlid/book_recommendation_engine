  "description": "Misty just left the gay bar alone, too shy to approach anyone. Again. Tipsy with only her cat for company, she checks out the F4F ads. In the morning, she agrees to meet up with someone... but which ad did this Opal girl post, again?  A few months after a big move, Opal hasn't managed to meet people in her new city. Adrift without her sorority sisters and keg parties, the loneliness drives her to the online personals. She's only looking for a friend... so why did this Misty girl send her a winky face?  Once Misty and Opal meet up, Opal quickly decides theyâ€™ll be BFFs. Meanwhile, Misty's crushing on her. Will Misty figure out Opal's straight before falling even harder? Or will Opal realize the connection they share goes deeper than friendship?  (Femme 4 Femme is a 45,000-word standalone friends-to-lovers lesbian romance, complete with lots of heat and a happily ever after ending.)",
