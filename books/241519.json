  "title": "The Sacred Revival: Magic, Mind & Meaning in a Technological Age",
  "description": "The Sacred Revival is a thought-provoking examination of the social, cultural, and personal development that is part of a new and unfolding era in our history. Its central thesis is that a new form of energy has entered our post-industrial (post-mechanical) epoch, and that this energy will be more conducive to a respect for feminine attributes and organization and our inward “interior search and gaze.” The author predicts there will be a healing of life on the planet from an emerging new planetary ecosystem that will be physical-digital-biological and a greater drive toward a coherent cosmic consciousness. He explains that one of our greatest needs is for a connection with the transcendent.",
