  "description": "Trurl and Klaupacius are constructor robots who try to out-invent each other. They travel to the far corners of the cosmos to take on freelance problem-solving jobs, with dire consequences for their employers. Asking their machine that can do anything to do nothing almost destroys the universe. Lem creates other cybernetic triumphs - laser-eyed beasts, dragons of improbability, electronic bards, and involuted story-telling machines that never finish a tale - brilliantly funny examples of his talent for intellectual slapstick, bizarre invention, and keen insight.'The most completely successful of his books... here Lem comes closest to inventing a real universe' - Boston Globe",
