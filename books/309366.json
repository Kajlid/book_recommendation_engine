  "description": "After everything I did for her—she betrayed me.I looked my brother in the eye and lied to his face to save her, and in return, she decided to return to the camp and burn it to the ground. All of our hard work—just gone. My own brother tortured me as punishment in front of the other guards, and then ordered me to rebuild the camp with my bare hands.Now I’m back in the camp—and so is she. If she thought my brother wouldn’t retaliate, she was wrong. His men grabbed her from her apartment and brought her back here—to work for the rest of her life. All she had to do was enjoy the freedom I gave her—but that was too hard. She tries to talk to me. Tries to apologize to me. I ignore every word. This woman used to be so important to me that I risked everything to save her—and now I couldn’t care less if she lives or dies.But when the guards begin to torture her in retaliation, it’s hard to look away. When they threaten to do horrific things to her, it’s hard to ignore. As I watch her struggle to survive every single day, my heart softens from stone. I know if I don’t protect her, unspeakable things will happen.I thought I was angry enough to look away—but maybe I’m not.Pick up your copy now by clicking the BUY NOW button at the top of this page.
