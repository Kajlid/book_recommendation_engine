  "description": "Parables picks up Jesus' story at around twenty years of age. We learn how Jesus became a master teacher. Jesus did not speak without telling parables. He told stories of good people who went bad; bad people who went good; stories with sad outcomes and glad ones. He taught by contrast: this is a good person, that is a bad one. He didnâ€™t lecture. He told stories.",
