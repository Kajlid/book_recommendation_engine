Without the support of the local church in those early days, Mama's life could have continued down this dark path; as it was, she and her mother had barely enough to get by. Mama grew to despise poverty and everything that it the selfishness and greed of the wealthy, and the shocking effects it had on the poor.Devoting her life to eradicating poverty while refusing to accept it as simply a fact of life, Mama would come to establish the Huruma Children's Home in Kenya, a children's shelter that continues to perform the same function as the church did in Mama's protecting the helpless children and teaching them to make the world a better place.",
