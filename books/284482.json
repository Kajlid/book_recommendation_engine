  "title": "The Anthill",
  "description": "An intoxicating literary ghost story told through the eyes of a young woman returning to her former homeland of Colombia to seek redemption for a past she can't entirely remember.Twenty-eight year old Lina has come home to the country of her childhood. Sent away from Colombia to England after her mother's death twenty years before, she's searching for a connection to herself and to the one person who can help her make sense of their shared past. She's never forgotten Matty--her childhood friend and protector who now runs the Anthill, a daycare refuge for the street kids of Medell√≠n. Lina begins volunteering there, but her reunion with Matty is not what she had imagined. He has no interest in discussing the past and his secretive behaviour puts Lina on guard. Soon strange happenings start taking place at the Anthill: scratches on the supply closet door, disturbing crayon drawings and sightings of a small, dirty boy with pointy teeth. Is Lina losing her grip on reality, or is something more sinister going on? Did she ever really understand what happened to her mother? Or to Matty?A visceral, hallucinatory ride by an author who has been called \"blunt, fresh and unsentimental\" (The New York Times Book Review) and \"remarkably inventive\" (The Atlantic),  The Anthill asks what it means to belong and how a person--or a country--can heal from the horrors visited upon them.",
