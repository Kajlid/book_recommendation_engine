  "description": "What happens when the legend you love, becomes the man you hate? Camilla:Do I love Rhett Steele? Absolutely not. Do I like Rhett Steele? Not even close. Do I hate Rhett Steele? Yes. This is the man who destroyed my world, shattering my dreams the very first time I met him. It’s like he purposely pushes buttons I don’t even realize exist. I wouldn’t live with him if he were the last man on earth. Then how did he end up being my newest most hated roommate? Rhett:My singing career is tanking, my fans are turning against me, and I’m told I need to clean up my image. I should have done it with America’s sweetheart on my arm. But what’s the fun in that? Instead, I turn to the woman who hates me more than anyone. I’ve already hit rock bottom, I can only go up from here, or so I thought.",
