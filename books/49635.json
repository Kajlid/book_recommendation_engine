  "description": "It's a human eat human world out there. Can Adrienne protect herself and the young boy she befriends from both the dead and the living? Awaking from an apparent fugue to find herself in a world populated by the undead, Adrienne quickly learns that, in order to survive, one must eat the dead -- before they eat you. Embarking on a hunt for survival and meaning, Adrienne struggles to stay alive, remain sane, and still preserve her humanity.Flesh Eaters is an irreverent tale of zombies, cannibalism, and self-consumption. Mixing survival horror with smatterings of postmodernism, existentialism, and black humor, Alisha Adkins, in this debut novella, weaves a graphic and disturbing story while also making a powerful statement about humanity.",
