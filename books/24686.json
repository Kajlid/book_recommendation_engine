  "description": "A dog with a flatulence problem wasn’t high on Judy Bowen’s wish list of Mother’s Days gifts, no matter how cute the canine. So imagine her surprise when the spa gift her eldest daughter, Norma, usually gave her was substituted with a little dog named Crankshaft who suffers from tummy trouble. In Pull My Paw, the second Holidays From Hell short story from Sue Ann Jaffarian, the crazy Bowen clan is at it again, celebrating another holiday with arguments and angst in the shadow of their still missing husband and father. When middle daughter Zelda steps in to sort it all out, she learns that good things really do come in small packages – small, hairy, smelly packages.",
