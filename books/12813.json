  "description": "Two randy young wolfmen want my burrow -- and me. And they aren’t planning to take no for answer.The world fell apart after a virus killed billions and turned most male survivors into violent wolfmen. Five of us, my family, found refuge in an abandoned bomb shelter. Over the last three years I’ve lost them all. Now I’m trapped here. Alone.Food stores running low, I resolved I would not die down here in the stark silence of my burrow. I know there are dangers outside: wild animals, fatal injuries, and worst of all, the beasts that had once been men. Wild, feral creatures infected with a virus that turns normal men into half animal beasts.But I need to feel the sun on my face, hear the whispers of the wind as it caresses my skin. To smell the earth, the flowers, the freshness after it rains. To know life goes on outside my isolated tomb. It’s worth the risk of a horrid death for even one hour of such ecstasy.I never imagined coming face to face with two young beasts. They want my burrow -- and me. And they aren’t planning to take no for an answer. It would seem my loneliness has ended. At least until they realize what a burden I will be. In a world where only the strongest survive, I’m excess baggage. Unless I can convince them otherwise.",
