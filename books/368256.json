Together, in a treetop sanctuary, they would learn the importance of trust, and forgiveness--and moonlight... Noah LeCroix, half-French and half-Cherokee is convinced he's the oldest living male virgin in southern Illinois and certain he's destined to be alone forever...until one fateful night when he hears a bone chilling scream from the depths of the swamp.Olivia Bond is on the run from a terrible year as a captive in a whorehouse in New Orleans. Hopelessly lost, Olivia is unconscious by the time Noah finds her, a disgraced heroine who finds freedom in forgiveness and the love of a reclusive hero who dares to stay and give his heart when running would be easier.Note: this is a re-issue of a classic \"old school\" style historical romance with explicit love scenes.
