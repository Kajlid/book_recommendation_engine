  "description": "The night we met, I instantly wanted to know the brunette bombshell’s deepest secrets. She was pure temptation, and I was mesmerized by her soulful bedroom eyes. As one drink led to two, I craved more of her playful banter and taunting lips. Resisting her wasn't an option, and we quickly became a desperate mess of tangled limbs and hot kisses. Once it became obvious that meeting her wasn't a coincidence, everything changed. After years of keeping her at a distance, I want to pull her close as a threat emerges in her life. I’ll do whatever it takes to keep her safe, to show her I'm the good guy, but one night takes a tragic turn for the worse when her boyfriend and I start throwing punches. And it ends when I’m arrested for his murder.TRULY MINE is book 1 in the Mason & Sophie duet and must be read first.",
