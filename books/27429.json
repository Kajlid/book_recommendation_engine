  "description": "Jarod Greene doesn’t know anything about love, but that didn’t stop him from taking an IT intern from the FBI up against the wall in a moment of confusion and passion. It certainly didn’t keep him from asking the wide-eyed intern to be his kept lover. And it’s not like Chris Wilkinson’s job or life was going anywhere. Why wouldn’t he want to be the kept man of the most powerful mob boss in Los Angeles? But Chris Wilkinson is more than he appears, and so is Jarod Greene.In the City of Angels, where every foundation is cemented in lies, two men whose first words to each other were false are about to find out how far they’ll go to discover the truth—because nothing true comes without a price to be paid in blood, and that’s especially true if you’re the Godfather’s lover.",
