  "title": "Thrown to the Lions: Volume One",
  "description": "Money. Excitement. Duty. Lust. Four men have agreed to be thrown to the local pride of werelions. Each man might have had a different motive when he first applied for the position of willing human sacrifice, but one thing is guaranteed—once a man is delivered, bound and naked, to the lions' doorstep, he’s destined to receive much more than he ever bargained for. And, as for the lions who accept their sacrifices—from the leader of the pride, all the way down to the meekest cub, they're about to find out just how much trouble humans can be. This volume contains the first two stories from the series: Ryland’s Sacrifice & Marrick’s Promise. Principles don't pay tuition fees. When Ryland's math scholarship disappears overnight, he has two choices. He can borrow money from fellow student Jason Burrows, who has very interesting ways of collecting debts. Or, he can volunteer to be thrown to the werelions. One night spent playing the part of a willing human sacrifice will give him enough money to finish his PhD. It seems like a good deal...right up until the moment he finds himself naked, blindfolded, bound and surrounded by lions. Marrick thinks that being thrown to the lions will be the ultimate adrenaline rush, and he’s not disappointed. But his plan is to try everything life has to offer once. He has no intention of visiting the lions again. Blaine and Luther don’t expect to give any of the human sacrifices they share another thought once they leave the den. This man’s different. They have no intention of letting this one go. The only question is, while they are willing to share Marrick with each other, are they willing to share each other with a human who could become as important to each of them as they are to each other?",
