The night the barrier between the dead and the living is as thin as muslin, Josie's convinced she will come away with proof of her mother's spirit at last when the evening takes an unexpected turn as the teens gravitate four ways into the haunted grounds.Set against the backdrop of the rainy Pacific Northwest, four graves will be rubbed, touching off a series of events that will rattle their once mundane lives. From the lonely World War II hero to an accused witch, the people buried beneath the stones have stories that need an ending. The journey to unravel the mysteries leaves the friends wondering if the graves would've been better off left alone.",
