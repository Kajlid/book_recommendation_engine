How could I have been so wrong? He used me. Humiliated me. Then my parents threw me out. I’d hit rock bottom when Thunder found me. He didn’t just get me off the bridge that night. He saved me in every way that counted. He’s my rock. My hero. My everything. I only hope one day he’ll come to love me as much as I love him.Thunder -- My club is my life. My family. And I’ll do anything for them. But I’ve kept a secret. Something from my past. Before I became a Dixie Reaper. When Portia asks for help, I can’t deny her. So I go out into the storm. I didn’t realize the impact it would have on me. Seeing Amity on the bridge, ready to jump, brought it all back. Now I’ll save her because I have no other choice. I failed in the past. I won’t this time. One look in her eyes, and I know she’s meant to be mine. I will lay her demons to rest. Get revenge for her and our baby. Every man who’s touched her, hurt her, will answer to me. And I’m sending them all straight to hell.WARNING: Thunder is part of the Dixie Reapers MC series and contains adult content some readers may find difficult to read.
