Apple, Jr., of The New York Times credits third-generation Alabamian Frank Stitt with turning Birmingham into a \"sophisticated, easygoing showplace of enticing, southern-accented cooking.\" His southern peers think his cooking may have a more profound sense of place than any of theirs. His food is rustic and homey, but sophisticated in method.Now, Alabama's favorite son has written a long-awaited cookbook that features his enticing Proven√ßal-influenced southern food. More than 150 recipes range from the traditional--Spicy Green Tomato and Peach Relish, Spoonbread, and Pickled Shrimp--to the inspired--Slow-Roasted Black Grouper with Ham and Pumpkin Pirlau and Pork Loin with Corn Pudding and Grilled Eggplant. Desserts such as Bourbon Panna Cotta and Sweet Potato Tart with Coconut Crust and Pecan Streusel elevate the best of the South for cooks everywhere.",
