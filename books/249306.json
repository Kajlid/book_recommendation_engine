  "description": "When Martha returns to the homestead after five years away at school, the excitement of her arrival is somewhat overshadowed. There’s a new pack in town who appear friendly enough but something about them raises both the Alphas hackles. But any reservations about their new neighbors don’t stop Martha from falling for the charms of the handsome wolf set on seducing her.  With his stubborn daughter intent on giving up her future plans, his youngest son out of control and Ephraim not doing much better, Caleb struggles to keep his family together, risking his relationship with Jacob in the process. And, of course, the surprise guest that Martha brings with her doesn’t help matters either.  And as for Martha, her whole life has been an adventure of books and learning, until Albert captures her heart. But while she wrestles with her feelings, there’s a constant presence waiting in the wings. Someone that will catch her if she falls. Someone that always has, and always will. If she’ll let him.  No matter how far you go, there will always be a home for you in my heart.  70+K words Not an M/F Romance",
