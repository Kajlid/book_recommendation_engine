  "description": "Annie Beiler is a spunky, spirited schoolteacher, but she's struggled ever since the man she was promised to \"jumped the fence\" and left the Amish of Seymour. She needs a man who is committed to his Amish beliefs. And now, she's struggling to regain the trust of the school board members and the parents of her pupils for taking her class on an unauthorized field trip to a nearby Civil War battlefield. She's put on probation, and one wrong step could cost her the position permanently.Joshua Esh of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, moved to Missouri ostensibly as part of the man swap meant to bring new blood into the community. Annie Beiler caught his attention the moment he arrived in Seymour, but he's disheartened to discover that she is promised to another man Luke, who left the Amish but vowed to return one day and claim \"his\" Annie. So, Josh fills his social calendar with singings and frolics, taking a different girl home from every event with the exception of Annie, since she is already committed to someone.When Luke comes home, Annie pushes him away, and Josh Esh comes to her rescue. But the situation becomes awkward, since Josh is staying with Luke's family. An awareness of each other's attraction to Annie causes the awkwardness to escalate, and Annie's father soon invites Josh to stay with his family. But not all of the Beilers are happy about this new arrangement",
