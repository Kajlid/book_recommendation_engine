  "description": "David Johanssen is a hard up journalist whose drinking problem goes beyond the usual need for self-medication. He sees things he shouldn’t be able to see, that no one could handle seeing — and he has no one but himself to blame for opening the door to them. When the possibility of answers is dangled in front of him, his reporter's instinct won't let him ignore it. Even if it takes him to hell--proverbially speaking--and back.A stunning piece of supernatural noir from Alan Baxter, now available from The Red Penny Papers.",
