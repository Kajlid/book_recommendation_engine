  "description": "The wedding is four months away, and Ethan has promised to train Sam to handle a planned honeymoon activity. He’s calculated the math to figure out her goals each week. When she reaches the weekly target she gets a massage and lots of fun orgasms. But if she doesn’t, it’s the stainless steel cane. All this along with navigating her clients’ drama, planning a wedding, dealing with her mother, and having lots and lots of wild and kinky sex. And we haven’t even mentioned the bachelorette party.",
