  "description": "Acclaimed illustrator Rick Geary tackles of one the most controversial cases of the 20th century with The Lives of Sacco & Vanzetti . Anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti were accused and arrested for robbery and murder, but so many supposedly damning pieces of evidence were questionable, and the pair’s eventual guilty verdict elicited massive protests around the world. Geary presents readers with all the twists and turns, appeals, and dubious evidence, giving a human face of the two men—who were demonized by many and martyrized by others—in his usual, unflappable style.",
