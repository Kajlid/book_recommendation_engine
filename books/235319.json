They commit crimes to line their pockets and sin to warm their beds. They use foul language, wield weapons like utensils, and every single character's morals are questionable at best. This is a dark romance. There may be triggers, so if you are easily offended, this story may be too much for you.If you're still here, bienvenidos! The cartel is waiting...**The Carrera Cartel books are all standalones and can be read out of sequence. However, if you prefer to avoid spoilers, it's highly recommended that you read them in order.",
