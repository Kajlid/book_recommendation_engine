Two gorgeous hunks, one dark and surly, the other blond and bright, lived to please and sexually fulfill you? What if you burned with passion like a cat in heat and only these two alpha males could satisfy you? What if you found out they were shape-shifters and so were you?” ~ Eliza ~Mackenzie’s ménage fantasy comes to life when she’s snowbound with Sky Castle Lodge partners, Adam and Trent. One golden, one surly, the alpha males vie for her attention. For Kenzie, the strange sensations, the sexual need, and the awkwardness all make sense when she discovers she's a shape-shifter. Adam and Trent supported each other through their first metamorphosis, and agree to guide Kenzie safely through hers. But when they turn, Were males don’t share. Kenzie must choose between them, or they’ll fight to the death. Accepting that she is meant for both of them, they have one other option. Adam can submit sexually to Trent, becoming his submissive. Kenzie can help them through the sexual boundaries, but what will it do to the men’s friendship? Or the balance in their ménage relationship?",
