  "description": "Jazz has never been known as a good boy.A good drinker. A good partier. A damned good builder, and a hell of a good liar. Those are all descriptions that come to mind when the citizens of Loudon, Tennessee, think of the tall, muscular, laughter-filled charmer they know as Jazz. And Jazz will admit to all of them: he likes to play; he likes to tease. And a little white lie surely never hurt anyone.Until the sexy, too-shy kindergarten teacher, Annie. Annie sets fire to his lusts as well as to his heart. But Annie has a past he wasnâ€™t aware of. A past that will draw Jazz into the heart of a conflict he had never expected to face.Now, Jazz has to pull in some serious favors, just as he finds himself fighting a woman determined to save the charming liar who has never been serious. A man who has sworn to pass on love. A man who is now is telling the most wicked lies of his life to steal the heart of the woman who has stolen his soul.",
