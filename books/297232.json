  "description": "I'd love to tell you how I got stuck in a house in the middle of Nowhereville, Illinois. Or how many years I've spent with no memory of the person I used to be. But I can't. Those details are locked down tight inside the chaos of my mind, and I don't have the key.The only thing I do know - I’m dead. Major bummer, right?I spend my days doing what I do best - scaring off anyone who steps foot inside my house. Of course, ghost girls can't own houses, but that's beside the point. A girl's got a rep to maintain, and after a close call a while back, I’ve had to step up my game. This ghost girl doesn't want to be exorcised anytime soon. Just when my unlife is getting increasingly dull, a team of hot paranormal researchers shows up to investigate the cause of all the unusual activity. Now I don't know whether I should bust out my normal bag of tricks or take a chance on making my presence known in other, potentially naughty, ways. Don't judge. Ghost girls have needs too, ya know, and mine have gone unmet for way too long. Cole, Knox, Macklin, Thad & Levi might have just gotten more than they bargained for - namely, me - but this feels like so much more than insta-lust. With every encounter, this sense of familiarity just won’t leave me the hell alone. Who are they? Who am I? In the end, maybe I'll finally know the truth, and the guys might just get something they didn't even know they were missing. A Fate Unknown is book one in a medium-burn, why choose trilogy. The FMC will have a HEA with all of her guys by book three.",
