  "description": "One sexy snow leopard shifter finds his mate and more, now Gilbert Trujillo just has to convince Jihu Warren to trust his instincts and give them a chance to be an unexpected family.Gilbert Trujillo has watched his two older brothers, Tim and Isaiah, find their mates. He’s not sure he’s ready for such a commitment himself, even if he does kind of envy them at times. His life is about to get a lot more complicated, and if he can survive and protect the ones he loves, Gilbert just might have more than he ever dreamed possible.Jihu Warren hasn’t known much in life other than that he was to be used to further his species. Amur shifters were bordering on extinction, and a breeding program had been established decades ago. Jihu’s desires were of no consequence. He sees no way out, no hope, until he hears rumours of Bae, a half-brother he’s never met, who escapes from the demands of the lepe. Given hope, Jihu fights for his freedom and in his search for Bae, he runs into a sexy snow leopard shifter named Gilbert Trujillo instead, and Jihu finds out there are some things, and some people, worth risking everything for.Fate throws Gilbert and Jihu together, with a twist. Jihu’s senses have been altered by the injections given him while in captivity at Chung-Hee’s lepe. He doesn’t know who to trust, and will have to depend on himself rather than using the enhanced senses he normally has.Together, he and Gilbert, along with a new family Jihu is quickly coming to love, will have to battle the shifters who want Jihu back at almost any cost.",
