  "description": "Every dog has its day. Mine has its own realm.I can tell when you’re lying. Every. Single. Time.As a private investigator, being a walking talking lie detector is a useful skill but let's face it, it’s not normal. You'd think it would make my job way too easy, but even with my weird skills, I still haven't been able to track down my parent's killers.I'm hired to retrieve a lost heirloom, but I have no idea that the job is going to send me careening into a co-existing magical realm where my dog is a hell hound, and where there are werewolves and dragons and elves…Some of whom will stop at nothing to hide their lies…",
