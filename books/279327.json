  "description": "As America's first television series about lesbians, The L Word captured national attention when it debuted in 2004, and has continued to make headlines since. The Showtime cable drama about a group of lesbian and bisexual friends in Los Angeles challenges traditional notions of relationships, gender, and sex, and has generated both controversy and devotion within the lesbian community. Contributors write on how the show deals with topics like third-wave feminism, bisexuality, race, glamor, sex, relationships, music, as well as how the series has been marketed to and received by viewers. Also included are interviews with key contributors to the show itself. Throughout, the essays address both humorously and analytically what The L Word says about lesbians--and what lesbians say about The L Word.",
