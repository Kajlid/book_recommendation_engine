  "title": "Melinda's No's Cold",
  "description": "Gail Chislett's fourth book presents a twist on the theme of childhood colds--a twist that is played out in language and humor. Melinda develops a terrible \"no's\" cold. Her mother and sister can barely cope with her symptoms, especially when they are expressed in a torrent of NO'S directed at every remedy that's offered to her.And the complications develop from there: Melinda is very concerned that the cold might move into her chest (she inspects her toy chest to see); then both sisters develop \"flew\" (and enjoy soaring around the room).Young readers will enjoy discovering all the puns as they read about a very unconventional way of experiencing the most conventional of family illness.",
