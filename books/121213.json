  "title": "Chronolysis",
  "description": "Chronolysis is one of the most important French SF novels of the 1970s. It deals with time and its manipulation through the use of chronolytic drugs. Its protagonists are psychronauts, helpless explorers of a confusing, multidimensional universe, facing threats from alternate realities, such as Harry Krupp Hitler 1st, Emperor of the Undetermined, or the mysterious Phords from the future world of Garichankar. They search for secret paradises, hidden within the folds of space and time, away from their bleak realities, such as the tropical realm of Oblivion-by-Ruaba. This volume also includes a foreword by Theodore Sturgeon, a biography and illustrated bibliography of Jeury and a never-before-published short story translated by Jean-Marc & Randy Lofficier. \"Just how Jeury conveys the feeling that he knows what he is doing, that he is in charge, that you the reader are in the place in which he intends you to be, cannot be analyzed. A very small number of writers have this Joseph Heller can do it; so can Kurt Vonnegut and Philip K. Dick.\" Theodore Sturgeon.",
