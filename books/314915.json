  "title": "Iceland",
  "description": "Iceland follows the absurd adventures of its narrator, Paul, from making love to a woman named Emily whom he meets by a swimming pool filled with floating internal organs, to falling into an underground river in a volcano in Iceland, to sitting in a piano bar for six years crying over the lyrics to \"The Banana Boat Song.\" Driven by Paul's obsession to be reunited with Emily, the plot leaps hilariously through time, coincidence, and disjointed logic, with only the narrator's ludicrous perspective to hold it on course. Reminiscent of Raymond Roussel and Harry Mathews, Krusoe has combined an eccentric character and an outlandish plot to create an unforgettable book.",
