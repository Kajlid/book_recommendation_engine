  "description": "This book reveals a major Turning Point of Freedom in America and how to bring about a new Turning Point that will reverse the trend and restore lost freedom and prosperity. Freedom in America has decreased over the last century and seems to be diminishing more rapidly as time goes on. Many are concerned for the future of the nation and wonder where things went wrong and how to repair the damage. In the book 1913, Oliver DeMille answers these questions by illuminating three critical events of 1913 which, combined with a corresponding event in 1936, constituted a Turning Point away from freedom and by detailing three practical solutions for restoring Americaâ€™s freedom and revitalizing her prosperity. With the implementation of these solutions, the future of America is still very bright.",
