  "description": "Tildy MacNamara is a psychic whose screwey predictions, no matter how well-intentioned, often leave chaos in their wake. She just woke up at forty-one to find herself without a husband, without a life, and without a clue - then she inherits a New Age bookstore in Sedona, Arizona - a mystical place where psychics (and maybe a few psychos) are not only accepted, not celebrated. There, she finds new friends, a new purpose, and a new home complete with a pain-in-the-ass ghost. The dead guy is Houston Powers, a journalist murdered twenty-five years ago while tracking down a lead on the car-bomb death of newspaper reporter Don Bolles. Houston needs Tildy to find out who killed him so he can pass over. Desperate to get rid of this Saturday Night Fever wannabe, she agrees to take on the mantle of - ta daa - Detective to the Dead. Tildy's not exactly Dana Scully, but her hit-and-miss investigation somehow manages to turn up a geriatric Mafia Don who thinks he's Elvis and who'd be hilarious if he wasn't so dangerous; an engimatic Navajo sheriff with a shocking secret; an aging playboy land developer with everything to lose if Tildy reveals his involvement in an old Arizona land scam. A powerful Senator is also determined to keep her from linking him to the land scam and the Bolles murder, and destroying his career. Can she find the killer without becoming a victim herself?",
