  "description": "Get swept away with 10 little rubber ducks! (Book with sound chip) Chuckedy-chuckedy-chuck goes the rubber duck machine. Out pop little yellow rubber ducks one after the other...A brand-new batch of rubber ducks is loaded on to a ship and sent off to be delivered to children everywhere. But when a storm strikes, 10 little ducks are tossed into the sea and swept away in 10 different directions - with some wonderfully unexpected adventures along the way. Come ride the waves as legendary children's book author and illustrator, Eric Carle, explores numbers, directions, opposites, geography, animals and more in an extraordinary interactive picture book, beautifully illustrated with his unique collage-style art. And for a final surprise, the last page contains a duck with a squeaking sound chip for a special treat at the end of the story!",
