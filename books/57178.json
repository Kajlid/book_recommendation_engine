  "description": "Published to wide controversy, it became the source (acknowledged or unacknowledged) of much of our thinking about race relations and was for many a catalyst for the civil rights movement. It remains the most courageous, insightful, and eloquent critique of the pre-1960s South.\"I began to see racism and its rituals of segregation as a symptom of a grave illness,\" Smith wrote. \"When people think more of their skin color than of their souls, something has happened to them.\" Today, readers are rediscovering in Smith's writings a forceful analysis of the dynamics of racism, as well as her prophetic understanding of the connections between racial and sexual oppression.",
