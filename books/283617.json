  "description": "alternate cover edition of ASIN B07VF924H7Sawyer Smith’s life is a hot mess.  Hot, because he’s found six of his eight mates. To say things are heating up between them is putting it mildly.  A mess, because he’s the Chosen One, the son of a goddess with no powers of his own, tasked with fixing the broken magic in his world... and he has no clue how to do it.  With every new layer of mystery that's revealed, Sawyer's doubts about his abilities get stronger. To complicate matters, Sawyer is growing weaker by the day. Meanwhile, his newest guardian, the one he’s calling Yellow Eyes, refuses to reveal himself.  With time running out, Sawyer's desperate enough to make a daring move -- one that's potentially deadly for him and his mates. Because at the end of the day, if there’s nothing ventured… there’s Nothing Gained.",
