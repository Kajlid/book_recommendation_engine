  "description": "Attagari Kathalu (Stories of Mother-in-law) by multi-talented Dr. Bhanumati Ramakrishna, apart from her unparalleled stature in the movie industry, also made her mark as a writer of fiction, writer of humor with the creation of the mother-in-law character which is soo hilarious and unique. These collection of short stories won her the Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Academy award in 1966. Bhanumati has written a few stories of serious nature also, but it is her mother-in-law character that has become the hallmark of her writing.These mother-in-law stories reflect her belief in tradition and family values. Her stories brim with her belief in god, astrology, and family values, drawing humor primarily from situations and the human ideosyncrasies; and, she never missed a chance to take a jab at our customs and beliefs. That is not however to be interpreted as disrespect for tradition.",
