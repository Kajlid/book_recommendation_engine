  "title": "U2 at the End of the World",
  "description": "The most intimate and appreciative biography of  the mega rock band U2 to date--by the author to  whom the band gave complete access.  When U2 took the stage for their three-year Zoo TV  world tour in 1991, Bill Flanagan was there--in  the bus, on the plane, in the recording studio and  well after hours with the biggest rock band in the  world. A tour that began to support the hugely  successful Achtung Baby record and ended with a  second, even more successful record, Zooropa, took U2  to the far reaches of the world, playing to over a  hundred sold-out arenas in over forty  cities.U2 at the End of the World  takes you on the world tour and drops you off at  the cultural intersection where rock stars meet  politicians; where writers, directors, and models all  wind up backstage with U2. You're there when the  band meets Bill Clinton in a Chicago hotel room;  when Salman Rushdie comes out of hiding to join the  band onstage at Wembley Arena in London; when  Frank Sinatra and Bono record their famous duet,  \"I've Got You Under My Skin.\" And finally,  when the band performs their last Zoo TV concert in  Tokyo in 1993 and nearly collapses from physical  and mental exhaustion, you are there with them  waiting for the end of the world. Augmented with  sleek photos by renowned photographer Anton Corbijn, U2 at the End of the World is the  most definitive book on the band to  date.",
