  "description": "When the CITV Channel closed in September 2023, it had become a shadow of its former self.Back in the eighties and nineties, however, British kids in their millions tuned into hundreds of weird, wacky and wonderful shows put out under the heading of \"Children's ITV\". From \"Art Attack\" to \"ZZZap!\" - and other programmes that didn't feature Neil Buchanan - read about forty of CITV's greatest programmes, handpicked by Ben Baker, author of \"Christmas Was Better In The Eighties\".\"The Dreams We Had As Children\" might not be the ultimate guide to old kids' TV, but its a bloody fun one, with potty puppets, quirky quizzes and animated absurdities, plus lots of bonus articles, eyebrow-raising trivia and very silly jokes.",
