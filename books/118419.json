  "description": "A child petrified by the shadows in his bedroom. A boy shrinking from the anger of his father. A wandering adolescent who sees the Twin Towers as the legs of an interplanetary god. A new adult battered by the absence of that god.Burdened by the weight of the past and the uncertainty of the future, Jeremiah sets out in search of the answers to his own mysteries, embarking on a journey that will carry him from the raves of New York to the Latin tropics to Israel’s Independence Hall, and back to an autumn evening in Sheep Meadow when the world was still whole.A story of fathers and sons, self and shadows, Jeremiah’s Ghost traces the path of a young man through a landscape where memory is just another kind of fiction.",
