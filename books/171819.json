  "description": "Raven Lancaster was only trying to have a little fun. Going off with her new boyfriend seemed like a good idea at the time, but when she discovered that he was part of the Headhunter MC she wasn't so sure anymore. When the white knight shows up she's more than ready to get home. Only he's acting like an ass, and she can't understand why every other woman thinks she's lucky for being rescued by him.Travis Hoyt isn't too happy to be told that even though he was released from the Red Devils MC years ago he's now back in whether he likes it or not. Sent on a wild goose chase after a woman he doesn't even know, for a club he isn't even a part of makes him a little crankier than usual. Finding her was easy, keeping his heart from getting stomped on again, not so much.",
