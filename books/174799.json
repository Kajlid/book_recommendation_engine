  "title": "Glenn Hates Books Vol. 1: Brutally Honest Book Reviews",
  "description": "WARNING: There's a lot of unnecessary profanity in this book. Why? Because... Because REASONS!  This book contains over 100 brutally honest book reviews. These laugh-out-loud reviews are offensive in every way possible. There's so much unnecessary profanity, it's crazy. But it's not the profanity or offensiveness that makes this book worth reading. It's the honesty.  You will find 1 star reviews in this book, that absolutely tear the book to shreds, because the book was really that bad. But you will also find 5 star reviews in this book, because the book was actually that good.  It contains reviews of popular books such as Gone Girl, The Giver, The Maze Runner, and many other popular books. Of course, it also includes plenty of books you've probably never heard of.  There's reviews that urge you to read a book, because it's so good. And also, reviews that warn you to stay the hell away from certain books, because they're bad. So bad.  In the end, you'll laugh while reading this book. And cry. And possibly vomit. You've been warned.",
