When the stress builds from too many sponsor obligations and a failing marriage, she finds herself in the ER with a concussion from a snowboarding accident. The last thing Cason wants is to fall for a straight married girl that lives life on the edge of a snowboard. Adler doesn’t realize what’s right in front of her until it’s gone, but will it be too late?",
