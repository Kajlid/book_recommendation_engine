  "description": "Asher Anderson, a musically gifted, gay teen, has been the object of ridicule for as long as he can remember. So long, in fact, that he spends all of his free time alone in his bedroom singing and composing music on a miniature baby grand piano… his only friend. Night after night, Asher's ethereal voice cascades from an open second floor window to be eagerly heard by everyone walking the red cobbles of Wealthy Street.  A few months before his eighteenth birthday, Asher meets Conor Vincent, an overly sensitive lad with struggles of his own, not the least of which is keeping his temper in check. The unlikely pair strike-up a friendship and Asher dares to believe he has finally stumbled upon some measure of acceptance. Fate, however, has something else in mind.  In the wake of a terrible betrayal, Asher’s world crumbles. In answer to his plight, winter winds whisper of an ancient secret that yearns to be told. Astonishingly, Abigail Jones, the plump shopkeeper of nearby Healer’s Glen, understands every word the winds speak.  “Expect not warmth from an Angel’s embrace…”  Everything is about to change. As Asher’s despair deepens, Abbey's dreams darken, with visions of fallen angels, wolves cloaked in silver mists, and an old crone who sails a turbulent, grey ocean upon a raft of oaken planks.  Abbey braces for the storm that is coming. Asher waits for a miracle… one last white Christmas with enough beauty and grace to make even the ugliest things shiny and new.  Heaven itself prays that Abbey will find enough faith left in the world to stop Asher from falling. The final note of an extraordinary song struggles within the soul of an ordinary boy, and its playing may be the last hope of us all: SNOW ASHENS... ANGELS FALL.",
