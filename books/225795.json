  "title": "The Wosnick Tunnel",
  "description": "“Once the wooden shutters were closed, he felt safe, at peace. Life started again every night outside, but here, within those walls, he was the happiest of men…” Alas, his routine would soon be over and the truth revealed. Is the village outside the shutters the token of a past catastrophe or the figment of a delusional mind? His technophobia may explain it all: the Reset and the dystopia that followed, the real mission of the people stranded on the Moon, even the acclaimed Biomental Theory that led PsiHist to commercialize its Cube interface. In his first novel, A. N. Mignan orchestrates the collision of several science fiction subgenres (apocalypse triptych, Cyberpunk, time travel and space colonization) and creates the Jungian realm that is The Wosnick Tunnel.",
