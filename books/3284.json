  "description": "Mixing mystery and erotica, the stories in Mahu Men take readers into the world of openly gay Honolulu homicide detective Kimo Kanapa’aka. Moving from pickups to murders, Kimo surfs the waves of his professional and personal lives in a sexy, sensual tropical paradise, where danger and desire lurk behind every palm tree.  The stories fill the gaps between the Mahu novels, showing Kimo dating as well as solving cases and establishing a relationship with his new detective partner. Mixing the sensuality of erotica with the sharp-edged attitude of mysteries, Mahu Men is a chance for new readers to meet Kimo, and for fans to delve more deeply into his world.  “One of Plakcy's gifts is for his secondary characters. Five stars for the overall effort and dazzling effect of these tales.” A.J. Llewellyn, author of the Last Warrior Series  “Plakcy’s storytelling is tight, flawlessly executed, eminently interesting and inspiring.” George Seaton, Out in Print.  Books in the Mahu series have reached the finalist stage for the Lambda Literary Awards as well as winning mystery fan awards.",
