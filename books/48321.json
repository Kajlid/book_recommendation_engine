  "description": "How a Bully Learns to Share ... \"James Alexander's nickname was Jim, But nobody would be friends with him. No one wanted to play with Jimmy, For Jim Alexander always said, \"Gimme.\" Thus begins the rhyming story of Jim Alexander, whose nickname was Gimme-Jimmy because he was a greedy and selfish bully. Imagine Jimmy's concern when he found that every time he said the word \"Gimme,\" his hand grew larger! Jimmy was happy to discover that when he was polite and said, \"Please\" and \"Thank you,\" his hand began to shrink. He started practicing his new \"Polite Rule\" and found out that it was much more fun to share. Author Sherrill S. Cannon wrote three children's books that garnered prestigious awards in 2011. In less than two years, this award-winning grandmother of nine had three books and five children's plays published. Gimme-Jimmy is her fourth book. Her earlier book The Magic Word received a Readers Favorite Gold Medal, a NABE Pinnacle Achievement Award and a Global eBook Finalist Award; Santa's Birthday Gift received a National Indie Excellence Finalist Award and a Readers Favorite Silver Medal; and Peter and the Whimper-Whineys won a Readers Favorite Bronze Medal and a USA Best Books Finalist Award. These three award-winning titles are all available as eBooks, and Peter and the Whimper-Whineys is also available as an app. A former teacher, Sherrill S. Cannon of Great Bend, Pennsylvania, is retired and travels the country with her husband in an RV, going from coast to coast to visit their children and grandchildren, sharing her wonderfully rhyming books along the way.
