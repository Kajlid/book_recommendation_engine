  "description": "What happens in Vegas doesn’t stay in Vegas when you wind up married to your sworn enemy.To all the world, he is Joaquin Reyes, the playboy son of a billionaire media mogul.To the cartel his family cut ties with, he is the man who murdered the leader of our North American operation.He’s a menace to our empire, and he knows retribution is coming.But he doesn’t expect it to show up in the form of me, the ebony-haired bombshell whom he wakes up married to after a wild night in Las Vegas.I am Natalia Esposito.La Viuda Negra.The Black Widow of the cartel.My job is to seduce men and kill them when they least expect it.And poor, sexy, oblivious Joaquin, my soon-to-be late husband, doesn’t suspect a damn thing.I have one job, and I’ve got him square in my lethal crosshairs.He never expected to wind up married to an assassin, and I’ve never failed at taking out a target--but I never expected to catch feelings for a man I was ordered to murder.I now have a choice:Kill the man I wasn’t supposed to fall for, or face the wrath of the cartel.'Til death do us part?Exactly.Because one of us is leaving this marriage in a body bag.",
