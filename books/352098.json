  "description": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewAnansi Boys, a sequel of sorts to Neil Gaiman's Hugo- and Nebula Award winning American Gods, revolves around a prudish guy named Fat Charlie -- the unwitting son of the spider-trickster god Anansi -- who, after finding out about the death of his estranged father, meets the brother he never knew he had: and watches as his orderly life devolves into supernaturally induced chaos. Fat Charlie's life in London is anything but remarkable. Though he works in a dead-end job for a despicable boss who resembles \"an albino ferret in an expensive suit\" and dates a woman whose mother hates him, Fat Charlie's bland existence takes a dramatic turn when he is summoned to Florida for his father's funeral. The trouble starts when Fat Charlie meets his brother, Spider -- who evidently received all his father's charm, wit, and wild sense of adventure. When Spider shows up in London and seduces his brother's fiancï¿½e, Fat Charlie reluctantly begins a journey of self-discovery that leads him to the very beginnings of the world, where the oldest -- and most powerful -- stories reside pAlthough Gaiman himself had difficulty classifying the genre-transcending iAnansi Boys/i (he called it a \"a magical-horror-thriller-ghost-romantic-comedy-family-epic\"), this myth- and folklore-powered fantasy combines the magic realism of Charles de Lint's Newford sequence and the rich African storytelling traditions of Chinua Achebe's iThings Fall Apart/i with the allegories of John Bunyan's iPilgrim's Progress/i. Fans of the intense and unsettling iAmerican Gods/i will enjoy this lighter -- yet equally thought-provoking -- look at the influence of myth. iPaul Goat Allen/i",
