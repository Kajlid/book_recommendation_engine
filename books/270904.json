  "description": "Ever since Peter Pan flew in through Wendy Darling's nursery window and took her off to Never Land, Barrie's classic adventure story has thrilled and delighted generations of theatre-goers. J M Barrie wrote Peter Pan first as a work of prose and then adapted it for the stage. John Caird and Trevor Nunn first adapted Barrie's book and play in the 1980s for the Royal Shakespeare Company and then in 1997 for the Royal National Theatre.",
