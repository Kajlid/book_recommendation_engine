  "title": "Gravity, Time and Consciousness",
  "description": "Have you ever wondered about gravity, time and consciousness? Do you embrace without a single qualm, the theories and conclusions of the establishment? Have you asked questions such as 'what is gravity really?' and 'what is the Universe made of?' only to feel that not only were the questions unanswered but that you were more confused than ever? In this title, Ronald Sharp B.E.M., presents the ideas that he has formulated since discovering Physics at age twelve in high-school. He is now eighty-six. Always confused by advanced mathematics and the plethora of seemingly nonsensical explanations, he has written down his own conclusions, taken from direct observation of the World around him, reading available literature and common-sense lateral thinking, in the hope that others with greater resources may be stirred on to find a new way to the real nature of the Universe and its contents.",
