  "title": "Tokyo Fragments: Short Stories of Modern Tokyo by Five of Japan's Leading Contemporary Writers",
  "description": "“Restraint, sensitivity, and generous humor.”—The Japan TimesTokyo is far more than streets and skyscrapers full of gray-suited businessmen, super-trendy teenagers, and schoolgirls in sailor-suit uniforms. Five of Japan’s most popular contemporary fiction writers—Ryuji Morita, Tomomi Muramatsu, Mariko Hayashi, Makoto Shiina, and Chiya Fujino—present their vision of life in different quarters of Japan’s capital. From Tokyo’s mean streets to its bars and elegant cafes, here are stories that measure the pulse of the city while dissecting its heart. These five stories break down the metropolis into fragments of experience that anyone can relate to and enjoy. It is also the chance to sample these leading Japanese authors whose work has never before appeared in English.",
