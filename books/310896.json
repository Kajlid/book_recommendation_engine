  "description": "I used to live in darkness and a comet soared through my night sky. So I made a wish.Blood is my sanction.Pain is my salvation.Fear is what I instill.Especially for my Comet.The warm barrel of a gun against my head? It won’t stop me from protecting what is mine.Even if it means spilling more blood.My love for her has been tested and I’m furious.Seconds has turned to minutes.Minutes has turned to hours.And suddenly months have gone by without a change.Trying to make Daphne remember is getting us nowhere.It’s time to accept our fate.This is the new us.Giving up isn’t an option, but moving on is, and we are doing it together.While we figure out how to be together again, we wait for her stepfather to be sentenced.Even if I want to be the executioner.And while time creeps by, I don’t give up hope she’ll come back to me.In the chaos of fighting for our lives, fighting the flames that try to take us down, there is one thing stands strong.Us.She’s mine.And there are no limits to protect what’s mine.A taste of time is nothing compared to the history we hold.And sometimes time tells us when to let go.But I’ll hold on tight until my death....And wishes do come true.",
