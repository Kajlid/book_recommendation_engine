  "title": "Just the War, Just the Peace",
  "description": "Just the War and Just the Peace are both an homage to Tolstoy as well as works of social commentary on literature and war. Created by separating Tolstoy's original work into two volumes (the war parts and the peace parts), these two stand-alone novels present the text from Tolstoy's classic in an entirely new light. Experimental author Aaron Dietz uses his iron touch as an editor to create this exciting and innovative way to experience Tolstoy's most famous work.Just the War is Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace without the peace. Napoleon invades, Moscow is torched, and on the rare occasion that someone has a party, all anyone does at the party is talk about the war.Just the Peace is Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace without the war. Characters fall in love, marry, and die. They have parties where they talk about who is in love, who is marrying, and who is dying. Napoleon never even enters the picture.",
