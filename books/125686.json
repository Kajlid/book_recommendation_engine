  "description": "Rachel D’Evereau has everything the world can offer--wealth and prestige, striking beauty, a successful husband, and a profession she loves. Yet, when a series of catastrophes begin to shatter the secure, comfortable walls that surround her life, she is forced to admit long-suppressed feelings of insecurity and worthlessness.Rachel returns to her ancestral plantation home where she confronts the painful secrets that have haunted and challenged members of her family for generations. Her quest to rekindle the spiritual flames that guided her as a child take her on an unexpected journey, a journey from darkness into light.Celebration! is a sweeping saga filled with characters whose lives blaze across the pages of history, from the genteel South of the early 1800‘s to the tumultuous landscapes of modern America. It is also a powerful and moving novel that captures the journey each of us must take if we are to accept our true identity as God’s worthy children.“There was a lantern in her soul that called reassuringly,‘Come home, child, come home’--a lantern that had been there always.”",
