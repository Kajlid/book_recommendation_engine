  "description": "When Laurie Hamilton agrees to ski lessons from the third born Masters son, she is more than aware the odds of him being her mate are great. She is equally aware another man will make them a threesome.Zachary Masters is also not shocked as he approaches Laurie that gorgeous sunny morning at the ski lodge. Considering both of his older brothers mated with both of her older siblings, chances were tremendous.Corbin Archers, however, is blindsided. A Native American shifter from the reservation, he didn’t see this claiming coming. When he inadvertently agrees to deliver a few supplies to the cabin where Laurie and Zach are stranded, he gets the shock of a lifetime.None of the three of them are stunned by the strange developments in and around the mountains where they live. Unexplained spirit sightings create renewed unrest. And bigotry raises its head among both the Native American and Caucasian communities.When Laurie becomes convinced her presence is the root cause of their problems, she takes matters into her own hands and leaves town. The trouble is—mates cannot separate. Their souls are fated to unite.Nature makes Her statement—as She always does. What does She want? And when will She be satisfied?",
