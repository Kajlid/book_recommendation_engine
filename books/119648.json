  "description": "Based on a true story of: The GREATEST heist-NEVER TOLD!In 1983, the rapidly growing city of L.A. and beachfront communities were active in the illicit drug trade, successfully operating through Angels Gate Lighthouse, and LAX, the gateway to the City of Angels. This true story is a recounting of the largest monetary heist in history, carried out by four local surfers, and August Taracina, a successful marijuana smuggler. The heist progresses with only minor hitches, until they open the bags of loot. Much to the thieve's chagrin, there is no cash, no gold, nothing but financial instruments, unable to be cashed. While still in command of one of the larger marijuana smuggling operations on the West Coast, August begins a whirlwind, worldwide tour with his connections to organized crime, the Medellin Cartel, and international bankers, as he attempts to fence the items. Other gangs, along with their treachery and murder, as well as FBI Agent Nick Cutler's team, the Treasury Department, and Interpol pursue him. During this maelstrom, August devises an incredible plan to satisfy everyone's interest and fulfill their dreams. Now, all he has to do is MAKE IT HAPPEN!",
