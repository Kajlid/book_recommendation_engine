  "description": "The only problem with getting everything you ever wanted is that it forces you to reassess everything you ever wanted in the first place.Thirty-two-year-old Dan Johnson has it all; a nine-digit net worth, a gorgeous fianc√© and a luxury riverside brownstone. The only problem is, he doesn't want any of it. And the endless distractions of digitized society give him no head space to figure out what he does want.So, Dan unplugs. He abandons all things digital technology, effectively retreating from society to live an analog lifestyle geared at perfecting the art of avoidance. When a case of mistaken identity launches Dan into a series of bizarro relationships and absurd events, it represents an unexpected path to reconnect him with a world he never knew existed.Dark, offbeat and laugh-out-loud funny, Unplugged is a coming of middle-age story about finding authentic connections and meaning in today's hyper-digitized society.",
