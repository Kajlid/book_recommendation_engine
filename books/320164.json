  "description": "“Deep within, I find that I am filled with oil, thick and toxic. And like oil, if looked at in the right light, at the right angle, I can be a beautiful mixture of bright colors - a facade to cover up the true black center.” Oil Spill is a self-reflective and cathartic poetry anthology that examines bad feelings, sadness and the things we feel at night when we can’t sleep. These powerful dark emotions that we feel when we are alone are not often given the attention they deserve. This poetry collection acknowledges this part of us, so that we can try to empty ourselves out and fill ourselves up with something better. Oil Spill is an emotionally moving selection of sad poems, complex love poems and confessional poetry that readers can draw inspiration from again and again, as they deal with any hardship in their lives, and it will also inspire all of us to look inward with introspection, before we make important life decisions.
