  "title": "A Fish Out of Water",
  "description": "A classic, comic easy reader about getting a pet!In this beloved Beginner Book written by Mrs . Dr. Seuss (aka Helen Palmer), a young boy hilariously learns the consequences of not following instructions when he feeds too much to his goldfish—causing it to grow as big as a whale! With delightfully retro illustrations by P.D. Eastman ( Go, Dog. Go! ),the message of the book—that getting a pet is a big responsibility—is as true today as it was when the book was published in 1961. Perfect for beginning readers and read-alouds—and anyone getting a pet, especially a fish—it's ideal for birthdays, holidays, and happy occasions of all kinds! Launched in 1957 with  The Cat in the Hat  and written specifically for emergent readers, Beginner Books combine an exacting blend of simple words and fun pictures that encourage children to read—all by themselves.\"Comic pictures show how the fish rapidly outgrows its bowl, a vase, a cook pot, a bathtub.\"-- The New York Times.",
