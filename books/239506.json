  "description": "My plans for the future didn’t include falling for my professor.   But how could I help being struck speechless by the sexy smile and warm intelligence of Professor Shane Brooks?  What starts as wistful gazing from the back of the room leads to stolen touches that melt my core, and ends with a midnight encounter right on school grounds.  Those weren’t the kind of after-school activities I had in mind.  Will Shane hate himself for what we’ve done, or resent me for wanting it? I don’t know. I’m too lost in the heat of his body and the depths of his soul.  Sooner or later someone’s bound to find out about us, and it’s not going to be pretty.  The only question is, are we strong enough to survive it?  FORBIDDEN HEAT is a full-length standalone in the Firework Girls contemporary romance series. Jordyn White takes you on a delightful journey of secret rendezvous, nerdy soulmates, and transcendent love in this completely swoon-worthy forbidden romance.",
