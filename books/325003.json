  "description": "The participants in the International Communist Seminar in Brussels (Belgium) dedicate this book to communists the world over.This annual Seminar, first held in 1992, brings together parties, organizations and groups that defend Marxism-Leninism and the proletarian internationalism and are opposed to revisionism.One of the essential conditions of uniting the International Communist Movement on a revolutionary basis, is to identify the real causes of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and to learn lessons for the future.This book contains 17 contributions from Russia, Cuba Korea, Germany (ex-GDR), Greece, Great Britain, the Philippines, Syria, Belgium, India, Palestine, Zimbabwe, Turkey and Italy. Twelve papers are from parties that participate in the Seminars; three documents have been added to give a more complete picture of the different opinions in the movement. We are also publishing two historical documents, written in 1951 and 1956.They show that true communists have condemned revisionism from its first appearance, by denouncing the policies of Gorbachev`s two predecessors, Tito and Khrushchev, in 1948 and 1956 respectively.Finally you find the Proposals for the unification of the International Communist Movement that lay down the framework for the Brussels Seminar.  * James Klugmann: Tito√Øsm, a tool of capitalism and imperialism (1951) * Niel Gould: The Twentieth Congress and After (April 1956) * Nina Andreeva (All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks): Anti-stalinism is a Trojan horse in the communist movement * Kurt Gossweiler: Errors and Successes in the Building of Socialism : Strong and Weak Aspects of the Struggle Against Revisionism * Dr Wiktor Zbigniew: The causes and the forces of the counterrevolution in Poland * Communist Party of Cuba, Fidel Castro and Raul Castro: Cuba didn't fall, it's stronger by relying on its people * Kim Jong Il (Workers' Party of Korea): Building socialism by combining ideological, cultural and technical revolution with people's power * Communist Party of Greece: Thoughts about the reversal of the socialist system in Europe * Armando Liwanag (Communist Party of the Philippines): Stand for socialism against modern revisionism * Ammar Bagdache (Syrian Communist Party): Counter revolution in the Soviet Union * Communist Ludo Martens (Workers' Party of Belgium): An assessement of the collapse of the Soviet Union * Socialist Unity Centre of India (SUCI): The development of revisionism in the CPSU and restoration of capitalism in the former Soviet Union * Adel Samara: The Soviet Union: from revolution to collapse * Ishmael Rinashe Dube (Zimbabwe): The collapse of socialism in the Soviet Union and its impact on some southern African countries * Kurtulus (DHKP): Revisionism and liquidation of proletarian internationalism * Harpal Brar: The Economics of Class Struggle under Socialist power * Vijay Singh (Revolutionary Democracy): Stalin and the question of the \"market socialism\" in the Soviet Union after the second world war * Initiativa Communista (Italy): The historical significance of the Twentieth Congress",
