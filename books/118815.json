  "description": "For Eleanor, riding horses isn't a pass time, it's the central thesis of her very existence...For David, if he isn't flying, he's planning, briefing or studying NATOPS for his next flight, and if he had enough JP-5, he'd probably never come down...When our beautiful Australian farm girl accepts a simple act of chivalry from our dashing American naval flight officer, a more unlikely yet romantically explosive mixture could not have been contrived, and true love's uncertain journey takes off at a canter - a canter of the heart - replete with every comical, heartwarming and inspirational twist and turn that you might expect, but would never guess, from our two unlikely lovers.This beautiful tale covers the globe from one end to the other and back again and is a journey unlike any you've ever imagined. And what becomes of our intrepid young couple? Well, you will simply have to read to find out!",
