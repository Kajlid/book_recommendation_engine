  "title": "Bolan: The Rise and Fall of a 20th Century Superstar",
  "description": "Marc Bolan was the very first superstar of the Seventies. As the seductive focus of \"T Rex\", he revelled in fame and fortune, released a string of classic records, but then lost his way, bingeing on cocaine and booze and apparently heading for obscurity. But the fatal 1977 car crash that cut short his planned comeback as a punk rocker was also to fix him forever as the classic icon of Glam Rock. Today, decades after his death, the legend of Marc Bolan lives on and not just for the image. His music and chameleonic style were to influence many future bands. Mod, Beatnik, Hippie, Glam and Punk Rocker - Bolan's numerous guises offer a fascinating glimpse into the man himself as well as British pop history. This classic biography of a pop obsessive draws from interviews with many friends and colleagues including the late John Peel, brother Harry and band members Mickey Finn and Bill Legend.",
