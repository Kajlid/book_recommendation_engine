  "description": "When the family found an odd piece of string, tied at equal intervals into nine knots, under Miles Despard's pillow, they dismissed this trifle from their minds.But then the housekeeper, a normally sensible woman, told an incredible story of a beautiful woman in the old man's room - a woman who had \"walked through the wall\". Who could go through a door which had been bricked up and paneled over for two hundred years, leaving an old man to a hideous death?Edward Stevens smiled at their fears of the supernatural - until he read a manuscript on female murderers. On one of the pages was a clear photograph of a woman. Under it, in small letters, had been printed:Marie D'AubrayGuillotined for Murder, 1861Edward Stevens was looking at a photograph of his own wife.",
