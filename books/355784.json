  "description": "Why?From Ganymede to Gomorrah, a bizarre breed of planet-hopping humans sell their sexless, neutered bodies... so that others may explore the outer limits of sexual perversion.Far beneath the surface of the planet earth, a doomed architect lives out the rest of his years in a hideous life-sustaining coffin... in a world where not dying is the ultimate form of punishment.And in a remote outpost near Canada, a lone cluster of Hell's Angels prepare for the final battle with a society which demands that all men share in the good life... whether they want to or not.This is the universe of Samuel R. Delany. Rooted in the present, projected into the future, it is an existence where anything can happen—and does!Contents:•\tThe Star Pit•\tDog in a Fisherman’s Net•\tCorona•\tAye, and Gomorrah•\tDriftglass•\tWe, in Some Strange Power’s Employ, Move on a Rigorous Line•\tCage of Brass•\tHigh Weir•\tTime Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones•\tNight and the Loves of Joe Dicostanzo",
