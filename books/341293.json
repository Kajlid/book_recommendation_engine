  "description": "Dorothy knows she could make a great Tarzan in the class play, even if she is a girl. When she gets up to introduce the world to her primal yell, something comes over her -- something wild and untamed. She gets the part, but Dorothy's not the only one with jungle fever. Her Tarzan yell seems to have an effect on all nearby animals, and when the circus comes to town the night of the class play, things start to get a whole lot wilder! Betsy Byars is one of the most celebrated and beloved writers of children's books today.",
