  "description": "'This isn't just any cookery book. It is \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\", first published in 1961, and it's a book that is a statement, not of culinary intent, but of aspiration, a commitment to a certain sort of good life, a certain sort of world-view; a votive object implying taste and appetite and a little je ne sais quoi. Julia Child was like Amelia Earhart, or Eleanor she was a hero who'd gone out there and made a difference. Her books are a triumph, and also a trophy' - A.A. Gill, \"The Times\".",
