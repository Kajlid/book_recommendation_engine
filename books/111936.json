  "description": "The little southwest border town of Malpuesta Del Sol is no stranger to trouble. But when a routine saloon brawl knocks a hole in space-time and a creeping black ooze slithers in, it's going to take more than the usual jabber and bravado to set things straight. Featuring Jesus Christ, a 6,000-year-old medicine man who rides a salamander, the Devil in a red dress, a Pre-Columbian death god, Aztec b-ball, zombies, steampunk bondage, Smallification, the ultimate archetypal showdown and much more, Bad Sunset stretches the conventions of the Western genre farther than anything you've ever seen. From the author of Doctor Flesh and Black Tongues of the Illuminati comes the wildest ride yet. Prepare yourself for an unforgettable journey, back to a time when the West was Weird.",
