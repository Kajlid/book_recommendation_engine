  "description": "With the superior artisanship and eye for the natural horse that has made him the world's most celebrated photographer of horses, Robert Vavra presents a book of all-new images, profiling eighteen stunning equines spanning six Arabian, Andalusian, Morgan, American Saddlebred, Friesian, and Peruvian Paso. As in Vavra's most popular books, all are alone and running free in glorious natural a white Arabian in a sun-washed desert; a black Friesian galloping in snowdrifts; a gray Andalusian amid violet flowers; a chestnut Arabian prancing in autumn leaves. These lush photographs are accompanied by poetry and are followed by text and drawing that profile each breed, highlighting the particularly outstanding traits of each horse depicted. Vavra pays special attention to the Andalusian, providing an essay on its romantic history. Presented on natural, handmade paper, Horses of the Sun fuses the beautiful simplicity of Vavra's earlier works with a new, fresh image of horses. For anyone who loves horses or simply appreciates the finest of photography, Horses of the Sun is a lovely gift -- a paean to this most beloved of animals.",
