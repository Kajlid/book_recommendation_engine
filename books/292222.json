Her favorite one is having the choice of the fairest gentlemen in the land to be her private \"playthings.\" All seemed well in her kingdom of pleasurable pain.  Tragedy is about to strike a second time, forcing this hedonistic monarch to embrace her dark past, and to realize the full potential running through her veins. In order to destroy the familiar enemy who once shook her world, she will need to gather those closest to her, and learn to lean on her newest \"plaything\"...who is not all that he seems.  Blood is sweet, but revenge is sweeter when you're...The Queen.",
