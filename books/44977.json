  "description": "FIRST IMAGE BOOKS EDITION. 1991 trade paperback, Vita Sackville-West (All Passion SPent). Joan of Arc was fourteen when she first heard the voices. She was seventeen when she took command of the armies of France-a peasant girl in the early fifteenth century in charge of a nation's forces. At nineteen she was captured by the British and tried as a witch by a church court. Before her twentieth birthday she was burned at the stake. In 1920 she was canonized a saint. V. Sackville-West, one of the great writers of the century, tells one of the most extraordinary tales of history with a brilliance attuned to the religious and feminist implications of Joan's tragic life. - Amazon",
