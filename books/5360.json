  "description": "The New York Times’s intrepid health reporter investigates the truth about sex, eating, exercise, and other health conundrums  For more than two years, the New York Times’s science and health columnist Anahad O’Connor has tracked down the facts, fictions, and occasional fuzziness of old wives’ tales, conventional-wisdom cures, and other medical mysteries. Now in this lively and fun book, he opens up his case files to disclose the experts’ answers on everything, from which of your bad habits you can indulge (yo-yo dieting does not mess up your metabolism and sitting too close to the television does not hurt your eyes) to what foods actually pack the punch advertised (you can lay off the beet juice!).A compendium of answers to the curious and nagging questions of how to keep healthy, Never Shower in a Thunderstorm will provide guidance and amusement to anyone who has ever wondered if the mosquitoes really are attacking her more than everyone else. (Yes, they are.)",
