  "description": "\"Crazy! Can't wait for the next one!!!!\" \"while there is plenty of putrid zombiness here there is soooooooo much more!\" \"It’s nice to find a new idea on how people came to be zombies.\" Civilization shuts down as the world’s population fills the streets in a deadly orgy. They feel only pleasure and never pain, even as they are injured, maimed, and mutilated. The few who remain unaffected struggle to survive, unaware that things are about to get unbelievably worse. Cooper is among the few survivors of an apocalypse that is a result of a conspiracy to depopulate the world. One week ago, college was his biggest concern. Now he is on a perilous journey to find his sister. But zombie attacks aren't the only threat he faces. In this nightmarish reality, the living can be far more dangerous in this new dystopia. Euphoria Z is the first is a series and the next novel is expected to be released Halloween 2014 in both print and Kindle books.",
