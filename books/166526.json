My parents taught me right from wrong and everything in between… except I wanted the gray area. I wanted to live life on the edge with the possibility of falling over. I didn’t care about the consequences because I had no heart…I left that on the floor of my parents’ bedroom door, shattered.And never went back to pick up the pieces.DevonFamily first.I learned the meaning of the word hate.I learned that life is a battlefield and I stood frontline.I learned that praying doesn’t work and God doesn’t listen.And I learned how to be a man…All at the receiving end of my father’s fists, my mother’s tears, and my sisters screams.You can’t run away from your past…It will always find you, especially when you’re asleep.Warning: Book contains adult situations. Sex/language. Mature readers only.",
