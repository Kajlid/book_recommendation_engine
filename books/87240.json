  "description": "Helle Tompkins has reached the end of her days as an outcast, suburban teenager. Ever since her beloved father killed himself, and they released Helle from the mental hospital for trying to join him, she's been in a place where her pain is far deeper than high school melodrama. No more hiding behind black lipstick and a mohawk. Now she's playing with pagan charms, Wiccan rites, and the scrying sorcery of her Ouija board. It's the perfect distraction until she summons the attention of a charming and sinister faerie prince. A seductive spirit lurking in the shadows of treebranches shimmering upon her walls, he may be something much more horrible than he claims. Will she succumb to bewitching promises and find salvation in his cruel embrace, or will his own agonizing secrets draw Helle into even deeper heartbreak?",
