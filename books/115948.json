  "description": "The gods are back, and they are tearing this world apart  Zeus, Dagon, Loki, Lugh and countless other deities have come back to this earth and rule over their individual districts with no goal other than satiating their own petty desires. The sole remaining functional province, Hellenica, decides to act. They build the Academy and are about to recruit 16 young gods with the hopes of training them to police this world.  The Horsemen  Of these 16 young gods, four have strange powers that the Academy might not be able to control. Kayana Marx, Gunnar Redstone, Tommy Alderon and Saoirse Frost arenâ€™t like normal gods, and their abilities stem from the Monotheistic times. But if Hellenica has any hope of holding this world together, they will have to teach these four to exercise their powers to their fullest extent, even if it might bring everything to an apocalyptic end.",
