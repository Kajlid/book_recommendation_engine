Is a serial killer after him, or is it just a set of coincidences?As the body count rises, Adam Darnow has Police Scotland on one side, crazy locals on the other and enough relationship problems to drive a man to drink.The whole mystery is made tougher thanks to the criminal past of our hero, who isn’t always in a position to call the cops for help…“Adam Darnow is a fantastic addition to the pantheon of great anti-heroes”“Dark comedy, mystery and crime successfully blended … an outstanding novel”“Tense, intricate and utterly immersive”",
