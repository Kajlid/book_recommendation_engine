  "title": "Roughing It",
  "description": "Scott Thompson, rock star, has spent years burying the pain of a tragedy in his past by indulging in reckless, often injury-inducing adventures during the band's downtime. His latest brings him deep into the backwoods, where he's taken captive by a group of hired rednecks for 48 hours of physical, sexual and psychological torture. He expects the pain and degradation going into to--but he doesn't expect the instant attraction he feels for the leader of the group, a dark-eyed enigma of a man named Johnny Lee.",
