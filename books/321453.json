And when her awful employer makes his darkest demand yet, she flees for the forest, and tumbles toward her doom…Until she’s snatched to safety by a huge, vicious green beast. \nAn orc. \nHe’s utterly terrifying, with his towering bulk, sharp teeth, and deadly black claws — but his touch is gentle, and his eyes are kind. And his scent is a deep, decadent sweetness, sparking a furious flame between them…But it’s only more disaster, because Alma’s shy, soft-hearted rescuer is already mated… to another orc. A tall, silent, snarling monster named Drafli, who loathes Alma on sight, and clearly longs for her death.Yet Drafli will do anything for his sweet mate, even if it means tolerating a weak, worthless human. So he makes Alma a cold, calculated offer: he’ll share his mate with her… but only on his terms.He wants her silence.Her surrender.Her servitude.And with Alma’s fate firmly in Drafli’s ruthless hands, how can she face her own dark desires — or all the secrets hidden behind Orc Mountain’s walls? Can a lost, lonely housemaid come between two orcs… without being crushed? _____________________A dark, angsty, full-length, enemies to lovers fantasy romance. Comes after The Midwife and the Orc, but also reads as a standalone. Happily ever after guaranteed.",
