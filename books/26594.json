  "description": "Can you ever go home?  After wandering the deserts of the Lands of Endless Summer for five years, Jaludin the thief wants to do exactly that. Having left as a boy, he returns as a young man, intent to leave his adventures in the desert and settle down with the girl whose eyes have haunted his dreams since he left. His homecoming is not the joyous occasion Jaludin imagined. He finds the town under some strange curse. As he rushes to solve this mystery, Jaludin wonders if some enemy from his wandering followed him home, or is this some new threat altogether. No matter what power is behind the curse, Jaludin must find a way to end it before the town succumbs to thirst, the desert's most ruthless killer. \"Jaludin's Road\" is a fast-paced novella set in the same world as the Tears of Rage novels.    This ebook also contains excerpts from the First Chosen, Halloween Jack and the Devil's Gate, \"The Dragon Bone Flute, and DEAD The Tombs.",
