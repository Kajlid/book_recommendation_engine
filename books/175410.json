  "description": "*Warning* If you're looking for a light hearted love story, this is not it! This book is not recommended for readers under the age of 18 due to the use of strong sexual language, adult content, and violent situations  I will RIP your heart out...  Don’t let the dress fool you. I am the CEO of a billion dollar corporation named Quinn National. I set my own rules and do what I want, WHEN I want. I’ve devoured any male or female that has crossed my path and I refuse to FAIL.  I wasn’t always this hard, so shut off from the world. I actually loved a man once, but I quickly realized that love makes you weak and I don’t DO weak—anymore. I’ve learned three cardinal rules to be successful in life. Number one: Do NOT get attached to ANYONE. Number two: Lock up my heart and throw away the key.  And number three: SEX is power. To keep the power, you do things you’re not always proud of. I’m Sheila Quinn and I’ll show you what it takes to be the BOSS.",
