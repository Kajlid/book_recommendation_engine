  "description": "Toggle, to switch between two options, or views. When mysterious green circles arrive around the world, with the promise of ‘transformation’ for those that touch them, there are mixed views about what to do, and about who has sent them and why. Can they be trusted? What happens to those that dare to trust and will the world change as a result? “This book speaks to our fears and mistrust and the atmosphere of aggression that most of the world has been infected with. The reader is taken inside a character’s mind and then squeezed gently until they are oozing emotion. The ending is like a sad parting from an old friend.” Cherry Mosteshar. The Oxford Editors.",
