I came home to find them all dead; their throats savagely cut. My sisters only five and eight were gone as well as my brother who was twelve. My mother too lay butchered in her marriage bed. The bed her children were born in...- After young Rose Baines discovers the savage murders of her family by her mad, incestuous father, she is plunged into a nightmare of hell and incarcerated in two madhouses.

It is both a tale of the eternal struggle between good and evil, and a story of love that strives to prevail, despite all odds. \"Think Jane Eyre with demonic vampires and with sexual scenes.\" \"I want to put the bite into gothic romance!\" Carole Gill, Author Show less",
