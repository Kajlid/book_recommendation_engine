  "description": "One glance across a dim, crowded room. That’s all it took for my life to change.One moment. One look. One touch. From him…The man with no name. He is everywhere I go and everywhere I turn. He is in my thoughts and daydreams. He’s a constant want and need I can’t escape.I don’t want to.The closer he gets the more I crave him. I crave his intensity and his fire. I crave his biting words and rough touches. He’s unlike anyone I’ve ever known and his touch is unlike anything I’ve ever felt.He unravels me. My life. Everything I’ve ever known, until all that’s left are secrets that never seem to end.Until all that’s left is ashes and blood.Until we burn.",
