  "description": "Excerpt from Secrets of the Convent and Confessional: An Exhibition of the Influence and Workings of Papacy Upon Society and Republican Institutions In this free and enlightened land of ours there is an organization which takes a sacred name, and assumes to speak for God to the people; and yet, in spirit, it is directly hostile to our most cherished institutions, and its one persistent study, purpose, and effort is to undermine the foundations of our Republic and set up the throne of despotism upon the ruin of our liberties. It must needs be watched with a vigilant eye, and restrained with a strong hand, or it will accomplish its purpose while the guardians of the public welfare suspect no danger. It is foreign in its origin, secret and subtle in its policy, pious and pitiful in tone, and yet it is ever intent upon a deep-laid and remorseless conspiracy against the sacred rights and the blood-bought privileges of the American people. It is the more dangerous because it numbers good men among its supporters and apologists, and it speaks the language of liberty and enlightenment while plotting the subjection of the people to ignorance, superstition, and bondage.",
