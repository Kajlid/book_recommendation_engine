  "title": "WOMEN WORKERS GLOBALIZ.: Emergent Contradictions in India",
  "description": "Investigating the impact of globalization on women workers in India in jobs that are considered to be most prominent in discourses around women’s work, this book demystifies the phenomenon of globalization, offering an overview of its prime drivers, processes and forces. Four sectoral studies of women workers are provided: two on factory women in garment exports and electronics; the third on home-based workers in a range of manufacturing processes and industries; and the fourth on middle-class women working in Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES). Primary surveys were conducted amongst 500 women workers in 2002-04, covering the capital and its satellite townships of Noida and Gurgaon through a combination of structured questionnaires, individual and group discussions. An incisive guide to the impact of globalization on women’s work, the book will be invaluable for scholars, activists, the general public, whose very livelihood is at stake, and indeed for policy makers.",
