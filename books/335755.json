  "description": "Ethan loved Nica from afar throughout high school, but the one night he mustered the courage to ask her out turned into a catastrophe. Ten years later, Ethan is a jaded, billionaire actor looking for a fresh start. He’s tired of playing roles on and off screen and wants something… someone real. Nica is a single mom and unemployed chef living with her parents in their lakeside hometown. It’s not the life she wants to model for her daughter, but it’s all she’s got right now. When Ethan asks her to be the chef in his new restaurant, she laughs in his face thinking it’s another prank. But when her smarmy ex-boss dangles his perceived Restaurant Wars win in her face, she would rather team up with Ethan than let her ex-boss represent the town she loves. Can Ethan and Nica progress through the culinary challenges, overcome old hatred, and find the happily ever after neither of them believe they deserve? ★★★A second-chance, enemies-to-lovers foodie romance perfect for fans of Nicholas Sparks, Susan Wiggs, and Debbie Macomber. All Emerald Bay Chefs Romances are stand-alones and can be read in any order. You are guaranteed a happily ever after with every couple.★★★This book was previously published in the Elf Hollow Romance Series. Setting details have changed, but the story is the same.",
