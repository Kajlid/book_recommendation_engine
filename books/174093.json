Too bad that when it comes to dating, she’s the biggest dummy of all. Jilted at the altar, abandoned by her best guy friend, Grace is about to hang up her keyboard for good until said best-friend lands back in town. He OWES her, and she’s determined to collect.Rehabber Joe Baker is good at fixing things, but he can’t fix his emotions for Grace. When he realized he’d fallen for the quirky columnist right around the time he’d had to give her the bad news about her bastard of a bridegroom, he knew he had to split town, fast. Now he’s back and stuck on a job that may make or break his business. He can’t escape—especially when Grace demands that he tag along as a watch-dog for one disastrous date after another, all in the name of giving her avid readers what they want. Joe may be Grace’s biggest fan, but all he wants… is a second chance with her.",
