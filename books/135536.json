It is the winter of 1962, snow is piling higher by the day, and George is called upon to endure more than most men could withstand. With the help of his grandparents and Tucker, his beloved Irish setter, George must navigate through life's most difficult challenges and find the strength to walk on the road that leads to healing, growing up and finding his true self. George's journey is our shared human journey. A coming-of-age story suitable for readers of all ages; Christmas with Tucker is a classic Christmas story about a young man's love for his dog, his family and his farm.",
