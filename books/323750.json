  "description": "You might think you know what happened in the tragic shooting of Breonna Taylor, but no one knows that better than the lead officer on the scene, Sergeant John Mattingly.   However, with the full support of the mainstream media, Black Lives Matter activists and other leftist groups immediately pounced on the tragedy, exploiting Breonna’s death and twisting the story—in some cases, telling outright lies—to bolster a shameful “All Cops Are Bastards” narrative and radical “Defund the Police” agenda.   In 12 Seconds in the A Police Officer’s Firsthand Account of the Breonna Taylor Raid , Sgt. Mattingly tells what really happened that horrible night. A twenty-year police veteran with an impeccable record, Mattingly takes readers inside the Louisville Metro Police Department’s response to suspected criminal activity that night, debunking lie after lie about what happened,     In this gritty and suspenseful true story, Mattingly sets the record straight on this shocking story that gripped the nation.",
