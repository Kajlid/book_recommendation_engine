  "description": "Lucy just turned eighteen, and she’s finally ready to lose her v-card. A camping trip with her boyfriend’s family is the perfect opportunity.  When she stumbles upon a couple in the throes of passion, Lucy is transfixed—a hunger awakening in her. But it turns out, the strangers in the woods aren’t strangers at all.  Angry and confused, she runs away from the scene. Only she’s not alone, footsteps rustle behind her, chasing Lucy into the forest.  Once she’s finally captured, the fear coursing through her veins turns to burning desire. It feels wrong, corrupt, but the sting of betrayal is still fresh.",
