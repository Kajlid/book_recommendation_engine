  "description": "When Elena Grayson’s divorced parents both remarry, she makes the most logical choice available: to travel across the country to East Clarington Academy, one of the best boarding schools in the United States. A loner with no ambition or desire to “fit in,” Elena has zero expectations for her fresh start. And then she meets Tristan Kent, East Clarington’s big-man-on-campus extraordinaire, the boy every girl dreams of having and the boy every guy dreams of being. The thing is, while he’s extremely irritating, totally obnoxious, and a complete egomaniac, Elena, for some reason, sort of likes him. Throw in the jealous Queen Bee and her followers, the jocks on the basketball team, and the general student population that somehow ebbs and flows with the popular crowd’s whims, and Elena is about to find out that navigating through her new school—and her new emotions—without going completely insane, might just be the greatest challenge of her life.",
