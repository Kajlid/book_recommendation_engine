  "description": "We know the Greek gods from mythology, and assume their stories ended there. They did not. This is a compelling new story about the Olympic gods in our century. Now they appear in our time to prevent humans from discovering immortality. The Fates — three ancient goddesses who determined human life span — are reborn so they can manipulate events to restore the balance of life and death. Their machinations make this a classic Greek tale. 21st century Jack Night, a financial whiz, raises his daughter by himself in a bucolic Pennsylvania countryside. When she’s 19 extraordinary events begin, which include golden light and irresistible lust. Sightings of a massive, three-headed dog and the goddess Artemis occur in the backyard. He’s shocked to find his daughter is one of the Fates. Jack finds himself pulled into the amoral world of Greek divinities and a mad rush to take down world-famous scientists. A second Fate — who claims to be his daughter — joins them at his estate. When a third daughter appears, the Fates are set for action. The stakes rise and additional Greek goddess join in the fray. As scientists are picked off one by one, Jack is torn between conventional morality and loyalty to his daughters. Just before the startling climax, Jack is aided by a nymph who is destined to become more powerful than the Olympic gods. She is the subject of Books II, III and IV. This is a stand-alone novel or Book I of The Naxos Quartet .This is contemporary fiction at its finest.",
