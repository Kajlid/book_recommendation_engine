  "description": "All roads lead to Louisiana…Dana Ricks never knew her mother, but her father was legend in the trucking world. She spends her life following down his tales driving her own rig down those same dark roads.Until her world is rendered by nationwide terrorism and she rises to the challenge, just as her father would have done. “If your daddy was alive, maybe you’d have figured out what kind of man he was by now, and stop living in dreams.”Her notion of family is destroyed and she has to find a way to come to terms with a dangerous world, and the dangers rising in her own mind.“Your dad’s eyes shone with an unholy light and I liked that. I was all for a bit of trouble. I brought him a beer and I brought him home… but I’ve often wondered if it was the devil himself I rescued…”She runs the road in a state of exhaustion trying to live up to her father’s reputation, and ends up creating one of her own. She rises from her own explosive circumstances to discover a family she never knew she had, and that life on the road is only bearable if you had a home to come back to. “That swamp rat paddled himself right out of a backwater swamp in a leaky canoe. He dragged himself up on the muddy banks of the Mississippi… and there you were bundled up into his shirt, baptized in swamp water. His own kin chased him right out of there, threatening to feed you to the gators.”In the end, she finds that she was only chasing down her own self after all, and she had what she needed all along.Relationships heal along with an embittered country, and life goes on in Goodwill, Georgia.
