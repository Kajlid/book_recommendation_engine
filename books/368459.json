  "title": "Jesus the Fool: The Mission of the Unconventional Christ",
  "description": "Frost directs our minds and hearts to the greater story of Jesus, reminding us that following the Savior is rarely safe—and that Christ will continue to redraw our blueprint of what’s right and what’s righteous, and will persist in calling us to take the alternative, dangerous, ridiculous road walked by wise fools down through the centuries of the church. A much-needed and longed-for challenge to emergent, contemporary and traditional gatherings and churches alike. Original.",
