  "title": "Baby Precious Always Shines: Selected Love Notes Between Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas",
  "description": "Off and on, during the entire period they were together, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas wrote each other little love notes. Calling her \"wifey\" and most often addressing her as \"baby precious,\" Stein scribbled her love for Toklas in quick moments of unself-conscious desire. And on occasion, Toklas penned or typed letters back to her \"husband.\" Because the couple was virtually inseparable, the notes were written and exchanged at home.Baby Precious Always Shines presents selections from this previously unpublished correspondence. In first-person documentation, in direct address, these brief mantralike enticements—tender, beseeching, funny and game, sexually charged and sincere, quotidian and queer—disclose the intimacies of a deeply committed, very rare, and at the same time, very ordinary marriage between two of the twentieth century's most famous women. Toklas called their notes \"a beautiful form of literature.\" They are indeed, and when pieced together, they create a tantalizing mosaic, a portrait of a marriage that helped shape the course of modernism and modern lesbianism.",
