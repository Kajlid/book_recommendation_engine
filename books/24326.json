Those who are searching for it are the 7 emperors of the lower world, hidden where the water sinks to its end… Whatever that means.One thing is for certain though, Ryder is catching feelings for the domineering man who thrashes revenge on all of his foes.When friendships get in the way of Ryder’s fantasies, he challenges his love for Lucifer by siding with his friends instead.Lucifer, however, remains calm… because the Devil always gets what he wants.",
