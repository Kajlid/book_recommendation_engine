  "description": "Unhappy Beast sets out to involve the shining soul of Beauty in his spiritual rebirth . . .Park Delafield has no problem with women, they seldom refuse him, no matter how much he treats them as objects. Not trophies, truth is he’s so good looking, he’s the trophy. Yet he’s sick of it all, the easy conquests, the adoration, the clinging and rows when he’s had enough and moves on to the next body in the queue. Something’s missing – challenge and, yes, spirituality in a relationship. Park’s becoming a bit of a romantic about that sort of thing. He’s got a mind too, and a soul, tawdry as it is. So he wants to change, from sad sybarite to parfit gentle knight, and for that he needs a parfit gentle maid.Chloe Lambert is ugly, she knows it, no getting away from that simple fact. She accepts her lot with a good grace, has come to terms with her fate, set up a kind of social life for herself and relies on her friends to get her through. She has no problem with men. There aren't any in her life, though she loves romance, but no one is ever going to fall in love with her - no matter how lovely she is within, as her friends and her mother keep assuring her she is. Until she has to tell them shut up about it, enough already.Sooner or later these two have to meet and in The Advent of Lena, for better or worse, they do.",
