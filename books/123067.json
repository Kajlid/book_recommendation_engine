  "description": "Two years ago Josh Smith had 'set her free'... and Marta Brennan had been running ever since. First furious, then heartbroken, Marta had finally accepted Josh's rejection - and another man's proposal. But a chance meeting brought her dangerously close to the only man she'd ever really loved. Renewed desire, lingering tenderness and familiar obstacles surfaced. She'd have to convince him that her fast-paced globe-trotting could never compare with the thrill of settling down by his side. For the twinkling diamond on her finger seemed mocking now... when the fire in her soul burned for Josh alone.",
