  "title": "The Littlest Hitler",
  "description": "Welcome to the world of Ryan Boudinot, where a little boy who innocently dresses up as Hitler for Halloween suffers the consequences; where jacked-up salesmen go postal; where besotted office workers tend to show up to work covered in live bees; and where the children of the future are required to kill off their parents—ideally with an ice pick—in order to be accepted to the college of their choice. You may never want to leave. Unable to change the world, But unwilling to give up on it, Boudinot's characters vibrate with rage or be suffused with regret, but they never entirely lose their sense of fun, however perverse it may be.",
