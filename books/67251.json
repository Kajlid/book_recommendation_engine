  "description": "Miranda Alexis Perry, sometimes known as the Lump or the Blimp, could hardly believe her good fortune in finding Dinah and the steamer trunk stuffed with Dinah's seemingly endless wardrobe. Dinah was a beauty. No question about it. Her bisque face was fresh and serene. Her dress was a somewhat faded calico and her high-heeled shoes protruded daintily from mesh pantaloons. Graceful and charming, the antique doll was a perfect miniature wonder.With her mother an ardent feminist full of good intentions and nonsexist theories, Miranda's experience with dolls was practically nil. Knowing her mother would object, Miranda keeps Dinah's presence a very well-guarded secret. Until, that is, snoopy Towney Ordway discovers the intriguing wonders of Miranda's closet.The changes that occur in quiet, shy, never-opens-her-mouth Miranda as she spunkily creates a special world for Dinah and herself make a most engaging and satisfying story of one young person's first tentative assertion of her own individuality.Are there any girls left who play with dolls? The Secret in Miranda's Closet grew out of the conviction that freedom can sometimes mean freedom to make the individual choice to keep doing what has given pleasure for ages, in spite of the quiet pressures of the popular, stylish points of view that surround us.",
