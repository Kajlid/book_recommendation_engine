  "description": "Sales surpassed Heather's initial goal; she continues to donate 50 percent of revenue from the sale of each book to Unicef's Gift of Education fund. Heather Grace Stewart (hgrace.com) is an author, poet, and photographer. Her poems have appeared in Canadian literary journals, international anthologies (Routes, Babylon Burning) e-zines, and the British small presses. Where the Butterflies Go is her first complete collection. Reviews: \"Whirlwind poetry that never hesitates...always delightful and rarely what you expect. We need poetry like this.\" -Sally Evans, poet and Editor, Poetry Scotland. \"Thanks to an exhilarating directness and a worked-for simplicity of language, not to mention a nicely self-deprecating sense of humour on occasion, this is a book full of sharply drawn images, honest poignancy and frank admissions.\"-Poet-Journalist Tom Phillips. \"These poems have a humanity, a goodness, an almost other-worldliness about them.\" -Tony Lewis-Jones, Author of Anytime and nine other collections",
