With Carla he genuinely tries to behave like a gentleman, until a violent episode throws them together. It is during this stressful time that Alex meets his \"once in a lifetime\" girl, the beautiful and fascinating Joely. Inexplicably, he rejects her advances, convinced something that perfect must really be false and selfish. Immediately after pushing away Joely there comes an anonymous offer to commit a stranger on stranger murder.

But the reappearance of Joely complicates matters. So begins the strangest of love affairs - Alex torn between delirium and despair at what he is committed to.
