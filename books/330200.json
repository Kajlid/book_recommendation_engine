  "description": "[Ménage and More: Erotic Ménage a Trois Romance, M/M/F, M/M, and M/M/F/M/M/M, Multiple Partners]Five guys and one hot woman, shacked up in a cabin for the week, was not what Cullen had in mind when he pictured his relaxing week away. Especially when that woman was Tess, Cullen's best friend's girlfriend. To make matters worse, Rael, a sophisticated and very much male acquaintance, is along for the ride, and seemingly content to stir up Cullen's long since suppressed curiosities.Wound up from the sexy ride over, Cullen finds himself the center of a rather sexy competition, as Tess and Rael jockey for position to see who will get to lay claim on Cullen.Stunts involve a raunchy game of poker with a live sex act, a game of chase in the kitchen that ends up in bondage and a spanking, an orgy of five guys and one woman in a hot tub, and a lot more frisking, teasing, and tantalizing.Warning: Contains public exhibition, light bondage and voyeurism",
