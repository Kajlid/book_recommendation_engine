  "description": "History is not something that happened to other people. History is a memory.August A.D. 1120Dijon. A headless corpse is found in a room with shuttered windows and the door locked from the inside. The man's name was Salonius and he was the Duke. His young heir's grasp on the throne is precarious, yet a new alliance is made to safeguard his position.November A.D. 1120Barcelona. Alexander, the Prince, learns that the emperor Enmerkar is looking to add Barcelona to his territories.January A.D. 1121London. Julian, the Governor, finds that Enmerkar has turned his hungry gaze toward England.April A.D. 1121York. Medb, the Queen, discovers that Enmerkar hungers for the whole Isle.Many now recognize the threat posed by Enmerkar's continued expansion, so a game of politics begins to spin a web of alliances and treaties that will thwart Enmerkar. But this is not a web of humankind. These men and women are Algul, a race that lives, unseen, alongside humanity. They are rulers and warriors, storytellers and shapeshifters, magicians and politicians. Each was human once. None is human now. Their learning is far deeper than that of humans, their strength far greater, their lives not curtailed by illness or by age â€“ the price a life lived in the shadows and sustained by blood.Yet while all others are entangled in their political machinations, only one man can see that Salonius's murder was but the first move in a deeper plot, one that even he cannot fully piece together.For, in a world where history is a memory, the greatest danger comes from what has been forgotten.",
