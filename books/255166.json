  "description": "According to Pope John Paul II, if we live according to the true meaning of our sexuality, we \"fulfill the very meaning of [our] being and existence.\" The human body is a \"theology\" because it is meant to be a sign of God's own life and love in the world. With clarity and precision, Christopher West unpacks John Paul II's Theology of the Body, translating it into a language everyone can understand. Theology of the Body for Beginners explores the profound interconnections between sex and the deepest questions of human existence, What is the meaning of life?Why did God create us male and female?How do we attain true happiness on earth?What kind of joys await us in heaven?Why is there evil in the world and how do we overcome it?How can we experience the love we long for in the depth of our hearts?",
