  "description": "Gabriel is an Observer: a member of an ancient race that created Earth and humanity. His task is simple. He observes humans from afar and reports any sign of interference from The Fallen, people of his kind who have broken their most important rule: never interact with humans. But when Gabriel becomes fascinated with a young, vibrant human named Alyssa, it isn't long before he justifies breaking the rule himself.His forbidden association with her doesn't go unnoticed. The Fallen seek to recruit him and The Enforcers, a separate caste of his society who ensure punishment of those who break the rules, force him to hide--all while trying to combat a centuries-old plot by The Fallen to destroy humanity and claim Earth for themselves.Spending most of his time now with Alyssa in her world, Gabriel realizes he's acting more like a human than an Observer, and he must make a choice: sever all ties with his people, or lose the woman he loves.",
