  "description": "Beneath the rollings seas lie the mysteries of forgotten civilizations. Swept by the tides, half buried by the sands, worn away by terrific pressure are the remnants of a culture little known to our age. Where the mighty Pacific now sweeps majestically for thousands of miles, there was once a vast continent. This land was known as Lemuria, and its people as Lemurians. In this book you will learn the incredible truth about the Lemurian race, their civilization's high development, their advanced technology, their deep comprehension of psychic and spiritual laws, and how their civilization was utterly destroyed. Yet the vast knowledge they possessed was not lost but has been preserved - kept alive in the hearts and minds of a sacred group today. Will our present civilization benefit from these inspiring, spiritual truths? This book reveals these things in a way you will never forget. California and the West Coast of the United States were once part of the vast continent of Lemuria. From early times, legends and myths have circulated about California's mountain of mystery - Shasta - linking it with an ancient, forgotten people and a great sunken continent to the west. Is Mt. Shasta the repository of the remnants of Lemurian civilization? What do the strange rock-carved symbols in the Shasta region reveal about an ancient civilization swept from the face of the earth, except for surviviors who live among us today? Now you can witness the evidence and experience the glory that was Lemuria in Wishar S. Cerve's captivating book.",
