Eventually, Abbey would learn that her family history included a link to an ancient prophecy and a mystical tribe of people with telepathic power so strong that people would be willing to kill to control it.H.L. Stafford’s In Plain Sight is filled with intrigue, taut action, and edge-of-your-seat suspense, as well as a heartwarming love story. Stafford skillfully weaves the storylines together and then ties up the ends in a thrilling, surprising, and supremely satisfying conclusion.",
