  "title": "Rainbow World Poems",
  "description": "Trudy's poems are beautifully written, uplifting with positive expressions using everyday words with everyday meanings. Her poems are not strictly about her. Rather, they are about all of us who lust for life and love. Her lyrical words and language usher us into a different place, an escape from the \"daily grind\". By reading her poems you will see that Trudy endeavors to live life to the fullest and, through these poems, invites each of us to tag along. Her insight into life's occasions is keen. Her appreciation for love, life and its gifts is obvious and exposed with explosive emotion, tender words and uproarious humor. Her poetry makes us look at life's challenges a little clearer, think a little harder, question a little more, smile a little broader and laugh a little louder.",
