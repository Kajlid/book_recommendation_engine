Her love for Deidre is unwavering. It appears as though Deidre's web of enchantment has forever entrapped Nova, leaving no escape. However, as they venture further into their senior year of high school, a mix of harsh violence and pure romance tangle the already messed up web of their lives, leaving the two hanging in a very delicate balance. Heartwrenchingly real and breathtakingly beautiful, this tragic love story told through Nova's eyes helps to prove that happy endings - the zenith of life - do exist within the realm of possibilities.",
