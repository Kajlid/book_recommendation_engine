  "description": "Andy Qwinn isn't even ordinary in a family full of extraordinary. She's a straight A student, created her school's Earth Club, has been a top-ranked varsity swimmer since her freshman year and is the youngest person to earn an internship at the aquarium she volunteers at. She dreams of going to college and studying marine biology. In an artistically-minded family, none of this matters. At 17, Andy can't act, draw, paint or sing. She didn't inherit her mother's graceful gift of dance or her father's talent to play any instrument he picks up. Her four siblings have been showcasing their artistic talents since preschool, and even her seemingly mundane stepparents have an artist's flare. However, while the spotlight may be shining brightly on her extraordinary family, not everything is as perfect as it seems. The glare of the stage lights washes out the black and blue of bruises. The roar of applause drowns out the sounds of verbal punches. Costumes and make-up, canvas and paint make it easy to hide what life is really like for Andy.With a brave but risky plan and the click of a mouse, Andy changes an ordinary spring break visitation with her mom, step-dad and step-sister to an extraordinary nine days in Hawaii, working with a couple of monk seals and their intern - Kai. She spends the week experiencing things she's never thought possible before and learning more about herself than she could in any art class.How much can Andy's life change in nine days? Following her dreams. Making her own choices. Dealing with the consequences of those choices. What happens when the Nine Days are up?",
