But what starts out as a perfectly normal day of food fights, rioting classmates, fires and (yawn) threats of expulsion goes suddenly and horribly wrong when a mysterious, wealthy woman appears at the school and adopts Saskia...without her sister. On her own in a mansion full of dark secrets, Saskia stumbles upon a conspiracy that threatens her very life. Meanwhile, desperate to find her, Sadie and Erik escape from the orphanage with a gang of enemies in hot pursuit. Faced with perils beyond their imagination, the trio must decide who to trust and what to believe if they are to survive.",
