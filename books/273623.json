  "description": "Maree Webster―an \"almost-emo\" from the western suburbs of Sydney―hates school, has few friends, and is obsessed with angels and fallen angel stories. Life is boring until she decides to steal a famous painting from a small art gallery that has been haunting her swirling reds, greys and oranges of barely discernible winged figures. There, she meets a stranger who claims to know her and stumbles into a world where cities float in the sky, and daemons roam the barren, magma-spewing crags of the land far below. And all is not well―Maree is turning into something she loves but at the same time, fears. Most fearful of all is the prospect of losing her identity―what makes her Maree, and more importantly, what makes her human.  Guardian of the Sky Realms  takes the reader on a journey through exotic fantasy lands, as well as across the globe, from Sydney to Paris, from the Himalayas to Manhattan. At its heart, it is a novel about transformation.",
