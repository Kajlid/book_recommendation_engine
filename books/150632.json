  "description": "Fred Tutem lives in Greenville as a successful attorney. One night, a car pursues him as he races down a mountain road. Then he has a fiery crash. He wakes and remembers nothing. Everyone is a stranger. He has severe injuries, including a traumatic brain injury and severe burns. Only when he gets back to lap swimming in the pool does his convalescence begin in earnest. Just before the crash, he had a very important, but precarious, task to finish as the personal representative of a multimillion-dollar estate. Will someone try to destroy him again before he gets it done?",
