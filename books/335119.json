  "title": "Hindu Temples What Happened to Them Volume II The Islamic Evidence",
  "description": "The book restricts itself mainly to the study of Hindu temples destroyed and desecrated and converted into mosques and khanqahs without overlooking Muslimâ€™s ideology of iconoclasm; here and there, it also mentions other theological props and concomitants of the iconoclastic ideology. In the book, Ayodhya retains its importance, but it does not occupy the center of discussion. In dealing with its subject, it exercises complete fidelity to truth; unlike secularist and Marxist writers, it does not believe in re-writing and fabricating history.",
