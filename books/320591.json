  "title": "Young Dark Emu: A Truer History",
  "description": "Bruce Pascoe has collected a swathe of literary awards for Dark Emu and now he has brought together the research and compelling first person accounts in a book for younger listeners.Using the accounts of early European explorers, colonists and farmers, Bruce Pascoe compellingly argues for a reconsideration of the hunter-gatherer label for pre-colonial Aboriginal Australians. He allows the listeners to see Australia as it was before Europeans arrived â€“ a land of cultivated farming areas, productive fisheries, permanent homes and an understanding of the environment and its natural resources that supported thriving villages across the continent.",
