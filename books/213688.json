  "title": "Navals of War: ~xX.Deadeye.Xx~’s Tale",
  "description": "An elite sniper in his prime. A mystery prize up for grabs. A competition to end all others. Industry Giant Tornado Tech had promised the prize to end all prizes in their latest game Navals of War, but when it was discovered that the requirements were next to impossible to obtain nearly everyone had given up on it. ~xX.Deadeye.Xx~ and his not so friendly rival AyeBroham still have their eye on the prize, even if it will take years to obtain. But not all contests are created equal and when the prize is suddenly up for grabs both rivals will do anything in their power to be the one that comes out on top. How will the pair face the challenges that await them in a game that now wants to stick it to them at every turn? As the spectacular S.S. Aircraft Carrier looms before them an important question remains unanswered. What kind of first person shooter would pit their players against each other in sex contests? More importantly to ~xX.Deadeye.Xx~ is his own personal question, “What exactly does any port in a storm mean?” Warning: Contains m/m situations and cocky dude-bro banging. While part of a series, this novelette can be read as a stand alone story!",
