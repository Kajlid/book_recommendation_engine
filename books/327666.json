Discover some of the many wonders of Egypt on this alphabetical escapade â€“ foodslike mangoes and konafa, animals such as foxes and jerboas, and places like the Red Sea and Zamalek. At each letter of the alphabet, stop to explore fun alliterative phrases, colorful photographs, and interesting facts. Read through the letters in order, or flip through the pages until one catches your eye. You may choose to read only the phrases at the top of each page or find out more by reading the detailed paragraphs. You are the captain of this journey so how you travel is up to you! A glossary is included that provides the meanings of some of the more challenging English words found in the text. All of the Arabic words are also defined. The website that accompanies An ABC Escapade through Egypt hosts a range of multimedia so readers may explore Egypt even further; audio recordings of all the Arabic words used in the book; writing tips and a place for young authors to publish their own alphabet adventures; and lesson ideas and resources for extension activities to complete after reading.
