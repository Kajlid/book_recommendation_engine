  "description": "Love is for suckers.It’s one of the reasons I’m here in L.A. on the other side of the world from my home in Scotland and the five-star hotel I run with my dad.I’m sick of watching everyone else’s happy ever afters from the sidelines. I mean, if my own mother left me as a baby, what hope do I have of finding a woman who wants to stick around?I’ve spent months traveling, surfing and working on my tan, but my need to work led me to take a temporary job in a gym for six weeks before I fly home.What could possibly change in six weeks?Apparently quite a lot.I could meet someone who rocks my world with her killer curves, hypnotic hips and her purple dresses that leave little to the imagination.She could ask me to take a leap of faith with her I can’t resist taking.She could get me so hot and bothered I end up in the emergency room.She could invite me into her home, introduce me to her dog that looks like a walking cloud, and break me out of my self-inflicted sex sabbatical.She could show me what it feels like to be loved, so I never want to leave.Violet West walked into my life and changed things forever. It’s just a shame that good things never last.*****Lincoln is a steamy standalone, dual point of view, learning to love romantic comedy with a Happy Ever After, and no cliffhanger. Lincoln is Book 1 in The Boys of Castleview Cove Series.",
