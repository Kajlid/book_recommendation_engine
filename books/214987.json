  "title": "The Anarchist's Girlfriend",
  "description": "Fiction. The definitive new edition of an underground classic, updated with vintage art. THE ANARCHIST'S GIRLFRIEND walks the Bowery in early 1980's New York City and absorbs the atmosphere and emotions of those around her. Both mystic and blank canvas, the AG's encounters reflect her society art, politics, business, religion. Inspired by Dostoyevsky's divine Idiot,  the AG is a clairvoyant Brooklyn Go-Go Girl who designs clothes of the future. Delightfully retro and powerfully prescient, the novel satirizes New York's bohemian underground and the America of any time. The AG's roommates include her beloved Anarchist, a silkscreen artist who wants to resolve Ireland's \"troubles\" with organic food, and nihilistic Sandy, a video verite switchboard operator. The story also involves the Llama, who's in the religion business, and his employee, Wayne, a deaf mute journalist with a nose for truth. As passion and hypocrisy erupt in a cloud of dust, character becomes destiny in this novel of ideas. The AG must save her imperiled city. And in the end, innocence is not lost but transcended.\"",
