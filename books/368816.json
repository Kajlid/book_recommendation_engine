  "title": "Anne of Avonlea",
  "description": "Avonlea's new schoolma'am, at the age of 15, is barely older then her pupils. Anne earnestly strives to win the affection of every student while maintaining the decorum of her new role. Her irrepressible spirit and lively imagination, however, often sidetrack her into amusing mischief and mortifying scrapes, all eventually remedied by the warmth of friendship and goodwill.In this classic sequel to Anne of Green Gables , the author once again draws from girlhood memories of Prince Edward Island to portray the sweet, old-fashioned village of Avonlea, situated amid the natural beauty of the Canadian Maritimes. Although Anne and her friends and neighbors dwell in a bygone age of gaslight and horse-drawn carriages, Anne's dreams of the future, lofty aspirations, and romantic visions make her a heroine for all ages. Modern readers continue to share her tribulations and triumphs in leading the village improvement society, adapting to the boisterous arrival at Green Gables of a pair of 6-year-old orphans, and searching always for the company of kindred spirits.Since Anne's debut in 1908, generations of readers around the world have grown up with the starry-eyed young woman with the shining hair (please, call it auburn , not red). This inexpensive new edition of Anne's further adventures ensures the continuation of a joyful tradition.",
