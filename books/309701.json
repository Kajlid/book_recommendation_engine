But, with my band set to go on tour around the world, I have a problem. I need a nanny for my autistic daughter. And unfortunately, Viola Starr, my brother’s ex, is the perfect fit. Now, there is no escaping her. Or our past. Especially when my brother seems determined to win her back. Five months and she’ll be out of my life again. Five months of ignoring lingering, heated glances. The fire she draws out of me. The way she loves my daughter. Five months… And my world is about to come crashing down around me.
