  "description": "Mystery Suspense Short StoriesThe stories “Death by Lightning”, “The Sparrow Man” and “The Time I Almost Drown” are all fiction based on real life events.\" Dark Side Stories and Toe Tags & TNT are the only adult books in my Ozark Mountains series, the other novels and short stories are enjoyed by all ages. Reviews: \"To understand Overland Park writer Rolland Love, think MARK TWAIN.\" Nick Kowalczyk, The Kansas City Star. \"Rolland, your writing reminds me of reading the Hardy Boy adventures and Mark Twain when I was younger. You are able to create vivid mind pictures. I've read most all of Stephen King's books and he does that for me. Keep writing great stories.\" Larry Bodinson, PI \"Rolland Love writers in the Mark Twain vein. Excellent storyteller who does not rely on graphic language or sex to cover up a weak story line. His stories are a fast-paced page-flipper of a read.” Molly Martin, Scribes World",
