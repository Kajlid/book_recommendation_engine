  "description": "Bobby is a werebear and Lynn is the lone mortal at school. Lynn tutors Bobby for finals but he's falling asleep as a mysterious storm hits. She's stumped for the first time. Lynn feels like a square peg in a round hole. She didn't fit at her old school because she's too smart. She's an outsider here because she's not supernatural. Maybe Bobby can help her finally feel at home in this crazy school. If only she can figure out how to keep him awake. Bobby can't fail. But either Mother Nature or something worse is trying to make it happen with this storm. Who'd want a nice guy like Bobby to flunk out? Read about these student sleuths in Bearly Awake, the first in a ten book series.",
