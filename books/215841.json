  "description": "When serial womanizer Jack Banks hits on the wrong beauty, a Spanish witch who’s been turning thoughtless men into dogs since one broke her teenage heart over three hundred years ago, he wakes up as a Labrador retriever. As if that and navigating a far from stray dog-friendly city weren’t frustrating enough, he falls in love for the first time with Karen, the young woman with an outsized heart for animals who adopts him. She clearly loves him too, as a dog. But even if he can break the spell, will she love him as a man?",
