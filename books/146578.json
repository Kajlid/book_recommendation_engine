History made him a spy.1755, Grand Pré, Acadia — British soldiers descend upon peaceful Acadian settlements, forcing families from their land in a wave of terror and betrayal. When Clément Gosselin witnesses a secret exchange between a terrified British courier and a mysterious stranger, he stumbles into a conspiracy far darker than war itself—and begins a journey that will transform him from a hunted boy into something far more dangerous.As his family scatters and the Acadian resistance smolders beneath the surface, Clément must lead his brothers through burning villages, shadowed forests, and a widening net of imperial surveillance. But the deeper he travels, the more he realizes this fight isn’t just about home—it’s about truth, legacy, and the soul of a nation not yet born.Haunted by a pale-faced stranger who seems to manipulate events from the shadows, and guided by whispered alliances with Mi’kmaq warriors and French loyalists, Clément’s path will take him far from the life he knew—into the inner workings of espionage, sabotage, and revolution.
