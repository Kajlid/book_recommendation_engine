  "description": "Tor.com Publishing has bought The Woman at the Tower Window, a radical retelling of a classic damsel in distress fairytale from one of the genreâ€™s luminaries that upends the idea of the sheltered princess waiting for her prince. Here, Rapunzel is a young woman who has retreated from the world by choice. Her older lover, a female professor of anthropology, is a witch only in the eyes of her suitor, a man who feverishly misreads the situation.",
