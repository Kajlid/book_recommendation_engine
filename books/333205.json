  "description": "The Dragon King is looking for a wife.This news throws the women in my village into a tizzy. The king will be sending out the royal guard to bring women of childbearing age to his castle in Jade City.There is only one requirement: the woman must carry enough magic to produce an heir for him.I’m a watered-down human with a mere ten percent dragon magic lineage, I know I won’t be chosen, but for some reason the magic sniffers command me to present myself to the king as a possible wife.I’m ready to go to Jade City until my mother tells me a terrifying secret. A secret that could get me killed… by the king himself.",
