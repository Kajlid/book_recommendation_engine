  "description": "For them it’s all a game, but to me it’s survival.When an opportunity to work at the exclusive island resort called The Limit comes up, I can’t say no. I’ll only be a maid, but at least it’ll get me off the streets and offer me somewhere to hide out from my stepfather.But a case of mistaken identity changes everything.The men who own this place—Brody, Wilder, Rafferty, and Asher—think I am someone else, and when an offer of winning a million dollars is put in front of me, how can I tell them the truth?These men are all different, but they all have one thing in common, they’re all broken, and now they want to break me.The game involves a hunt across the island. If I win, I get my heart’s desire. If they win, they get to do whatever they want to me.But as the days pass, limits get blurred and boundaries are broken, and as my secrets bubble to the surface, the danger only increases.What will happen when they discover my lie?",
