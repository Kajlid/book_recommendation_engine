  "description": "Zombie Zora (Book 1- Zora Baker series) If you are a crackerjack shot, the army will overlook your spacing out, but not following orders, they might just throw you to the zombies with a smile. 19-year-old Zora Baker has dozens of problems. She never said she was army material. To keep her out of trouble, they assign her to a rescue squad with Brittany and Matthew. They get separated and as they make their way back to camp, they face old zombies with missing limbs, new fast zombies that leap out of nowhere, people in the midst of the change, and hordes of scavengers eking out an existence. Can they make it back with information to destroy the zombies? Will zombies take them out? What about the scavengers? How many can they take out before it is their turn? Those questions are meaningless. Zora’s deliver the information and get back to her brother. Anyone or anything that gets in the way of that goal will get put down. Cross her at your own peril. Watch out Zombie World, here she comes and she plans on sending you all to Hell—Screaming!",
