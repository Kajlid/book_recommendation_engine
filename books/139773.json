He's had every woman he's ever wanted, and his stately mother never ceases to try and find \"the right one\" for him on their Easter get-togethers. But Keith's idea of \"the right one\" is completely opposite to what his mother thinks. (His mother believes that not even the incumbent Princess of Monaco is good enough for her son.) Added to that, Keith is bored.Until he meets Melissa.And then things get interesting...* CONTENT WARNING: Contains steamy sex scenes interspersed in between the humor. Intended to be read by ADULTS ONLY! *",
