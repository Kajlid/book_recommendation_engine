  "description": "I never wanted a mate. Until I was put in chains. Strapped down. And claimed. I always believed I could analyze any situation until I found a solution. Solve any problem if I just applied my brain. I went to university, studied science and told myself my academic cocoon would protect me from the alphas dominating our society. I was wrong. No textbook prepared me for my meeting with test subject 351. The biggest, scariest alpha on death row, hauled into my lab to uncover how to control the beast of a man. How to make him submit. Mold him into a weapon. But there is no controlling the feral alpha, and no logic strong enough to save my mind once he unleashes his fury on my body. Once he claims me. Obsession is the first book in Nora Ash's second suspense-filled Omegaverse serial, Feral.  Please note: This series gets dark, and it gets dirty. If you don't enjoy your romance scorching and your alphas rough & dominant, give this book a pass.",
