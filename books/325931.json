  "title": "Loop",
  "description": "Devastated by the death of his young wife, Alix, the author conceives a project that will allow him not only to continue writing, but to continue living - writing a book that leads him to confront his terrible loss as well as examine the lonely world in which he now seems, increasingly, to exist: that of Memory. The Loop finds Roubaud returning to his earliest recollections, as well as considering the nature of memory itself, and the process - both merciful and terrible - of forgetting. By turns playful and despairing, The Loop is a masterpiece of contemporary prose.",
