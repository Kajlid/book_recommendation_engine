  "title": "Over the Sea, To Me",
  "description": "A novelette retelling an old ballad.  A castle of marvels, by the sea -- full of goblins and sprites. Many young knights come in search of adventures, and leave in search of something less adventurous.  A knight brave enough to face it could even woo the Lady Isobel there, but when Sir Beichan and she catch the attention of her father, the castle has horrors as well as wonders, enough to hold him prisoner. Winning freedom may only separate them, unless its marvels can be used to unite them, over the sea.",
