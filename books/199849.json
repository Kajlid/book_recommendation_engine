  "description": "Dr. Victoria Gray, neurologist, is fed up with her humdrum life in cold, rainy Paris, and sets out for a vacation on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin. She determines to create a new identity for herself, at least during this holiday, and leave behind the old Victoria \"the Gray…\" After a radical makeover, she meets Massimo Baldini, a man with the perfect mix of nonchalant, gruff Frenchman and hot-blooded Italian. But when Massimo asks her for her “first and last name” in a rather direct way, almost like a cop, she’s taken by surprise, and blurts out, “Vicky, Vicky Golden.”One little lie. But one lie leads to another, and eventually it all ends up a hopeless tangle that throws her and Massimo, actually an undercover agent posing as a sailing instructor, into a web of intrigue. Massimo may be an old hand at living a double life, but when Victoria finds herself in strange, sometimes dangerous situations inconceivable to her “old life,” she has to confront her fears, cynicism and false assumptions. Along the way, both she and Massimo learn to stop hiding and start trusting, but is it too late to find each other? Is it too late to seek true love?Author Valerie Lieko, a pediatric neurologist, lives in the French West Indies with her husband and their three children. She is hard at work on her second novel, also set in the Caribbean, but this new romance will develop amid the gods, spirits and demons of West Indies folklore.",
