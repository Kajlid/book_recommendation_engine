  "description": "Librarian turned Gladiatrix.  That's what a female gladiator is called, not a term for a dominatrix in gladiator gear. Bummer right? I wish.  I'm Octavia Alexander. A few days ago, I was hiding out under a facade of normalcy, hiding my magic by being as mundane as possible. Every card I touch comes to life between my fingers, a simple deck of playing cards could be a deadly weapon in my hands.  Today, I've been recruited to a supernatural tournament of dragons in Ancient Rome, the dragon population is so low they have to recruit other sorts of magical creatures from other realms and times. Now I need to survive eleven battles to the death to earn my freedom against the biggest and baddest monsters from history and mythology.  Thankfully, the most dangerous dragons aren't in the arena, they're in my bed.  I thought I knew all of their secrets but I was so wrong, their secrets might just get us all killed. *Do you like edge-of-your-seat action? Heart pounding sexual tension? Inappropriate humor?
