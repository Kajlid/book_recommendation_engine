  "description": "Now that Crystal has turned sixteen, she can transform into a Red Dragon, just like everyone else in the kingdom. Having moved to the capital with her mother to finish her studies among the elite of Red Dragon society, she is only interested in enjoying the last two years of school. But then she meets John, the strange and exceptional student who insists that somehow she is special. He is a constant reminder that she is different, with her blonde hair in a Kingdom of redheads. And he always seems to be there, just when she and her friends need him most. Despite her best efforts to stay away from this strange new boy and finish the school year, Crystal may just find that she needs his help more than she is willing to admit. From the East comes the growing threat of conflict with the Blue Dragons, who are bent on killing them all.",
