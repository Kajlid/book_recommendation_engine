Many know it as the place where fortunes can be made and lost though games of chess, backgammon - every game under the sun.But a select few, who are picked to compete in the higher league, know that some games are played for higher stakes - those of politics and empires, of economics and kings . . .In 1930s Bangkok, one higher league player has just been challenged to a game of hide and seek.
