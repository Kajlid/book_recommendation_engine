  "description": "Never trust the spy who loves you.Staff Sergeant Alexei Dvorkin has a history with spies that typically ends with most of them dead. But Agent Sean Delaney is proving to be the frustrating exception to every one of Alexei’s rules of engagement. As part of Alpha Team’s long-running mission to stop an enemy metahuman, the two are constantly forced to work together, resulting in a simmering attraction neither can ignore.When the MDF tasks them with finding evidence of criminal wrongdoing against the owner of a private military company, Sean knows exactly how to play the game to win. But it’s one thing to con the enemy, quite another to con his own heart. When the mission goes sideways, Sean must put his life in Alexei’s dangerously capable hands and hope their burgeoning relationship doesn’t go up in flames.",
