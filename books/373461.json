  "title": "The Nature of the Gods",
  "description": "'My present intention is to clear myself of any suspicion of partially by presenting the views of the generality of philosophers concerning the nature of the gods.'In The Nature of the Gods, Cicero presents a detailed account of the Greek theories of deity, examining the theologies of the Epicureans and the Stoics, together with critical objections to these doctrines raised by the Academic school. Providing vital evidence of the views of the Greek philosophers of the Hellenistic age, Cicero also casts light on the intellectual life of first-century Rome. When these Greek beliefs are translated into the Roman context they result in a fascinating clash of ideologies.This new translation of a work whose importance is becoming increasingly recognized is complemented by an invaluable introduction to the main philosophical issues, as well as substantial and helpful annotation.",
