  "description": "You've heard of the Horse Whisperer -- now meet the woman who uses similar methods to train dogs. Jan Fennell's remarkable gifts have earned her the nickname \"the dog listener\". Her unique understanding of the canine world and its instinctive language has enabled her to bring even the most desperate and delinquent of dogs to heel. This easy-to-follow guide to understanding Jan's simple techniques draws on her countless case histories of problem dogs -- from biters and barkers to bicycle chasers -- to show how we can bridge the language barrier that separates man from his best friend. In The Dog Listener Jan shares her secrets, telling us how she grew determined to find a more compassionate alternative to standard \"obedience\" training techniques and ultimately how to communicate with canines.",
