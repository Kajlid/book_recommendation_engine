  "title": "Hungry: A Young Model's Story of Appetite, Ambition, and the Ultimate Embrace of Curves",
  "description": "Hungry is an uplifting memoir with a universal message about body image, beauty, and self-confidence, and an inspiring, cautionary tale for women of all ages.At fourteen, I was a regular junior high school student in Clinton, Mississippi, when a modeling scout told me: You could be a supermodel...but you'll have to lose a little weight. For glamour, fame, and escape, I lost seventy pounds. This is a photo of me at sixteen, when I signed a big modeling contract, moved to New York City, and started traveling around the world. It is also when I developed a ferocious case of anorexia and exercise bulimia. Until I decided enough was enough—I wanted to live. And so I ate. And ate. Offering a behind-the-scenes peek into the modeling industry, as well as a trenchant look at our weight-obsessed culture, Hungry is an inspiring and cautionary tale that will resonate with anyone who has battled society’s small-minded definitions of beauty. This is me now, the leading plus-size model in America.",
