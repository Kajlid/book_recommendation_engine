  "description": "This volume collects the first two novellas in the Spinward Fringe Resurrection and Awakening. Captain Jacob Valance has no memory of his past. Left on a strange ship in an unfamiliar sector of the galaxy, he was forced to begin a new life. Years pass and in that time he's earned a reputation as a man who can hunt down hardened criminals and go where others fear to tread. The crew of the Samson are caught up in the problems of their Captain as his past starts to catch up with him. Just as new allies start to fall in line old enemies come creeping out of the shadows, putting everyone at risk. While the crew struggles to deal with their own problems, Regent Galactic begins putting a plan in motion that will bring about the fourth fall of man and position their Corporation as the dominant power on the fringe. Their ambition and greed spell disaster for mankind. The Spinward Fringe Series follows after the First Light Chronicles, available in a collected Omnibus.",
