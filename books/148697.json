  "description": "Jesse James was a rock star with the high profile life that went with it. When everything fell apart, as far as Jessy was concerned, she had two choices: blow her brains out or disappear. But after years in seclusion with no one knowing where she is, she realizes that she’s alive, but she isn’t living. This time around will things be different or will trying to get back into the business and back to living only drive her deeper into hiding?",
