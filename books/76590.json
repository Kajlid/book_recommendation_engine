  "description": "Lucy Taylor has a rare gift of writing horror stories about sex that are extremely provocative, and yet touched as well as with longing, even wistfulness. In these nine tales about demons and angels, wrestlers and boxers, and other denizens of a netherworld of erotic terror, she achieves just the right balance of a bleak, unflinching worldview, and characters whose need for fulfillment reveals their underlying humanity. Unnatural Acts includes her classic \"The Safety of Unknown Cities,\" which won a Bram Stoker Award when expanded to novel length.
