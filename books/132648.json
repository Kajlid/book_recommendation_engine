  "description": "Callahan's Crosstime Saloon is back in business! After waiting long enough for the crowds to thin out, Mike Callahan, proprietor of the famous Callahan's Crosstime Saloon, is opening the doors again to new customers. And to help cope with the long lines he justifiably expects, he's asked Hugo Award-winning author Spider Robinson to pitch in. The Spider sweetens the pot with both fiction and the nonfiction that has earned him his reputation as one of science fiction's foremost critics.So, if you're looking for a good night out someplace where the beer is always cold, the times are always hot and disco was dead to begin with, then belly up to the bar in Callahan's. Human or otherwise, hale and hearty or down and out, regardless of race, creed or dimension of origin, you're all welcome. But remember - Time Travelers Strictly Cash!",
