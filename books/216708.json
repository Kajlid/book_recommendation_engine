  "description": "Set across the backdrop of refugee migration that spans East Africa, the US and Australia, How Fast Can You Run is the inspiring true story of a five-year-old boy's flight from war in southern Sudan, and his journey to find his mother. When the US grants approximately 4,000 unaccompanied minors political asylum, Majok becomes Michael, and he is given a new start in the US. Yet his life is not without trauma, culminating when a fellow student betrays him. This is the story of a survivor who summons the courageous spirit of millions of refugees throughout historyâ€”and it lives on today.",
