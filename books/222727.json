Untouched is an enthralling story of Aria Cason who has turned her back on love in favor of her career. Aria's past gives her reason to redirect her life and strictly focus on success; allowing little to no room for anything more. Every part of Aria's life is structured and organized, including love and sex, which are always strategically planned until Aiden Wyatt. Aiden surfaces at Raine Publishing House as an intern who, from the initial meeting, causes several side-steps for Aria. Aiden's extraordinary good looks and commanding demeanor change Ariaâ€™s structured world, unlocking feelings that she has vowed to never embrace as he introduces her to a world of intimacy she's never before experienced. Aiden's presence ultimately forces her to face past demons and fight to keep the current ones at bay as she realizes that running is never the answer.",
