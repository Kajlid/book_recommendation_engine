This is a novel about obsession: an obsession for collecting; about collecting paintings; paintings of the Newlyn School. John Branfield cleverly weaves his story through fact and fiction. His narrator Roger Travail, writer and passionate collector is torn between his obsession and the displeasure of his wife, echoing his inner conscience. How low can someone fall in their own estimation to pursue their goal? Matters come to a head when he has the opportunity to acquire a collection of 'lost' paintings from an elderly man who has no idea of their value.Written with wit and keen observation; the author displays his knowledge of the Newlyn painters lightly and humorously.Paperback with dustjacket.",
