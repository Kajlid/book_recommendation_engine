Outsiders came, but it was not to learn from us; it was to change us. There was a war and a university, an oil company and a small village, all run by men. There was a young man who hunted geese to feed his family and another who studied geese to save them. And there was a young woman who flew into the world of spirits to save herself...\"So relates Kayuqtuq Ugungoraseok, \"the red fox\". An orphan traumatized by her past, she seeks respect in her traditional Inupiat village through the outlawed path of shamanism. Her plan leads to tragedy when she interferes with scientist Leif Trygvesen, who has come to research the effects of oil spills on salt marshes - and evade the draft. Told from both Kayuqtuq's and Leif's perspectives, Flight of the Goose is a tale of cultural conflict, spiritual awakening, redemption and love in a time when things were - to use the phrase of an old arctic shaman - \"no longer familiar\".\"What an extraordinary novel... (Thomas) deals with shamanism and sorcery in a very realistic way...\" ~ \"Sacred Hoop Magazine\" \"Masterful... Remarkable... Gripping...The authenticity palpable... A joy, a big broad deep river of a book, a work of substance and great beauty of both vision and style... I was moved by the characters and their fates as I have not been by a novel in a long time.\" ~ Richard Hoffman, author of \"Half the House\"Read at universities and schools, book-clubs and in academic libraries worldwide",
