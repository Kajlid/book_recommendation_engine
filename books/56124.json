  "title": "Confessions Of A Romantic Pornographer",
  "description": "Following the death of a minor league writer, a mysterious woman whose own past is full of contradictions is called in to investigate his life and to discover the lost manuscript of his memoirs, lest they incriminate people in high places.Her journey of discovery becomes a dazzling and confusing exploration of the nature of autobiography and the awfully grey zones between truth and fiction. As she encounters the women who knew him, she realises every one has a different story to tell and the only thing they have in common is that they were all loved by the writer.So who was he? A man addicted to women? A romantic? A compulsive Don Juan? A serial adulterer? A pornographer? A lost soul? A liar? Does the book he is believed to have written even exist? With every new revelation come another series of questions.",
