  "description": "Earl Preston has been fighting dark, seemingly impossible forces, trying to prevent the return of ancient, otherworldly beings — creatures of unfathomable intellect, rumored to have created all life here on Earth. Gods or monsters, these unseen puppet masters continue to pull strings despite a millennia of exile. Now, as the gateway to their alien world nears completion, Earl must locate Hades’ secret base of operations, must destroy this doorway before it can ever be opened. And time is running out. Scattered across the globe, allies and foes alike are coming together — Poseidon, Hades, and Zeus, all rallying their forces for one last confrontation. This will be a battle to end all battles, and its outcome will decide the fate of generations yet to come. In this fourth and final installment of the Legacy of the Gods series, bestselling author Michael West provides answers to all the questions faithful readers have been asking for years, closing his dark, fantastic narrative in spectacular fashion. Prepare for Kronos’ Return!",
