  "description": "Former government agent Frank Compton foiled a plot to enslave the galaxy in Night Train to Rigel . But the Modhri, an ancient telepathically linked intelligence, has walkers, unwilling hosts that can be anywhere, anythingâ€¦and anyone. And Compton is the only man who knows how to fight them, as they wage a secret war against the galactic civilizations linked by the Quadrail, the only means of intra-galactic transit. Accompanied by Bayta, a woman with strange ties to the robot-like Spiders who run the Quadrail, and dogged by special agent Morse who suspects him of murder, Compton races the Modhri from station to station to acquire a set of valuable sculptures from a long-dead civilization. What the Modhri wants with them is anybody's guess, but if Compton can't outwit it, the whole galaxy will find out the hard way.",
