But Neal’s victory began a genocidal war that cost him dearly. Now the future he hoped for is unraveling. Count Berengar has invited the lovely Genevera, Aarundel’s granddaughter, to join in a quest to bring stability to the land. Pressed to accomplish the impossible, Genevera suggests the unthinkable—raising Neal from the dead. But what is true in legend is not always true in reality.
