Nate \"Bear\" Tucker has dealt with his homosexuality by protecting others. No one has ever tempted him to \"come out\" and jeopardize his promising football career. That is until he meets Liam. Soccer player, Liam O'Brien is in dire need of a guardian angel, and Bear is more than happy to protect the cute sophomore. The problem is the more time Bear spends with Liam the smaller the closet becomes. Even more, with the start of a new year and new life, Bear's football career is endangered by a hidden enemy. This time he'll need Liam to protect him ... from himself.",
