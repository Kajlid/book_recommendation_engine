  "description": "King of the Forest by Lucinda Marcoux is a Family Saga Novel, which is a novel that tells the story of a tragic event that takes place in the life of one family. It was my pleasure to work on this book with the author. The day that I met Lucinda, my family was going through a tragic moment ourselves. We had just been informed that one of our favorite cousins had just passed away from breast cancer. It was too late to cancel our meeting and Lucinda walked into a home filled with sadness and grief. All of this made her story more relevant to me. Lucinda s story is one of a brother and sister and the life and love shared between them. It is a story known to many, but no matter how often it is told, it is never understood until it hits you and your family. The purpose of a Family Saga Novel is two-fold. One is to help the family deal with the pain by telling their story, and two, is to help other families reading the book to know that they are not alone. Lucinda s book fulfills both of these objectives because she has such a deep love of her family and her brother. The book rings true with both her family and the reader. You are not alone as Lucinda speaks from her heart and mind. Lucinda has a medical background and the story not only tells of the pain in her soul but also the science behind the medicine. The book does not overdose the reader with technical terms but walks you through the complex issues with a helping hand and gives you a shoulder to cry on.",
