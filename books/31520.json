  "title": "The Secret Life of Siegfried and Roy: How the Tiger Kings Tamed Las Vegas",
  "description": "From their humble beginnings in war-torn Germany, larger than life Tiger Kings Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy Horn roared into Las Vegas and tamed Sin City like no other act before them. Their mind-blowing illusions captivated the world and broke box-office records. In just one decade at The Mirage, their magical extravaganza—featuring rare white tigers, lions, and elephants—grossed an astounding half billion dollars. Then, in one tragic instant, their world came crashing down. On October 3, 2003, Roy Horn was savagely attacked on stage by his 600-pound white tiger, Mantecore. Beating back death’s icy grip after he literally “died” on the operating table, dark-haired Roy fought for survival as his blond doppelganger Siegfred watched and prayed. Suddenly, the show was over…or was it? In The Secret Life of Siegfried and Roy , three members of their inner circle—Jimmy Lavery, Jim Mydlach, and Louis Mydlach—unravel the story behind the famous duo’s onstage act and personal drama. Louis—at Roy’s side throughout his traumatic recovery—describes in detail the agonies of rehabilitating the partially paralyzed performer. Louis’ father, Jim—head of security for the magicians—and Jimmy Lavery, a show consultant to the pair, provide additional insights about the ultimate showmen, as they masterfully hid a lifetime of secrets. In this compelling read, the authors reveal that the lives of Siegfried & Roy was their ultimate illusion.",
