  "description": "Phoenician Prince Talen Jacek has lived a cursed existence for over two thousand years. Suffering one violent death after another, though, is nothing compared to the emotional isolation he endures. Computer programmer Keri Maddox's life may not be exciting, but predictability is her mantra. Then she discovers Talen in her apartment wearing only a towel and her safe, tidy world is yanked from under her feet. An inferno of carnal need erupts between them. Yet the power of their igniting love may not be enough to save Keri from a killer who is determined to deliver the inevitable death stroke.",
