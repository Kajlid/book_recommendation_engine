Or at least that’s how my day starts out.By the end of it I somehow find myself shackled to not only one dragon but five. Five pain in the ass dragons that want me just as much as I want them, which is not at all.Fate is a fickle bitch.Someone send booze.I’m going to need it.This is a Reverse Harem paranormal romance, meaning the FMC gets all the peens unless they also like to share with each other... There will be sword crossing in this series, along with battles, bad language, and one hell of an adventure. If that sounds good to you, hold on to your dragon and enjoy the ride.",
