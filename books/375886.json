  "title": "Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation",
  "description": "Through sloppy usage and low standards on the internet, in e-mail and now \"txt msgs\", we have made proper punctuation an endangered species. In \"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\", former editor Lynne Truss dares to say that it is time to look at our commas and semicolons and see them as the wonderful and necessary things they are. If there are only pedants left who care, then so be it. This is a book or people who love punctuation and get upset when it is mishandled. From George Orwell shunning the semicolon, to \"New Yorker\" editor Harold Ross's epic arguments with James Thurber over commas, this lively history makes a powerful case for the preservation of a system of printing conventions that is much too subtle to be mucked about with.",
