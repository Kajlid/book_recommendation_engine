  "description": "The full, explosive story for the first time:Putin’s espionage campaign against the West, how it intensified in the last decade and how the warning signs were missed -The Russian ‘deep cover’ spies who penetrated the US and the years-long FBI hunt to track and capture them -The recruitment, running, and escape of one of the most important spies of modern times, a man who worked inside the heart of Russian intelligence-The evolution of Russian espionage against the West including its use of ‘cyber illegals’ who continue to manipulate us today and pose a significant threat to the 2020 election-And much moreLike a scene from a John le Carre novel or the TV drama The Americans, in the summer of 2010 a group of Russian deep cover sleeper agents were arrested. It was the culmination of a decade-long investigation, and ten people, including Anna Chapman, were swapped for four people held in Russia. At the time it was seen simply as a throwback to the Cold War. But that would prove to be a costly mistake. It was a sign that the Russian threat had never gone away and more importantly, it was shifting into a much more disruptive new phase. Today, the danger is clearer than ever following the poisoning in the UK of one of the spies who was swapped, Sergei Skripal, and the growing evidence of Russian interference in American life.Russians Among Us describes for the first time the story of deep cover spies in America and the FBI agents who tracked them. In intimate and riveting detail, it reveals new information about today’s spies—as well as those trying to catch them and those trying to kill them.",
