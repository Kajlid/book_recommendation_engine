  "description": "Stories are meant to be told. But many stories go unfinished, unpublished and unread. What happens to the characters in those books when nobody reads them? Where do they go? In a city populated by these forgotten literary denizens, Jack Reynolds works as a member of an ancient order called “The Heroes,” who are charged with defeating villainy and maintaining order. Alongside an immortal humanoid computer and a knight from a children’s tale, Jack must solve a case by the end of the week or his division will be permanently closed. After stumbling across a case of illegal magic which threatens the safety of the entire city, Jack also realizes that solving this mystery is the only way he can do right by his friends. With time and veiled forces aligned against him, does Jack have what it takes to be a Hero one last time?",
