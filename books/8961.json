  "title": "Gang Wars of the North: The Inside Story of the Deadly Battle Between Viv Graham and Lee Duffy",
  "description": "Viv Graham and Lee Duffy led parallel lives as pub and club enforcers, raging their gangland turf wars with a fierce frenzy of brutality and unremitting cruelty. This frank and astonishing book by underworld authority Stephen Richards is a riveting double portrait of two of the North East's most feared men whose bloody rivalry was cut short when they each met horrifically violent ends. With a frightening capacity for extreme violence, Tyneside protection hardman Viv struck fear into the hearts of his enemies, yet his benevolence to local charities and schemes to keep kids away from drugs and crime was well knownâ€”any patch that Viv protected was guaranteed free of both. He was the ultimate maverick trouble-shooter. Teeside drugs enforcer Lee Duffy had half his foot shot off in an assassination attempt and his skull beaten with a crowbar, but his streetwise instinct was unmatched. With unprecedented access to friends, family, and associates, Stephen Richards dispels many of the myths surrounding these legendary figures.",
