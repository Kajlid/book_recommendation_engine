  "description": "s/tThe Complete Classic Space Opera SeriesThis is the complete collection of the highly regarded and influential Arcot, Morey and Wade science fiction stories by John W. Campbell. When these classic tales of interplanetary wars and high adventure in space were first published in the pioneering days of modern SF they rivalled the work of such renowned contemporaries as E. E. 'Doc' Smith in popularity. Here you will meet the dynamic team of young twenty second century scientists-Arcot, the physicist, Morey, the mathematician and Wade, the chemist. The three books included here, 'The Black Star Passes', 'Islands in Space' and 'Invaders from the Infinite' are 'hard' SF, firmly based on current knowledge at the time they were written. Whatever the problem, no matter how threatening the alien menace, the dynamic trio rise to the occasion! Campbell's stories evolve with the maximum amount of pace and satisfying action and are now available from Leonaur in soft cover or collectors' hard cover with dust jacket.",
