  "description": "The last time I spoke was eight years ago when my best friend tried to kill me. I never dreamed my silence would break with a scream.Being sent to Chapel Crest after my new stepfather deemed me a heathen seemed like a blessing compared to staying with him and my mom. I was a mute demon in his eyes, and when the rod didn’t beat the evil out of me, he prayed Chapel Crest could.I envisioned the religious academy would become my sanctuary. I was wrong. So very wrong. Chapel Crest was an asylum moonlighting as a religious school. It's where the meds take out the demons in your head or the punishments from the staff will.If this place and its rules didn’t break me, Dante Church and his cult of bullies would.They called themselves the Watchers. They were dark and ruthless—everything a girl like me should avoid. But maybe something was wrong with me because the thought of being on my knees for the four devils appeals to me.Even if it meant I was praying for survival.Going to Church took on a whole new meaning at Chapel Crest.Church is book one of The Boys of Chapel Crest. It’s a dark bully romance with four guys chasing one girl. There is no choosing. Only begging. And lots of praying. Please read the foreword.",
