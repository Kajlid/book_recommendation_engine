  "description": "Every night the little girl in the moon watches the earth from afar just like the earthlings gaze at the moon and wish upon the stars. One night she sees so many wishes not quite reaching the stars and she tells her mommy how it worries her. She wants, with all her heart, to help the wishes get to the stars so they will come true. Her mommy whispers a secret to her that sparks the little girl's imagination. Before long the Little Girl in the Moon gets a 'Big Idea' and she and her Moonling friends write a song to go with it. All the moonling families gather to sing the song and something very special happens. The \"Big Idea\" works! And, for a moment in time, there is peace and harmony in the universe.",
