  "description": "Donuts is a fairy tale with a modern day appeal. Meet Merl, a plucky, young squirrel who makes his home in a vast wilderness where all the trees have been cut to the ground. When Merl finds the very last acorn, he makes an extraordinary wish, resulting in one final oak tree sprouting. However, Merl’s wish is far from granted when the tree’s sprawling branches fail to bloom one single nut. A visit to a park turns Merl’s world upside down and his tree will never be the same. This is a majestic and poignant tale that exemplifies the beauty of loyalty in the friendship that grows between a squirrel and his tree. Donuts will touch the hearts of readers and make the most ardent cynic, smile. Stunning illustrations and melodic rhyming text make this enchanting adventure a memorable read.",
