  "description": "Encompassed by Enemies Bent on Their Destruction, Their Hopes Were Fixed on-The Key to Zion The fifth book in THE ZION CHRONICLES, The Key to Zion opens with the British in the final stages of their military evacuation from Palestine. Haj Amin Husseini and the Arab Palestinians have been impatiently awaiting this day, but their power has gradually eroded. Five Mid-Eastern nations have gathered around the tiny country to divide it up for themselves, totally ignoring the interests of the Palestinians in their greedy conspiracy to destroy the Jews. While the Jewish Haganah frantically trains its pilots in fighter planes which they, ironically, have bought from Germany Moshe is still attempting to supply the Old City of Jerusalem with food. Even before statehood is declared on May 14, 1948, full-scale fighting breaks out between the Arabs and the Jews with no intervention from the British. And caught in the middle are the fleeing Palestinian refugees clogging the roads in front of the incoming armies. The Key to Zion signals the hour of destiny",
