  "description": "“It’s a dangerous time for a Witch.”The scars left behind by the Blood Massacre of 1888 still run deep through the Witches of Britain a hundred and thirty-five years later. Queen Mara, who led the Witches to victory on that harrowing night, must once again face her old enemy as well as a mysterious group of rebels with seemingly no motive. Tired and ready to retire, Queen Mara wants nothing more than to pass the baton on to her only living heir......too bad Lumen doesn’t want to be Queen.With only a few weeks left until she turns twenty-one and must officially claim the title of Heir to the Blood Crown, Lumen is determined to spend her last moments of freedom doing what she loves best – sneaking out to walk among mortals and getting outrageously drunk at the upcoming Samhain Ball. Fate has a different idea. As a night of debauchery drags on, Lumen is embroiled in a mystery that will rewrite history, shed light on the recent attacks on Witches, and send her on a path to discover the true culprit behind her parents’ murders.A hundred and thirty-five years in the past, two brothers are the only reason that the ignorant Witches of Gallows End haven’t been slayed in their entirety. Though the Grave brothers’ names may never make it into the history books, that doesn’t mean they’ll be entirely forgotten.",
