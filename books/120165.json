  "description": "The complete HYDE trilogy. This box set contains all three full-length novels and is intended for adults because of very naughty language, biting sarcasm, and descriptive love scenes. HYDE, an Urban Two people bonded by a curse of heredity and the manipulation of an unknown entity. When the truth leaves them nothing to hold onto, they will be forced into a partnership neither expected…or wanted. Because in life, who you trust is as important as who you are. And when you can't even trust yourself, sometimes the only person you can rely on is the last person on earth you should be falling for. JEKYLL, an Urban After waking up in her enemy’s spare bedroom, Eden will do whatever is necessary to get back to Mitch. Because his life depends on it. Mitch has lost something he never thought he'd find to begin with. And \"It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all\" is a lie. A lie people tell themselves to make the pain go away. But the pain doesn't go away, not in someone like Mitch. It festers. It grows. Until it can't be held back, even by the bars of a cage. STRANGE CASE, an Urban In this final chapter of Mitch and Eden's story, everyone will be tested. Morality and honor weighed against getting the job done. But desperation can make people do things they never thought they’d be capable of. And returning from hell is a pretty damn big wake-up call, especially once Mitch realizes that the woman he loves has been in a different kind of hell…and she can’t get out of it.",
