  "description": "My Best Stories     is a dazzling selection of stories—seventeen favourites chosen by the author from across her distinguished career. The stories are arranged in the order in which they were written, allowing even the most devoted Munro admirer to discover how her work developed. \"Royal Beatings\" shows us right away how far we are from the romantic world of happy endings. \"The Albanian Virgin\" smashes the idea that all of her stories are set in B.C. or in Ontario's \"Alice Munro Country.\" \"A Wilderness Station\" breaks short story rules by transporting us back to the 1830s and then jumping forward more than a hundred years. And the final story, \"The Bear Came Over the Mountain,\" which was adapted into the film Away from Her, leads us far beyond the turkey-plucking world of young girls into unflinching old age. Every story in this selection is superb. It is a book to read—and reread—very slowly, savouring each separate story. This collection of small masterpieces deserves a place in every book lover's home.",
