When his buddies at TomCats Resort in Key West throw a birthday party to cheer him up, Jack never expects a beautiful Asian man to jump out of the cake. Aran Suttirat, the twenty-one-year-old that arrived from Bangkok, is not Jack's usual type, but Jack's pheromones go into overdrive when the boy lands on his lap.Aran is the new masseur, and he gives Jack a birthday massage with a happy ending the Captain can't forget. Jack is smitten, but the boy is too young for him, and besides, Jack's been commitment-phobic since losing his mate years ago.Aran doesn't agree, and he'll do anything to change Jack's mind, including playing dirty. But can Aran bring Jack to his senses and convince him they can have it all?",
