  "title": "Poses for Artists Volume 7 - Faces & Expressions: An Essential Reference for Figure Drawing and the Human Form",
  "description": "This book of over 300 faces was created by an artist who understands that sometimes, you just need a creative nudge to help get the pencil moving and break that pesky block. By simplifying the human form, we hope to remove the inevitable anxiety that comes with drawing a face, and speed-up your art, over time, increasing your own understanding of human anatomy, proportions and movement.",
