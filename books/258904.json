  "title": "She-Wolffe: The Forgotten Child",
  "description": "After a brutal attack on her group, Emily is the only one to survive. She wakes up in hospital days later to find herself already under the ward of a new guardian. Brandon Wolffe’s fierce protectiveness and loving care are both a comfort and a mystery to her, but she knows he is keeping secrets. Dark and dangerous secrets. Emily has been aware of the divide between humans and the ‘Others’ for most of her life. Brandon and his entire group are far from being human, but with the target still on her back, Emily has no choice but to trust them. She suspects the assailants’ relentlessness in their pursuit to kill her is because she was witness to what happened the night of the attack, but can she dare tell her new guardian about what she knows? Will she have the courage? Crossing the threshold into the domain of magic and supernatural creatures, Emily is set on a path to be immersed in the world she was raised to fear.",
