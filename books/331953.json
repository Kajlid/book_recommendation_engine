He thought I’d come home after that.Only I didn’t.The worst part was that I couldn’t tell him why. Not when my sister begged me to keep her issues private. My silence made him think I didn’t value our relationship.After that, there was no us.During our years apart, I watched every movie, read every book Noah wrote. All of them were about us.None of them ended happily.Now though, he wants that to change. See, Noah wants to rewrite his script, and he wants me to co-author the kind of ending we didn’t get in his manuscript and in real life.I want it, too…but when I can’t tell him the truth, what will keep us from breaking up again?We’re so close to our second chance at happily ever after.And this time, I don’t intend to let us go without a fight… Kissing a Writer, book 1 in The Writer series, is a second chance, emotional and sexy emotional contemporary romance that can be read as a standalone. They start as star-crossed lovers who will break your heart, only to mend it back together when these soulmates find their happy ending.",
