  "title": "Hebrew Myths: The Book of Genesis",
  "description": "This exploration of Hebrew myths & the book of Genesis resulted from a collaboration between a scholar raised as a strict Protestant & another raised as a strict Jew. It goes beyond Christian biblical & Judaic myth & incorporates midrashes, folk tales, apocryphal texts & other obscure sources to extend & complete the stories. An intriguing view of the suppressed & censored pre-biblical accounts is the result, along with a rich sense of a culture consisting of oral & literary traditions, where the spiritual is rooted in landscape & history.",
