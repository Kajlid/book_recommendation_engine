  "title": "The End of War",
  "description": "The war is over. By many years gone. The dead sleep beneath the soil of Flanders' fields, beyond suffering and the pain they once knew. Until today, when one of them stirs, wakes and claws away the earth of his unmarked grave so that he can arise and look upon a world that has known the end of war.",
