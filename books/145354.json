  "title": "Jasmine's War",
  "description": "From the shadows between colossal trees the dawn mist drifted across the trail. A girl was running hard, a basket of washed laundry on her head, hands struggling to keep it there. Sheâ€™d have to ditch the basket if she was serious about putting distance between her and her pursuers, but she pictured her mother, hands on hips, enquiring after the whereabouts of what was almost their entire wardrobe. Breathless, she looked behind. She could see nothing and now the path, too, faded beneath the mist. She ran on, instinctively picking out the way ahead. A male voice barked somewhere behind her and seconds later, three short bursts of automatic rifle fire thudded in quick succession. The soldiers must have seen or heard her and followed her back into the forest. When Jasmine Gavidia witnesses an El Salvador army killing, people want her dead, and she must sort friend from foe. A fast-paced adventure with explosive action and refreshing honesty, this is a story of a 14-year-old girl growing up fast after the massacre at El Zacate and finding a new life.",
