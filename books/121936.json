  "title": "Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto",
  "description": "In his new preface to this paperback edition, the author observes, \"The Indian world has changed so substantially since the first publication of this book that some things contained in it seem new again.\" Indeed, it seems that each generation of whites and Indians will have to read and reread Vine Deloriaâ€™s Manifesto for some time to come, before we absorb his special, ironic Indian point of view and what he tells us, with a great deal of humor, about U.S. race relations, federal bureaucracies, Christian churches, and social scientists. This book continues to be required reading for all Americans, whatever their special interest.",
