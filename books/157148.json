  "description": "You find what you’re looking for... where you least expect it. That held true for me ER nurse, Liz Johansson; the night a young man named Trevor arrived at the hospital and turned my life upside down. Perhaps it was divine intervention that my care for Trevor led me to his friends…Sinfully hot, James Bartlett and his equally gorgeous boss, Ian Stone; two men, so tall, dark, and lethal, they conjured fantasies my body ached to fulfill. It was impossible to choose one or the other, and hungering for them equally tore at my moral code. I had to find the will to banish my shame or risk losing them forever.Powerless over their potent, carnal command—together—they led me down a blissful path of uninhibited passion. Unlocking my forbidden desires, while healing the scars of my past, they opened my soul to something so powerful and alluring I couldn’t turn away. Seduced by their infinite love and dominant touch, they taught me how to surrender my fears…my heart, and learn to live again.",
