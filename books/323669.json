  "description": "The more I find out about the Boys of Ascendance Bay, the more questions I have…They have more secrets than I first thought, and getting to the truth is harder than digging my sister's grave. I have to persevere if I want answers, but keeping reality separate from the lies is getting more difficult by the day.My feelings for them are only getting more confusing, and my twin is only getting more frustrated with me. Nothing is going according to plan and at any moment, everything could fall apart.Not only is pledging Pi Ep getting harder, but now I’m being recruited to join a secret society as well—all of which ties to my parents and could lead me closer to answers about my sister’s death, if I can make it past initiation...If you love the twists and turns of Caroline Peckham and the steam of Tate James, then you'll love Cruel Reign!",
