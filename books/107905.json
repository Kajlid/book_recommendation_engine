  "description": "In the terminology of the Shari’ah, the word saūm means to abstain from food, drink and sexual activity from dawn to sunset, with the intention of doing so sincerely and solely for Allah, the Exalted. This is because fasting purifies the soul and cleanses it from the evil that might cause it to become a miser and their ill behavior.",
