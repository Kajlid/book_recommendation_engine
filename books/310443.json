  "description": "LIFE IS ALL WE HAVE ... ONE CONVERSATION AT A TIME.When middle-aged nurse Dora Stuart-Frazer is assigned to provide end-of-life care to ex-prostitute Magdalena, she suffers a failure of sympathy linked to the woman’s career and her own marital issues. It’s her job—her vocation to care. Trying to overcome her prejudices against her patient and the other members of the all-female household, Dora is drawn into their world. Mags has cancer and it won’t be long now. She is an unwilling listener to the sordid life-story that her patient wants to recount in her last few weeks of life. It’s her dying wish to get her story out and as such, it’s Dora’s job to listen. However, every night as her patient’s story unfolds, Dora needs more. She is transfixed and a willing listener as she compares the life of the story teller to hers and forces herself to confront her mid-life crisis. In this race against time, Dora has to know it all—but fears Mags won’t make it until the end.",
