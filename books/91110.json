  "description": "Two Kiwis - Garth MacIntyre and Uganda-based Cam McLeay - and Brit Neil McGrigor had travelled over 5000 km up the world's largest river, and their expedition to find the source of the Nile was going as well as could be expected.But all that was about to change. A mishap on the water and another in the air left them stranded (and McGrigor injured) in Uganda's spectacular Murchison Falls national Park.When Cam's friend, British expat Steve Willis, came to the rescue in his Land Rover they were ambushed by the Lord's Resistance Army, a rebel group notorious for its barbaric attacks on civilians and its policy of leaving no survivors. One of the party was killed in the ambush, another wounded, and McGrigor was held at gunpoint. Grieving and traumatised, the men abandoned the expedition.Six months later, they returned to complete it. They'd endured wildlife and ever wilder water, fear and fire, air accidents and toxic mushrooms, guerrillas and bullets - and their comradeship only strengthened.",
