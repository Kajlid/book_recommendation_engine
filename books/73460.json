  "description": "Bakery owner Valentine Benington’s day just went from the best of her life to the worst. Toronto Tribune reviewer, David Fraser, shows up for a review just after a fire comes close to destroying her kitchen. After David's last assignment, which ended with food poisoning, it’s not the best of starts, especially since the job is a last-minute thing. He doesn't expect to run into a woman from his past. First looks can be deceiving. The food isn’t the only thing on the menu he’d like to taste. When these two get baking, the flames from the oven aren’t the only thing setting the kitchen on fire.",
