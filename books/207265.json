  "description": "In a love triangle, will she make the right choice?Debbie King. At 14 years old she was like other so many other 14 year olds—lacking confidence and maintaining belief that she was a nobody who would never know any happiness in her life. But after she meets someone so much like her, together they discover inner strengths in themselves, and a deep friendship that would be tested over and over again by events and other people coming into their lives, along with an ongoing uncertainty over what their relationship should really be like.So many things they share, the greatest of all being their love of their enthusiasm and career as musicians, and yet still the ongoing question hovers over them—should they be together . . . as a couple?Embark on a journey from the intense emotions of teenage years, and on through adult life eventualities such as marriage, parenting, post-natal depression, and a never ending uncertainty about a life choice that eventually contributes to infidelity.",
