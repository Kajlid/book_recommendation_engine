  "description": "On a mission to rescue Allieâ€™s mother, Allie and her friends seek out the Resistance hidden in a dangerous region of the galaxy known as The Shift. All anyone knows about The Shift is that no one has ever been seen again once they crossed its borders. The Resistance themselves may no longer exist, leaving Allie and her friends as the only ones standing between the Highlord and complete dominion over the galaxy. But the Highlord has his own plans to eliminate the Starjumper and her allies, sending one of the most destructive forces in the galaxy to hunt them down, his network of spies betraying their every move. Meanwhile, Highlord Tyren completes work on a new weapon, with power beyond anything the galaxy has ever seen before. While Allie and her friends form a plan to fight back, the Highlord musters all his forces to pursue and destroy the Starjumper, the only person who can stop him from his ultimate goal. A goal the Highlord has kept secret even from his closest advisors. A secret that could mean the end of all life in the galaxy.",
