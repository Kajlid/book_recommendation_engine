The partners with her in this effort, are two very different and absolutely mesmerizing males. One is a Prince of the Fae, and the other--a High Druid Priest just revived after a two hundred year coma. She travels to Scotland to stay at a warded castle belonging to the Druid, Julian MacTalbot. During this time, an obsessed and blood-drinking beautiful, evil and ancient woman decides she wants Maxie dead, and has the magical powers to achieve her goal. As Maxieâ€™s own magical mana develops, so does her love for one of her partners, and the question remains, will the one she chooses--choose her back?",
