  "description": "Were they destined to be enemies? Or to bridge the gap between their two races and bring peace to a world gone mad?Sentinel Raen knew the intruder needed air, but his body was of a different mind when Cassie clung to him like a limpet and demanded his mouth each time he pulled away. And he discovered he was in no particular hurry to get his captive to the holding cell they'd set up for the human intruders. And in no hurry to release the captives when they'd learned what they could from them ... because he discovered he didn't want to let Cassie go at all.The irony of falling for a woman born of the race he'd despised wasn't lost on Raen, but he discovered the spark that ignited between the two of them with their first kiss wasn't something to be denied or easily extinguished.Rating: Spicy/Carnal-Adult situations and language, graphic sexual scenes and graphic violence.",
