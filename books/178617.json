  "title": "Self Treatments including The Radiant I AM",
  "description": "Self Treatment is an overview of the 12 lessons Emma taught in all her books and classes. It stands on its own merits. The Radiant I Am is probably one of Emma's personal treatments as it stands on its own, too. In all her classes she encouraged students to become healers by practicing on themselves and keeping journals. These treatments come from her lessons and her own private journals. This book was printed in a small format so it can be carried in a pocket of purse.",
