  "description": "Something wicked this way comes . . . and it keeps coming and coming and coming. . . .\n\nWilliam Shakespeare was one of history's greatest writers, a master of words with a body of work that is truly impressive . . . some may say a little too impressive for a single man to accomplish in one lifetime. Perhaps, as many have speculated, he had assistance. Or perhaps the explanation is more . . . unusual.  \nWho was William Shakespeare?\nWho was the Dark Lady of the Sonnets?\nWhy are the undead stalking the alleyways of London?\nAnd can they be stopped?\nSomething is definitely rotten in the state of Denmark.  \nSo brace yourself for a wild ride through twisted streets and shadowed graveyards of Elizabethan London, where you'll discover how the Bard got his Bite.",
