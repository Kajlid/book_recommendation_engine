  "title": "Sagas of Giants and Heroes",
  "description": "Huge in stature; living in far-distant wastelands; sometimes comically stupid or crude; but possessing vast wealth and knowledgeâ€”such are the giants of Norse myth and legend. Four Icelandic sagas and six tales, spanning five centuries, are brought together for the first time in all-new English translations. All tell of mighty giants, and of the heroes who dared to face them, fight them, and sometimes befriend them. The giants and trolls of old still live on in these legendary sagas of old times. These tales of epic voyages, wars, and romance will appeal to both scholars of Norse mythology and fans of Viking adventure. The sagas include the Saga of the Kjalarnes People, the Saga of Halfdan Brana's Fosterling, the Saga of Sorli the Strong, and the Saga of Illugi Grid's Fosterling. The six shorter tales the Tale of Halfdan the Black, the Tale of Hauk High-Breeches, the Tale of Jokul Buason, the Tale of Brindle-Cross, an excerpt from the Saga of the Fljotsdal People, and the Tale of Asmund Ogre-Lucky.",
