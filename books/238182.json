  "description": "Ryan Axston may have been my brother’s best friend, but he is so much more than that to me… He was my first everything. Kiss. Sexual encounter. Love. Ax had my whole heart, but he had no freaking clue.He always wanted to be a Marine. It was in his blood. The day his brother was shipped home in a body bag, Ax signed up and left town to do his duty to his country.I forced myself to move on. I really thought he was gone forever. When he showed back up wearing the Unacceptables’ skull and bones on his back ten years later, I thought I'd be able to fight all the old feelings I had for Ax. I was older, wiser, and unofficial godmother to my best friend's adorable little girl, Annie. But all he had to do was crook his finger and it was as if I was 17 all over again. I wasn't willing to sit back and let him tear us apart again. This time I was going to fight for what I wanted. But not even my love could stop a bullet. One of us was going to have to make a life-altering choice. Would it be me, or him? Undeniable is a crossover between Susan Stoker's Delta Force Heroes Series (http://amzn.to/2vB73Vj) and Kristen Hope Mazzola's Unacceptables MC Series (http://amzn.to/2vBzOkz).",
