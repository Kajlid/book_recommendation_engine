As new recruits in Britain's Aerial Corps, man and dragon soon proved their mettle in daring combat against Napoleon Bonaparte's invading forces.Now China has discovered that its rare gift, intended for Napoleon, has fallen into British hands--and an angry Chinese delegation vows to reclaim the remarkable beast. A reluctant Laurence has no choice but to take Temeraire back to China--a long voyage fraught with peril, intrigue, and the untold terrors of the deep. Yet once the pair reaches the court of the Chinese emperor, even more shocking discoveries and darker dangers await.",
