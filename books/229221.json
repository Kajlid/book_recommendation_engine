  "description": "Alternate Cover Edition for ASIN: B00YQA28P0\"We're three women from two different centuries, trying to save the world from oblivion. I don't know about you, but that's way above my pay grade.\"A time warp has opened in a popular Santa Fe retail store. The building housing the shop was the main office of The Manhattan Project during its development in the 1940s. Only one person has witnessed the departure of two dangerous men through the doorway to the past--reporter Rachel Blackstone. Although she is certain they are evil she has no idea how they left 2015 or where they landed on the other side, only that she saw them do it. But the office on the other side is certainly a very different place than the showroom with the neatly arranged inventory of gifts and Native American art. When she uncovers the mystery of the room, threats are made and people die. It becomes apparent at least one man is an alien force wearing a Nazi uniform--and intent on changing the balance of nuclear weapons in the world. Rachel and friend Chloe time travel to a world of subterfuge, secrets and danger. If they can't stop the two men intent on sabotage, history will be changed. For Rachel and Chloe, it's no small task: just save the world.From award-winning writer G G Collins.",
