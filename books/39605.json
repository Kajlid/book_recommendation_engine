But a fun night of drinking turns bizarre when Belial introduces Dahlia to Lucien and the rest of her friends, men who are exceedingly rich, in short supply of morals, overflowing with violent tendencies, and interested in everything about her. Dahlia is charmed by her new friends, but something about them seems strangely familiar and it should. Lucien is Lucifer Morningstar, his friends are fallen angels, and Dahlia is no ordinary woman; she is the very reason they were tossed out of Heaven. She is the reincarnated spirit of Lucifer's equal and former lover, the imprisoned Primangel Ladriam. Within her, lies the power to restart and win the war against Heaven, but first she needs to survive dating the devil.Rated MatureHumor-Adventure-Paranormal 130,000",
