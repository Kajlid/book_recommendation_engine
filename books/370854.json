  "description": "Ashlai, a Fyre who can harness powers of flame from the sun, has always felt like an outsider amongst the Forest-footer elves who raised her and her brother, Merritt. The only clue to their past is a strangely unbreakable crystal Shard left to them by their mother.When Ashlai discovers a Fyre princess speaking to her from within their mother's Shard, she is soon launched into an adventure that is much bigger than her constant longing and struggle to understand who she is and where she comes from--a quest which may help her unravel that secret past.With the help of Six new friends, including the sarcastic Sprite, Aryl; the equally snarky Mandolin, Princess of the Water-skippers; and Gailea and Chamblin, a pair of squabbling but wise and kind-spirited musicians, Ashlai will go through a journey in which she is not only challenged with saving her world, but with facing her past and coming to know and accept who she truly is.And, as Ashlei will learn, sometimes the truth is frightening to learn, and even more frightening to stand up to.",
