  "title": "Twenty Pieces: A walk through love, loss and midlife reinvention",
  "description": "Lisa's world collapsed the year she turned 58. Her 25-year marriage ended; the only home her children had ever known fell into foreclosure; and her last child left the nest. Her financial lifeline, her career in advertising, had gone stagnant.From under the crushing realities a wild idea popped into her head. What if she went away for 30 days, all alone to New York City and took a crash course to learn the new digital ways of her business? After class she could sneak in a 1-mile walk, each day treating herself to a different neighborhood of Manhattan, the place she'd always dreamed of living. Using the lessons she'd learn, she could share stories and photos from her daily walks, all in hopes of reinventing herself professionally.It seemed like the perfect plan, and it was. However-the real truth she found on the streets of Manhattan never made it to her blog. Only in her personal diary did she share the rawness of what she learned about herself ... and all she needed to do to make the changes she wanted.In her memoir, Twenty Pieces, Lisa Weldon shares what she learned.",
