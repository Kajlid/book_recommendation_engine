  "description": "Emilia—All I’ve ever wanted was to marry for love.But girls like me don’t have that luxury.We are used as pawns in a game we can’t control.The game? It’s called Mafia. I was foolish enough to try to change the rules… and I lost.Luca—She was promised to me years ago.And he dared to take her from me.Dared to touch what was mine.I put an end to that.I hope he’s enjoying the view from his dirt room.Emilia—My beloved’s killer placed a ruby ring on my finger and called me his queen. But that red gem symbolizes something different for me. It represents the blood shed by those I love most.Hell was empty the day we wed.Because the devil was standing before me and said “I do.”Luca—I saw her as a possession.A shiny toy I didn’t want other boys to play with.But she’s so much more.Beautiful and brave and strong and broken all at once.She tastes like everything I’ve ever wanted.Emilia—Hidden and patient.I wait for the perfect time to seek my revenge.But slowly, I feel him possessing me.His heart is full of darkness… and I still want every inch of him.Hard as I try, I can’t escape loving this beautiful monster.Luca—I’m waiting patiently because I already know that she’s mine.Mine in a way that no one will ever understand.Even if she hasn’t yet realized it.For love, I’d do anything. For her, I’d do everything.",
