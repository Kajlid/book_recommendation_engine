  "description": "Paris  I’ve had a crush on my best friend for as long as I can remember. But he’s a hockey winger, who has quite a reputation with the puck bunnies, and I’m a nerdy girl trying to survive my biochemistry degree as a single mom.  If science has taught me anything, it’s that facts don’t lie. The truth is Ryse and I are from two completely different worlds. He’s headed for the pros, and I hypothesize I’ll be left behind… again.  Ryse might not be boyfriend material, but he makes a great fake fiancé because he’s fooling even me. After months of subtle touches and staged kisses, our experiment finally combusts.   He may be a reckless player… but his pretend love is the realest thing I’ve ever felt.  Ryse  After my gorgeous best friend moves in next door, things go from friend zone to off-the-charts chemistry. Now I’m seeing the sexy single mom in a whole new light.  It’s my year to go pro, and before I can draft, I need to clean up my playboy reputation and graduate. I can’t risk a relationship… or my friendship with Paris. When she needs a fake fiancé to get her son into private school, I do what any good friend would do—I volunteer.  But the closer we get, the more blurred the lines become. Falling for her is a complication I didn’t calculate… but pretending to love her is the easiest game I’ve ever played.  I just hope when the game is over, I don’t lose her for good.",
