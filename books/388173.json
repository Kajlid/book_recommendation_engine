  "description": "[#214 Siren Menage Everlasting: Erotic Western Menage a Trois Romance, M/F/M] Amanda Keller's only goal was to help her mother and sister escape her father's abuse. She certainly didn't need the two hard-nosed Texas Rangers meddling in her business. Texas Rangers Zane Owens and Rand Sloane have their own mission. When they catch the raven-haired beauty about to shoot a man, they don't believe a word of her lies but have no choice but to let her go. Once they find her again, however, all bets are off. Amanda has no option but to lie to them and escape, only to find herself in more trouble than she bargained for. Soon, they not only rescue her, but outmaneuver her and make her an enticing offer of their own, one that would give her the escape she's looking for. But feelings have a way of sneaking in when she least expects it, turning her world upside down. In a town where their relationship isn't accepted by all, living the way they are could be risky indeed, especially when men are willing to do whatever they have to in order to satisfy their greed. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
