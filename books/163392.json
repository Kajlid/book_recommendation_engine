  "description": "You may have looked at the title of this book and wondered, \"Stephen King is wrong? Just plain wrong, sort of wrong, completely wrong, or what?\" Well, he's not wrong about everything. The guy can write like an inspired fiend and has put out far more pages than I have or ever will, and he does it in a way that pleases a great many people. When it comes to writing, he knows what he's doing. But you don't need me to tell you that. Where he's wrong is at the end of that limb he goes out onto to say that evil comes from inside humans; it's hard-wired into us (as he said to Rolling Stone); it does not exist outside of us. That is dead wrong. I have seen things you would never believe; I have seen the laws of nature thrown up into the air looking just the way we think they ought to look; only to be shot down and shattered by mysterious forces I cannot explain. King knows about writing. He's done his time in the halls of academia absorbing great masses of data squeezed out by ancient sponges who absorb and redistribute the usual well-fermented wisdom. But he hasn't gone way, way down into the truly scary places where the dark things live, like I have. Old white men who live in ivory towers shouldn't attempt to shoot down phantoms they've never seen, I think. In this story, I play around a little bit using the traits of a supernatural creature I met many years ago. I don't know exactly where the thing came from, but it existed outside of humanity and broke through certain barriers in order to enjoy the darker pleasures available to solid living beings like us. It was not a good thing; it was most certainly an evil thing. If you (or Mr. King) would like to know more about this thing, let me know.",
