  "description": "Victorious Charles: A Ladies' Man is a fascinating historical account of the lives of the nobility and the poor in 15th Century France, under the reign of King Charles VII. Charles VII was a warrior King who reigned at the time of France's decades-long war against Henry V's England. Charles is also often remembered for his numerous high-profile affairs, including one with the beautiful Agnes Sorel, known at the time as the Dame de Beaute. The book explores Charles' youth, his crazy mother, and the positive influence of his aunt, Yolande d'Aragon. Charles ruled during the time of Joan of Arc, \"The Virgin Warrior\" who fought valiantly for France in the war. She delivered Orleans from the English, before being burned at the stake after a religious court sentenced her to death, proclaiming her a sorceress. The late Caroline (Cally) Rogers Neill Sehnaoui was born in 1944 in Manchester, NH to a 16th generation American family of English and Scottish descent. Her father was educated at West Point and Princeton, and her mother's ancestor was William Barton Rogers, who founded MIT in 1861. Caroline studied Political Science and History at UNH and Liverpool University, carried on with her graduate studies when she married in Lebanon, at the American University of Beirut, where she majored in History. She lived in Paris with her husband Elie Sehnaoui for almost thirty years and did most of the research for this book in French at the Bibliotheque Nationale de Paris, having been enthused by French history, some of its great kings and their formidable mistresses.
