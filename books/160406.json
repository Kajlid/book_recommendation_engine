  "description": "My young adult life was simple. I was about to start college, I had a great boyfriend and a large circle of friends. My life was simple—until I met him. Him being the new kid in town; Ash Walker.I learned really quickly that he liked to play games, and the thing about Ash is that he played them well. I tried to stay away because I had been told that he was bad news, news I neither wanted nor needed, but there was something about him that made him impossible to ignore.He pushed the limits and had an impulsive streak that knew no bounds. He had an addiction. An infatuation.Then one day, I became his new obsession.There was one problem, though. He was off-limits; his words, not mine.Every girl in the whole town wanted to be inside his bed, and if I wanted us to be friends then I had to make sure that I didn’t become one of them. He was heading along the path to self-destruction and there was only one person who could save him from his past demons; who could bring him the acceptance he so desperately craved.Me.",
