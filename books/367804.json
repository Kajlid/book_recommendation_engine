  "description": "It's Friday and Mike wakes up brutalized from a 50/50 grind on a handrail gone awry the night before. Despite his cuts, bruises and sore muscles, Mike can't wait to skateboard tonight. He, David and Cedric have planned to skate in the forbidden zone downtown and go to a party afterwards. Cedric has an added surprise for his buddies - dinner across the border in Mexico at a suspicious looking little hole in the wall he calls Dog Tacos. Before the night is over, the friends will come face-to-face with the most notorious gang in town, be detained and interrogated at the U.S. border and be hailed as heroes on the local news. Mike's heart and loyalty will also be tested. This night will challenge the friends like no other. The unexpected rewards far outweigh the night's events.",
