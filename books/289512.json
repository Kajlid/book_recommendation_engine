  "description": "A species created by man to serve and obey. But we made a mistakeâ€¦we gave it fangs.We designed them for our use. To wage our greedy wars, toil in our poisonous lunar mines. We made them pleasing to the eye so our children would not have nightmares, tall and strong and smart so they would adapt to environments never meant to sustain life. We thought we had created the perfect sub-species. Obedient. Disposable. How wrong we were.Helios stands alone. The first of a dying race. He has spent his life fighting to free his kind. To avenge them. His world is a cold, desolate one that has never been touched by grace or light until a hot-tempered woman, a human, marches into his life, his home and his guarded heart. Through Dawn's dry humor and passionate embrace, he learns to trust again and to love. But just as he starts to hope, she is stolen from him. With his light gone, all that is left is darkness and revenge.They took the one thing he loved and Helios will stop at nothing to get Dawn back. Even damn his eternal, vampire soul.",
