  "description": "Bronson is laughing all the way to the crematorium, he kicks his way through steel doors, causes £1/2M worth of damage in one roof-top protest and clinically brings the life of a sex attacker to an end, until he’s revived. Dave Courtney says: “I was pleasantly surprised to find that he was a very intelligent, witty and funny man indeed.” Includes introductions from Joe Pyle, Tony Lambrianou, Lord Longford, Charlie’s mother and legal team & more.Broadmoor sees some nasty sights... Read of the time Charlie had to fight a 195 pound Rottweiler or face an angry crowd — he made them suffer! Guns, Fists, Knives and more are used to try to stop Bronson — all fail. Hostage taking is a game to this man — a game the system taught him to play.",
