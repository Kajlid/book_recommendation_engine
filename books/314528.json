  "description": "Sonya Pope is pragmatic, always rational, and has no time for setbacks, so when she arrives at her elopement to find her fiance wants to break up rather than get married, she uses the flight home to reprioritize. But when a woman on the plane has a medical emergency, she puts her mental list-making on hold and jumps to action. Unfortunately, so does the cocky, almost-paramedic two rows back.Ben \"Trav\" Travis totally got to that patient first, but the cranky nurse with the pretty brown eyes made a big show of taking charge. Sure, he might be one clinical rotation away from actually being a certified paramedic, but he has real-life experience. The kind he wouldn't wish on anyone.When Trav shows up at the hospital two days later to find the same woman is his preceptor, a second battle begins. Trav's got too much riding on this to let a woman with a chip on her shoulder make his life miserable, and Sonya's not about to let a pretty-boy with an adventure complex disrupt the one area of her life that she still has control over. But when a patient they both grow to care about needs their help, their head vs heart battle sparks into something neither one of them trained for.",
