  "description": "How far is too far to go for love?Jean: Could it be true? Instead of a summer playing handmaiden to Daphne, was I being delivered something entirely different—a summer in the spotlight? A summer starring Gil Burke and me?Summer flings and sexy romances were Daphne’s territory. Not mine. I was the one you didn’t pick.I swatted off my hope like a bumblebee, knowing it was already too late. I’d been deliriously stung.Fritz: People always joked about summer romances because they didn’t last. Summer romances were made out of ice cream and cotton candy, intensely sweet before they melted into nothing. But I’d never thought of Gil as a summer thing.Gil was my real love, my real first. We were outsiders together, we had each other, we didn’t care that we didn’t belong.",
