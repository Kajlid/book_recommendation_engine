  "description": "My worst nightmare has come true, I'm one of them now, a monster... the very thing I fought against. If that wasn't bad enough, I've been sired by one of the most powerful, sadistic and calculating vampire Lords in the city; Theoden. It's just the beginning of my new life, hell, i'm not even one night old as a vampire and already I wish they had decided to kill me instead of turn me. I guess this was my punishment for rebelling against them. They're clever that way. Theoden has promised to punish me for every offense I've made against him and I have no idea what's in store for me. I do know that it won't be pleasant. My night of pain and torment is just beginning. Warning: This novelette series contains hardcore sexual situations between men, not meant for sensitive eyes.
