  "title": "The Book of Night Women",
  "description": "Described by the New York Times as “both beautifully written and devastating”, 'The Book of Night Women' is a startling, hard-edged dissection of slavery – a tour de force of voice and storytelling.At the heart of the novel is the extraordinary character of Lilith, a spirited slave girl struggling to transcend the violence into which she is born, her story narrated in one of the boldest literary voices to grace the page. Overflowing with high drama and heartbreak, at its centre is the conspiracy of the Night Women, a clandestine council of fierce slave women plotting an island-wide revolt. Rebellions simmer, incidents of sadism and madness run rampant, and the tangled web of power relationships dramatically unravels amid dangerous secrets, unspoken jealousies, inhuman violence, and very human emotion.Listening Length: 15 hours and 45 minutes",
