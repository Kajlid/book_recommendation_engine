  "description": "She left glitter in his AC vents. He put green dye in her conditioner.  She buttered his bathroom floor, and he kidnapped her precious puppy.  Layla Mullens hates Donovan Donley. His crude language, his wide shoulders, his crystal blue eyes…she hates that she can’t stop herself…from kissing him or landing in his bed.  And Donovan Donley wants nothing more than to knock Layla off her princess pedestal. He hates her stuck up attitude and her soft, tempting lips. He especially hates that her father is his coach.  But he’s fine with their arrangement—act horrible to each other during the day, attack each other naked at night. It works. But one night changes everything. When Layla doesn’t show, and Donovan’s cold bed stays empty, the lies he tells himself to keep Layla out of his mind aren’t enough to keep him from missing her. And needing her. Something he promised himself would never happen.  The white flags in their prank war have been lowered but their high stakes battle has just begun.",
