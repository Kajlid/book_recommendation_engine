  "description": "HARVARD 1914 has been acquired by Sourcebooks, has been freshly edited and a new edition will be revised and released in August 2014 as THE END OF INNOCENCE. Synopsis: It is the twilight of innocence: America 1914. As Europe goes to war, Helen, a Boston bluestocking, begins her studies at Harvard-Radcliffe. Riley, a carefree British playboy more interested in chasing women than studying, sets his sights on her. He is surprised to find his adversary in love is not Helen’s protective brother, but Riley’s own cousin, Wils Brandl. As the roar of war begins to penetrate the quiet walls of Harvard, Wils, a brooding poet and German noble, must return to Europe and face a war for which he is not prepared. Set in Boston and Flanders Fields, Harvard 1914 explores love, war, and a new social imagination.",
