  "description": "Spend the summer's holiday in a Cornish village that has rugged shores, quaint cottages, idyllic gardens, and a Poldark-inspired hero. It’s the career move of a lifetime, and Julianne can’t believe it’s a position as an event planner at a country house in Cornwall, England, beginning with the wedding of a celebrity! If her old firm's senior planner back in the States hadn't fallen suddenly sick with the chicken pox, Julianne wouldn’t be roaming the grand halls of Cliffs House in one of England’s most beautiful coastal counties.But life in Cornwall isn't exactly as Julianne imagined it. Her first bride-to-be is a petted snob, the groom is immature, and the Cornish staff of Cliffs House have their doubts about the mid-level event planner handling a wedding this posh. And then there's a personal matter—the handsome, sometimes charming, sometimes standoffish gardener Matthew Rose. He and Julianne have formed a complicated relationship somewhere between friendship and attraction. But with a secret in his past, and a scheming bridesmaid interested in having Matthew all to herself, will Julianne find a way to untangle her feelings and the problems of planning a perfect Cornish wedding?",
