  "description": "Kit is back. And she’s still stuck playing her ridiculous elf dancer character.  After leading a group out of the full submersion video game, Chronicles of Retha, Kit knew she couldn’t leave the remaining players to suffer their fate alone. So she returned to the game with the goal to get everyone out.  Solus Miles has always preferred solo playing, but Kit’s return changes everything. He vows to partner with her fully, allowing her to use him as her shield and even her mascot.  There’s just one problem.  Forcing a system wide logout requires the defeat of the end game boss character. A boss who hasn’t ever been beaten before.  When the top guilds are still skeptical Kit turns to those whom others overlook: the non-playable characters controlled by the game mechanics.  But Retha has changed.  Monsters, events, and quests have shifted, complicating her task. The journey across an altered Retha tests even Kit’s veteran knowledge and strains her leadership like never before.  Can she leverage her NPC allies and convince the other players to join her?  The SECOND AGE OF RETHA series features an epic fantasy video game world inspired by Tolkien’s Middle Earth with the adventure and stakes of Sword Art Online and other “stuck in a game” stories.
