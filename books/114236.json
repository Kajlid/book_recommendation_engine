  "description": "\"To Whom It May Concern: My name is Shalia Elizabeth Monroe, and this is my confession as to my part in bringing about Armageddon.\" When the Kalquorians entered Earth space during the war, they unwittingly triggered bombs hidden beneath the major cities. Now Earth's former enemies rush to save the survivors left on a dying planet. Told from the viewpoint of survivor Shalia Monroe, this journal traces the first few weeks following Armageddon as she struggles to keep herself and her dementia-stricken mother alive. Battling the guilt of her part in Earth's demise is only the first of many issues Shalia must deal with. She also faces man-eating alien Tragooms, disease, and violent gangs of surviving Earthers determined to kill each other in order to claim supremacy. Then there are the invading Kalquorians themselves, whose intentions may or may not be so innocent. One of the aliens, Dramok Dusa, stalks Shalia in hopes of bringing her back to his people. The stunning Kalquorian saves Shalia's life more than once, but can she really trust him? Shalia must make a decision: stay on Earth where she and her mother are doomed to die or accept life in the Kalquorian Empire as a female mate to a clan of three men. This is a compilation from the free serial story blog 'Shalia's Diary - A Clans of Kalquor Story' by Tracy St. John, bestselling author of the Clans of Kalquor series that begins with the novel 'Alien Embrace'. Mild BDSM, including anal play/intercourse, bondage, Dom/sub play, spankings, forced seduction, and multiple sexual partners (m/f/m).",
