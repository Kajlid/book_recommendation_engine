  "description": "The leading scorer on the Reapers has the unspeakable yips…and it’s me.The second my NHL legend of a father appears, I can’t shoot to save my life.And my mistakes might cost my team our playoff spot.No pre-game superstition can fix it—I’m broken.Adding to the pressure, my little sister’s best friend just became my roommate for the next five months.Evangeline Walsh. The curvy photographer with a heart of gold.She’s in my kitchen, baking treats as scrumptious as her body.She’s in my living room, torturing me with pajama bottoms that beg to be peeled off.And when we cross that line, we discover she’s also my cure.She’s my newest pre-game ritual, but it’s so much more than that.I can’t keep my hands off her, and each time leaves me craving more.But my life plays out in front of the camera, and Evie wants to stay behind the lens.When my past comes back to bite us,I’ll have to risk everything to show her she’s not just a lucky charm—She’s my endgame.",
