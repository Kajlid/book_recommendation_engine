  "description": "Juliet Alva had lived in Big Bay, Michigan since the day she was born - until the very January that she decided to change everything. She liked to think she had bigger aspirations, dreams that could only flourish outside of Big Bay - but, when one hit twenty-four years old and one had never left their home state before, one began to wonder about their aspirations and dreams. Luckily, nomadic Daksha Paracha was on her way to Big Bay to change everything.",
