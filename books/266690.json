  "description": "AN AMAZON TOP 100 BESTSELLER A standalone teacher/student romance in the What He Doesn't Know series.  I never learn my lesson. And I always want what I can’t have. When Sarah Henderson walks into my life, I tell myself she’s off limits. She’s my student, sixteen years younger than me, and my boss’s niece. It doesn’t matter that I see the same pain reflected in her eyes that I have in my own, or that the dead organ better known as my heart kicks to life when she’s around. I’ve been here before, and I know how this ends. It’s been two years since I fell for the last woman I knew I couldn’t have, the one with the ring on her finger that I chose to ignore. Two years of trying to overcome that heartache when Sarah slides into my life. Another woman I can’t have. Another woman I can’t stop myself from wanting. I never learn my lesson, but with a constant reminder of how that last forbidden love burned, I think I’ve finally learned this one. This time, I won’t chase what’s off limits. This time, I’m staying away. And I’ll keep telling myself that until I believe it.",
