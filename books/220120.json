Until she heads home with Justin for the holidays and learns that the sexy stranger is none other than Justin’s older brother, Matt.Matt Ellis is trying to be on his best behavior for his mother—it is Christmas, after all. But when he recognizes the beautiful woman from the elevator—the one he hasn’t been able to stop thinking about for months—his best behavior is being held by a thread.
