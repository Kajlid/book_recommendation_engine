  "description": "RAW ICE is the story of Aldolphus Jackson; an innocent child that was robbed of his emotion by the shadows of darkness. Raised by a mob figure named Airstead Gaddafi, Aldolphus learned the rules of the blood game and drug game. Born into a web of lies that will slowly untangle, he would be forced to make life altering choices. He was caught between street wars with the Japanese Mafia and a love-hate relationship with monogamy. Eventually he would be forced to choose between being a sacrificial lamb, or drinking the blood of the wolves. RAW ICE is a nonstop roller coaster without brakes that has more twists than a murder mystery. Written in gritty street dialogue and lyrical undertones, RAW ICE will keep you glued to your seat until its shocking end. DON'T BLINK.",
