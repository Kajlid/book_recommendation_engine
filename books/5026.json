  "description": "These are dark days at Saddle Creek Farm.When inhumane activities emerge in the horse show world, an intriguing RCMP officer turns to Bird for help. Soon, she's juggling more than she can handle. Between using her unusual skills to bring animal abusers to justice, riding jumping sensation Sundancer to victory (fingers crossed!), and grappling with complicated family issues, Bird has hardly any free time at all. And that's too bad, because a little free time is just what Bird needs. This summer, she's determined to find out the truth about her father, whatever that might be.Things get even more complex when Bird's old friend and mentor, Pete Pierson, is rushed to the hospital with a life-threatening illness. With support from her animal friends, Cody and Sundancer, Bird struggles to make it through a stormy summer.",
