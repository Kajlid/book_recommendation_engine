  "description": "Something hideous is stalking the streets of Wakely.\"They stopped, looking around, trying to pinpoint the source of their discomfort. The tension in the air suddenly snapped, released, and with a series of staccato bangs, every door down the length of the street swung open.From out of the houses and shops they came, shuffling, staggering, and swaying. Fly-by-wire humans, jerking along the street like meat marionettes, with mouths agape and eyes empty. In their suits and their dresses, overalls, smocks and pyjamas, the locals of Wakely marched to their own rhythm of decay to greet the visitors to their town.\"Three strangers find themselves drawn to Wakely, a small village in the Scottish Borders, where a centuries-old conflict between two warring Celtic deities is drawing to its gruesome conclusion. A small boy holds the key to their survival, but first they have to find him. And they're not the only ones looking.\"One of the many things John Dow does very well indeed is tension and release. The tension will ratchet up and up with fear and horror laid upon trepidation and anxiety, and then heâ€™ll write something that will make you smile. Fear and a little humour make for a terrific combination.\" The View From My Kindle (4.5/5)",
