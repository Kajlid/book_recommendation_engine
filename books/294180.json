  "description": "Two strangers live just miles apart their entire lives but have never met, until that faithful day in the hospital. It was only a quick glance, but something stirred inside Jack when he saw Maria that first time. Instantly he felt something between them, something larger than any words could explain. Little did he know that faith would guide them so close that two worlds would become one and life as both he and Maria knew it would be forever changed. A marvelous story that brilliantly explores the funny, thrilling and indeed tragic business of love and life itself!",
