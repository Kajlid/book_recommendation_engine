  "description": "I didn’t have a lot, but what I had I was proud of.I was raised to keep my head down and work hard.I followed the rules, rarely straying off the straight and narrow path.That’s why when the opportunity to get wild and have a little fun presented itself, I jumped on it—or more like on him. The handsome cowboy from the bar.It was one night in Vegas.Afterward, all I had was the memory of his body pressed to mine and the hotel room key I swiped as I snuck out.I never expected to see him again.I definitely never imagined he’d show up in my small hometown seven years later, only to discover the daughter he never knew about.",
