With her new partner-in-crime, a.k.a. artiste extraordinaire Bethany, she is again promoting her comic. Matt is also back in town, but to Christie's shock, he came with a girlfriend! Now, not only does Christie have to fend off close-minded manga fans, she also has to try to keep her heart clear of Matt. But in the twilight that separates friendship from something more, things often get a little complicated... and at a convention anything is possible.",
