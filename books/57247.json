  "description": "I think I'm being stalked by the killer. The dreams are one thing, but I'm pretty sure I'm losing it because I'm not even sure they're dreams. They could be real, but if they are, my life is about to take a drastic turn.Ever has spent most of her life with her nose in a book. As a college student at S.U.C.U, she wants nothing more than to stay focused and finish her degree. Of course, that would be easier if her life wasn't veering off the tracks. Between the weird dreams and a potential stalker, not to mention the hot-as-sin guy she keeps bumping into, her life may never be the same.Talon is a born-vampire, a member of the Union City clan, and despite always being in control, he can't seem to get that Human off his mind. Ever . He has no desire for a relationship or a mate, for that matter, but he can't help but feel drawn to her. Her blood is enticing--flowers and rain--but he knows he must stay away from her or risk draining her to nothing more than an empty husk. Unfortunately, when the Vampire King's brother is spotted near SUCK U, a little name the Vampires gave the University since it has one of the densest underground populations of his kind in the western hemisphere, and goes after the very Human he can't stop thinking about, he has no choice but to get involved.SUCK U is book 1 in a long-running series with more than one storyline. The first storyline is told from a dual-POV, Ever & Talon, and is set to be a trilogy. This first story is a progressive reverse-harem. Meaning, the FMC will add mates as the series progresses. Adult language, steamy adult scenes, and themes of abuse, rape, and stalking, but while those may be disturbing to some, this book is meant to be a fun read.",
