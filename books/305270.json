  "description": "My husband has horns, hooves, fur, and a tail.His Krampus-like appearance didn’t scare me away from marrying him. Forever an optimist, I eagerly agreed to be the first bride shipped under the new liaison program to Voran, a country on the newly discovered planet Neron. The Colonel also has two little boys—a huge plus for me since I adore children.My down-to-earth sister says I live with my head in the clouds. And maybe I naively hoped for an out-of-this-world romance.What I didn’t expect was an out-of-this-world brute. The scowling, growling, rough-around-the-edges Colonel proves hard to live with and impossible to love. He’s also proud and possessive and is dead set on keeping me as his wife.Did I mention he has horns? Well, he’s also horny… And our expectations of marriage don’t exactly align.There is something behind the scowl of this infuriating man, though, that intrigues me. Catching glimpses of his strong, fur-covered body makes my stomach flutter with excitement.I came to Voran hoping to find my place in its culture and in the Colonel’s heart.Could there be a way to make this thing between us work?_______________________All books in My Holiday Tails series stand alone, loosely connected by the same world and the fact that all heroes have tails.This series can be read in any order.-----------------------------Warning: Contains graphic scenes of intimacy. Intended for mature readers.",
