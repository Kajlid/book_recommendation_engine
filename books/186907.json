  "title": "Count Luna / Baron Bagge: Two Tales of the Real and the Unreal",
  "description": "This book includes two short novels by Alexander Lernet-Holenia, dealing with the experiences of a military officer at the close of World War I, and with the guilt of an industrialist who inadvertently causes Count Luna to be sent to a concentration camp in war-torn Europe..The thin line between life and death, between reality and fantasy, is skillfully explored in these two short novels. As a writer, Alexander Lemet-Holenia combines the best of the classic tradition in literature with a surprisingly contemporary understanding of structure and language. Passages in Count Luna tracing lineage and metaphorical relationships are brilliant.",
