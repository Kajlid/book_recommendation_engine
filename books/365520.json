  "description": "Tynde is the second son of the King of Alaquis. Sweet, quiet, and with the ability to sense the emotions of others, he's destined to join the seers at the Priory and be cloistered. At least he is until his brother, the Crown Prince Towan, disappears. Desperate to recover his heir, the King sends Tynde to the planet of Kion to chase a rumor that Towan has been kidnapped and taken there. Kion is everything that Alaquis isn't: crowded, urban, with denizens far more ruthless than anything Tynde has experienced before. Lucky for him, he's taken under the wing of Koss, an important businessman who is drawn to Tynde from the moment he meets the young man. Koss believes he's found a real treasure in sensitive Tynde, but will his needs and desires ruin everything that Tynde is?",
