  "description": "Danger and adventure await our dynamic duo as they are transported into the covered wagon of a pioneer family. Life is tough on the Oregon Trail. Rugged land, treacherous mountains, disease, fear of the unknown, and extreme weather conditions make for some challenging times. As Claire and Sam experience life on the trail, they try their best to “help” Jane's family in order to get home. But when every way they can think of to lend a helping hand doesn’t work, they realize they might actually be stuck this time. It isn’t until they track down the Newe (Shoshone) Native Americans that they realize they might have been trying to help the wrong people. Will they be able to figure out a plan before their environment gets the best of them?",
