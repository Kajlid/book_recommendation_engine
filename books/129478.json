  "description": "Alphonse is a hard-hearted bastard who doesn't let people hurt him—by not letting anyone get close. In his world, magic may be real, but he doesn't believe in love…at least not for himself. The only people he cares about are his cousin Ferrous and Ferr's boyfriend, Jude. Even so, they irritate the life out of him sometimes. He tells himself he's given up on finding the lovey-dovey, mushy thing they have—doesn't want it anyway. Then into his life comes Luke, a tough, cocky bastard of a boxer with enchanting dimples and a sexy little ass. Luke invites himself in through the window that very night, offering uncomplicated sex without emotionalism. He's not breakable or vulnerable, and he doesn't need words of love or promises for the future. But somehow sex becomes something more, and Alphonse finds himself wanting to keep the tough boxer forever—but only on his terms. Note: This story contains dark themes & sexual content This story takes place after \"Jude's Magic\" and contains characters from that story. Length: 50,000+ words",
