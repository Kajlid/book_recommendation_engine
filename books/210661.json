  "title": "Boys I Used to Know...: A collection of Haiku",
  "description": "A collection of haiku about bad dates, bad boyfriends, or bad situations broken down into their simplest elements, 17 syllables at a time. All the haiku in the book are about boys that I did in fact \"used to know\" and, yes, some of them I knew biblically. Not all, though. This collection includes boys that didn't make it past the first date, boys that became casual or even serious boyfriends, and some boys that I am still friends with today.",
