  "description": "I once thought Santa’s coal was punishment.Then, I fell for my enemy and was roasted by his heat.Elin. I’m starting to think Santa hates me because living with Anders Tollefson is worse than a stocking full of coal. Everyone thinks he’s a saint, but I know better. Because he was too cheap to fix the plumbing over the summer, the pipes in my building burst, flooding my apartment. Now, I’m forced out of my home with nowhere to go but to my enemy’s house. Donning a candy cane cast and the clothes on my back, I need to pretend my world isn’t crumbling down around me as I enter Anders’ world. On a positive note, I won’t be alone on Christmas, but I’ll keep my guard up just in case. I don’t want to get burned again.Anders. She is the bane of my existence, constantly pushing me out of my comfort zone. Elin Olson thinks she knows everything about me, but she couldn’t be more wrong. I take full responsibility for her broken arm and ruined apartment, which is why I offered her a place to stay. I’ll fix what I can to make things right for her as my tenant, but there will be no special treatment. We just need to get through the next month without killing each other. In a house the size of mine, avoidance will be my tactic. If worse comes to worse, I’ll ship her off to Las Vegas and let her be Axel’s problem.",
