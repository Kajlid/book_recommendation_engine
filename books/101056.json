  "description": "When Vaughn Shido joined his brother's troops as they besieged the desert city of Ro'don, he assumed that the infamous enemy commander Ari Kale adopted the title Demon Child to inspire fear in his enemies. After a gruesome battle, fate and a psychotic ally guide him to a beautiful young enemy on the brink of death. He steals the young man away and nurses him back to health, only to discover that he brought home the Demon Child himself--and that the title is a literal description rather than a moniker.Status: WIPhttp://original.adultfanfiction.net/s...",
