  "title": "Searching for Hannerester",
  "description": "When Hannah Esther Dunney disappears without any real trace, the townspeople and police would rather pin the blame on Pa than search for the truth -- at least that's how it feels to 14 year-old Carrie. No matter what it takes, Carrie is determined to find out what happened to Hannerester, even if the truth is her worst fear. \"Searching for Hannerester is one of the most exciting, authentic, and moving young-person's chapter books that I've ever read. With its surprising and suspenseful plot, unforgettable characters, humor, unique setting and profound human insights, I'd rank Searching for Hannerester right up there with Gary Paulsen's Hatchet and Katherine Paterson's A Bridge to Terabithia. Searching for Hannerester is that rarest of all stories: one that can, and will, be loved by readers of all ages.\"- Novelist Howard Frank Mosher.\"Multi-layered and full of mystery and suspense, Searching for Hannerester beautifully captures young Carrie's tireless effort to unravel the mystery of her surrogate mom's disappearance. In doing so, Carrie gets more than she bargained for, testing her closest relationships and uncovering deep and even dark family secrets. A powerful and unconventional coming of age story.\"- Filmmaker Jay Craven.",
