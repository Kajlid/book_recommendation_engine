  "description": "Love isn’t an emotion—it’s a chemical reaction. Like gasoline meeting a flame. Eventually, the fire burns out. Luckily I’m in the right business. Women don’t expect more than I can give. When I meet Melody, I’m on board for a little fun. I admit, she’s under my skin. But since we share the same philosophy there’s no chance this will turn into anything more. Is there?",
