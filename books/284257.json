  "description": "IN THE GAME OF SEDUCTION, HE WILL ACCEPT NOTHING LESSTHAN TOTAL SURRENDER.When prim and proper Lacey Wright decided to start a new life, she never dreamed she’d be managing a sports bar. But she is determined to make it work even if she is a bit out of her element. The only thing standing in the way is her recklessly charming new boss—a man she finds totally infuriating . . . and completely irresistible.There isn’t a woman in all of Texas who can resist sexy and confident football legend Bobby McIntyre—no one, that is, except the prissy new bar manager who gets his blood pumping. She’s not interested in his money or his fame, and she sees through the macho act he shows the world. But when the tables are turned and it’s Lacey who demands total surrender, can Bobby Mac afford the high stakes in a game of true love?",
