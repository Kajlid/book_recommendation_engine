The first in a series, A Slice of Sin is an anthology of savory stories guaranteed to make your mouth water and leave you needing a little privacy… or an audience.  Women drive these stories, taking the lead in sex, pushing the boundaries of their experience, and always enjoying themselves. From stories of casual sex to stories of the intimacy and enduring passion of established couples, these are stories that will whet your appetite and satisfy your cravings (and maybe leave you with some new ones…).  Act out a dirty little fantasy in Chase Morgan’s The Stand In, satisfy your late-night sweet tooth in Alegra Verde’s The Bakery Boy, or enjoy a night of romantic generosity in Autmn Tooley’s Tonight Is For You. Or step back to a time of long boats and Vikings in Michael Bracken’s Saga of the Sailmaker’s Widow.  From the romantic to the kinky, the suggestive to the explicit, this collection is sure to satisfy and keep you coming back for more and more.
