So, when a mysterious stranger walks out of her dreams and into her life to spout some nonsense about her being a mythical creature, she chalks it up to one more crazy thing to add to her it's-a-crappy-life list. Yet, when the stranger's predictions start to come true, she discovers a world that could shake up her humdrum existence",
