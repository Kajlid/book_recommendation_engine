  "description": "Morton Dauwen Zabel Award, American Academy of Arts and Letters. LYING IN BED begins with the voice of a strange, compelling speaker. The more we learn of his life and his most unusual marriage, the less we are sure of who he is and what he says. LYING IN BED first seduces us with its intense storytelling, then ensnares us in a dangerous psychological and erotic labyrinth we never want to leave.",
