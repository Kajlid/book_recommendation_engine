  "description": "Essentially a psychologically twisted style story, this book contains some offensive language and is suitable for adults only. It touches on sexual and domestic abuse of women, mental health and features three women, in East London, linked through adversity with twists and turns along the way. It is a work of fiction, however this type of thing could be happening near you - two very important subjects we should be aware of.",
