  "description": "When my best friend died of cancer just before her eighteenth birthday, she left her coveted bucket list to me. So, it falls on me to finish it for her, to honor her memory. In the next year, it's my mission to: dye my hair, have sex, camp out in a tent, go bungee jumping, and get revenge on Lincoln Kolb. Most are doable, some terrify me, and then there is the last item on the list. When the raven-haired football god dumped my best friend during senior year of high school, she was devastated. The jerk with charm for days found out she was sick, and betrayed her in the worst way possible. But he doesn't know me, I went to school a town over. Now, to fulfill my promise, I'm the newest freshman on the campus where he is the big man. If there is one thing, aside from cheap beer, that a jock can't pass up, it's a shiny new girl. So when I catch his eye, play hard to get, and then fall into his bed, I know my scheme is working to perfection. But what Lincoln can't see coming is the beatdown I have planned for his ice-cold heart. Unfortunately, what I never saw coming was the one he had planned for mine. Contains mature themes.",
