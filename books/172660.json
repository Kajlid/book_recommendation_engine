  "description": "“I don’t get it. And it sounds like you don’t either.\"  Yves Santiago, anonymous sex blogger turned memoirist, is rarely at a loss for words, especially when it comes to sharing the details of her sex life. But when her sister asks her to explain what spanking has to do with sex, she’s struggles to find a way to make her understand.  Yves takes this confusion home to Elijah who enthusiastically explains why spanking is so erotic for her…and a little of why it works for him.  (Includes an excerpt from In Her Closet, The Lust Diaries: Book One)",
