  "description": "Ellis McGowan, a child psychiatrist, thought he had seen and heard it all, especially with a wife, Jodie, in the same emotionally-draining profession. When the fire and collapse of an Abbey in the vicinity of their home leaves traumatised children of all ages displaced Ellis is ready to help in any way he can. Soon enough he finds that everything is not as they had imagined; more children than what were originally documented escaped from that building, many with no traceable origins and Ellis needs to find out why, prepared to go to great lengths to do so. Zack and Alex, the two eldest survivors, soon find themselves in an environment radically different from what they are used to. In a warm, inviting household and faced with a real family the two aren't sure how to handle things but are certain they will never be able to tell others what went on in their pasts. Unwilling to lose all faith in the system and his profession Ellis is determined to get answers out of the boys to save them, and the others, from the torture they have been subjected to, even while knowing that the Abbey walls were easier to knock down than the ones that had formed around their hearts.",
