  "description": "He's the GOAT of the NFL. She's a hot-headed reporter who despises him. They're in the same small town for the summer. What could possibly go wrong?I'm more than aware of the responsibilities that come with being a quarterback in the NFL.The upside—I get to do what I love every day, which is play football.And I make more money than I know what to do with.The downside—everyone wants a piece of me, and the press stalks me ruthlessly. And one reporter in particular, Brinkley Reynolds, has crossed a line.She takes things too far.So yeah, I have her escorted out of the press conference.Imagine my surprise when the same woman walks into the coffee shop in the small town where I’ve gone to get some privacy for the summer.I accuse her of stalking me.She calls me every name in the book before proceeding to make me feel very unwelcome in Cottonwood Cove.Her hometown.The place where she tucked tail and ran after I’d unknowingly gotten her fired.So now I’m enemy number one.That’s fine with me. I’m not the biggest fan of her either.She’s equal parts stubborn and aggravating.But she happens to be the sexiest woman I’ve ever laid eyes on.So I try to make amends.I’m not the devil after all.But she won’t give me the time of day unless I agree to give her my story.One I’ve fought hard to protect since the day I started playing professional ball.I don’t owe Brinkley Reynolds anything.So why am I considering giving her everything?",
