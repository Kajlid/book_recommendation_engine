  "description": "She has a secret.  I’m complicated. Not broken or ruined or running from a past I can’t face. Just complicated.  I thought my life couldn’t get any more tangled in deceit and confusion. But I hadn’t met him. I hadn't realized how far I could fall or what I'd have do to get free.  He has a secret.  I’ve never pretended to be good or deserving. I chase who I want, do what I want, act how I want.  I didn’t have time to lust after a woman I had no right to lust after. I told myself to shut up and stay hidden. But then she tried to run. I’d tasted what she could offer me and damned if I would let her go.  Secrets destroy them.  **Pepper Winters is known for her Dark Erotica. This book is more a Grey Romance. It isn't fluffy, and still deals with darker subjects, but it isn't brutal.**  Destroyed is a complicated love story between a man with a terrible past and a woman who holds his cure. A man who finds redemption in love and a woman who loses her heart and reason for living.  Death brings life, and destruction brings new beginnings.  No cliffhanger. Stand alone. HEA",
