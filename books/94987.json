  "description": "Pea and Carrot have a bad feeling. Are Donut, Soda and Candy hiding something? They are so sweet, fancy and popular. But something is not right about them. Do they have a bitter secret? Today's food society is very confusing for children and adults alike. Food comes in wrappers and boxes with intimidating ingredient lists. What are we really eating? Do we know where it came from? Is it even real food? Eating should be simple. THE UNPOPULAR PEA (& CARROT) serves as a fun way to learn about \"real\" food. It shows the differences between junk food and vegetables and teaches children how to make healthy choices.",
