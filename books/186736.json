  "description": "Rina Brewer is one of Santa’s elves, yes you read that right. Not the tiny cute little toy maker, but the sexy, petite, bombshell kind. She’s come to Holiday to set a promise right, even if she’s not sure she’s made for a small town with too prying eyes. Justin Cooper knows how to make mistakes. It’s taken years to learn how to rectify them. When he nearly died one snowy night, he made a promise to the big guy up north and now it’s time to deal with the consequences. Only Jack Frost might nip more than your nose if you’re not careful and this Christmas romance is one misstep away from melting everything around them. Rina Brewer is one of Santa’s elves. Not the tiny cute little toy maker, but the sexy, petite, energy filled bombshell kind. She’s come to Holiday to aid Justin in his new role as Santa’s executive, but as soon as she sees the sexy ex-bad boy, she realizes the job may be more than she bargained for. As they work together to make this Christmas one to remember, an old foe has come to town to make sure that his holiday is the coldest yet. Contains a perky elf who dreams of something more, a Christmas myth who may be a baddie, and a sexy ex-bad boy who craves Christmas cookies … and a certain perky blonde.",
