  "title": "Despite Serendipity",
  "description": "A boring night, a crowded club. Portia Winters has had her fill of both. She's one cheesy pickup line away from losing her mind when Tore Brennan slides up onto the barstool next to hers. When the DJ plays the perfect song, she seizes the opportunity to show him everything she's come to feel for him since they first met over a decade ago. Tore loves the nightlife — the music, the alcohol, and the easy women. All that could change when his perfect woman drags him onto the dance floor. Portia's classy, gorgeous, and everything he’s ever dreamed of. Can he abandon his playboy ways for a chance to prove he can be the man she deserves? Or will old habits die hard? **The events in this novella fall within the timeline between books one and two of the Revenants in Purgatory series. It should be read after Aeonian Kiss (R.I.P. #2)",
