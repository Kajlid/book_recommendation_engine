Headmistress Robin pretended to be my friend, but she might turn out to be my greatest enemy of all.Things should be simpler now that I no longer have to pretend to be someone other than myself, but nothing could be further from the truth.Bleakwood is under investigation. With the threat of closure hanging over us, I find myself tangled in a complicated web of yet more lies and secrets—lies and secrets that could determine the fate of this school and everyone in it, myself included.With the future of Bleakwood in the balance, I soon find that the next great betrayal isn’t going to come from outside, from anyone else.The next betrayal, the greatest betrayal of all, is going to come from me.Wretched is a full-length reverse harem bully romance with multiple love interests. It’s the third book in the Wicked Brotherhood trilogy, a contemporary enemies-to-lovers series where the main character has no intent to choose between the men who inevitably end up falling for her...after they’ve paid their penitence, of course.",
