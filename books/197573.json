  "title": "Dirty Ugly Toy",
  "description": "Her time is over. Things are looking up.  She’s dirty and ugly. He’s wicked but handsome.  Six months to toy with her. Six months of vacation and a ton of money.  I’ll hurt her beyond repair. I’ve been through much worse.  She's difficult to control and doesn't obey. I'm done submitting to anyone or anything in this life.  I should hate her. I should hate him.  The game has changed. I will win.  Dirty Ugly Toy is a novel that blurs the lines of right and wrong, deals with abuse, contains dubious consent, and adult subject matter. If you are sensitive to violent sexual situations, the book may not be suitable for you. Some parts of this book are not easy to read and are not intended for everyone. However, those that keep an open mind and stick with it will not be disappointed.",
