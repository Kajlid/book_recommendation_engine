  "description": "He watches from afar, a harbinger of death… Alexandria Malik is NOT having a very good day. First, a man falls from the sky. Then, she is arrested for murder. And now, stuck behind bars, she realizes she can’t remember anything. Not even her name. To make matters worse, amidst the chaos sits a stranger—cigarette in one hand and three watches on the other—with a proposition to join him in mayhem, and a summons to serve.Suddenly, Alex is thrown into a world of rich anecdotes and poor tribulations, a life so wondrous people would change their genes to have it. But as Districts begin to burn, people disappear, and a war begins to brew, Alex realizes things may be more complicated than they seem, and the truth more cruel than she wants to believe.",
