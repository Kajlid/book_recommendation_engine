  "description": "Physically beautiful and strangely passive, George Miles becomes the object of his friendsâ€™ passions, and one after another, they ransack him for love or anything else they can trust in the mindlessness of middle America. What they find assaults the senses as it engages the mind, in a novel that explores the limits of experience and the horror in the world around us.",
