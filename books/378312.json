  "description": "Two brothers wearing bunny suits hop on a phallic train and travel to a mysterious underwater brothel.The story is very surreal and deranged in an Alice-in-Wonderland kind of way. The art style is quite original and seems influenced by European comics, in particular the likes of Jean Giraud.",
