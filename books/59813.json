  "description": "\"She told me my eyes 'looked like emeralds in a bottomless sea and she just wanted to drown in them.' I sensed she wanted to drown, period.\" When six foot five, dreamy-eyed Kai Williams looks into your eyes, he'll sense your soul's darkest desires. That's a serious liability as far as he's concerned. When he meets Cassandra Evans, he'll be faced with a choice - surrender his heart to love for once in his life or fall prey to the evil his old pal Cam Tyson has introduced to him, the seductively demonic Angela Myers. Angela wants him. Will her malevolent, evil magic be strong enough to overpower him or will he embrace his own incredible powers and defeat her, finding true love?",
