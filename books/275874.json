  "description": "Oligarchs gone wild, in a brutal and darkly comic Argentinian noirMr. Luis Machi is an unforgettably loathsome and hilarious Argentinian oligarch who made his fortune collaborating with the worst elements of society--parasites, pushers, and secret policemen. He has a cocaine habit, a collection of three hundred ties, ten million dollars in the bank, and a bloody corpse in the trunk of his BMW . . . but as far as the body goes, he's completely innocent. He has no idea who the victim could be, or who among his many, many enemies might be trying to frame him for murder, and he doesn't have much time to find out . . .The profane and uproarious Like Flies from Afar follows Machi through twenty-four hours of his eventful life--one full day in which to solve this mystery, or at least to make sure he isn't the one to take the fall.The first novel to appear in English by the \"subway janitor by night, novelist by day,\" who began his writing career while an undocumented immigrant in the United States, Like Flies from Afar will demonstrate why K. Ferrari is already an award-winning star of international crime fiction. A hardboiled noir thriller, a whodunit, a black comedy, and a filthy catalog of the excesses of wealth, this is a Jim Thompson novel for the globalized world.",
