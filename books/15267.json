  "description": "\"A RIVETING TALE of passion, danger & forbidden love. Breathless BREATHES NEW LIFE into the vampire genre.\" Rene Fountain, BookFetishCollege freshman Leesa Nyland has been fascinated by vampires since she was 3 years old. That's when her mom started acting weird, insisting sunlight hurt her skin because she'd been bitten by a one-fanged vampire. Fascinated doesn't mean Leesa believes, though. Any more than she believes in blue fire, people who live for centuries, or kisses that can kill. But when her beloved older brother suddenly disappears, she is forced to confront all these and more. She also has to figure out what to do about her mysterious new boyfriend. She knows Rave likes her a lot--so why won't he kiss her? As Leesa draws closer to finding her brother, she faces some gut-wrenching decisions. Should she risk her mom's life trying to \"cure\" her? Should she continue seeing Rave, after he reveals his dangerous secret? And most terrifying of all, should she make the ultimate sacrifice--give up her humanity--to save her brother? VampireRomanceBooks called Breathless \"fabulous\" and \"captivating.\" Bite This! Vampre Book Blog said Breathless is \"a book you will fall in love with and want to read over and over again.\"",
