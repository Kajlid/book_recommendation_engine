  "title": "Le Divorce",
  "description": "This delightful comedy of manners and morals, money, marriage, and murder follows smart, sexy, and impeccably dressed American Isabel Walker as she lands in Paris to visit her stepsister Roxy, a poet whose marriage to an aristocratic French painter has assured her a coveted place in Parisian society...until her husband leaves her for the wife of an American lawyer.  Could \"le divorce\" be far behind?  Can irrepressible Isabel keep her perspective (and her love life) intact as cultures and human passions collide?  \"Social comedy at its best\" (Los Angeles Times Book Review), Le Divorce is Diane Johnson at her most scintillating and sublime.",
