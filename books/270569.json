Martin Petrovich, a young man seeking a better life, immigrates from Dubrovnik to San Francisco at the turn of the century.

Martin rebuilds his life in a small farming community set on the Monterey Bay, populated with ethnically diverse characters--Croatians, Mexicans and Japanese.

Martin once again finds himself in a place where racial hatred in all its ugly guises runs amok.  As the government turns the town’s airport into a Naval facility, conscripts his sons, and begins moving Japanese to internment camps, Martin’s forced to make a decision. Should he help a Japanese friend and risk the backlash of his neighbors? Or should he take the safer path of least resistance?  Whatever the decision, it will lead to his destiny and forever shape his American Dream.",
