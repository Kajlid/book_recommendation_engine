Suddenly, that stranger was starring in my dreams as my romantic and sensual husband-to-be.That role’s already taken, though.But no matter how hard I try, I can’t stop thinking about Reece Blackstone, the famous 47-year-old, soft spoken guitarist.

Literally.But I never could’ve known that Reece has been living with a terrible secret that’s kept him from having the love and happiness he deserves.And now, it’s back again, threatening to tear him, and us, apart.What Reece doesn’t realize is that he’s no longer in this alone—I’m going to fight for him, our happily ever after, and all the wishes of our hearts.",
