After losing his faith, his wife, and now his partner, Fletcher learns that Charlie Fields has come back to town with one mission: to kill everyone responsible for his sister's death. It is Fletcher's job to track and stop the crazed killer. But as it becomes clear who the main targets are, Fletcher finds himself in the midst of a moral quagmire. Although he sees justice in Charlie's crusade, the killer seems to be taking out others not responsible for his family's destruction. As Fletcher and his new partner battle each other in a test of ideology and limits of the law, the real demons show up and change everything.",
