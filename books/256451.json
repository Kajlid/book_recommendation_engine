  "title": "Their Ruthless Sadist",
  "description": "By definition, a Sadist is one who receives sexual gratification from causing pain and degradation to another.  That’s me to a T.  I only play with those who understand what it means, those who are willing to indulge my devious desires.  Any masochist who seeks me out knows that if they trespass, I will gladly shatter them and walk away, leaving them for someone else to put back together.  Yet the cowboy and the pretty boy have given themselves to me. They have agreed to play by my rules and there is only one: THERE ARE NO RULES.  I have warned them. I’m not looking for companionship or love. I don’t want to be their friend, their confidante, or their lover. I’m in it for pleasure only. In the form of pain.  I am ruthless.  I am a Sadist.  And I make no excuses for it.",
