  "description": "The woman he had no intentions of loving, but who he did love, hopelessly. The woman he had no intentions of dating, but had ended up committing himself to. The woman who had always been four years elder to him, but realised it only when she was about to hit London for a PG course. The woman who had gotten into the car, without looking back once as he stood there on the empty streets outside the institute, nursing a broken heart.",
