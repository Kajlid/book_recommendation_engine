  "title": "Planes, Trains & Elephants",
  "description": "Whether you're an explorer or a tourist, the journey often proves to be more exciting than the place you arrive at. Not to mention more alarming, entertaining, spectacular, dangerous or farcical. All of which is pretty closely connected with the mode of transport you're dependent on - from stubborn mule to ancient plane. Brian Thacker has been on the look-out for unusual vehicles ever since he travelled down the Ovens River in the Victorian Alps on a rubber inner tube when he was nine years old. Here he writes about his most memorable journeys, including his trip on the Trans Siberian Express, his pub crawl on the London tube, his journey down the east coast of Australia in a truck and a camel safari with a particularly grumpy camel.",
