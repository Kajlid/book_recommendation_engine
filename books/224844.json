  "description": "Bronwyn and Paul are a couple stranded at a \"temporary\" stop on their inevitable way to Hollywood glamour--in a house that is so ugly, so frayed, so...brown that it's almost cool. But just as the Bohemian life is wearing painfully thin, their fortunes change, catapulting them out of the world of practical problems and into the world of ethical ones.",
