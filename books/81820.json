  "title": "Until One Has Loved an Animal: How Pets Affected One Vet's Soul",
  "description": "Mildred Drost has had the honor of meeting many wonderful beings-canine, feline, and wild. She has had comical interludes and been shocked and horrified. She has seen, met, and experienced miracles. Through it all, she has become part of the best career in the world. Dr. Drost is a veterinarian who, by her own admission, is completely fascinated by her patients. In Until One Has Loved an Animal, Dr. Drost shares all the amusing and heartwarming ways that pets affect all of our lives. She recalls the ninety-pound Malamute who spontaneously decides he wants a live chicken for lunch while on a jog with her; the German shepherd who makes any other ornery dog look like an angel; and the cat who, seemingly possessed at night, steals geraniums. Providing an entertaining and informative glimpse into the lives of pets and their owners, Dr. Drost also explores animal emotions and health, proving that these creatures, both large and small, often feel the same sentiments as humans. The stories of this collection offer an intriguing look into the animal psyche, the importance of pet rescue, and all the reasons why we cannot help but love animals unconditionally.",
