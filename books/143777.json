  "description": "A mesmerizing, atmospheric modern gothic story set in a sinister English manor house where a woman discovers her destiny winding through centuries of previous incarnations . . . Teetering on the edge of the North Sea in Norfolk, Grimdark Hall is both grim and dark in name and nature. When Cló and Jude Honeyborne arrive from Toronto to claim Jude’s inheritance, Cló is unsettled by the foreboding ancient building and the hostility of Jude’s sisters, who stalk her every move. But Cló is drawn to the strange energy of the treacherous fens and the haunting sadness of a drowned village in the bay where ghostly church bells toll thirteen, sweeping her back into another woman’s memories . . . In 1645 Euphemia Figgis was accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake, screaming a curse on the Honeybornes as the flames consumed her. Now, flashes of Effie’s life torment Cló at every turn. Cló isn’t the only one who’s lived   an odd little girl lurks about Grimdark claiming to be the reincarnation of a notorious pirate, and waiting in the shadows is a darker, vengeful incarnation who has hunted them both through the centuries in search of a medieval treasure. As echoes of Cló’s past lives converge in present threats, she must confront a final reckoning of old betrayals and relentless greed to end an eight-hundred-year-old quest for vengeance.",
