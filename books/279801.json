  "title": "Kate in Waiting",
  "description": "From bestselling YA rom-com queen Becky Albertalli, author of Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda (Love, Simon), comes a new novel about daring to step out of the shadows and into the spotlight in love, life and, yes, theatre.Contrary to popular belief, best friends Kate Garfield and Anderson Walker are not codependent. Carpooling to and from theatre rehearsals? Environmentally sound and efficient. Consulting each other on every single life decision? Basic good judgment. Pining for the same guys from afar? Shared crushes are more fun anyway.But when Kate and Andy's latest long-distance crush shows up at their school, everything goes off-script. Matt Olsson is talented and sweet, and Kate likes him. She really likes him. The only problem? So does Anderson. Turns out, communal crushes aren't so fun when real feelings are involved. This one might even bring the curtains down on Kate and Anderson's friendship.",
