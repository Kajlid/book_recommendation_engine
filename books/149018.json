  "description": "Is love ever wrong? Paul Meyer has never let anyone get too close. Until Max. The Lion's Heart is a heart-rending story about love and sacrifice. The emotional struggle of Paul's same-sex attraction, the guilt he feels, and his ambivalence toward his Catholic faith all come together in this look inside the heart of a tortured man. Reviews: \"Dena Hunt is a consummate story-teller who does not shirk or shy away from the difficult questions about life and love that her story raises. The Lion's Heart contains not only the loves of lovers, spouses, parents, and children but also the demons and dragons that selfishness unleashes. The Lion's Heart is not for the faint-hearted, nor is it for the hard-hearted. It pulsates with a passion that will bring true hearts to their knees.\" Joseph Pearce, author of The Unmasking of Oscar Wilde, co-editor of the St. Austin Review\"The Lion's Heart moved me to the core. Dena Hunt managed a rare feat: a delicately crafted novel that is at once a work of beauty and existential weight, and yet forces you to keep reading with all the urgency of a thriller.\" Bernardo Aparicio Garcia, Publisher, Dappled Things",
