  "description": "TO: Alex VegaFROM: Emilia StilesSUBJECT: HelloDear Mr. Vega,I felt it necessary to follow up on today’s meeting, since we weren’t able to speak candidly in front of your son.I was shocked to discover that you are Ryder’s dad. Given that your ex-wife will be out of the country for a while and you are currently his primary caregiver, I’m sure you understand why we need to establish boundaries and etiquette. I think it would be best if we just pretend that we met in person for the first time today.Your son is a very bright (flirtatious and talkative) student and since his education is a top priority for both of us, I hope I can count on you to respectfully refrain from grinning at me, using that sexy tone of voice, and undressing me with your annoyingly beautiful brown eyes if we should happen to interact with each other again in the future.Thanks so much,Miss StilesTO: Emilia StilesFROM: Alex VegaSUBJECT: Re: Well, hello again…Dear Miss Stiles,Great to hear from you. My son’s education is indeed a top priority. As such, I respectfully agree to refrain from doing all of the aforementioned things.However, I can’t promise to stop thinking about that kiss at the bar this summer. I’ve been thinking about it for the past month. It’s interesting how humorless and uptight you are about my son’s totally awesome personality, given that I have personally witnessed just how flirtatious and talkative you yourself can be when mildly intoxicated.You’re so welcome,AlexP.S. I volunteered to be a chaperone for your next field trip. See you then.",
