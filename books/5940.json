  "description": "[Menage Amour: Erotic Paranormal Menage a Trois Romance, M/M/F]  When Emma dreams about super-famous rockstar Duncan and his friend Jake, it never occurs to her they might be dreaming, too. About her. Everyone knows dreams aren't real, but what will happen when the trio's shared visions develop into a passion that can't be denied?  When reports of a new \"bonding\" phenomenon surface, Duncan and Jake finally realize why they feel so connected to the sweet high-school librarian they've never met. The headaches and dreams suddenly make sense, but it isn't until they meet Emma face-to-face that instinct takes over, and passion binds their minds and bodies into a link that can't be broken.  Then, just as the happy ending Emma always hoped for seems possible, a hostage crisis and a series of kidnappings threatens everything. Can the trio unravel the conspiracy in time to protect the future of their bond?  ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
