  "description": "Hangry: adjective—feeling irritable or irrationally angry as a result of being hungry.Sometimes, Crockett felt that in her soul.And, of course, the one time that she’s being ‘irrationally angry’ would be the time that the hottest guy on the continent walked into her place of business dressed in prison orange.She should’ve been afraid.She should’ve taken one look at him and walked the other way.But, she didn’t.Crockett Archer, better known as a doormat extraordinaire, didn’t walk away from the people she knew needed her. She’d never been able to do it with a father that didn’t love her, and she wouldn’t be able to do it with a man that didn’t think he deserved a chance at love.One look is all it takes for Zach Caruso to know that Crockett could be his.All he would have to do is snap his fingers, and she’d fall right into the palm of his hand.Which is why Zach turns around and walks far, far away.He tries not to look back.He tries to leave her be.But then he sees how she’s treated by the people that are supposed to love her, and all cognitive thoughts seem to flee his rational brain.One second, he’s running in the opposite direction. The next, he’s playing her knight in dingy armor.God help her.",
