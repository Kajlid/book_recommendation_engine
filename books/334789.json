  "description": "I became the monster I had to in order to survive…. My history isn’t filled with love and sunshine. I grew up with a family that did the opposite of what they should have and I had to fight to survive. When the time came to battle my demons, I burned them to the ground until there was nothing left to fight. Now that I’m free, I have to feed the monster they forced me to become, and there’s only one way to do that. My name is Briar, and I’m your worst nightmare. If you’re slotted for death, you’ll never see me coming and I promise you, it won’t be quick. You can pray all you want, but no one can save you from me. Run, if it will make you feel better. My monster will still find you…. *A standalone Dark Romance MFM. If you have any triggers, be extremely mindful of the warnings at the beginning of the book. They’re there for a reason and not to be taken lightly.*",
