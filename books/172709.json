  "description": "CONTENT WARNING: This YA Contemporary Romance is recommended for ages 16+ due to non-graphic sexual content and some strong language. Anna can’t believe her life is such a mess. She’s dating Derek, but she’s in love with his brother—and her best friend—Jesse Daniels. To make matters worse, Anna’s dad is about to make them her stepbrothers! Now she’s graduating high school, but instead of thoughts centered on her future with Derek, all she can think about is Jesse. When had he slipped past her defenses, with his blond hair and soulful eyes…and that grin that makes her knees wobble? When had her crush become full-blown desire? Everywhere she turns, Anna’s confronted with her love for the Daniels’ boys, and she knows she can only choose one. Even her twin, Tiffany, is gaga over Jesse’s cousin, Greg—a bad boy with a mean streak! Anna is torn and doesn’t know what to do. She doesn’t want to hurt either of them, but she can’t stay away from Derek any more than she can stay away from Jesse. Derek and Jesse are egged on by Greg, and it’s only a matter of time before they come to blows over Anna. As the summer heats up, so do emotions. At a beach party one night, Greg—as always—fuels the emotional fires to a raging blaze and the unthinkable happens. No one, not even Anna, could have imagined the unspeakable tragedy that awaited them, or the bittersweet aftermath that could be the balm to heal their hurting souls. LIFE WITH JESSE DANIELS is a poignant exposé of young love that is sure to become a keeper with everyone who reads it!",
