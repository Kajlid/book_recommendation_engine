  "description": "Bizarre rituals on a remote island in Maine.My crazy neighbor lying naked in the produce section of a grocery store.The sting of a knife as it slices through my flesh.Now I know why they say life is never easy.The soft touch of Tria’s hand against my chest is the only thing that keeps me going, but there are consequences. As a fighter, I should be able to deal with anything life throws at me, but there is one circumstance I simply can’t handle.I only have one coping mechanism: a tube around my arm and a needle in my vein.",
