  "description": "How far would you go for the one you loved? Would you risk everything? What if you had two soulmates? What if one of them wanted to kill you? What if you had to destroy the person you love in order to save them? Would you be able to do it?  Dev: He has the answers I've been looking for my entire life.  He's also keeping one more secret.  My first love....is alive, and he wants his revenge against me.  Problem is...I still love him.  I still love the BOTH of them.  I'm equally bound to them.  One owns my heart...one owns my soul.   In order to save one...I'll have to kill the other.   But not if he kills me first.  Tristan: I never meant to fall in love with her, but just like breathing- it was beyond my control.  I should have told her the truth about Alex right away, but my own jealousy got in the way.  Instead, she walked right into the trap...and so did I.  Now, I'm being held captive, and she's about to marry the man she swears she loves.  Even though he's a monster.  Even though it's destroying me.
