  "description": "Talia laughed. \"Really? That's all you've got?\"  Arryn smiled. \"Not even close.\"  After being left for dead on the tallest peak in the Frozen North--Arryn is ready to make good on the promises she made to Talia.  Fighting the dangers of the North only made her stronger than she ever thought possible. And now she's heading back to Arcadia to get the job done.  But she's not alone...  She found a new friend in the mountains, one who's just dying to meet Talia.  Set on the foundation laid by the Kurtherian Gambit Series, The Frozen Wasteland tells an entirely new story in the Age of Magic--and of the heroes and villains who battle for control of its destiny.",
