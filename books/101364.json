  "title": "The Gateway Cat",
  "description": "With humor, grace, and occasionally resignation, the author describes her family's journey into owning one cat...then two...then three...and finally four. Triggered by the drama of an impending divorce, the plea \"Mom, now can we get a kitten\" seemed an easy one to grant in order to ease the pain. Little did anyone know that cats were like potato chips--nobody can settle for just one!",
