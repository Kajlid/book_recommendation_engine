  "description": "Julian Carleton went on the rampage at the building site of Frank Lloyd Wright's home, Taliesin, in Spring Green, Wisconsin. His employer is known far and wide, but other than the newspaper report of the heinous crimes Julian committed, nothing is known of him. Cook-Wilson has created an account of his life in which he has been placed in situations which do not serve to excuse his actions, but perhaps explain his motivation.",
