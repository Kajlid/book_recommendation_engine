  "description": "Trouble just seems to follow Faia Rissedotte. She's a powerful mage, perhaps the most powerful. And it's Faia's fate to bring the Delmuire Barrier down, to end life as it has been for millenia on Arhel, and to reunite it with the rest of the world. Much as Faia will fight it, Fate will have its way with her--but even the gods won't be the same when she's done.",
