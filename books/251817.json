  "description": "The 'War to end all Wars', as seen through the eyes of three young womenIt is 1915. War is being fought on a horrific scale in the trenches of France, but it might as well be a world away from sixteen–year–old New Zealander Midge Macpherson, at school in England learning to be a young lady. But the war is coming closer: Midge's brothers are in the army, and her twin, Tim, is listed as 'missing' in the devastating defeat of the ANZAC forces at Gallipoli.Desperate to do their bit – and avoid the boredom of school and the restrictions of Society – Midge and her friends Ethel and Anne start a canteen in France, caring for the endless flow of wounded soldiers returning from the front. Midge, recruited by the over–stretched ambulance service, is thrust into carnage and scenes of courage she could never have imagined. And when the war is over, all three girls – and their ANZAC boys as well – discover that even going 'home' can be both strange and wonderful.Exhaustively researched but written with the lightest of touches, this is Jackie French at her very best.",
