Struggling against the chemicals dripping into his veins, the scientist must keep the DNA source code hidden to preserve a world on the edge of annihilation. But the alien has miscalculated and coma is induced, a state of mind which the scientist uses to escape into a world where song rules and he can run from the pain. Rhey is determined to follow. In this place, Jareth the lone minstrel swordsman, is suddenly surrounded by those that claim to know and protect him. Leanan Sidhe, the Dark Muse, says she’s his lover, born of myth and magic with the power of her voice riding ocean winds. The other, the Cervine, is a stag-man rooted to the earth. His song riddles the bark of trees and digs with chords of soil. Along with the woman of light, they urge him to go home, if anyone is to survive. When Leanan and the Cervine insist he take the girl Beryl with him, to protect and guide her, he balks. Until they tell him the Hunter is coming. To him, Beryl is an outcast whose skin is filled with living, moving ink. She’s just another one that’s making his life more difficult.Without the knowledge he’s a character in a story that has now become the only thing that can save the world, Jareth is a soul stirred by an eight stringed mandolin and a sword he dares not touch. The memory that each is more must be awakened before time runs out.It’s a story only imagination can write and a bard could sing. It is the tale of Jareth Rhylan.",
