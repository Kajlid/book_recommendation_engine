  "description": "Check out the MacArthur Family series if you’re in the mood for quick, light romantic suspense reads! He’s not her type. Elementary school teacher Patience had her whole summer planned out, and it included margaritas and a lot of time at the beach. But when she agrees to a temporary nanny position as a favor to a friend, the last thing she expected was to butt heads with—or be attracted to—Brodie MacArthur, her employer’s sexy head of security. But that doesn’t stop her from wanting him. Brodie made a mistake with Patience and forever ruined her first impression of him. Just as their heated clashes reach a peak, Patience falls ill…and it’s something far more sinister than a simple summer bug. He screwed up once. He won’t do it again. And when he learns that the danger is closer than they imagined, he’ll have to fight to protect her—and win her heart.
