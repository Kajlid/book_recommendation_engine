  "description": "Two of bestselling author Lisa Kleypas's beloved novels, now available in one volume, Falling for You.In Married by Morning, for two years, Catherine Marks has been a paid companion to the Hathaway sisters—a pleasant position, with one caveat. Her charges' older brother, Leo Hathaway, is thoroughly exasperating. But when one quarrel ends in a sudden kiss, Cat is shocked at her powerful response—and even more so when Leo proposes a dangerous liaison. Leo must marry and produce an heir within a year to save his family home. But Catherine hides a secret that could separate them forever—unless two lovers can find a way to banish the shadows and give in to their desires. In Love in the Afternoon, free-spirited Beatrix Hathaway has never been seriously courted…and she has resigned herself to the fate of never finding love. Captain Christopher Phelan is a handsome, daring soldier who plans to marry Beatrix's friend, the vivacious Prudence Mercer, when he returns from war. But, as he explains in his letters to Pru, life on the battlefield has darkened his soul—and it's becoming clear that he won't come back as the same man. When Beatrix learns of Pru's disappointment, she decides to help by concocting Pru's letters to Christopher for her. Soon the correspondence develops into something deeper. What began as Beatrix's innocent deception has resulted in the agony of unfulfilled love—and a passion that can't be denied.",
