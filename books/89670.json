But those lies suddenly become much harder to keep when Reid Phillips, a struggling musician and her not-entirely-welcome new roommate complicates things by seeing right through her carefully constructed walls and challenging her compartmentalized life.Now with Grams seriously ill, her mother’s life in turmoil and her dream job and relationship on the line, it’s more important than ever for Whitney to hold everything together. But when that means being honest with everyone—starting with herself, is Whitney strong enough to do what it takes?",
