  "description": "They say there is always a calm before the storm. A time when you think you’re safe, protected from the destruction that you know is going to eventually come. Harper was that calm. And I? I was the motherfucking storm. As kids we were best friends. She was the light to my darkness. I used to protect her from her bullies, now I’ll become her most feared one. Seeing her for the first time after three years was like a bucket of ice water being poured on me. It chilled me to the bone, making me irrational, angry. No longer is she a little girl but a grown woman with curves and eyes that pierce my black soul. No one knows the darkness that lingers under the surface, all they see is my smile, my charismatic charm. I’m the all American golden boy. Having her back in my life is awakening something inside of me. She reminds me of everything good, everything I’ll never have and I refuse to let her stay. She has to go and the only person dark enough, dirty enough to scare her away is me… Breaking Harper isn’t as easy… I thought I knew everything, turns out others are just as good at hiding their secrets as I am. Damaged, dark and falling off the deep end. Will I break her? Will I break us?“Sometimes the scariest monsters aren’t those that hide in the dark. Sometimes they’re the ones hidden right in plain sight… like me.” **This is a standalone DARK bully romance. This book contains scenes that may be triggering to some readers.
