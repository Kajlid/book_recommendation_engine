  "description": "Drastic times call for drastic measures, and Jane Denning's love life certainly qualifies as drastic these days. She's had a string of lousy relationships with Beemer driving, self-important yuppies that need a map and a guide to navigate a woman's body. Oh yeah, and who automatically defer to her on every decision. As a strong woman, she ends up walking all over them. BORING! She decides what she needs is a man who won't be so accommodating. One who will take control instead of giving it, demand instead of ask, command instead of cajole. One who knows what goes where when it comes to sex, for God's sake! But for a woman who's always been in charge, that's easier said than done. Enlisting the help of her best friend, together over ice cream, potato chips and chicken salad sandwiches, they hatch a plan to find the perfect man for this little experiment. As a career military man, Ian knows the value of being in the right place at the right time. So when he overhears Jane plotting with her friend in a crowded caf√©, he's not above taking advantage of the situation, and sets about using all of his training to take the control she's so willing to give up. He has no trouble convincing Jane that he's the right man to give her a taste of what she's been missing for the short term. Trouble is, he figures out pretty quick that he doesn't want to just be her short term solution he wants to be there for the long haul. But Jane's leery of falling in love, and Ian's going to have to think fast and act faster if he's going to keep her around. Shouldn't be a problem for a sneaky Dom like him.",
