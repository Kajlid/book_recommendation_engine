  "description": "Daws is a Devil Crusader, born and raised a bad boy. He’s sick of superficial, meaningless relationships. Fate throws him a curveball when Aubrey begins working for his dad’s motorcycle shop. Aubrey is damaged and scarred. She’s running from a past that has the ability to destroy her. It’s not just herself that she needs to protect. She’s fighting to save her sister. She needs to keep the monster away and she’ll do everything in her power to keep her sister safe. She wasn’t expecting to meet Daws, the man who would change their lives. Dangerous, strong and completely hers, her heart never had a chance. Is Daws capable of protecting her from the monster who haunts her? The monster who will stop at nothing to get to her? He wants her back, that much is clear. She just hopes that when the time comes, she’s strong enough to save them all…. Please Note: This is the second book in the Wrecked series. It can be read as a stand alone and it is not necessary to have read Wreck You, however reading Wreck You first may give you some background to Daws. This book is intended for mature audiences as it has graphic scenes involving sex and child abuse. The use of the F bomb is frequently thrown around so if that offends you, I wouldn't recommend reading this.",
