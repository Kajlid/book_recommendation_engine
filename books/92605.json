  "description": "Since 1973 we have been told that a woman has the right to choose, but what if she doesn't? The Pew Foundation reported that the overall U.S. birthrate, which is the annual number of births per 1,000 women in the prime childbearing ages of fifteen to forty-four, declined eight percent over a three year period. The birthrate for U.S.-born women decreased by six percent during these years, but the birth rate for foreign-born women plunged fourteen percent. The birth rate for Mexican immigrant women fell even more, by twenty-three percent. The reasons for this drop are widely debated. The advantage of fiction is that it allows an individual to ask the question “What if” and an author can take this kernel of truth and weave a tale that is admittedly wildly speculative, totally unsubstantiated and pure fiction. Still, it could have happened this way, we just don’t know. But somebody knows, somebody knows everything.",
