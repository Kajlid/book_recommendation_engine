  "description": "Even though Melody Dover has always wanted a house, she is not excited about moving to a new state to get one. But when she stumbles across an extraordinary sandcastle on the beach near her home, everything changes. Built by people who sail around the world building such places, the sandcastle gives Melody a chance to see a world unlike anything she has ever known. Accidentally shrunk down to size by a young apprentice, she is quickly welcomed by the builders, and is enchanted by their carefree, almost magical ways and strange way of seeing the world. When a storm approaches and the castle faces inevitable doom, Melody chooses to join them on their ship bound for new lands. The fierce waves and dangerous games the people play on the water, including chasing sharks, make Melody feel a little uneasy about her decision. But as she grows more homesick, she also faces the difficult decision of which home is really the one with her family, or the familiar one she left behind. Filled with adventure, danger, and magic, “The Sandcastle People” will take young readers on an unforgettable voyage through the unfamiliar, from a magnificent sandcastle to the treacherous oceans, all the way up to the stars.",
