  "title": "Full Circle: A South American Journey",
  "description": "Full Circle invites us to accompany Chilean writer Luis Sepulvéda on a \"journey without a fixed itinerary\". Whatever his subject - brutalities suffered under Pinochet's dictatorship, sleepy tropical towns visited in exile, or the landscapes of legendary Patagonia - Sepulvéda is an unflinchingly honest yet lyrical toryteller. extravagant characters and extraordinary situations are memorably evoked: gauchos organising a tournament of lies, a scheming heiress on the lookout for a husband, a pilot with a corpse on board his plane... Part autobiography, part travel memoir, Full Circle brings us the distinctive voice of one of South America's most compelling writers",
