When a crazy encounter at a new bar ends with bodies littering the ground, Lana wonders if she may have discovered a path that leads to answers she desperately needs.Never one to walk blind, she treads carefully. What she finds is more than she ever hoped for. Lana knew she wasn't human, but an entire community of others like herself blows her mind. And the men! Heat and passion burn bright when Valan men are on the hunt for their mate, but Lana never expected to be the spark for two of their hottest playboys. More than ready to sizzle with the alphas of Valan, Lana does what she always does. She dives right in.*Intended for readers 18+**Originally published in TAMING THE ALPHA*",
