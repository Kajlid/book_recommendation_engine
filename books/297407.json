  "description": "Saga of the Borodins, one of the families who for centuries steered the golden destiny of Russia, amid the fabled Court of the Tsars. The dynasty that rode high to the crest of power-only to reach the brink of a rebel-torn New Age. Prince Peter: the unbending heir to the tempest of change. Ilona: the heartstrong Princess, slave to a renegade passion. George: the roving American journalist, tied to the great family's fortunes. Tatiana: the wildest young beauty in a restless hour. Bound by pride , the Borodins must stand against the fated forces that threaten their priceless birthright and the dark-eyed monk who holds their monarch in thrall. A story of the longings of a people stirred by the false promises of unscrupulous men, and struggle to uplift the silken banner of their fragile world.",
