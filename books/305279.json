  "description": "My mom had a bad habit.  And that bad habit was men.  They're like her own personal form of crack and she never wastes anytime getting through her stash.  I don't know if it's intentional, but she smokes them up and bleeds them dry until there is nothing left. Each and every one of them.  Then she'll move onto her next victim... making sure she drags me along for the ride too.  Only this time she's made the wrong move and now I'm forced to live with the Devil himself.  My new stepbrother hates me.  He's not shy in showing me how much he detests me either.  I never thought I'd wish for my mom to hurry up and bleed her new guy dry, but right now that day can't come soon enough.",
