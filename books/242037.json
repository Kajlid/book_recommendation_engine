  "description": "Kaylee looked at her hands. No, not hands. Claws. She had claws. “What am I?” “You’re a freak. An abomination. You never should have existed.”  For Kaylee Richards, starting high school is hard enough. Growing dragon scales and blasting her date with lightning just makes it that much harder. But when the creep pulls a sword on her, what’s a girl to do?  Turns out Kaylee is a dragon-kin, a half dragon/half human with the rare power to summon storms. The problem? She’s attracted the wrong kind of attention: Slayers, an ancient order dedicated to eradicating all dragon-kin. They’re planning something big. Something deadly. And they need Kaylee to do it.  But Kaylee isn’t alone. She has her martial arts-wielding best friend, a bumbling wizard, and his hot, air-headed Protector by her side. Together they’ll try to stop the Slayers before their plans are complete. Or they’ll die trying. But hopefully not.  Ready for a young adult urban fantasy full of magic, wizards, dragon (kins) and romance?",
