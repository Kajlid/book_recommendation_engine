  "description": "Memoria of a Heart is a collection of poetry and illustrations about the journey of a heart through grief, each poem describing emotions and feelings disturbing the balance in the mind and soul during toxic relationships. It is not particularly about one person or a specific kind of relationship. It is about the mixture of emotions that anyone can relate to and the internal struggles during hardships.Divided in 5 parts - each representing a stage of grief - it voices the pain and restlessness when experiencing the loss of a loved one, either alive or dead.This is for every heart that has their memories torturing them and fights the dark that is sucking them in. May the sun shine upon you once again.",
