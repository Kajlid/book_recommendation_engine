  "description": "At 21 years old, Symone Holmes has finally transitioned into the second phase of her life, adulthood. As the WNBA's top prospect coming out of college and with the love of her life by her side, Symone is ready to start living her dreams without delay. However, her mother's continued disapproval of her sexuality still casts a dark shadow over Symone's spirit. When an unexpected family tragedy occurs, Symone faces a major decision: put her plans of stardom on hold and confront obstacles that have kept her fenced out of her mother's life or continue on a path to basketball greatness and remain the black sheep of the family. The decision will not be an easy one and regardless of which path she takes there are serious downsides in the midst. If she forgoes her rookie year as a professional basketball player, there is a chance she will not get a second opportunity to live out her dream. However, if she does pursue her career first, she may resent the one thing she loves - basketball - and lose the only chance she has to reconcile with her family.",
