  "description": "Brandon’s trying his best to play it cool. He figures if no one knows he’s a total amateur, he’ll go a lot further in adult entertainment than a nervous newbie. Touchy about being short and pretty, he’s fierce in his independence and determined to become a hot commodity.He didn’t count on two of twentysomethingtwinks.com’s top studs swooping down and claiming him for their own. Gabriel and Dylan, notorious for their intense sex scenes and passionate relationship off-screen, decide they want Brandon as their third in a permanent ménage.Now, all they have to do is convince him. And if a guy’s been working in adult entertainment for any time at all, he knows more than a few mighty pleasant ways to coax a man over to the dark side -- and right into the middle.",
