  "title": "The Road Not Taken and Other Poems",
  "description": "\"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.\"These deceptively simple lines from the title poem of this collection suggest Robert Frost at his most representative: the language is simple, clear and colloquial, yet dense with meaning and wider significance. Drawing upon everyday incidents, common situations and rural imagery, Frost fashioned poetry of great lyrical beauty and potent symbolism. Originally published in 1916 under the title Mountain Interval.",
