  "description": "Murder by the Book Betsy Brannon Green Small-town librarian Kennedy Killingsworth thought that Midway, Georgia, was the dullest place on earth until a fateful day that begins with a speeding ticket and ends with a suicide. The ticket comes from Kennedy's ex-husband, Deputy Cade Burrell, who seems desperate to find any reason to talk to Kennedy ever since his scandalous affair. And the suicide victim is Foster Scoggins, the leathery-faced resident who applied for a library card just hours before his gruesome death. Rumors fly that Foster took his life after being jilted by a mysterious love interest. But as the investigation unfolds, murder becomes the name of the game, and anyone might be a player including the four men who recently started competing for Kennedy's attention. Could the killer be Cade, who s been more interested in her since the divorce than he ever was when they were married? Drake Langston, the dazzling billionaire who needed Foster's cooperation to land a major development deal? Drake's construction boss, Sloan, whose powerful build makes him a perfect suspect for the crime? Or could it be Luke Scoggins Foster's hazel-eyed nephew, the charming ex-Marine whom Kennedy just might be falling for? In Murder by the Book, celebrated suspense novelist Betsy Brannon Green skillfully weaves a rich tale of intrigue and romance in a Southern town that, for the time being is anthing but dull.",
