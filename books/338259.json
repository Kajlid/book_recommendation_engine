  "description": "Blood calls to blood and brings revelation…when nothing is as it seems can even magic untangle the mysteries of a supernatural clan?The perils of power…Keira Kelly has come into her full powers, and they are frighteningly strong, creating a distance between her and her human friends in her beloved Rio Seco. It is time to obey her great-grandmother Gigi’s orders, and rejoin her family in northwest Canada, where Keira can learn to handle her dangerous new skills. She’ll have friends with her every step of the way—her shapeshifter brother Tucker, his beloved Niko, and, to Keira’s dismay, her cousin on her mother’s side, Daffyd ap Geraint, the Sidhe prince who suddenly appeared in her life and now refuses to leave—but her vampire lover Adam has insisted on staying in Texas. And while there are certainly perks to being Family, such as a private Lear jet for the flight to Canada, and a fabulous penthouse condo overlooking Vancouver, there are threats looming that nobody, not even Gigi, has anticipated. Keira’s Sidhe inheritance from her mother is far more important than anyone ever realized, and the fate of the Clan may depend upon what she does….",
