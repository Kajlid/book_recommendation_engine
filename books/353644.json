In response to overwhelming requests from readers who wanted to know how they, too, could weather downturns, he has distilled his lessons into fifteen meaningful lessons, 路 Leap...With Sometimes it pays to leap without looking and say yes without thinking (Gill accepted the Starbucks job immediately, on a whim).路 Let Yourself...Be Pride is even more paralyzing than fear.路 Look...with Respect at Every Individual You Gill was raised to avoid eye contact with those who were different, cloistered in a privileged world. Now he realizes the potential in all who cross his daily path.路 Lose...Your Watch (and Cell Phone and PDA!): Our obsession with productivity produces madness, not gladness.Offering living proof that extraordinary happiness is found in ordinary moments, How to Save Your Own Life provides empowering words and hope for anyone facing a reversal of fortune.
