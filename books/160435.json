  "description": "No birth announcement could top the headlines from the day Janie and Jack Perkins entered the world. As twins born to a mother in a coma―courtesy of a bullet from their father―the sensational story of their birth never quite died down. While Jack still craves the flash of a camera, Janie seeks sanctuary behind the lens―as a crime scene photographer. Thanks to Janie’s line of work, she’s comfortable around gruesome murders. But when old photos of her mother’s body arrive in the mail, they open deep-seated wounds and raise chilling new questions about who was really responsible for that deadly night. Did Janie’s father spend decades in jail as an innocent man? Did an infamous serial killer actually take her mother’s life? With photos in hand, Janie brings the truth into focus. But when her investigation ends up invoking the wrath of the long-dormant killer, she must race to piece together the final evidence―before she becomes the target.
