  "description": "\"The Butterfield Overland Mail carried passengers and mail west from St. Louis to San Francisco through Texas from 1857 into the early 1860s. Used by soldiers, emigrants, freighters, and stagecoaches, the Overland Mail Road was the nineteenth-century equivalent of the modern interstate highway system, stimulating passenger traffic, commercial freighting, and business. Through extensive archival research and archaeological fieldwork, Ely focuses on the route's affect on West Texas and the role of the military in protecting the stage from attacks by bandits and Native Americans\"--Provided by publisher.",
