  "title": "Gathering of Cans",
  "description": "In this moving story, the reader will sense an air of greedy anticipation as it reveals particular aluminum cans that 56-year-old Zoie Baker gathers along the rural roads to raise the money to build a swimming pool for the children of her community. During this quest, the reader will find a story connected to special a gold Budweiser can, a green Mountain Dew can, a Santa Claus Coca-Cola can, and a NEHI can. With each special can, the reader will be going on another special journey with Zoie; from the romantic but turbulent time of World War II, through the tumultuous decade of the 1960's; and ending with Zoie gathering cans during the 1980's. There is magic, not just because of the wondrous characters, but also the friendships formed and the joys and the sorrows realized by each unique character.",
