  "description": "The classic queer story of Auntie Mame gets a Gen Z update in this bubbly tale of coming-of-age and finding chosen family. 17-year-old Isaac is feeling suffocated by his conservative Arizona suburb and his parentsâ€™ megachurch Christianity. But then he gets tutored by brilliant, free-spirited, and unapologetically queer college student Rachel, who helps Isaac come to terms with his own identity and introduces him to the sparkling and magical community that orbits around her and her ramshackle off-campus house. With the help of Rachel and her chosen family -- including her childhood best friend Johnny and sorority girl-turned-aspiring drag queen Vera -- Isaac will get an education unlike any other.",
