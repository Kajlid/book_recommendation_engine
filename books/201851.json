  "description": "DUET FOR THE DEVIL is a brutal and grim tale of The Zodiac Killer, serial slayers, drugs, dark gods, black magicks, detectives, and a dog-a road trip to oblivion. You've never read a hardboiled crime/erotic horror novel anything like this before- DUET FOR THE DEVIL completely redefines the meaning of extreme...and shatters, once and for all, the perceived limits of hardcore horror...Excerpted from Duet for the Devil by T. Winter-Damon & \"Is it gross? Hell, yes. It's grosser than anything I've ever written or ever read... It's a fictional foray into the purview of some of the things that most cause us to wonder about what we-as a society-are giving birth to... Serial-murder, sexual dementia, undiluted sociopathy, violence as pasttime...and all the other details of the darkest trimmings of the human heart... It delves into taboos so mind-boggling that the likes of Richard Ramirez and Richard Speck would be jealous, and it does so with an eagerness of vision and an energy to offend. I welcome this, because that which offends us also provokes us...to think. \"It's a piece of ultimately wicked art. PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER meets L.A. CONFIDENTIAL meets ANGEL HEART.\"- Edward Lee, from the introduction to DUET FOR THE DEVIL",
