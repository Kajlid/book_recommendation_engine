  "description": "Vivian Faber plays the diligent eighteen-year-old student during the day, but at night she is one of many “Swing Kids”––rebellious teenagers who partake in the illegal support of swing clubs. When a young Nazi soldier begins to take an interest in Vivian, her façade begins to crumble, and keeping her dangerous nighttime activities from colliding with the security of her mundane life becomes much more difficult––not to mention precarious—than ever before. Eager fascination becomes a struggle between the fresh and fragile relationship with the friend who has loved her for years, and the blue-eyed stranger she can’t seem to get out of her head. Soon, she starts to realize that there may be a connection between the soldier and the disturbing murder of her friend’s sister, Alice, leaving her to wonder what secrets truly lie hidden beneath those enticing blue eyes… Love can be a deadly thing.",
