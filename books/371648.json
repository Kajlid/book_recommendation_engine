Today, the world is sending out conflicting signals about what it means to be a man. Many men are questioning who they are and what roles they fulfill in life––as men, fathers, and husbands. This uncertainty is disrupting their personal and professional lives, leaving them frustrated and causing them to live far below their potential. It is creating cracks in the foundation of society. Best–selling author Myles Munroe examines cultural attitudes toward men and discusses the purpose God has given them. Discover the destiny and potential of the man as he was meant to be.",
