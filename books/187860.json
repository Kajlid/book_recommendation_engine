  "description": "This new play follows Íñigo (Ignatius of Loyola) from ambitious, hot-headed, street-fighting sensualist to his co-founding, with a radical group of young friends, the Society of Jesus in the 1700s. In Moore's bold, visceral, funny and poetic play, he asserts Loyola's position as countercultural radical. This is a timely exploration of one of history's major spiritual leaders and reformers.",
