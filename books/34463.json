  "description": "Joey Bettany's last term at the Chalet School proves to be an unforgettable one. First, there is the opening of the new house and a bitter quarrel with its new matron. Then the naughty Middles play a midnight hoax that backfires. There's a wild storm and a glorious picnic party before the term finally ends with an hilarious concert given by the newly formed and quite unmusical St. Clare's Orchestra.",
