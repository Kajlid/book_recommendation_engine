Throughout history, the Guardians, a genderless offshoot of the fairies, have entrusted a select few humans with a precious gift: a guardian bell. After an unwelcome exile from their homeland, the Guardians are forbidden any future contact with humans. With the arrival of aeronautics, the Guardian's love of everything technological made it inevitable that their presence would become known. The guardians were soon known as \"gremlins\" blamed for every mishap, although the opposite was really the case. A group of guardians break the rules and forge a friendship with an RCAF air force pilot, resulting in an epic journey and the birth of a legend. This re-telling of a legend, well loved by motorcycle enthusiasts, will enchant readers of all ages.",
