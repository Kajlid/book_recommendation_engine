  "description": "Manporium. It's where women of The Future go to buy the men of their dreams...and where twice-widowed Noelle Lytton is going to buy the third man of her dreams. Like a child crafting a Christmas wish list and checking it twice, Noelle has poured every last measure of hope into the traits she's selected to make up her third husband. She's checked her list more than twice, weighed it against past mistakes and future anticipations, and as she uploads her life's savings to pay the balance, she knows it's this man or nothing.Sometimes things don't go quite as expected at Manporium, however, and a bride's wish list is, er...subject to interpretation. A man might, for example, come out smelling like gingerbread cookies and possessing extra appendages. All of which Noelle discovers as she comes to terms with the husband who, despite mistakes, is everything she wanted and much, much more.Word Count: 41,097",
