  "description": "Sometimes the only thing a girl needs is a throbbing, thumping motorcycle clenched between her knees. Other times, she’d prefer a gentleman in the same place. Or, what the hell, who says he needs to be a gentleman?  Mali Alexandra has the first part of that down pat. She’s a little rough around the edges, and her job as a night-time security guard isn’t enough. She might not know exactly what she wants, but why not start with the whole ‘gentleman’ thing? The bike she has, but Mali figures she might like trying a different sort of ride.  Ahem.  Sometimes, all a werewolf wants to do is howl at the moon then drink a bunch of beer and fight until the sun comes up.  Jake Danniken’s the kind of werewolf with a case of wanderlust even bigger than his very respectable biceps. He’s never found a place to call home. But when his brother, the alpha of shifter-filled Jamesburg, needs his help with a bunch of bikers causing trouble in his neck of the woods, Jake ain’t gonna let him down.  After a long, lonely ride, Jake finds his marks. The mangy pack’s got a girl surrounded, and it looks like they aren’t being too friendly. Instinct takes over. It’s a bloody fight, but Jake’s biggest surprise isn’t that he survived... it’s that in the space of four breaths, he’s fallen in love.  With a human. It ain't ever easy, is it?  With any luck, the unlikely pair will make it out alive, and with a little more? They’ll have a chance to see what life can really taste like before they’re both ripped apart.  ***Each book in the JAMESBURG SHIFTERS series is completely standalone and features a HEA ending***",
