  "title": "Make Your Dreams Bigger Than Your Memories: Don't Let Your Past Keep You from Your Future",
  "description": "We all have a past. We have all made mistakes and done things we wish we had not done. We all wish we could just push a delete button on some of the choices we made yesterday and some of the things we have experienced years ago. What is more, our past has a way of shaping who we are today. It is amazing how one single dramatic experience of rejection in childhood can last through adulthood and forever alter our self image or how one bad decision in college can overshadow the dreams of the future, even God given dreams. The author knows that past hurts (whether brought on by someone else or our choice to sin) can undermine us. Raised a church kid, she knew all about sin, but made the mistakes anyway. She learned firsthand that it is not until we truly get a revelation of who we are in Christ and apply it to our lives, that our past can be erased and our dreams become real again. Terri Savelle Foy shows how we can let go of our past, change our self image and confidently move into a future with hope.",
