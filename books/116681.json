Remembrance of the pain felt and heart shattered has left Gracie wary of Daman's determination to break down the walls he once lived inside. But Daman is determined. And he will stop at nothing to prove to Gracie that they are meant to be. In the end, two souls will have to heal together or stand alone forever.  For the past six years Gracie has been in Vancouver for school. But a job offer she can't refuse has her moving back to the city, and man, she thought she left behind forever. Despite her attempts to keep Daman at arms reach, she finds their relationship progressing and her love for him blooming. Can Gracie trust in Daman the way she once had? Or will their past forever stand in the way?",
