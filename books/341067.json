  "description": "The ghost of Christmas Past... If Charles prefers leather to tinsel, that's okay. Nicky is still sure he can teach his master to love Christmas with the aid of a perfect gift. Just because Charles doesn't see any point in making a fuss about Christmas, that doesn't mean he can't tolerate Nicky's passion for tinsel and holly. He's never forbidden his pet from enjoying any of his Christmas traditions and he thinks that's enough. Nicky has one ambition to give his master a perfect Christmas. He's willing to do anything to make that happen even if it means taking risks and asking his master for special privileges - even if it means inviting a third man into their bed. The Spirit of Christmas Past isn't used to visiting Christmases that involve quite so much nudity, passion or kinky sex. Leading a dominant man like Charles through the Christmases isn't easy and keeping his eyes off the frequently naked Nicky is impossible. Still, all the spirit can do is enjoy the show because his job is to bring lovers together and fade away inconspicuously. That's the plan. However, if someone suddenly wants to thank him, who is he to say no? This story has a hot male gay menage scene and some BDSM play.\"",
