  "title": "Remember Your Rubbers!: Collectible Condom Containers",
  "description": "This book is indeed a \"first.\" A few rubber tins have made cameo appearances in past publications but this is the premier book exclusively about rubber containers-most of which have never been pictured before. Try this on your coffee table and you'll have a fun conversation piece-a trifle naughty but respectable! You and your friends can share hours of enjoyment getting to know about one of the hottest collectibles ever to hit the antique advertising scene! Buying Remember Your Rubbers! can save you money, perhaps many times the price of the book. You'll learn which brands are rare and which are not. You'll know enough not to spend a fortune on a \"Deans Peacocks\" (the \"Prince Albert of rubber tins\") as well as not to pass on a one-of-a-kind like the \"Rainbow,\" both incidentally from the same company!",
