  "description": "Great comedy at a great value! This gift set gathers three timeless Carlin recordings including two Grammy® winners, plus an interview from public radio’s Fresh Air.If one George Carlin audio is funny, then two are funnier and three must be funniest, right? That’s our thinking behind this collection. This laugh-out-loud program includes:Brain Droppings • 2001 Grammy® winnerAcerbic observations, manic musings, in-your-face questions, witty word play, and more “droppings” from Carlin’s singular brain. “I put a dollar in a change machine. Nothing changed.” “Why are there no recreational drugs taken in suppository form?”Napalm & Silly Putty • 2002 Grammy® winnerCarlin invents Past-Tense TV (“Got Smart,” “Father Knew Best,” “It Was Left to Beaver”), crusades for the Center for Research into the Heebie Jeebies, and suggests that “if the shoe fits, get another just like it.”More Napalm & Silly PuttyEverything that wouldn’t fit on the first Napalm recording—like “A Day in the Life of Henry VIII,” “Sports Should Be Fixed,” and candid takes on life’s little moments (“I’m beyond the nice day”), all delivered with wicked glee.Plus a bonus interview from Fresh Air.",
