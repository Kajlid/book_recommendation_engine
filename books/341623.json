As she struggles with the guilt over her husband's suicide, Merle's gut-wrenching quest for redemption takes her on a downward spiral into a hell of her own making. Resigned to a life of self-mutilation, abuse, and despair, will she find hope in a mysterious stranger, or will she die, entangled in a sadistic relationship with her husband's best friend. A story of death and renewal, of love lost, and of salvation found in the most unlikely of places, The Kissing Room is the story of two hearts united in cruelty and pain who have only to look to each other for hope.",
