  "description": "A smidge under three feet tall and a fetching shade of asparagus green, Digsby Greenholme is a gremlock. What he’s not, however, is Head of the Department of Exceptional Paper Snippets at Hiddenwyck Public Library--not anymore, anyway.Secluded in his house with only Want Ads and his trusty dog Winston for consolation, it isn’t long before a sublimely exciting opportunity literally unfolds in the gremlock’s lap: the chance to become a bodyguard. The gremlock’s first assignment is watching over Theo, Wyatt, and Marigold Chipping, the children of Hiddenwyck’s newest arrivals.There’s just one problem, however…You see, Digsby Greenholme despises children.To make matters worse, the lovely and unusual hamlet of Hiddenwyck has become plagued by the wicked deeds of a serial kidnapper, and children are vanishing from under the townspeople’s noses.Without warning, Digsby, Theo, Wyatt, and Marigold are pulled into a series of events that will plunge them into a world of darkness and dangers, and acquaint them with villains that hide beneath the surface of the town—the town Digsby thought he knew so well… and will have to act fast to save.",
