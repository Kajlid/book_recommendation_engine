  "description": "I lived my life by two principles: order and excellence.My moral compass steered me out of the backwoods of Tennessee and towards the woman I was destined to become, but not without gathering a few skeletons along the way.Eventually, I found success, but my restless, relentless nature still left me feeling unsatisfied.Then I met a ghost of a man, an enigma.At first, I was sure Daniello was a figment of my imagination, a beautiful and dangerous apparition with an animalistic hunger. He threatened my control and need for order, and in his absence, I became more haunted by my past.He wanted me submissive.I wanted to know him.But then my ghost met my skeletons.If you are not a fan of cursing, erotic and extremely explicit sex, immoral behavior, violence, dysfunction or sexual scenarios that may make you feel uncomfortable this is not the book for you.
