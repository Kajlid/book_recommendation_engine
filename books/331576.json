  "description": "Is it too much to ask for a whirlwind romance that sweeps me off my feet?I’m fed up with one-off scenes at the club. Online dating has become an endless conveyor belt of rejection. Enter Jax, the picture perfect friend with all the benefits I crave, and none of the drama I can’t stand.I’m used to fading into the background. Growing up as the middle child of seven siblings and now being the quiet one in my friend group, it’s easy to accept being overlooked. Never quite fitting in and never rocking the boat by demanding more than others care to give. But lately, I’ve been wanting more. More time with the family I love. Both the people that raised me and the folks I found at Adventures. More balance with my dream job before I find myself burnt out by thirty. More of everything, but I’d settle for a once in a lifetime romance.I want to be loved and cherished by a partner who can be both a tender caregiver for my little side, and a devious dom. One who leaves me filthy and debauched. I might be asking too much. Maybe the best I can hope for is getting all my kinky needs met with Jax. Should I hold out for a love connection when being in his bed makes me feel like I’m on top of the world, or will it all come crashing down when I can’t help but fall for him and his adorable dog?Picture Perfect is a kinky M/M romance between Jax, a genderqueer kink photographer who is not a daddy and Connor, a pierced trans boy who works for a nonprofit and just wants someone to love him. It includes sensation play, e-stim, figging, wax play, mild caregiver kink with a little who loves to get messy (sploshing), tentacle roleplay CNC, and oviposition.",
