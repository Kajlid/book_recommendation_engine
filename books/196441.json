  "description": "Everyone needs a hero. That’s what Detective Molly Masters tells me. “What we need,” she says, “what the whole world needs,” she pleads, “is a champion.” The only thing I want to talk about with Molly Masters is how I’d like to make her scream my name when I push her up against a wall, slide my hand up her thigh, and live out my wildest fantasies. “Someone who will fight against injustice,” she says. I’ll fight against anything you want, honey. Just come a little closer. “Someone who will stand tall in the face of adversity,” she says. I’ll do it standing, sitting, or lying down. See how easy I am? “Someone who believes in the value of a good deed,” she says. I believe in the value of me, sweetheart. Because I’m Lincoln Wade. Jaded genius, obscenely wealthy, capable of violence, and looking for revenge. Molly Masters might have delusions of grandeur. She might see me as some superman capable of cleaning up the scum, filth, and corruption in Cathedral City. But I’m not the hero she’s looking for. I’m the dark alley where all her good intentions hide. So be careful what you wish for, Molly Masters. Because you’re about to get it.",
