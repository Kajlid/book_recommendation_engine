  "description": "“A landmark musical, one of those few shows that enter the permanent lore of the theatre by altering the vocabulary of dramatic possibilities.” – Time “There’s never been a franker, more sophisticated work written for the musical stage.” – San Francisco Examiner “With a deliberately episodic, painfully accurate book by George Furth and an unforgettable score by Stephen Sondheim, Company is a total reversal of the usual musical comedy format. It is rigorously unsentimental. It has the courage to be both bitter and honest about love and marriage.” –Kevin Kelly, Boston Globe A breakthrough Broadway musical in 1970, Company remains fresh, acerbic and original today. The musical’s themes—marriage and commitment, friendship and loneliness—and its innovations in form mark it as a landmark of modern American musical theatre. Company ’s 25 th anniversary was commemorated by two major in New York at the Roundabout Theatre Company and in London at the Donmar Warehouse. This edition incorporates all revisions and additions made for these productions.",
