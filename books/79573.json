  "description": "Julio Cardenas didn’t want to be a member of the Cartel, he’d rather make wood cabinets or work construction. But through a series of events he was next in line for the head position. Pam Burrows loved caring for the sick, and as a hospice care nurse she made sure her patients last days were comfortable and dignified. It never occurred to her that she had been denied her most important patient.On the best days, you’d never put these two together. They had contradicting points of view on life. One believed in saving life at all costs, the other – not so much. One valued honesty, the other believed truth should be couched in shades of gray. One believes in love, the other refuses to think long term. Nevertheless, they become the breath the other needs to survive, proving once again, everyone needs love. Even Bad Boys.",
