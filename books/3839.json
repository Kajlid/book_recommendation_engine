  "description": "Debbie Webly is terrified that she will lose Laura to the influence of Angie who is rich, beautiful, and the most popular girl in school. There’s not much Debbie won’t do to hang on to her friend, but will she cross some line that she can never come back from? And what about Brad? Does she even stand a chance with him? The challenges mount when Debbie is tempted to commit social suicide by taking up for Stephanie who is even more of an outcast than she is. When Angie makes a surprising move, Debbie finds out that true friendship is based on much more than looks or popularity.",
