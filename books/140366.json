Then again, she wasn't expecting to be swept into a world of high stakes racing and multi-million dollar horse flesh a few days later either.Alexandra Anderson is on the run from the law. When the thirteen year old orphan can run no further, she collapses at the gates of the prestigious racing and breeding farm, North Oak. Horse racing strikes a deep chord in her. She hears a higher calling in the jingle jangle of bit and stirrup and in the thunder of hooves in the turn for home. It tells her she has a place in the world. But when the racing headlines find her on the front of every sports page, she realizes North Oak is no longer a safe haven... or is it?",
