  "description": "Heartbroken after being abandoned by the mysterious Dom known as Beast, Phim is determined to move on. To forget the island and Beast, to pretend her professional submissive persona, Sapphire, never existed. Instead, when the cruel Dom known as Orion invades her gallery and shatters her anonymity, Phim must reluctantly seek shelter in the one place she swore never to visit again.  For months, Beast has sought Sapphire, frustrated by what he has been led to believe are her ever-escalating contract demands. Eager to reclaim his submissive, Beast returns to the island only to discover old rivalries and new dangers threaten his plans and Sapphireâ€™s safety. On an island designed for fantasy, the truth can be more dangerous than a secret, and two people drawn together can easily be torn apart.  Beast may not be the playboy Dom he appears to be, but neither is Sapphire a docile slave. To reclaim her Dom, Sapphire must reconcile submission with independence, the past with her future, and fantasy with reality.
