  "description": "Alynia Sky: The Beginning and the End is a whimsical coming-of-age story about Alynia, a thirteen-year-old girl and member of the Goodwind Tribe. Alynia shares a natural kinship with birds, from which she learns much. Her best friend and fishing companion is a rooster who provides comic relief. Unknown to anyone, this rooster is so much more than he seems. Inspired by an orphaned songbird, Alynia neglects her studies and responsibilities to daydream of flying. On the eve of her fourteenth birthday, she receives a vision to seek out Daybreak, the King of Birds, to ask him to teach her to fly. Unknown to Alynia, the vision has a much higher purpose. Alynia Sky: The Beginning and the End revolves around Alynia, her family, her tribespeople, and a variety of avian characters dealing with the events set in motion by an ancient race. It is the first installment in a young-adult fiction series that deals with the issues of gender equality and social justice.",
