  "description": "Mena's life is complicated. She's just murdered and buried her husband, the local wolf pack's alpha - problem number one. Phoenix, the High Vampire, is the one her heart beats for, but not the one her wolf wants - problem number two. Her wolf pines for Alex, the human homicide detective who might just send her down for murder - three. Four, wolves and vampires don't mix. Five, she has no clue how to be alpha, keep her pack safe while fighting off challengers with every step she takes, or what it would take to tame her wolf, which is the biggest problem of them all. Because the beast might just forfeit Mena's life when its insatiable thirst for blood is unleashed on the world in just a few short days, with the next full moon.Which should be doable. Except for the Nexus... and the little extra problem of bonding with a stranger.",
