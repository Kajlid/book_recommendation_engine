  "description": "When her brother was alive, Elyse Korbin used to live for Halloween. Now, at the age of fourteen, she finds it hard to live for anything. A year after piano prodigy Patrick Korbin’s untimely death by trick-or-treating, Elyse feels more lost than ever; school in Bootville is a drag, her parents have lost their minds with grief, and her best friend, Will Castle, is probably in love with her. Nothing seems to matter until the discovery of an ancient text filled with bizarre markings pulls Elyse from her mourning gloom and pushes her into a night of chilling adventure. With the help of her fellow misfits, Will and the mildly-autistic Colin Niemann, the violin-slinging Elyse decodes the spidery encryption and discovers the uncanny ability to summon Patrick’s ghost from beyond the grave with her rare musical gifts. Her brother seems to relish his newly-undead status, but their tampering with the barrier between life and the death has brought back an unspeakable evil: Colonel Spicy Jack Cavendish, the legendary boogeyman whose fury almost destroyed Bootville during the Revolutionary War. As Spicy Jack and his fire-spewing pumpkin-lantern sidekick bumble their way through the modern world, Elyse and her friends must seek the assistance of a gallery of eccentric town characters from both the present and the past in a race to unravel the mystery of Bootville’s dark history, and thwart the Colonel’s sinister plans to finish the job he started centuries ago…",
