  "description": "Seven years ago, Ava Murdoch’s world collapsed and left her devastated. Now, she spends her days helping those who’ve suffered the same fate, and her nights longing for what she can never have—a normal life. Haunted by nightmares and invisible scars, she is unable to form a relationship with any man.Then she met him.Kirk Lombardo’s world is anything but ordinary. As drummer for alternative rock band Blind Man’s Alibi, Kirk has known nothing but success and fame. But fame is vacuous, and being a rock god is highly over-rated. Especially when devastating loss taints his world not once, but twice, leaving him with no one to help ease the pain and anger. Until he met her.The last person Ava ever imagined she’d feel safe around is a tattooed, irresistible rocker with hypnotic eyes. But something about Kirk calls to her, promising an end to her nightmares and a happiness she’s never dared dream of.",
