  "description": "Eleven years ago, Phineas T. Pimiscule rescued his nephew Sky Weathers in the town of Exile. Since then, Sky studied traps, puzzles, science, and the secret lore of the Hunters of Legend, believing it all a game, while his parent and uncle sacrificed to hide him. On the eve of Sky's twelfth birthday and his family's return to Exile, Phineas disappears. To find him, Sky joins ragtag teen monster hunters whose weapons are made out of garbage and know even less than he does. If Sky can't solve the riddles his uncle left for him within two days, Exile will burn. Who is Sky and why does everyone want to kill him?",
