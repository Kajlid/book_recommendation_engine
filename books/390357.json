  "description": "Winner of the New England Book Award for Fiction and a New York Times Editors’ Choice, Lily King’s masterful third novel received glowing critical praise upon its initial publication and is poised to make an even bigger splash in paperback.Gardiner Amory is a New England WASP who’s beginning to feel the cracks in his empire. Nixon is being impeached, his wife is leaving him, and his worldview is rapidly becoming outdated. His daughter, Daley, has spent the first eleven years of her life negotiating her parents’ conflicting the liberal, socially committed realm of her mother and the conservative, decadent, liquor-soaked life of her father. But when they divorce, and Gardiner’s basest impulses are unleashed, the chasm quickly widens and Daley is stretched thinly across it.As she reaches adulthood, Daley rejects the narrow world that nourished her father’s fears and prejudices, and embarks on her own life—until he hits rock bottom. Lured home by the dream of getting her father sober, Daley risks everything she’s found beyond him, including her new love, Jonathan, in an attempt to repair a trust broken years ago.",
