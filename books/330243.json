  "description": "Chase Andrews.The Kingsmen’s top tight end.My brother’s friend and teammate.My new neighbor.The grumpy to my sunshine.But underneath that grumpy exterior, there’s so much more.Chase likes to pretend nothing affects him, but I’ve seen glimpses of his other side in the time we’ve spent together.And the more we get to know each other, the more I’m falling for him.Under normal circumstances, this would be great. Except my hyper-protective big brother thinks no man is good enough for me, and my ex-fiancé is trying to win me back.One charming, seemingly good man already broke my heart. Am I stupid to give a self-confessed relationship-adverse football player a chance to break it a second time?",
