  "description": "Where do the tactics, strategies, and lifestyles of today's activists come from? Many ways of doing radical politics pioneered by Movement for a New Society in the 1970s and 1980s have become central to anti-authoritarian social consensus decision making, spokescouncils, communal living, unlearning oppressive behavior, and co-operatively owned businesses. Andrew Cornell's important contribution to US political history uses this story to raise crucial questions for activists today. Oppose and Propose is an engaging and accessible study, every page offers new insights. Andrew Cornell 's work appears in Letters from Young Activists and The University Against Itself . He helps produce the quarterly anti-capitalist magazine Left Turn .",
