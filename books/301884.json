  "description": "WHEN A PURITAN MISS DISCOVERS THE JOYS OF CHRISTMAS, LOVE'S AS NEAR AS THE MISTLETOE.The Davenport sisters were alone, without even a dour-faced maid to supervise their strict puritanical devotions. Then the elder, flame-haired Gillian, boldly decided it was high time they let their hair down. So, with the help of a kindly relation, the two daring misses exchanged their somber attire for modish gowns and hairstyles that would surely give their parents apoplexy! But the best was yet to come: plum pudding, eggnog, carols, and a most breathtaking tree. The Davenport sisters reveled in the rituals of Christmas --- and in the selection of handsome gentlemen who decorated the festivities! But when Gillian was caught under the mistletoe by Lord Ranger Marden, she discovered things her mother had never dreamed of telling her!",
