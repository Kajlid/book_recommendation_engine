  "description": "For two hundred years the five kingdoms have lived separately. To keep the balance, no inhabitants are allowed to cross into another kingdom. To do so is to be charged as a spy...  At only thirteen, Princess Amelie of Candor developed the powers of persuasion - she can seduce men to do her bidding. Unable to suppress her magic and affecting the males in the palace, she is sent away to live in a small convent of nuns. Time and seclusion eventually has rumors circulating around the princess's disappearance. It isn't until years later when assassination attempts threaten the royal family that she is brought back in secret to use her unusual skills to gather information. Her mission sends her into dangerous territory: into the neighboring kingdom of Draeden. A run-in with one of their princes results in her capture and she is taken in to Draeden's palace to stand trial. But there's a lot more on the line than she could have ever known. Somewhere along the way she falls for the prince and her heart, which she never thought could beat for someone else, is suddenly her biggest risk of all.  Prince Seth has been immune to magic since he was young which suits him because he dwells in the kingdom of Draeden where powers are forbidden. Even so, when he learns that underground mages in his kingdom are disappearing, he and a band of his soldiers are determined to investigate. When he stumbles across a spy from Candor with the power to seduce men, her magic has no affect on him. But underneath her magic - the woman he comes to know - reins him in with a power far greater than any mage could produce.  What becomes of two enemies that fall in love?",
