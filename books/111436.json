  "description": "An illustrated poetry collection based on the author's travels around Latin America. \"In these poems you see two cultures eyeing one another in equal parts of wonder, suspicion and delight; the beautiful scenery; the amazing wildlife; and the gruelling difficulties of being a stranger in a paradise that still requires passports, papers, pesos, and patience. A Paradise that is bit by bit being polluted by the great god globalisation.\" - Alan Gillott.Illustrated with black and white line drawings by Robbie Burns.",
