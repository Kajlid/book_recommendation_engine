  "description": "Three years and hundreds of bullets later, Orchard Close is holding together. The cabal dreams up more ways to get their latest group of gardeners and women of loose morals. Food production is a major concern, for the marts and for the enclaves. Caddi pushes Harold with his new games, taunting, testing and trying to figure out what makes him tick â€“ so he can exploit it. A common enemy, The General, smashes smaller enclaves, combines gangs and makes a wide sweep for control of the city, aligning the GOFS, Barbies and Orchard Close for their biggest fight yet. In this new world, only the strategic survive, but can they survive their temporary alliances?",
