  "title": "Lemon Gulch",
  "description": "Set in a small Southern Californian town in 1947, this story is told in the peculiarly haunting voice of a fat, love-starved, white trash homosexual twelve year old, who looks eighteen due to \"An acute hormonal unbalance of the highest order which has ran in our family for eons\". Danny lives in an often uncaring world amidst the comic torment of his relentless pubescence. His motto is\" Persons should be kind, all of them, explicitly we sissies which ain't able to defend theirselves\". Danny's desperate search for love and acceptance leads him through a series of comically bizarre adventures. Lemon Gulch is a darkly comic moral tale where kindness is rewarded and evil sternly punished.",
