  "title": "Jesus, Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible",
  "description": "The problems with the Bible that New Testament scholar Bart Ehrman discussed in his bestseller Misquoting Jesus —and on The Daily Show with John Stewart, NPR, and Dateline NBC, among others—are expanded upon exponentially in his latest book: Jesus, Interrupted. This New York Times bestseller reveals how books in the Bible were actually forged by later authors, and that the New Testament itself is riddled with contradictory claims about Jesus—information that scholars know… but the general public does not. If you enjoy the work of Elaine Pagels, Marcus Borg, John Dominic Crossan, and John Shelby Spong, you’ll find much to ponder in Jesus, Interrupted.",
