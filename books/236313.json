  "title": "Brother Bewitched",
  "description": "Mature and responsible, 17 year old Pattenia Denea has always felt her reckless and hard partying little brother got more attention, more praise and more love from her parents. Worse, he stands to inherit the throne and rule the Shattered Isles simply because he is a boy and she is a girl. The injustice of it all infuriates her, and her little brother, Serren, makes it worse by constantly mocking her young woman's life, flaunting his male privilege at every opportunity.  Then, a strange new girl arrives and offers Pattenia an opportunity to even the score: \"Use my magic to turn your brother into a girl,\" she says. \"Force him to wear dresses and live as a girl, while you seize the crown and rule in his stead.\"  Will Pattenia strip her brother of his name, his sex and his crown?  This is a PG-rated novel that explores what it means to be a boy or a girl. It includes portrayals of drinking, smoking and sex, as well as cross-dressing. Your librarian most certainly will NOT approve.",
