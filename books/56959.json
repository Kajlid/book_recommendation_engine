  "description": "Among the ton, innocent young Mary Seabrook is positively out of place. She'd rather go bird watching than go to a ball, and her embarrassing habit of speaking the truth gets her nothing but funny looks. If her peculiar behavior keeps up all Season, she may never find a man to marry.But when her bird-watching eyes catch sight of Lord Grayson, she sees right through his bad reputation to the intelligence and good humor beneath. Unfortunately, she can also see that danger follows Grayson at every turn, and that his many mishaps are more than mere coincidence. Someone wants him dead, but why? Could the kind Lord Grayson have something to hide after all?",
