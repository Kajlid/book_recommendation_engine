For millennia, the worlds lived in relative harmony. But once again the order has been shaken.On Corin, a prince’s courageous quest has released a ruthless demi-god that can bring the disgraced planet back to its former glory—or destroy it.On Earth, a young man is ripped across a universe he didn’t know existed and inextricably tied to an ancient conflict that he can’t begin to understand.And all the while, the immortal Siroco pursues his own mysterious ends.Who are the true heroes? Who is the Chosen One?Battles rage and families crumble in this second installment of Marvin Amazon’s mythic fantasy series, where once again the lines of right and wrong blur around the individual experience, and even the best of intentions cannot control a galaxy on the brink of destruction.",
