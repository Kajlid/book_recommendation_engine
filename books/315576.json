  "description": "We need to talk about your aim… For Callie Mcguire, love is that mysterious, magical thing you read about in books. It’s Darcy’s and Elizabeth Bennet’spassionate beautiful, bittersweet, and inspiring. And it’s entirely out of reach. Callie moved all the way to Chicago to find love, and it’s been failure after failure. Almost ready to give up on the notion, she stumbles across a new dating website with an incredible true love with a million-dollar satisfaction guarantee. Determined to make this her last attempt at finding her match, Callie signs up. When the results turn out to be nothing like she expected, she decides to call the whole thing off and abandon romance for a while. Little does she know that her decisions will send her life in a direction she never could have expected, and she’s forced to realize that perhaps Cupid has a little more influence in our love lives than we thought.",
