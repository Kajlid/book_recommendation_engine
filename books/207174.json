  "description": "From the acclaimed indie author, Eloisa J Campbell, comes the story of Sam Taylor. Sam is smart, beautiful and finding her way in a world that hasn't always been kind to her. Her journey into the real world of complicated relationships begins when she tries to help foster a better relationship between her husband, Marc, and her life-long best friend, Damian. The two men have never gotten along, and only seem to agree on one thing - they both love Sam; one as a friend, and the other as a husband. In Sam's quest to keep both men in her life she learns valuable lessons about love, friendship, marriage, and most importantly - herself. Is Sam right about the stability of her marriage to Marc? Is she right about the platonic nature of her friendship with Damian? Is it right to keep both men in her life? Is it fair to ask both men to get along? Sam finds herself in an unwitting triangle, and is forced to make some tough decisions along the way.",
