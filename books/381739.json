  "description": "Have you ever had a secret? Something so big and crazy that you probably would die before you told anyone else? Something that belonged to you and only you? That's what this book is about. I guess this is the story of my life. Well, not my whole life, writing about seventeen whole years seems kind of extreme for such a small book, that would take at least two thousand pages, but anyway. This is the story of the most life-changing epic eye-opening thing that has ever happened to me. It's called senior year of high school. If you want, you can join me as I recount all of the crazy stuff I did during that one month of January. It gets pretty interesting, believe me. Or you can read something else, I won't know, I'm just words on the back of some book. Yeah, so if you're still interested, read me please. Who knows, I might just let you in on a little secret.",
