  "description": "\"Flight to Landfall\" is an adventurous story set in the Dutch East Indies, Singapore and the inhospitable desert region of western Australia.However, it would be incorrect to call this book an adventure novel; in addition to the fascinating act and fascinating description of strange places, the reader will follow with increasing interest the character development of a number of people who, by chance circumstances, come together to fight for their existence and try to adapt to each other.An impressive and moving book.",
