  "description": "Three years ago, Joy Davis lost her best friend in the world. Since then, she's been going through the motions of life, and what’s worse is she knows it. As her thirtieth birthday looms, she finds herself an unmarried wallflower, surrounded each Sunday by young singles at church, and can feel her life slipping between her fingers one day at a time. Even her best friend’s widower, the man she’s been in love with forever, can’t remember her, so obviously something needs to change, and fast. When his Home Ward bishop tells Trevor Masters that he should join the Young Single Adults ward, at first he balks at the notion. Having lost his wife Hannah three years prior, and juggling a hectic work life and three young children, he still doesn’t feel ready to start dating. But what the Lord wants, He usually gets, and when Trevor starts to attend the new branch, he finds that true love can happen twice. But will Joy’s desire to do something useful with her own life end up getting in the way of the love she’s been waiting to find?",
