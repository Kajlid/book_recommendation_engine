Her nuanced analysis of intersecting systems of oppression goes deep to reveal the complicated truths of a multiply-marginalized experience.

She is both fearless and vulnerable, demanding and accountable. Hers is a voice like no other. \"One of the most provocative and insightful writers of our generation.\" -Aura Bogado, Colorlines \"A fierce voice among a generation of queer and trans folk of color.\" -Janet Mock, New York Times Bestselling Author of \"Redefining Realness\" \"Tough-love activism at its best-straightforward, challenging, whip-smart, and uncompromising.\" -Andi Zeisler, Bitch Magazine",
