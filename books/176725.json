  "description": "The Narratives series of works is a collection of short introspective essays written by an average guy in an effort to better understand himself, his life, and his relationship with the world around him while traveling the road of self-discovery. These works can best be described as the author's unique brand of journaling, encompassing both self-reflective entries, and an expression of thoughts and opinions surrounding social issues of the present day.The Anthology is a compilation of all four previously published Narratives works that were written over the course of two years, following the death of a loved one. The collection traces the author’s journey through the five stages of loss, his healing process, and the beginning of a new phase in his life. The highs and lows are pronounced and seep through in the writing, taking the reader on an emotional journey through moments of personal triumph and exhilaration, but also through moments of anger, sadness, and total despair. Each short essay style narrative touches on a particular personal or societal topic, but when taken as a whole, they are recognized as emotional stepping stones in the transformation of the author’s life. This book contains new material including a Forward section that details the history and genesis of the series, plus five new essays written post-volume four.The Anthology is the fifth volume in The Narratives series.",
