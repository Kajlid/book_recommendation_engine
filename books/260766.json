  "description": "A classic of patient empowerment, Peace, Love & Healing offered the revolutionary message that we have an innate ability to heal ourselves. Now proven by numerous scientific studies, the connection between our minds and our bodies has been increasingly accepted as fact throughout the mainstream medical community. In a new introduction, Dr. Bernie Siegel highligths current research on the relationships among consciousness, psychosocial factors, attitude and immune function. \"Love and peace of mind do protect us,\" Siegel writes. \"They allow us to overcome the problems that life hands us. They teach us to survive...to live now...to have the courage to confront each day.\"",
