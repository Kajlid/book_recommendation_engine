Aged eighteen, she's flunked school and spends her days lying in a darkened room, doing nothing. Finally, she is forced to get a job at Silver Birches Care Home.Once there, and after meeting the residents, particularly the feisty, no-nonsense Bobby, she settles in, appreciating how much history lies behind each person. A history she can read, in her own special way, via the touch of a hand.Alice is another resident, aged ninety-two, and mute. A woman who has always been institutionalised and is now near the end of days. It is she who intrigues Lottie the most, but whom she also fears. All she knows is something happened to make her the way she is, an event on Christmas Eve, way back, something truly terrible.Surely, she deserves peace, but if together they aren't brave enough to confront what lurks in the darkest recesses of her mind, she'll die in anguish.It's Christmas Eve again, 2023, and as Lottie is about to find out: not all ghosts are dead.",
