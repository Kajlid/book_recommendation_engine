  "description": "Young Kelly's mom doesn't understand about red. Sure, the brown mittens are warmer, but the red mitts make better snowballs. And the red boots aren't just for rain; they take bigger steps in any weather. And, yes, a red cup does make a difference... juice just doesn't taste as good in a green one. No doubt about it, red is best.Red is Best is the story of one toddler's obstinate color preference, an easily read aloud tale illustrated with simple child centered drawings and each page punctuated by red.",
