It wasn’t perfect; but it wasn’t awful. Then he died.After the grief took its course, and the reality of my life set in, I grew frustrated. It wasn’t the bills or the struggle to keep my interest in my work. It was life without a man – the only man I’d been with for twenty years. And before you go all feminist on me, it isn’t that I can’t be an independent woman, but there are certain areas where a man is necessary.You need a fuck buddy, my friend said. I didn’t even know what that meant.Is it friends with benefits?, I asked.Better, you don’t even have to be friends, she offered.Boy, did I need an education in the modern workings of dating, and sex.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++A coming-of-an-older-age novel. Something new from L.B. Dunbar -- a stand alone!",
