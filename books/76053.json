  "description": "The remaining days of Nick Alexander's life are numbered. Well, his college life. At this point, it doesn't seem like there's too much he's going to miss. Nothing cooking with girls or the job search, and his stand-up comedy career and weekly humor column in the school paper have pretty much plateaued. That's all about to change as he enters the final, and most interesting, semester of his life. Run-ins with the men's basketball team, a confusing web of girlfriends and fans, and an attempt to get a charity comedy show off the ground are just some of the adventures he faces while en route to graduation. Oh, and lest we forget trying to get a job, not alienate his friends, and decide if it's been worth the wait to talk to his crush (fine, obsession) since freshman year.",
