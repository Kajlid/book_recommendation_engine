  "description": "Barbara Ann Brennan continues her ground-breaking exploration of the human energy field, or aura—the source of our experience of health or illness. Drawing on many new developments in her teaching and practice, she shows how we can be empowered as both patients and healers to understand and work with our most fundamental healing the light that emerges from the very center of our humanity.In a unique approach that encourages a cooperative effort among healer, patient, and other health-care providers, Light Emerging explains what the healer perceives visually, audibly, and kinesthetically and how each of us can participate in every stage of the healing process.Presenting a fascinating range of research, from a paradigm of healing based on the science of holography to insights into the \"hara level\" and the \"core star,\" Light Emerging is at the leading edge of healing practice in our time.",
