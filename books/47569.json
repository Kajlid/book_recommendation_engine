  "title": "Feminist Ryan Gosling: Feminist Theory (as Imagined) from Your Favorite Sensitive Movie Dude",
  "description": "Based on the popular blog of the same name, Feminist Ryan Gosling pairs swoon-worthy photos of the sensitive, steamy actor with feminist theories to the delight of women (and more than a few of their mothers) everywhere.What started as a silly way for blogger Danielle Henderson and her classmates to keep track of the feminist theorists they were studying in class quickly turned into an overnight sensation. Packed with 100+ photos and captions throughout -- including the best \"Hey girl\" lines from the blog and 80 percent brand-new material -- this book is a must-have for feminists and fans of the actor alike. What more could a girl want? You know, besides gender equality and all that.",
