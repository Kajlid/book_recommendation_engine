  "description": "Inventors, pilots, tinkers, and soldiers; magical metals to replace an aging heart or a ruined limb; steam-powered fantasy worlds of clockwork nightingales, automatons, dirigibles, and men. The stories in this anthology visit diverse times in the history of modern man, and the men who populate these tales face war and cruelty, masters and autocrats, illness and poverty and greed. Yet the heat of romance outmatches even the steam engines, and time and again, the gears of love rule the day.Stories included The Clockwork Nightingale's Song by Amy Rae DurresonCaress by Eli EastonSwiftsilver by Bell EllisThe Clockwork Heart by Kim FieldingThe Galatea's Captain by Anka GraceScrews by R.D.
