  "description": "Every species on Earth has a survival strategy. Rabbits flee. Deer freeze. Grizzlies fight. And high-school junior Emily Ferris... well, she lies a little. It's just easier for everyone that way, especially her mom. So even if Emily hates the church they've started attending, thinks her stepdad is a dolt, and worries her mom is trying to disappear into a Good Housekeeping ad, she's making it work here in Pineridge.But then Sophie Williams joins the cross-country team. She's fierce, funny, and unlike anybody Emily has ever met. The closer she gets to Sophie, the more Emily has to hide: about her beliefs, about her whereabouts, about the girl she loves. But soon Emily discovers that the more you hide, the harder it is to keep moving forward.Long Steady Distance is a book about running, and family, and love, but mostly it's a book about how to keep going.",
