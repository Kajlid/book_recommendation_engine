  "description": "Troy Yeah, I got an attitude problem. So what? I’m a cocky, rich hockey player with more pucks than sense. A Game-player, a heart-breaker. I take what I want and never look back. I hadn’t expected in a million years to be back in this town. But hey, shit happens, especially when you got a temper like mine. My plan was to spend a season padding my stats and breaking in my mattress. I’d be out of here before the Zamboni finishes resurfacing the rink. Then one night Sasha fell into my arms. She’s been running through my mind ever since. She's changed something in me, that’s for sure. But will these changes last? Sasha Good girls shouldn’t fall for bad boys like Troy. I knew better. But I fell all the same. After losing my husband to the war I thought I’d never love again. My life revolves around family and running my own business. But life has a way of throwing a curve ball when you least expect it. Bumping into Troy was a chance encounter, two strangers passing in the night. A warm body to stave off the loneliness. I should have left it at that. But a one night stand turned into a string of secret, steamy rendezvous and I found my world spinning upside down. I want to believe he's the one, but I don't know. Am I making a big mistake? WILD NIGHTS is a Steamy Standalone Romance Novel with a Happy Ending (HEA)",
