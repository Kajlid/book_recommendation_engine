Strong to her core and with a mission of her own, Helena knows she doesn’t have to be their captive for long.However, despite all the terrible things she’s heard about these brutal beasts, Helena is overcome by intense desire for the one ruthless man who has taken her. As their passion escalates, Helena will have to trust in Tyr in order to save both what’s left of this desolate, torn-up world…and herself.",
