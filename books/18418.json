  "description": "When Alexandra Rafferty was a girl, something unspeakably cruel happened to her on a summer afternoon. Her father, a cop, knew about it, but nobody else did. Or so she thought. Now a forensic photographer for the Miami P.D., Alexandra remains haunted by that horrible day, and it colors all of her relationships. Stan, her emotionally estranged and loutish husband, drives a Brinks armored car and has his own mindbending agenda. Her now aging, not-altogether-there father is more and more dependent and less and less dependable. And her work photographing crime scenes has become a life-consuming obsession.Now Alexandra is about to get caught up in a gruesome series of rape/murders that seem to speak to her long-hidden past. But before she can understand the killer's message, her personal life spins out of control, sending Alexandra on the run -- from her husband, from the crooks after him, from a surprisingly persistent boyfriend, and from a killer who's bent on making sure Alexandra won't live long enough to translate his message.With this \"unputdownable\" crime novel, the author of Under Cover of Daylight and Red Sky at Night heads for bestsellerdom.",
