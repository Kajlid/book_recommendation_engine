  "description": "The daily misadventures of mischievous Belgian youngster Albert, as recounted in comic strip form by legendary ligne claire cartoonist Yves Chaland. The art of Yves Chaland ( Chaland Anthology - Freddy Lombard Vol. 1 & 2 ) tackles many different universes and genres. In the case of Young Albert, the author sarcastically explores intimate, everyday events in a largely autobiographical way. Mastering both art and writing skills in his short time on earth, Yves Chaland, is remembered as a genius who tragically left us to soon, but who thankfully gifted us a body of work that lives on as a major contributions to the world of comics.",
