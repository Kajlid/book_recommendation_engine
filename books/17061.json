  "title": "AmericA, Inc.: A Stage Play",
  "description": "Based upon dialogue from the stream-of-voice novel by Lentz written in 2007, with uncanny, prophetic accuracy in this dark comedy the USA has incorporated in 2020 into an oligarchy, or \"corpor-nation,\" headed by a President + CEO like Donald Trump. Sub-divided by a great, brick wall into the northern Bluefish and southern Redfish States, AmericA, Inc. is run by President Travis Bash. Perpetually at war, riddled by special interests and voracious for capital, Bash drafts Bob, a destitute Yale poet, to transform America, Inc.'s corporate culture. Bob's job is to market to voter-shareholders the vulgar, bewildering and corrupt culture of this brutal corporate dystopia to increase share value. Nothing is sacred in corporate America or American culture in this hilarious cautionary tale about an oligarchy gone berserk in its relentless pursuit of self-interest and profitability. In a blend of high and low comedy, AmericA, Inc. rings true in a witty, merciless lampoon of the omniscient intrusion of the savage greed of big business into culture, politics, law, religion and everyday life. Lentz innovates with an accessible, darkly comic script to bring characters to life onstage in satire. In AmericA, Inc. Lentz extends the literary bloodline of the rich satire of Gaddis, Beckett, Orwell and Moliere.",
