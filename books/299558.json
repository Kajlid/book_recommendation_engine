  "description": "In a remote spot outside L.A, a giant truck suddenly plunges in flames off a mountain road at midnight. It looks like an accident, but it isn't. Someone had fastened a bomb under the truck, killing owner-driver, Paul Myers who was insured for $100,000. Crack insurance investigator, Dave Brandsetter is called in to find out what happened and why. Why was Myers hauling in that secluded spot at that hour and for whom? No one wants to answer Dave's questions but then another trucker's death arouses suspicions and a pattern begins to emerge.",
