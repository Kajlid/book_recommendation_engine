  "description": "Throughout history, mankind has been fascinated by the possibility that other intelligent life existed somewhere out there in the universe. He longed to meet these beings and was sure that he would be able to do so on an equal footing. Surely, man, so royally situated at the pinnacle of creation, has nothing to fear. To facilitate and expedite this fateful day, he sent probes deep into space with messages and maps showing anyone, or any thing, who encountered them exactly how to reach us, though some did questioned the wisdom of such a move. Some say it was the epitome of naivet√© to think that whoever, or whatever, found our invitation would be friendly. What would happen if they turned out to be galactic conquerors, bent on destroying everything in their path? Or, an even more disturbing prospect, what if the visitors turned out to be more subtle, presenting themselves as friendly and helpful at first, while at the same time unleashing a plot so diabolical that, if successfully implemented, would reduce mankind to a state of existence that would make him beg for his own destruction?Surely, mankind could never be destined for such a humiliating fate . . . or could he?",
