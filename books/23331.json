  "description": "When handsome young Rick stops at a local service station to get his car checked out late one afternoon after football practice, he's in for an interesting surprise. And that's because the owner of the service station, Bob, is in one of his more playful moods. Though Rick has always suspected Bob's been interested in him, he's avoided any direct contact because Bob is divorced, has teenage daughters, and is closeted. Rick is looking for love and stability with a gentleman, not a quick fling with a greasy brute. And he avoids men like Bob as much as he can. But this doesn't stop strong, forceful Bob from closing the service station and becoming extremely aggressive with Rick. And when he asks Rick about the high heels Rick tried to hide unsuccessfully in his backseat, he's not asking because he wants to know how much they cost and where he can get pair just like them. Bob has plans for those kinky, smutty high heels that will change Rick's life in ways he never expected that afternoon.",
