  "description": "An inveterate doubter for most of her adult life, award-winning journalist Barbara Falconer Newhall embarks upon a quest to find a way to believe in God in the twenty-first century. The result is Wrestling with God: Stories of Doubt and Faith, which details her years-long search for the Divine in the lives of radically diverse Americans - from a fundamentalist Christian activist to a progressive Muslim leader to a Hindu classical dancer.In Wrestling with God, Newhall presents the deeply personal stories of a score of Americans encountered on her journey - believers, skeptics, contemplatives, activists. She also reports on the progress of her own rocky spiritual journey and how ultimately she arrives at a place of surrender to the universe's enduring mystery.Wrestling with God includes a foreword by Don Lattin, who covered the religion beat for the San Francisco Chronicle and is the author of Distilled Spirits and The Harvard Psychedelic Club.Among the storytellers of Wrestling with God are:* An atheist who conducts an experiment on God* A Buddhist who embarks upon a 650-mile bowing pilgrimage* A World War II veteran who survives a forced march across Germany* A Nobel laureate--Charles H. Townes--who develops the maser and laser* A Congregationalist minister who questions God's goodness",
