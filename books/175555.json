  "description": "A famous abstract expressionist painter from London is welcomed to the Maine Museum of Art where he'll teach a master class. His students, a group of talented local artists, are initially in awe. However, the eccentric Logan Dumbarton proves more difficult than any of the staff, along with his stunning yet whiny wife and his spinster/business-manager sister, can handle with his constant complaints and egocentric demeanor. Within a week the entire class loathes him. Is he really worth all this trouble? Somebody doesn't seem to think so and it's up to Dr. Dulcinea (\"Dulcie\") Chambers to find out who! But she'll have to team up with Detective Nicholas Black once again, and their relationship at the moment can only be described as fragile.",
