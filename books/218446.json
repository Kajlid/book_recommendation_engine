  "description": "The second instalment in the Lane Winslow mystery series; for fans of the Maisie Dobbs and Bess Crawford series.On a snowy day in December 1946, Lane Winslow—a former British intelligence agent who’s escaped to the rural Canadian community of King’s Cove in pursuit of a tranquil life—is introduced to the local hot springs. While there she overhears nearby patrons speaking Russian. When one of those patrons is found dead in the change room, Lane’s linguistic and intelligence experience is of immeasurable value to the local police force in solving the murder.The investigation points to the Soviet Union, where Stalin’s purges are eliminating enemies, and the reach of Stalin’s agent snakes all the way into a harmless Doukhobor community. Winslow’s complicated relationship with the local police inspector, Darling, is intensified by the perils of the case—and by the discovery of her own father’s death during the war.The case comes to a frantic and shocking end with a perilous nighttime journey along treacherous snow-covered roads.“Iona Whishaw is an exciting addition to Canada’s fine roster of mystery writers. I’m already planning to read [Killer in King’s Cove] again, and this time I’ll read the teaser for Whishaw’s next novel provided at the end. A debut mystery by an author destined for awards.” –Don Graves, Canadian Mystery Reviews blog",
