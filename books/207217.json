  "description": "That friend is nothing more than a pup trying to wiggle his way into my territory. When Celena meets her mate she is more than disappointed. Sure he is good looking and strong, but there is one major problem. Decebal has no idea what he is. Upset, she confides her feelings to her friend Victor. \"I can challenge him.\" is his response. Celena finds the idea intriguing, but thinks that ultimately it wouldn't be a good idea. Victor, on the other hand, is not going to give up that easily. Decebal and his wolf get increasingly irritated at the small pup that is in the way far too often. They hurt knowing that their mate would rather be with an underling than them. Determined, Decebal struggles to learn the way of the wolves and win Celena's heart.",
