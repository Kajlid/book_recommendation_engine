  "description": "Poems of Love and longing, innocent passion pitted against fiendish rules, and pining of the soul. A classic depiction of the immortal struggle which is the providential share of all discerning minds. However, the poet has no pretensions on his part as he is merely a vessel, distributing the mellowed elixir to enliven parched earthen pots.",
