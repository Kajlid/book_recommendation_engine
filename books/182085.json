Alone and trying to piece his life back together, he moves to Little Creek, the small town where he was born and where he is known only as the reclusive Vincent Blake. He is happy to keep to himself and mourn his losses until the day he finds an injured dog along the side of the road. Annie, the veterinarian who fixes up the injured dog, soon becomes the woman Vincent's heart longs for. It seems as if Vincent is getting a second chance at life and love when a call from his agent, offering one last shot at stardom, puts everything in jeopardy. Will he choose to return to the Hollywood life of Vincent Lemarco or stay in Little Creek with the woman he loves?",
