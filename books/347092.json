  "description": "Love, lingerie, and family loyalties collide in this sexy, sassy tale of chasing success. When ambitious City analyst Yasmin Yusuf's hope for a traditional \"happily ever after\" in the romance stakes is shattered, she decides there's only one course of actionâ€”get smart, sexy, and successful. And what better way to achieve it than by turning around a failing lingerie company? Swept head-first into her glamorous new job by suave private banker Zachary Khan, Yasmin is soon clashing with snobby fashionistas, pedantic accountants, her culturally conservative Bengali family and, worst of all, Hannah Gibbs-Smythson, Zach's indomitable senior advisor. With the odds stacked against her and her attraction to Zach complicating matters even further, the stakes for Yasmin have never been higher. Is she prepared to risk everything for the success she craves?",
