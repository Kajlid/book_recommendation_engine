The country girl from Armidale had been deemed no match for Anthony, whose family sat atop the social register in New South Wales--_ perhaps all Australia.Since then she'd built a comfortable life for herself in Sydney, and had a steady relationship with Thomas Crawford--her business partner.But when she bumped into Anthony at the charity ball, one brief look into those green eyes threw her emotions into churning conflict. He wanted her again. And Cathy wasn't sure she had the willpower to resist the only man she thought she had ever loved.",
