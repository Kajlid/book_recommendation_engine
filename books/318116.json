  "description": "The day I died was the day I woke up in my true form. The Healers tell me it’s normal to miss the life that was a lie. They assure me that with enough time, I’ll forget about the family of my human body. But every time I close my eyes, I still see them.With the information my people have gathered from the memories of my life on Earth, my species can now move forward with the conquest of their planet.But the attachment I carry for my human family and friends has not faded, and I cannot stand by as my race invades their world with the singular goal of conquest. I’ve made several appeals to the highest reaches of my government and they have fallen upon deaf ears.I am Commander Varen of the Draken Republic, and I now have no choice but to lead the rebellion to save Earth.",
