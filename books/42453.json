On the one hand, this novel examines the events in Europe in the early years of the twentieth century and the years of World War I, and on the other hand, it describes the events of the wealthy and educated French family, namely the Thibaut family. The youngest child of this family, Jacques Thibaut, with his rebellious and indomitable spirit, seeks his destiny in the world around him and leaves the family. In interacting with his socialist ideas, he contrasts happiness and an ideal life with someone he loves.",
