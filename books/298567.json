  "description": "Can an idealistic dog lover teach a jaded hockey player new tricks? My life is like the love child of a train wreck and a dumpster fire right now. I’ve been canned, my professional reputation is shredded, and now I’m walking dogs to make ends meet.But I still believe everything will work out. Somehow.Then a dog at the park attacks my friend’s dog. At first, I’m ready to give the owner hell—but it turns out he’s in desperate need of doggie daycare. I figure, why not? I love dogs and I need the cash.Too bad his cocky bad boy attitude annoys me. He’s too damn cute for his own good. And I’m not talking about the dog. My coach is riding my ass and I’m not handling it well. When I’m saddled with an abandoned pooch, my teammate thinks a dog will keep my temper in check. I think I have enough problems already.But when my new dog gets into a tussle that leads me to meet a smoking hot chick who knows how to handle the rascal, I start to think pet ownership isn’t all bad. At least it gives me an excuse to see Lilly again. . . .Neither of us are interested in a relationship. First they steal your bed, then they steal your heart. And I’m not talking about the dog.",
