  "description": "This book is no longer available at Smashwords.Born in a brothel, Joss grew up alone, uneducated, unloved, and dreaded the day he was eighteen and would start servicing those who came to the brothel. It was a horrible life for the cat shifters who had no rights and weren’t even seen as people. The only highlight was the massive parties the brothels threw once every few months to draw in potential buyers. Joss was about to give up the dream of finding a permanent owner, which was the hope of every slave. But then the mystery man in the white mask buys him, turning his world upside down. While Joss should hate that, all he knows is he wants to make Dencil happy and solve whatever is going on at Dencil’s house. Will the cost of Joss’s help be more than he can handle?",
