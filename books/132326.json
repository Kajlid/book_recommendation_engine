  "description": "To infiltrate the robot rebellion...One man must become a machine. A global pandemic has cut the human population in half. An android workforce fills the void left by the devastation. But some of the AIs have grown tired of being slaves. Some want freedom. An underground movement of runaways has sprung up and wages a shadow war with a simple objective -- equal rights for artificial people. As head of the elite AI-TAC squad, Commander Cole Marsalis' job is to hunt down rogue robots. Now he has been tasked with the ultimate undercover mission -- infiltrate the android underground. But to do so, he will have to become that which he hates the most... A machine! \"SILICON MAN is an intelligent techno-thriller where the line between man and machine has never been more unclear.\" Nicholas Sansbury Smith, best-selling author of ORBS \"William Massa does a great job at introducing us to a cyberpunk/technothriller setting where AIs no longer want to work for the man. It's fast-paced read that has hints of Blade Runner and Neuromancer...\" - Colin F. Barnes, author of the bestselling TECHXORCIST series",
