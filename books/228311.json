In the eight years since he graduated from high school, he's been unable to forget the man who could have changed his life - Uzuki Kobayakawa, the heir to a yakuza dynasty in Tokyo. Now, brought together by chance once again, he's forced to face the choices he made in his youth that tore them apart and to decide whether their differences will keep them apart forever.",
