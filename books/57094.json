  "description": "Cats and Other Myths is a poetry collection that finds contemporary relevance in the echoes of myth and legend and the mythic in the day to day world around us. Given truths are questioned and examined and if this means that dearly held beliefs are seen as the fairy tales they are, then so be it. These are poems of history and humanity, love and relationships, life and death and the things in between.",
