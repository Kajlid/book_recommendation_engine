  "description": "I've won one victory against my enemies, but it seems the barons are just getting started with their new, vicious schemes. They'll stop at nothing to expand their power.Any move I make to oppose them could have horrible consequences for both me and the guys I love. My only hope is playing along until the right opportunity comes my way.There's a chance I could sway my mother if I can earn her trust. She may be brutal when she feels she needs to be, but I've seen glimpses of a softer side underneath. Can I walk the line between obedience and resistance without losing so much more than I already have?*Grim Witchery is the seventh book in a university-age paranormal academy series. Expect magical villainy, a tough heroine who bends to no oneâ€™s will, a dollop of steam, and a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers romance where there'll be no choosing required.*",
