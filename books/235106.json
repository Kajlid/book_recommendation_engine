  "description": "The eleven stories in Will Mackin's mesmerizing debut collection draw from his many deployments with a special operations task force in Iraq and Afghanistan. They began as notes he jotted on the inside of his forearm in grease pencil and, later, as bullet points on the torn-off flap of an MRE kit. Whenever possible he incorporated those notes into his journals. Years later, he used those journals to write this book.Together, the stories in Bring Out the Dog offer a remarkable portrait of the absurdity and poetry that define life in the most elite, clandestine circles of modern warfare. It is a world of intense bonds, ancient credos, and surprising compassion--of success, failure, and their elusive definitions. Moving between settings at home and abroad, in vivid language that reflects the wonder and discontent of war, Mackin draws the reader into a series of surreal, unsettling, and deeply human episodes: In \"Crossing the River No Name,\" a close call suggests that miracles do exist, even if they are in brutally short supply; in \"Great Circle Route Westward Through Perpetual Night,\" the death of the team's beloved dog plunges them into a different kind of grief; in \"Kattekoppen,\" a man struggles to reconcile his commitments as a father and his commitments as a soldier; and in \"Baker's Strong Point,\" a man whose job it is to pull things together struggles with a loss of control.Told without a trace of false bravado and with a keen, Barry Hannah-like sense of the absurd, Bring Out the Dog manages to capture the tragedy and heroism, the degradation and exultation, in the smallest details of war.",
