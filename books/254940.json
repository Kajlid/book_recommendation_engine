  "description": "Jesaela doesn’t want to leave her home, the forest and the Tree. She doesn’t want to leave her family, but she has no choice. The young faerie must be the next companion to the Eldar Princess in the faraway Citadel, or else the Eldar will send the dragons to turn her home to cinder and ash. So Jes must travel alone to the den of darkness in search of the spell that binds the dragons to the Eldar king’s will, to try and free her people from bondage. If she succeeds, freedom and light will prevail, but if she fails, Darkness will consume them all.  Companion of Darkness is Book One in a new Epic Fantasy series set in the Neverwar Universe. Suitable for young adults of all ages.",
