  "title": "A Century of Sand Dredging in the Bristol Channel Volume Two: The Welsh Coast: Volume Two - The Welsh Coast",
  "description": "This is the second half of a detailed history of sand dredging in the Bristol Channel - the result of over thirty years' research. Concentrating on the Welsh coast, A Century of Sand Dredging: Volume Two documents the sand trade from its inception in 1912 to the present day, and examines the sand dredgers employed through the years, and the Welsh companies engaged in the trade. Information has been drawn from a wide range of sources, including the author's own experiences of the trade and its ships - his own father was a master of Bristol sand dredgers for over twenty-five years. Further information from interviews with crew members, company records, shipping records and photographic records, especially the Cedric Catt collection, has been collated and presented, with a vast number of illustrations, to form a book that will appeal to anyone with an interest in maritime trade and the history of the Bristol Channel.",
