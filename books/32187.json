  "description": "Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new, rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives, nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness, enveloped by a mysterious darkness. As Steinbeck interweaves the stories of the Trasks and their neighbors, the prosperous, open-hearted Hamiltons, he portrays men and women determined to conquer not only the land but the forces of love and hate, trust and suspicion within their hearts.(back cover)",
