  "description": "When opposites attract, they are screwed three ways from Sunday.Frannie learned the hard way that a McHottie doesn t always equal marriage material. She s happy with her vanilla life. She has friends, a career and a double-D-powered vibrator. Then Fate shoves her, literally, into Prince Charming s lap. His declaration of love at first sight is cute and spikes her bullcrap meter into the red zone.She s more than willing to give in with her body. But she s barricaded her heart behind castle walls and permanently welded the gates shut.Tragedy taught Jinx that time is too precious to waste, so when a series of uncanny coincidences thrusts Frannie into his life, he holds on tight. He knows she thinks he s several fries short of a Happy Meal, but he s determined to breach the fortress around her heart and give her a Happily Ever After.Even if he has to carry her fanny-first into his kingdom.\"",
