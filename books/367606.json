  "description": "With over 4.1 million copies in print, Elizabeth Koda-Callan's Magic Charm Books is the little series that could. Now, The Silver Slippers takes a dramatic new turn with a fresh redesign featuring a new cover and an irresistible 5\" x 6 1Â³2\" trim size--a smaller book for smaller hands, and the perfect stocking stuffer. The look is contemporary, yet as classic as the story inside, with its ageless message of \"Good things happen when you believe in yourself.\" And, of course, nestled inside the cover is a charm on a matching gold or silver chain.",
