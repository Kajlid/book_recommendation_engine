  "description": "A century old curse forgotten by time. A sleepy town cut off from the world by an ominous chasm. And a girl with the heart of a warrior.  The town of Justice Falls is slave to an annual tithe, but only those with the sight recall the true price of survival. As one of the gifted, Wynter Ashfall has made peace with the curse, for when the silver riders climb out of the chasm in the dead of winter, there is no force on earth that can stop them from claiming their cargo.  But when the man who holds her heart is marked, there is nothing she won’t do to get him back, even if it means climbing into the pit itself. With Death as her guide she must navigate a realm forbidden to the living, a place where every creature hungers for her soul and nothing is as it seems.  In a world where time has no meaning, time is running out, and Wynter must make a choice— finally claim her heart or find the courage to let it go.  Let the tale begin…  A dark fantasy with horns and teeth, Slavic gods and immortal fey.",
