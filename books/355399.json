  "description": "Shire horse shapeshifters Bayard and Marshall Stoddard have never been happier. They have a man they both love in safety consultant Oliver Philip, and the common enemy that brought the three together has finally left them alone. Or so they thought…When Oliver travels to the mountains of Alberta to conduct a safety audit on a ski resort, he runs into a completely different animal than the twins he’s in love with. The massive crows he spies upon his arrival aren’t exactly human, and it seems they have a cautionary tale about a group of men who would destroy the Stoddards without a care. Oliver isn’t sure what to believe, until he gets a phone call from Marsh telling him Bay has gone missing. Oliver must find the strength inside himself to fight for the two men he can’t live without.",
