But besieged by her past and the very attributes so many envy, she lives a lonely life devoid of the one commodity she cannot grasp--love. When sexy heartthrob Keller Cross swaggers onto the set of Beautiful Monsters, Riley's self-protective veneer cracks wide open. Her dormant passion ignites as the bad-boy actor thrusts her onto the volatile glass stage of Hollywood celebrity--and down into the depths of his sordid sexual deviancy. Against a backdrop of studio politics, fame, jealousy, and unrequited love, their white-hot chemistry explodes onto the film set, incinerating their former lives and exposing the unseemly underbelly of La La Land. But does love stand a chance among the beautiful monsters?",
