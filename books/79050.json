  "description": "Oh. No. This can't be happening. Me and Sean Reed? \"Trust Partners\" for the entire counselors-in-training program? Sean may have deep blue eyes that make my heart flutter whenever he looks at me, but he's always been a troublemaker. Being thrown together all summer? That is so not going to work. Even if he does have a really, really nice smile. Trust me on this.",
