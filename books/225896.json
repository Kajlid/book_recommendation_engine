  "description": "My Pet By J.W. McKenna Annette couldn't explain why the idea of a strong man taking her and bending her to his will aroused her so. Perhaps she was just \"wired\" differently than other women. When she began exploring her submissive feelings online, she came across \"Mr. Paul\", an alleged Dominant and trainer who lived in another state. As they began chatting, Annette found in his responses the answers to her own long-unanswered questions. He seemed the perfect Dom—not cruel or abusive, just firm and strong and masculine. She went to visit him—and met another strong man. Master James evoked similar responses in her. Now deep in her training, she finds herself torn between two men, the aloof and enigmatic Mr. Paul and the sexy and strong Master James. One of these men may steal her heart - or she may be destined to be sold to the highest bidder at auction! Annette opens her soul to the experience of total submission and finds her heart's desire.",
