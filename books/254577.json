  "title": "Main Street to Miracle Mile: American Roadside Architecture",
  "description": "First published in 1985, Chester Liebs' Main Street to Miracle Mile established the twentieth-century roadside landscape as a subject for serious study. Liebs traces the transformation of commercial development as it has moved from centralized main streets, out along the street car lines, to form the \"miracle miles\" and shopping malls of today. He also explores the evolution of roadside buildings, from supermarkets and motels to automobile showrooms and drive-in theaters. Both an historical survey and invaluable guide for reading highway landscapes, this classic work―which has inspired numerous studies, museum exhibits, and preservation efforts―is now back in print with new commentary by the author.",
