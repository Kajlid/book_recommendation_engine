  "description": "A good bottom can obey any master. Called annoyingly obedient, and dumped for a less submissive bottom, my attempts to recover from Dave have led me to a place where those same traits could mean my survival. An alien holding cell turned out to be a pound, and my new owner is a seven-foot tower of jet-black muscle with raptor legs and shark teeth. I'm getting the training and discipline I longed for from my Earth lovers at the claws of my alien owner. If only I can make him want meâ€¦ Warning, this title contains the explicit sex, graphic language, violence, alien-man sex, D/s, and human pets.",
