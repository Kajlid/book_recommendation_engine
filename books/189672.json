  "description": "A birds-eye view of corruption in the Big Apple. Urban Flight takes place in New York City in the despairing days of 1975, when the Big Apple flirted with bankruptcy and its mean streets teetered on the edge of anarchy. A year after Nixon's resignation, Jason Sims, one-time sixties idealist and part-time musician, finds himself piloting a helicopter for a television news station's traffic reports. Jason agrees to do some extra flying for the station's mysterious owner, and during these extra-curricular flights observes activities that could be related to the urban corruption scandal and possible murder that his best friend, journalist Adam Shaker, has been investigating. As Jason becomes inadvertently enmeshed in the City's political crisis (and a new love interest) he confronts the demons of his past and experiences a personal re-awakening.",
