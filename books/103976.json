After a humiliating divorce, Catherine’s content with her slightly dull, intentionally celibate life. She should have known better than to open a letter from a dead man.Max Windsor, a best-selling horror writer, was Catherine’s biggest client. Two days after he was killed in a car accident, she received a letter he instructed be sent at his death. Max left a fortune in a trust that goes to his sister and his five grandchildren. In his letter, he claims one of his beneficiaries was responsible for his death, as well two previous attempts on his life that he hushed up. Convinced the police are incompetent and a private investigator might publicize family secrets, Max wants Catherine to work with his grandson Ben Gallagher to identify his murderer. The trust requires that to inherit, Max’s beneficiaries must spend fourteen consecutive nights together at Nevermore, the Gothic-style estate Max built in the hills outside Rockville, Minnesota, a small town on Lake Superior. That will give Ben and Catherine the perfect opportunity to investigate, provided no one suspects why she’s really there.This book is a Kindle Serial.
