  "description": "He stunned me with the announcement: \"Now I wish to unveil to your very eyes the heart of the Gospel, the most ignored and hidden mystery of the Return, the Evangel's best kept secret. Anyone who has access to this knowledge already has one foot in the sacred threshold of paradise, his heart ready for that one spark to set it ablaze with the sublime vision of the Rapture.\" I began to shake like a leaf on a tempestuous night. It is December 1999-on the eve of a brave new millennium-and against the backdrop of shifting geography, history and religion, one determined pilgrim, in the company of over a thousand other intoxicated lovers of Jesus, is on a long arduous journey, from the coastal regions of West Africa across the shimmering sands of the Sahara to the edge of the Holy Land to witness the Rapture of Christ on that unforgettable Night of the Transition. By the author of Gatekeepers: The Quest for Clues to an Age-Old Riddle, this religious fiction offers alternative, refreshing and thought-provoking insights into the great issues of the Bible-issues that have confounded countless generations of believers-such as the creation story, proof of the existence of God, Satan, the virgin birth, miracles, the Trinity, heaven and hell, the Second Coming, the Resurrection, the Judgment, and the end of the world.",
