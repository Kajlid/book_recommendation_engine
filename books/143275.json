  "title": "Curious: True Stories and Loose Connections",
  "description": "Sometimes things are more ordinary than you think. And sometimes they're a whole lot odder than you can possibly imagine.Rebecca Front has always drawn on experiences from her life in her award-winning acting and comic writing. In her debut book, she reveals herself as a master storyteller: sharp, witty, honest and highly attuned to the absurdities of life and the oddities of human nature.By turns poignant, comic and uplifting, CURIOUS is a book of stories, all of them true, though sometimes perhaps a little bent out of shape in the telling.We learn, among other things, why a Mexican wave is a symbol of oppression, how to navigate a conversational cul-de-sac with a French vegan train driver, and why keeping a pet rabbit on a lead is perfectly normal.This is a beguiling celebration of the curiosities of everyday life, and of what it is to be curious - in every sense of the word.",
