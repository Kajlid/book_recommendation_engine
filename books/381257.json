  "description": "'Organic bugs must be purged from the system,' the screen told him. Then, more succinctly, 'You die.'The Network broadcasts entertainment to the planets of the Meson system: Death-hunt 3000, Prisoner: The Next Generation, Bloodsoak Bunny... Sixteen channels, and not one of them worth watching. But for the citizens of poverty-striken Torrok, television offers the only escape from a reality too horrible to face. Angela, a young inhabitant of Torrok, leaps at the chance to travel to the Network with a hermit who calls himself the Doctor. However, all is not well on the giant, chaotic space station. A soap star has murdered his wifeâ€™s lover; the robotic regulars of Timeriders are performing random kidnappings; and a lethal new game show is about to go on the air. Can the Doctor uncover the cause of the apparently random disturbances - or will his appearance as a competitor on Death-hunt 3000 be the last of his life?",
