  "description": "An approaching enemy...\n\n\nAn uncrowned Prince...\n\nA commoner with a destiny he could not realize... \n\n\nAlyx Reimund is a servant in the home that used to be his father's. Beaten, abused in ways he dare not recount, he longs for the day that he might feel a steady and kind hand. A chance encounter brings him face to face with the Crown Prince, a man so handsome and brave, surely he was made from Alyx's own dreams. Crown Prince Evander De Loughrey heads one of the fiercest armies in all the lands. He wields his power with less violence than his father before him, wishing only for an end to all the wars he had been on, wishing for someone to wake in his bed with him, to love him as he is not for the power he will one day have. When the two meet, it is as though fate had drawn them together. But will they be able to keep each other, and the royal family, safe? Will their kingdom survive an unknown enemy? Will they be able to know peace and harmony with each other. This novel features MM sex scenes, lots of dashing knights, and plenty of sweetness to match. A Hundred Others is meant for the 18+ crowd who enjoy a lot of sweet with some of their heat.",
