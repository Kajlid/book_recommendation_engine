  "description": "Nova‑Marie is a medium with a big heart and questionable work ethics. If she had it her way, she and her best friend, Elliot, would just drink tea, hang out, and let the supernatural beasties go about their business. But, as much as she wishes otherwise, Nova‑Marie doesn’t always get her way.Supernatural activity is on the rise.They have no idea what’s causing it, and Nova‑Marie doesn’t care to find out. Not even when a ghost, a demon, and a púca move in with her. But when some aggressive demon hunters come to town and mess with her neighbourhood, ignoring things may no longer be an option. If Nova‑Marie wants to keep the peace and keep her friends alive (or dead, as the case may be), she may actually have to get off her butt and do something about it.",
