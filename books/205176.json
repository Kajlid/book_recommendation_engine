  "title": "The Light of Murder",
  "description": "In the end times of the cosmos, the light of stars is the rarest thing. Cold darkness reigns. What little light remains is overshadowed by the pain, want, and desire of mortals and the divine. Above the endless world of the Shell, a god creates a new star out of anger over the death of his son. None can survive its passing light. On the shadowed world of Uin, a child of the divine brings war to her sister and her people. All will be caught in their engulfing conflict. And in the higher layers of the cosmos, on a world of fading light, a man is caught in artificial life. What hope he finds will be in the reflection of another.",
