  "description": "Floating on the Wow is this year's must-read quirky fiction. Peter Dreeton was hoping to find love and a short-term career in his university admissions office set on Cape Cod. What he wasn't expecting were the dancing cranberries. We all know Peter. We went to school with him. He dated your younger sister. You met him once in a crowded bar and left wishing you had a few more hours to spenddiscussing the nonsense and noise of life. He's a ninety-nine cent bean burrito from a fast food restaurant that spends the rest of theday in the pit of your stomach. He's a small gift you were hoping to find. Floating on the Wow follows Peter on an organic journey through career decisions, the pain of loss, and finally to what makes us all human: the need to be loved; to share small stories late in the night; to discover an identity; and to finish the puzzle of ourselves. Peter's adventures confront the question we've all attempted to answer: does anything good ever happen after college?",
