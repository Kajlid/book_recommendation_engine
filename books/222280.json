  "description": "Brodie Buchanan lives for war, the bloodier, the better. But lately, even her fellow Valkyrie have become concerned with how single-minded and blood thirsty she has become. Forced to take a holiday at the Southern Sanctuary, Brodie's boss has warned her not to return until she is completely chilled. Or in other words, bang a guy, they are the best stress relievers out there.There’s nothing more dangerous than saying no to a Valkyrie. Doubly so when they are demanding you have sex with them. Unfortunately for Fen Valhalla, Fireman, and Air Mage, there is only one option available to him if he wants to escape the dreaded machinations of the Southern Sanctuary matchmaker, celibacy. As much as it pains him, the only way for Fen to remain single, is to swear off women completely. Except, he failed to factor in one very determined six-foot Valkyrie when he took his vow of abstinence. With a magical arsonist wreaking havoc in the Sanctuary, it will take Brodie and Fen working together, to hunt down and stop the firebug menace before anyone is killed. There is only one small problem, the more time Brodie spends with the vexing man, the more she finds herself wanting not just merely sex from Fen… she wants it all. Damn, so all she has to do now is convince Fen that love is not a dirty four-letter word. Or, she could just kill him… decisions, decisions.",
