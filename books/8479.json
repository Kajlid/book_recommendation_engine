The all-new antiviral handwash, Gemini, has been laced with Meme-Spawn, a sentient microorganism which makes the user fluent in every language in the universe. However, manufacturer Zalnex made one crucial mistake. They didn t test Gemini on humans, who are seized by the violent urge to communicate but speak every language all at once with a manic, garbled shriek and pass on the virus by touch.The Doctor and Amy arrive on an Earth-bound cargo-ship loaded with Gemini, where a human crew are succumbing to the virus which has nasty second and third phases in store. When the Doctor and Amy are separated, they both know that it s only a matter of time before Amy is infected.With the ship locked on course and no way of curing the sufferers, the Doctor is faced with a terrible decision: Does he save Amy or Earth?Written specially for audio by Jason Arnopp, \"The Gemini Contagion \"is read by Meera Syal, who played Nasreen Chaudhry in the BBC television episodes The Hungry Earth and Cold Blood. \"",
