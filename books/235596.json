  "description": "Crystal Hollow used to be a magical winter wonderland.  Now it’s a wasteland of frozen death ruled by an evil Ice Princess.  As the last ice fae, Roshia’s the only one with the power to save her world. When her family is destroyed by the queen’s undead guard, she flees to the North Mountains, hoping to join the rebels rumored to live there.  But she discovers more than just the rebel camp.  She finds three men determined to help her learn to love again—and in them, the key both to her heart and to reversing the evil spell that poisons the Hollow.  If only they can convince her she can do it.  Author Note: Marked by Darkness is a stand-alone novel, as are all the Dark Fae Hollow books.
