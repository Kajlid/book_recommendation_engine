  "description": "We open literally one second after the shattering conclusion of Messiah War, and Cable's mission to save mutantkind has never looked bleaker. In fact, you can't even call it a mission anymore. After all he's been through, after all he's survived, now all Cable can do now is pray - pray the heavily-armed killers roaming the deep future can't match his survival skills. And what is the fate of Hope - the so-called \"Mutant Messiah\"? Collecting: Cable 16-21",
