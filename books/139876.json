And when the door leading back into the building locks behind them, it seems fate likes to play a good prank.Can Cassie ever overcome her shyness and confess to Damien the torch she’s carried for years, or have the years since high school changed them both too dramatically for them to ever have a second chance?-------------This 24,000 word romance novella is sweet with heat, and all about tight spots and second chances!",
