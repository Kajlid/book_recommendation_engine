  "description": "You know those people who love coloring outside of the lines?Yeah, that's not me.I’ve always been the girl who does what is expected.I’m the mind my parents, go to church on Sunday, dot my i’s and cross my t’s kind of girl.Some may call it safe and cookie-cutter.Heck, I’ll be the first to admit that it’s even boring.The thing is, I tried venturing into the wild side, and it bit me in the ass—literally.I not only went back to my safe and boring life, I ran.I put my mistake in the past. The only problem is that Lincoln Locke refuses to stay there.He’s constantly showing up and tempting me, trying to lure me into his bed.And damn it, I may like following the rules, but I definitely have trouble resisting temptation.It doesn’t help that temptation comes in the form of an ultimate bad boy, with sexy abs, devilish smile and dark eyes made to melt my clothes off my body.Linc burned me once. I’d be a fool to give him a chance to do it again. Now if someone could just tell that to my hormones... And my heart.",
