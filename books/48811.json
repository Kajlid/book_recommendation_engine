  "description": "Court reporter Renee Rose found out the hard way that hooking up with a cop is like getting a bikini wax. It starts off hot, quickly turns painful, and ends in tears. But when her best friend receives an e-mail from her long-dead fiancé demanding money, Renee knows they need help. Too bad help comes in the form of Detective Anthony Graciano, an annoying bossy cop who somehow still manages to haul Renee's libido out of dry dock. Police work is more than a career for Anthony, it's an obsession. Specializing in cases involving female victims, he has no time for a personal life until he meets Renee, a delicious mystery he yearns to solve. When Renee’s disastrous marriage ended some years ago, her mother consoled her with the knowledge that when one door closes the next door could open to a plate of warm cookies. Could this detective be Renee’s warm cookie? \"Good looking men are trouble. If I had known then what I know now, I would have put clowns on my wedding cake.\" – Renee Rose in Playing Dead.",
