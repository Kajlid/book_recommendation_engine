  "description": "Someone was trying to assassinate the president of the United States, and only army intelligence captain Diana Lockworth had the ability to stop them--if she could convince the authorities she wasn't a crackpot. It didn't help that her intel came from a source so secret even she didn't know who it was. With only twenty-four hours to stop the attack, she had to figure out who was masterminding the plot and when they planned to strike. First, she had to get the charismatic young president on her side. And then she'd give the enemy a new target--herself!",
