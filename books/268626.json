  "description": "I'm over men. I'm done with them.Or at least the ones that work in my kitchen. Fine, one man in particular. Wyatt Shaw is cocky and condescending and so far out of his element that he doesn't know which way is up. Or how to run his brand new kitchen all by himself.That's where I come in. Sous chef extraordinaire. Second in command. Bane of his existence. I am the reason Wyatt's doing so well as the new executive chef of one of our city's most prestigious restaurants. He has me to thank for his glowing accolades and five-star write-ups. Only if you were to ask him, he'd say I'm his biggest problem.Despite his discouragement and bullish behavior, I've set two goals for myself.The first? I'm going to fight my way to the top of this male-dominated industry and claim my own award-winning kitchen.The second? I'm going to do whatever it takes to ignore Wyatt and his rare smiles and the thickening tension that's started to simmer between us.Wyatt Shaw might be Durham's new shining star. He might be up for a James Beard Award. He might be my new boss and key to my future success, but he's also in my way.So he can keep his smoldering looks and secret kisses. And he can be the one that figures out how to make it through service without getting distracted by me.I'm not the problem. The problem is him.Contains mature themes.",
