  "description": "Sebastian Grey always thought he was a fairly normal teenager –- good friends, decent grades, and a pretty sweet job in his foster brother’s tattoo shop. But when Romany gypsies arrive in town, Sebastian discovers that his world is not what it seems. There is an age-old feud between his family and the gypsies -- and this isn't the only secret his brother has been keeping from him. His life is not his own. The girl he’s been dreaming about has just turned up at school, and he feels compelled to protect her at all costs. Even if that means life might never be normal again.",
