  "description": "For a hundred years, the people of Prairie Bend have whispered Nathaniel's name in wonder and fear. Some say he is a folktale, created to frighten children on cold winter nights. Some swear he is a terrifying spirit returned to avenge the past. But soon... very soon... some will learn that Nathaniel lives still--that he is darkly, horrifyingly real. Nathaniel--he is the voice that calls to young Michael Hall across the prairie night... the voice that draws the boy into the shadowy depths of the old, crumbling, forbidden barn... that chanting, compelling voice he will follow faithfully beyond the edge of terror.",
