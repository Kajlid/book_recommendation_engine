  "description": "Have you ever had a dream you thought for sure was real? I have, accept when I woke up the monsters didn't disappear. My monsters waved hello and went about their normal lives...they are real...and I'm one of them. I can see the souls of the dead, and I assure you they aren't pretty. The dead are terrifying, wandering between the mortal world and the Otherside until I can release them. I need to travel to the land of the dead...to find a killer, and save a friend. But ghosts aren't the only things that can hurt me, other beings reside within the realm. The distance between my friends and I grows larger as my trip draws near. I am trying to keep a foot in both worlds but realize too late, that I donâ€™t really belong in either. I am alone, and the only way to keep them all safe is to stay that way, but love sometimes has other plans for us. And as the saying goes...the path to hell is paved with good intentions, and hell itself...is full of none.But it sure is beautiful.",
