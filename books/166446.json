  "description": "Tember is a loner who has never even thought about being in a relationship with a boy, let alone a girl. She’s just waiting until she turns eighteen and has enough money saved to run away from her unbearable life with her grandparents. Gracie has everything Tember never knew she was missing—a good education and a loving father, who is supportive of her sexual orientation and even tries to set her up with girls. When he introduces the two girls, Gracie’s blue eyes and strong character immediately catch Tember’s attention. But a summer romance is not Tember’s style, especially since she’s about to run away.",
