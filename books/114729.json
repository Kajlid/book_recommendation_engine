To make things even better, his best friend Sebastian has also found his way to Arkadia and offered to let him live with the Arkadian lion's pride. He is living it up when he meets his mate. One overly neat, OCD, fastidious doctor. Dr. Maddox Claybourne is content with his life in Arkadia. He tends to the occasional broken bone or contusion that is commonplace in a shifter only town. He is not prepared for a redheaded mate that wrecks his clinic, ignores his orders, and tries to serve him microwavable pizza! It will take every ounce of skill between Felix and Claybourne to combat a mysterious illness that threatens to steal away the lives of those most precious in Arkadia. No one is safe when people begin to fall ill. Can Felix and Claybourne discover a cure in time? And when they can't, can they live with the deaths this virus will leave in its wake? This book is written in one point of view. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
