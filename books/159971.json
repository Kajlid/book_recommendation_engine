  "description": "Don’t worry about your tray table and seat back for this one. Forget what you’ve been told about the romantic notion of the airline business. It’s not like what you’ve seen in the movies. Buckle your seat belt and join Captain Kimber C. Turner for a flight over a thirty year career of ups and downs in aviation. This story of his love/hate life in airplanes will take you from laughter to livid and back again. Kimber C. Turner is a retired airline pilot with over 18,000 hours of flight time, and a former radio talk show host. Now he is out of the sky and off of the air. In his retirement, Captain Turner does some voice over work and an occasional guest spot on the radio. He also writes a book now and then.",
