  "description": "Bobby Early managed a restaurant in Aspen, Colorado, until the leases doubled too many times. He made a lot of friends and a few enemies since moving to the mining town turned ski mecca in the seventies. Now, one of his friends is dying in the local hospital. When Bobby arrives to visit Tad he encounters Tad's aunt, Donna Deerfield from Denver. Sixty, sweet, single and sexy, the flirtatious couple hope to discover a treasure within a tragedy. Meanwhile, buried beneath Bobby's ramshackle miner's cabin is a cache of silver, or so he believes. A greedy Realtor has developed a subdivision of oversize mansions surrounding Bobby's old house. He's chosen to fight the forces of inevitable ugliness and refuses to sell out. A corpulent Texan who practically sweats oil and gas has bought the last remaining lot -next to Bobby -and in such a beautiful spot of nature the picture of ugly has just become bloated. In the search for silver, for true love and for the abiding character of a town experiencing an unfortunate extreme cosmetic make-over, It's All About the Timing is a story of being in the right place at the right time even if it takes forever to get there.",
