  "description": "The Mechanicals of Recoleta is an intense drama about the dark secrets hidden in the Navy School of Mechanics, the infamous site of torture during Argentina's dirty war of 1976 to 1983. Flash forward to modern-day California, where Zoe, originally from Argentina, enjoys a cushy job on a Silicon Valley campus and a brand new husband. Her perfect life is interrupted during her honeymoon in India by a phone call from Buenos Aires. Hearing that her father has died, Zoe is forced to leave her new husband behind to rush back to South America to attend the funeral at the Recoleta cemetery, where only the crème de la crème of Argentina's upper crust are buried. In Argentina for the first time in years, Zoe uncovers hints about her father's and uncle's roles during the junta period, and that her new husband might not be who she thinks. Stalked by a mysterious old woman (a Plaza de Mayo Mother), Zoe is forced to confront the fact that her family's hidden secrets may be even worse than the accusations made by the current Argentine regime and starts to realize that her entire life may have been a lie. What is Zoe's true heritage? Are her parents really her parents? And what role does her husband play?
