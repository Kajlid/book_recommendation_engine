  "description": "Tips for Surviving a Fling with a Sexy Younger Man  First, you’d think as a thirty-something-year-old woman, I’d be immune to Griffin’s flirty comments and six-pack abs. You’d think that his carefree playboy attitude, or the fact that he’s still finishing grad school, would deter me.  You’d be wrong.  If you accidentally bang your best friend’s younger brother, here are a few important tips . . .  One: Do not brag to your friend about how well-endowed her brother is.  Two: Do not go back for seconds (or thirds).  Three: Do not let him see your muffin top or jiggly behind. And definitely don’t let him feed you cookies in bed. Cookies are bad. Remember that.  Four: Act like a damn grown-up and apologize for riding him like a bull at the rodeo. And do not flirt with him when he laughs at said apology.  Five: This one is crucial, so pay attention.  Do not, under any circumstances, fall in love with him.",
