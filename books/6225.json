  "description": "Nobel Laureate Pablo Neruda explored many schools of thought, poetic styles, and voices, but his passion lay in finding and improvising upon basic rhythms of perception to reveal unspoken and unspeakable truths. Copper Canyon Press has published seven volumes of Neruda's poetry. Six volumes were translated by William O'Daly and one volume of poems was translated by James Nolan.These brief poems, composed entirely of unanswerable questions, reveal the Nobel Laureate's lifelong dedication to an inner structure of feeling and paradox that underlies experience.\"Exploiting the lag between perception and understanding, Neruda's poems evoke pictures that make sense on a visual level before the reader can grasp them on a literal one. The effect is mildly dazzlingO'Daly's translations achieve a tone that is both meditative and spontaneous.\"- Publishers Weekly\"The English versions of the poems are excellent and can easily be compared to the Spanish original.\"- ChoiceOther titles by Pablo Neruda available from Ceremonial Songs (Latin American Literary Review Press), 0-935480-80-3 PBNeruda at Isla Negra (White Pine Press), 1-877727-83-0 PBNeruda's Garden (Latin American Literary Review Press), 0-935480-68-4 PBThe Sea and the Bells (Copper Canyon Press), 1-55659-019-9 PBThe Separate Rose (Copper Canyon Press), 0-914742-88-4 PBStill Another Day (Copper Canyon Press), 0-914742-77-9 PBStones of the Sky (Copper Canyon Press), 1-55659-007-5 PB 1-55659-006-7 HCWindows That Open Inward (White Pine Press), 1-877727-89-X PBWinter Garden , (Copper Canyon Press), 0-914742-93-0 PB 0-914742-99-X HCYellow Heart , (Copper Canyon Press), 1-55659-029-6 PB",
