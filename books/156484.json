  "description": "Charlotte Farrington always knew that she would attend Dolton Hall to finish her education. Remote and austere, the elite English finishing school has played host to untold generations of upper class ladies for hundreds of years. But upon her arrival Charlotte discovers there is more to the school than meets the eye. Beneath its respectable façade, Dolton Hall hides a secret. The girls will be taught not only how to behave in polite society, but also how to pleasure their future husbands in bed. By the time they leave the school they will possess the carnal knowledge to beguile and seduce, and the ability to deliver upon that promise in the bedroom. Alone and vulnerable, she meets fellow student Katrina, who is equally unsure of her new situation. It’s not long before they are taken under the wing of the more experienced Ashley, who seems to have a far greater knowledge of the activities at the school than the other students. As the days stretch into weeks, and the lessons turn increasingly erotic, all three girls begin affairs with the young men who work at Dolton Hall. As events unfold to a gripping climax they will discover love, heartbreak and a deeper knowledge of themselves than they ever imagined possible. A brilliantly crafted story of erotic awakening, Waking Charlie is a poignant and engaging tale that will consume you to the very end.",
