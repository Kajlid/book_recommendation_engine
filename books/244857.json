  "description": "'That Marabar Case' was an event which threw the city of Chandrapore into a fever of racial feeling. Miss Quested, on a visit from England to the man she expected to marry, showed an interest in Indian ways of life which was frowned upon by the sun-baked British community. She returns, alone and distressed, from an excursion to the caves in the company of a young Indian doctor. He is arrested on a charge of attempted assault, but when the case comes to trial Miss Quested withdraws her accusation and the doctor is set free. Was she the victim of an hallucination, a complex, an unidentified intruder, or what?In this dramatic story E.M. Forster depicts, with sympathy and discernment, the complicated Oriental reaction to British rule in India, and reveals the conflict of temperament and tradition involved in that relationship.",
