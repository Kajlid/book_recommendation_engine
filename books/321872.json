  "description": "“Nothing is enough to the man for whom enough is too little.” ~ EpicurusAt what age did I begin to question everything? As far back as I, Donavan Sherman, can recall, I saw the world, not through the rose-colored glasses of others—those spectacles worn by the individuals who see what surrounds them and are satisfied—but through vision hued by green.Life took me along a bumpy path, or better yet, the path I chose led me to encounter obstacles that prepared me to overcome. That journey didn’t sugar-coat the world; it opened my eyes to the true qualities of green—greed, illness, and envy. After all, even Disney surrounds their villains in green smoke. That green hue created the realization that there is always more, always better, and never enough. I saw, I coveted, I took, and I conquered. I made enemies. Even with Julia by my side, my quest for more isn’t satisfied. There are people I want to see suffer. It seems that revenge isn’t a one-way street. Will Julia pay the price for my sins? From New York Times bestselling author Aleatha Romig comes a brand-new age-gap, family saga, chance meeting, contemporary romantic-suspense novel in the world of high finance, where success is sweet and revenge is sweeter. Have you been Aleatha’d?*GREEN ENVY is a full-length novel and book two of the Sin Series that began with RED SIN.",
