  "description": "They knew they were going to die...Surrounded bu Cuban \"advisors,\" and 'Nationalist Front\" native Marxists, they knew that if they fought on they would be annihilated. If they surrendered there would be a show-trial first, but death lay at the end of that road too. There was, however, a third alternative...Thus begins a spectacular novel of High Adventure, the newest and best work yet by the co-author of the national best-seller, Lucifer's Hammer. Enter and be swept away into a world imbued with that combination of the fantastic and the utterly believable that is the Pournelle trademark. With the aid of over seventy pages of gorgeous illustrations by Bermejo, you will live the life of the JANISSARIES.",
