What impending event has drawn them here, to this sleepy suburb, as if it were the best seat in the house for the greatest show on Earth?In Another Country by Robert Silverberg:For time-traveling tourists, the rule about affairs with the locals is clear--look but don't touch. To flout that rule is to invite endless paradoxes and complications--as the well-meaning Thimiroi finds out to his dismay, in this all-new tale by SF master Robert Silverberg, written especially for the Tor Doubles as a companion to C.L. Moore's famous original.",
