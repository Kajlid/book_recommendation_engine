  "description": "When Bill Masen awakes blindfolded in hospital and carefully removes his bandages, he realises he is one of the few who can see; almost everyone else has been blinded by a meteor shower. Now, with civilization in chaos, the triffids - huge, venomous, plants able to 'walk', feeding on human flesh - can have their day. This stark vision of a desolate world infested by deadly, monstrous plants has lost none of its power to horrify. Author BiographyJohn Wyndham Parkes Lucas Benyon Harris was born in 1903, the son of a barrister. He tried a number of careers including farming, law, commercial art and advertising, and started writing short stories, intended for sale, in 1925. From 1930 to 1939 he wrote short stories of various kinds under different names, almost exclusively for American publications, while also writing detective novels. During the war he was in the Civil Service and then the Army. In 1946 he went back to writing stories for publication in the USA and decided to try a modified form of science fiction, a form he called 'logical fantasy'. John Wyndham died in March 1969. - The Day Of The Triffids: Popular Penguins By John Wyndham (Paperback)",
