  "description": "Fools, the title story in this collection, is a tale of generations in the struggle against oppression. Zamani is a middle-aged teacher who was once respected by the community as a leader of the future. Then he disgraced himself, and now he’s haunted by the impotence of his present life. A chance meeting brings him up against Zani, a young student activist whos attempts to kindle the flames of resistance in Charterston Location are ludicrously impratical. Both affection and hostility bind Zamani and Zani together in an intens and unpredictable relationship. Finding each other means finding the common ground of their struggle. It also means re-examining their lives – and, notably, their relationships with women. The Test, The Prophetess, and The Music of the Violin all deal with formative experiences in a township childhood: an act of courage and endurance; a close encounter with an awe-inspiring old woman; a choice which must be made between the narrow ambitions of middle-class parents and the challenge of the township streets, at once more inviting and more dangerous.Uncle celebrates the gift of one generation to another: a gift that mingles with other adventures of the spirit, recklessness with resourcefulness, and laughter with wisdom.",
