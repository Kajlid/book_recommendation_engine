Simon Westfield, the Duke of Blackmoor, is rich, powerful, and sinfully handsome, and has spent his entire life creating scandal and mayhem.

But Simon's idea of assistance is far different than hers, and Lily finds herself ensconced in his house and engaged to the rogue.They both may have bitten off more than they can chew when each begins to discover the other's darkest secrets...",
