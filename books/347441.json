  "description": "Living in Philadelphia, a young woman tries to outrun her regrets and the reoccurring approach of dawn with nothing but controlled substances, unfulfilling sex and sarcasm to sustain her anti-quest. Unable to find solace in her best friend Jason, her partner in crime Kat or her pot smoking mother she embarks on a relentless pursuit of distraction which leads her to New York and back, through night clubs, dive bars and dingy apartments until she finds herself hurtling towards a point where there is no up, only down.Then she notices a man on a train reading a book she loves, and convinced he is her only chance at salvation, sets out on mission to find out who he is. Infatuation becomes obsession and as her grip on reality shakes loose, she sinks to previously unfathomable lows before learning that redemption is never so close as when you hit the bottom.With dark humor and a biting tone, this compelling story moves along like a train careening down the track, leaving the reader pulling for its perfectly flawed heroine to the very last page.",
