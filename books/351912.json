  "description": "The scandal surrounding the Flamer's alleged love child has left Jack out in the cold romantically. Nora's journalistic ambition has nearly cost him his job, but he's not sure that any of that matters when his heart is in such dire straits. For her part, Nora seems to have picked up and moved on, working with the Fader to get to the bottom of the superhero sex scandal she broke -- and which may very well be a fake. Little does she know that Jack's cat, the furball also known as the Future Feline, is dogging her, suspicious of the girl's true motives. It's a complicated world when flying crimefighters patrol your skies...but an old romantic like Andi Watson is ready to tackle these super affairs of the heart with the usual wry wit and skillful brush strucks that earned him an Eisner nomination.",
