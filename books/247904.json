  "description": "Idiot is a powerful coming of age story about a girl who beats the odds and moves between two worlds from a drug addicted mother to a nurturing adoptive family. Idiot forces you think about the choices we're all destined to make and strikes a perfect balance between love and loss.Although Idiot was inspired by a true story, it is entirely a work of fiction. So many women could write stories of their own abuse and struggle trying to blend into young adulthood. This book transitions the reader from a young and unknowing girl to a beautiful young woman and provides a unique glimpse into the private life of Eva Langston through her diary entries.This story was written with the hope it may help others ease into and through difficult transitions. Although abuse never goes away, it is sometimes dealt with in a manner that allows survivors to move forward and blossom.This work is dedicated to all young people who havenâ€™t yet found their way.",
