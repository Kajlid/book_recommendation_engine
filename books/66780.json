Some would say she was 'running away'. Sam would tell you she wanted to 'find' herself. Whatever the reason for her travels, the very last thing she wants to 'find' is love, especially after her only other disastrous experience with it.When money runs low, Sam finds a job working as a Jillaroo (Aussie cowgirl) on a sheep station in the Australian outback. Little does she know that the station owner's son just happens to be the same gorgeous guy she sat next to on the plane over from England. The very same guy who tried to sweep her off her feet during her stopover in Bali.If that wasn't enough to deal with, she has her suspicions that the sheep have launched a secret vendetta against her. Not to mention the spiders, the snakes, and the shearers...Oh my!A heart-warming romantic comedy that will have you wondering if this is what would have happened if Bridget Jones had met The Man from Snowy River instead.",
