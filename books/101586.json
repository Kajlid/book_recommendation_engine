  "description": "Chaos has come to the northern kingdom of Delranan. King Badron's house is invaded; his son murdered and his daughter kidnapped. Badron's desire for revenge pushes the north into a long anticipated war. Confident of neighboring Rogscroft's involvement in the attack, Badron orders his feared Wolfsreik, an army without equal, to attack and destroy his enemies. The ship The Sea Wolf returns to Delranan during the night of the attack and is quickly hired to hunt down and return the dead or alive. Mercenaries and sell swords answer his call; none stranger than the seemingly feeble old Anienam Keiss, a man claiming to be the last living wizard and hiding the failures from a dark past and the mysterious warrior woman from the deep southern Rekka Jel. She comes with a dire warning. A dread evil has awakened and threatens to consume Malweir in a wave of fury. It begins in Delranan.",
