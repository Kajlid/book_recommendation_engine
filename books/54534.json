  "description": "The Mountains2nd Edition Take a break from academics, enjoy the Colorado Rockies, fight a fire now and then. That's all Jake Landon expected when he signed up to be a ranger. He'll partner with some crusty old mountain man; they'll patrol the wilderness in a tanker, speak three words a day, and Old Crusty won't be alluring at all. A national forest is big enough to be Jake's closet--he'll spend his free time fishing. Except Old Crusty turns out to be Kurt confident, competent, and experienced. He's also young, hot, friendly, and considers clothing optional when it's just two guys in the wilderness. Sharing a small cabin with this walking temptation is stressing Jake's sanity--is he sending signals, or just being Kurt? And how would Kurt react if he found out his new partner wants to start a fire of a different kind? Jake's terrified--they have to live together for five months no matter what. Enough sparks fly between the rangers to set the trees alight, but it takes a raging inferno to make Jake and Kurt admit to the heat between them. First Electronic Edition published by Torquere Press (2009). Bonus Short Into the Mountains Long before he met Jake, Kurt Carlson climbed Yosemite with his best friend, Benji. But after a storm traps them halfway up the face of El Capitan, Kurt has to accept that their friendship isn't what he thought.",
