Her business is drowning with past due accounts, difficult customers and crazy repossessions. In order to get the vacation of her dreams, Julia makes a deal with her husband.After catching a burglar, tackling a customer, and looking down the barrel of a gun, it's clear to this feisty car dealer that her vacation may be harder to achieve than she thought.

She could blame it on the contractor, the cheap casket, or the naked friend, but she'd rather blame it on the car lot.",
