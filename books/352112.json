As church secretary Cindy Preston prepares for the Easter service, she literally stumbles across a dead body in the sanctuary. A prominent church member has been stabbed to death in the locked church. With whispers and suspicions surrounding the members of the congregation, Rabbi Jeremiah Silverman, from the Jewish temple next door, helps Cindy search for the truth.

Fighting against time, the rabbi and the church secretary work together, learning more about each other and their faiths as they seek to expose the truth. But what secret is the rabbi hiding?",
