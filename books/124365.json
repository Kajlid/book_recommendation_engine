  "description": "When Alethea Newnham first came to London, her fashionable Aunt despaired of finding her a husband. Outspoken, lacking in feminine arts, and worst of all, clever, Alethea found more pleasure in literary circles than in the delights of the Season.  Fortunately her beauty rivalled her intellect . . . She soon captivated Sir James Devenish, the elegant Beau and notorious flirt. But Alethea despised both his reputation and frivolity – she found the shy poet, Paul Tracy, an admirer more to her taste.  Yet she allowed Beau was uncommonly handsome, and his languid manner masked a mind surprisingly in tune with her own. But reason must rule her heart – she had no intention of becoming his latest conquest . . .   Praise for Alice Chetwynd Ley  'A romantic page-turner from a master story-teller' - Robert Foster, best-selling author of The Lunar Code  'Certainly recommended for Regency fans who also love a mystery... its greatest charm is an airy evocation of Regency aristocracy's speech, dress, and mores' - Kirkus Reviews  Alice Chetwynd Ley (1913 - 2004) was a British writer of romance novels. She was the sixth elected Chairman of the Romantic Novelists' Association and was named honour life member. Her other titles include The Guinea Stamp and The Jewelled Snuff Box.",
