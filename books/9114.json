  "description": "Laura McHale Holland's world turns upside down when her mother committs suicide, leaving three daughters under the age of five alone with an ashamed and shattered father. To repair the damage he quickly remarries, bringing home a woman he hopes can take his late wife's place. But the children don't know what to make of this new harsh and bitter parent. The stepmother promises her husband she'll care for the girls better than their own mother. Instead she subjects them to constant abuse and seems determined to grind them down to nothing. Will this malevolent woman destroy the bonds of sisterly love, or will the little girls survive their never-ending nightmare? Told in the voice of her younger self, Holland's searing memoir is ultimately a triumph of strength and forgiveness in the face of adversity.
