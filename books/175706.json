  "title": "A Modern Look at Monsters",
  "description": "\"This was a very useful, informative, and accessible overview of the cryptozoological scene when it was first published in 1970. But, with the possible exception of the first few chapters, there have been substantial developments in just about every subject covered. Some developments are merely the fading of interest since the book was first published. The great sea serpent has faded almost entirely from the public consciousness in the past 40 years and probably should be grouped the monsters of purely historical interest like the dragon, the basilisk, or the griffin. Similarly, while the abominable snowman (aka yeti) still commands some recognition from the public, its temperate cousin the bigfoot or Sasquatch has long since displaced it in the public's interest. But at the time the book was published bigfoot was just beginning his rise to paranormal prominence thanks to the 1967 Patterson/Gimlin film. Hence, Cohen devotes much more space to the former.\"",
