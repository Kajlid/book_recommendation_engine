Add a good detective squeezed out of the loop by an overzealous narcotic detective; a robust prison union calling bad shots; a handful of drug criminals trying to find their conscience and you have the perfect recipe for a revolutionary uprising, bound by blood, all leaving the reader wondering, who are the real criminals? A view never before seen, from the inside of the criminal justice system looking out.",
