After a laboratory mishap, inventor-in-training Angus Clark finds himself aboard the Fearsome Flea. The pirate crew mistakes the middle schooler for his alter ego, a dirty, rude cannon boy. Clever Angus must face a sea battle and a nasty mutineer, and walk the plank. Will the scientific Angus survive life on the leaky Fearsome Flea? Why is Maniacal Marge out to get him? Will Angus ever return to his own world? And can Mrs. Clark endure the mischievous pirate who now lives under her roof?

While working on his latest invention, Angus accidentally transports himself to a parallel universe where pirates still terrorize the waters. Along the way, he discovers that his most loyal friend may very well be that annoying girl in his math class.D.M. DARROCH introduces the Inventor-in-Training trilogy with smoke and a sizzle.
