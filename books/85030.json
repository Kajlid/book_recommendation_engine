But with undercurrents sizzling like live power cables between him and his kids' hunky Latino nanny, he's finding it hard to maintain his distance.Louis promises Dan-and himself-that just one encounter will get the lust out of both their systems. But it's only the beginning...and when Louis's past crawls out of the shadows, dirty secrets threaten to destroy not only his own future, but the family he has come to love. Hot male loving and sweet family bonding-not bondage, bond\"ing,\" perv!",
