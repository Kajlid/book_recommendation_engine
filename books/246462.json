  "description": "Yahiro never thought she would end up in prison. Let alone on a prison ship where escape was impossible. But none of that mattered anymore because while she was curled up in the corner of her cell, the lights went out.And when they turned back on it was worse.Ending up on a planet—one so different than Earth—greeted by the screams of those who were injured in the crash and the corpses of those who didn't make it, she sets off with the survivors in hopes of finding a way home.What she finds instead are three golden aliens that won't let her out of their sight, a city on the back of a giant beast, and a ghost world that will never let her leave.Please click below in All Editions to find the correct version that you read.",
