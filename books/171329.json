In addition, he explains latter-day revelance for each chapter and shows how these scriptures can strengthen our homes, families, and testimonies. A talk on CD is included in the back of the book, featuring John’s unique teaching style. After reading and listening to Isaiah for Airheads, you’ll echo the feeling, “great are the words of Isaiah!” Hardcover book with Talk on CD!",
