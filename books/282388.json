  "description": "When Simone set off from New Zealand in the early 1990s, eager to experience what the world had to offer, she couldn't have imagined how things would develop. The Iron Curtain was falling and the world seemed to be opening up to nations previously cut off from the western world. Against this backdrop of change, she was one of a group of Kiwi friends who would embark on the journey of a lifetime called 'The Serious Road Trip'. Initially sparked off by the plight of the orphans in Romania, they planned to travel by red double-decker bus from London to New Zealand working with underprivileged children en route. The one-year itinerary was mapped out, but fate would intervene and the Bosnian war broke out in 1992 as they started their journey. Compelled by circumstance, the bus joined a Peace Convoy into Sarajevo in the hope of stopping the war. They became the first British-based group to break this infamous siege in June 1992. With compassionate hearts and living day by day, they endeavoured to meet some of the needs of orphans and refugees in many of the most remote and dangerous war-torn regions. They captured hearts and imaginations as they 'juggled' their way across borders and checkpoints in Bosnia-H, Croatia, Romania and elsewhere. Travelling in colourful trucks or by red London bus they developed their own unique and maverick form of humanitarian relief where keeping your sense of humour became a matter of survival.",
