  "description": "The first book in the Lynch Brothers series.  Sophie’s romantic life has been at a standstill since she broke off her engagement with her cheating ex-fiancé. So, of course, she wins a once in a lifetime, all expenses paid, honeymoon vacation–with no husband to bring along. But when her sexy boss, Derrick, makes her an offer that’s too good to refuse, it leads to a steamy week in paradise. The only problem with this honeymoon fake-out is that it’s starting to fool her, too. And it has to be too good to be true, right?  If you are looking for a breezy read with alpha males, insta-love, and steamy chemistry, then you’re in the right place. The happily ever afters (HEAs) are guaranteed, because the men and women in these stories aren’t afraid to stake an everlasting claim to the objects of their desire. So, cuddle up, pull the blinds, and settle in for a good time.",
