  "description": "They've got no strings...and they want revenge.  The people of the city of Vetri are turning into wooden statues...  ...and Beaumont and Beasley are not on the case.  Not technically, anyway. This case must fall to two of their employees, the faun Gareth Llewellyn and the dryad Sylvia Kirke.  True, Gareth and Sylvia don't have a great deal of experience, but this shouldn't be too difficult. The solution to the mystery is fairly obvious, and the evil magical force at work will be no great challenge to defeat.  Unless Gareth and Sylvia make a terrible mistake that puts Vetri on the brink of destruction, of course.  The dark legacy of Geppetto is more dangerous than anyone realizes...and an old enemy is about to make his move.  The end of Beaumont and Beasley has begun.",
