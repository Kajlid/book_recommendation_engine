  "description": "Jake Webster thought spending two weeks of leave from a combat zone would be a relaxing event. Just before he arrived, he started to notice lapses in his memory. Not simple lapses people experience as they age such as lost keys, forgotten names, or forgotten birthdays. No, these lapses ran deeper than that. Suddenly, he couldn't recall his childhood, his parents, his friends. To add to this, he can't reach his parents via phone. Naturally, the first thing Jake did was to reach out to his best friend, Chad Wells, an eccentric inventor for the UNIS Corporation and DARPA, but Chad seems to have disappeared as well and can't be located. With the help of his ex-girlfriend, Allison Deming, Jake embarks and in many ways, is pulled into a journey to recover his lost memory and find his best friend. This journey takes the two of them beyond Earth in search for answers and as things spiral out of control and become crazier than Jake could ever have imagined; he will be exposed to a past he can't believe and a future he can't ignore. Will Jake Webster find his friend? Will he find his memory? Find out answers to these questions and more in what is to be the first book of The Universal Alliance Chronicles.",
