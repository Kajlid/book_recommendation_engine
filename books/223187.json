  "description": "Fairy Tales are very literal survival guides. Ignore them at your peril…Nate Temple has gotten away with a lot in recent years: cow-tipping the Minotaur, decimating a gang of weredragons, sucker-punching Angels, and eating pancakes with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. He’s kidnapped one of the most powerful wizards on the planet and slaughtered the Brothers Grimm. Lady Luck has been very good to Nate Temple…Until now.Nate's good fortune has turned, catching the attention of a recruiter—the kind of person who offers jobs that can’t be refused…The kind of job that comes with perks like selling your soul to your new employer. That’s when a wizard tastes real fear—when he learns that all the biggest, baddest monsters actually work for the same guy—and they do so against their will.Silver Tongue…The nightmare everyone both knows, and doesn't know…Lady Luck better have one more good toss of the dice for Nate, or this will be the last game he ever plays. Unless…he can find a way to cheat the House.",
