They built a great life together, but careers, a baby, and years of mounting tension later, they are living separate lives and their once grand love is forgotten. After an accident, Gretchen suffers a brain injury that erases years of her memories. She wakes in the hospital with Jax at her side and everything seems normal…except Jax won’t look her in the eye and their baby boy is now a rambunctious toddler. Every line drawn between Jax and Gretchen starts to blur while Gretchen fights to figure out which of her most haunting recollections are real, and which are fake.Is it possible for this accident to be the second chance neither Jax nor Gretchen knew they wanted?Cover Artist: Tammy SeidickGenres: Contemporary / Romance",
