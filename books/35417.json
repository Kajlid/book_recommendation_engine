  "description": "Cry Wolf saved Andrea's life, or that's how she likes to tell it. Forever in search of spiritual fulfillment, Andrea has rejected everything from religion to eating disorders, in favor of \"I'm-with-the-band\" style fanaticism, all centered on Cry Wolf, a brother-sister folk/rock duo with an eccentric hodgepodge of followers. When Andrea meets fellow groupie Jordan outside a concert, their connection is Jordan is powerfully seductive, and Andrea is intrigued by Jordan’s lawless ways. Their romance escalates as they follow Cry Wolf around the country, but as Jordan becomes increasingly manipulative and unreliable, Andrea begins to realize that her passion for Jordan has turned into yet another addiction. The first time Jordan leaves her, Andrea flees Los Angeles for Chicago, almost relieved, and almost ready to start fresh. But when Jordan arrives unannounced on Andrea’s doorstep, Andrea can’t help it; she’s thrilled.Meet tightly wound, mid-20s, teacher, hotter than she gives herself credit for, less clever than she believes.Meet LA-skinny, ocean eyes, early-40s, perpetual undergraduate student, a liar who believes her own lies.Post-modern in form (lists, 3x5 cards, even the occasional screenplay), but classical in a tale of a girl desperate for something like, but not quite love.",
