  "title": "The Manager",
  "description": "Tina is short, but she packs a wallop. And she knows every move a boxer needs to get to the top. It's 1979, and the glory days of the sport are over. With the family gym about to fold, and her father unwilling to listen to a word she says, Tina explodes and takes off, leaving Sydney's Whitney Pier behind her for good. But it isn't her temper that turns things around, it's a road trip with her sister, and a Mi'kmaw light-heavyweight they meet along the way. Tina's convinced he'll go the distance - with her as Manager.",
