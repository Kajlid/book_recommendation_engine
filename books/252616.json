  "description": "**From USA Today Bestselling author A.M. Madden & Joanne Schwehm comes a uniquely fresh and sexy STANDALONE**Here’s a tip: When you least expect it, expect it.I’d been known to have my share of beautiful women. Usually, I met them in a bar, through a mutual acquaintance, or even when photographing them. Imagine my surprise when a gorgeous blonde drove her car into mine on the way to a party. No more than a minute after our run-in, a string of colorful words flew from her mouth in rapid fire. Unexplainably, the angrier she became the harder I got. All sorts of scenarios played in my head of how I could get her to shut up. I was all for feisty women, but I preferred leaving that for the bedroom—not on the streets of New York. When I learned she was a school teacher, that worsened my disposition. What man didn’t have a dirty teacher fantasy at one point in his life? I decided it was my turn to teach her a thing or two… or so I thought. Little did I know, Miss Prim-and-Proper would turn the tables on me.She called me Mr. Kinky, and that was fine with me.Lesson learned: Desire always trumps logic.",
