  "description": "Poetry. STEPPING OVER SEASONS artfully depicts the finer details of life, encapsulating change within people and places as the seasons unfurl. In \"Overlook,\" Capes argues that it's much easier for great poets to romanticise the world's most classic cities by poetically and playfully ridiculing his own not-so-romantic Australian hometown. Asserting that, in this digital age, everything can be recorded in some way, the poem \"Late Night\" claims there is no longer a need for people to appreciate things \"in the moment.\"",
