  "description": "Jolene is done with pilots. She’s better than just another quick lay-over. But dating is difficult with her chaotic schedule in and out of airport terminals and hotel rooms all around the world. She’s tired of watching couples fly off to romantic destinations and families spending vacations together. However, she doesn’t plan to be a flight attendant forever. She just doesn’t know what she wants to do yet. One thing she does know is that she certainly doesn’t want to do that arrogant Greek bastard Jim.Dimitrios “Jim” Georgakopolous is a contract pilot who loves his job — who wouldn’t when you can pick and choose your own schedule and destination? When a flight cancelation turns into the best layover of his life, he suddenly finds he doesn’t want to leave the arms of a certain dark-haired beauty named Jolene. Unfortunately, the storm that stranded them both there compare little to Jolene’s rage when she finds out he’s pilot. Jim never expected to find his airport tryst again. Jolene certainly didn’t expect to be the stewardess on the same plane that Jim’s traveling on to Greece. Will this be a twist of fate or a modern-day Greek tragedy?",
