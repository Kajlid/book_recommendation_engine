  "description": "The last thing Cole Sunger remembers is the trap door creaking open beneath his feet on the gallows of Arkwood Penitentiary. Now, Cole is awake – aware - in a frighteningly dark realm populated by demonic creatures. Utterly bewildered by his dark supernatural locale, Cole allies himself with two other damned souls, Clancy and Lucy and soon learns he has arrived in Hell amidst a demon uprising. Cole’s only chance of escape is to reach a portal hidden within a cave in the Black Mountains - a portal that will lead him and his companions into the safety of another dimension.",
