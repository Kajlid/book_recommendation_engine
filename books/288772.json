  "title": "The Power of Small: Making Tiny Changes When Everything Feels Too Much",
  "description": "Tiny changes to transform your lifeWe've all set out to change our lives with big plans, bold ideas, and brilliant ambitions. And too often those resolutions and plans have lasted for a day or two before real life swoops in and we are back to normal. Or, perhaps even more frequently, we find ourselves so overwhelmed with life that we feel utterly powerless to even attempt to change anything. The Power of Small offers a way forward. Instead of pushing for large, dramatic changes, Aisling and Trish Leonard-Curtin help readers make small, manageable changes in their lives. Everyday decisions pile up to create transformation.Instead of being daunted by your goals and dreams or paralyzed by the business of life, The Power of Small will help you take the practical, approachable steps that will change your life, even if you feel completely stuck or defeated. As practicing psychologists, Aisling and Trish know first-hand the power of the techniques outlined in The Power of Small and have based their writing on numerous case studies and the latest psychological research. Emphasizing self-compassion and real, actionable steps, The Power of Small will empower you to make big changes in your life--one small step at a time.",
