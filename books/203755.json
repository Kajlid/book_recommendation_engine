Tread carefully, for the dark things best left behind in the forest may seep under your door and sup with you. The lover at your window or in your bed may have the scent of your death already on their breath.Whispered to you from the edges, from the haunted mouths of those who see more than you or I, here are twelve tales of lust and rivalry, of envy and deceit, and of secrets gouged from the darkest depths of the human heart.Is the shadow on the wall, really yours, after all?Darkly delicious imaginings for the adult connoisseur of bedtime stories.",
