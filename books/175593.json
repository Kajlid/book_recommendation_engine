  "description": "This is the first collection of translations in English of stories originally written in Malayalam by Kamala Das under the pen name Madhavikutty. They amply demonstrate Kamala Das's special contribution to the short story in Malayalam. All the major attributes of her writing are evident: her subtlety and power in dealing with human relationships and intrigues of love, life and death and her earthiness, sensuousness and sensuality.",
