  "description": "Bloomie, they say, couldn’t find the hole in the middle of a bagel; her challah is missing a braid; she can’t remember which is her side of the eruv. Eager for her to get married, her parents conspire to advertise in the personals, and Adirondack Mendel arrives in Chelm’s Pond looking for love. But Bloomie, angry at her parents for advertising, will have nothing to do with him. They might never have come together if not for Aufruf, the talking spy dog who learned a bissel Yiddish when he worked for Colin Powell. In her anxiety before their marriage, Bloomie implores Adirondack Mendel to gain the respect of the community. But first, he confesses, he’s not Jewish. How can he convert since he’s an atheist? How can he lead the Shabbat service if he doesn’t believe in prayer? Only Rabbi Chayim “who looks to heaven,” aka Rabbi Chayim Shmayim, can solve these vexing problems.It all takes place in Chelm’s Pond, centrally isolated in New York’s Adirondack Mountains — the steep valley where every acre is two acres, you can till the soil with a teaspoon, and there are not only four seasons, there are five — where the ridiculous stories of Chelm meet the preposterous tall tales of the Adirondacks and generate compelling questions about the nature of God and the meaning of prayer.You're invited to Adirondack Mendel’s Aufruf. Welcome to Chelm’s Pond.",
