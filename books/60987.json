  "description": "This edition is no longer available. - - - He was supposed to trap him - not fall in love. When government agent and Ethereal Being hunter, Denny, has to imprison an elf in his garage overnight, his life spins out of control. Caught and cuffed on the London Underground, Kit shatters everything Denny's been taught about elves. How can Kit be a dangerous, mind-reading cipher who preys on human emotions? Kit's gorgeous and funny, he's got a cute arse. He even shares Denny's quiet kinks for bondage and cross-dressing. Or so Kit claims. When Kit wiles his way into Denny's house for a session of mind-blowing sex, the elf seems too good to be true - till reality strikes. Denny's made love to an elf. A prisoner in his charge. If he doesn't take Kit to the containment depot he's in big trouble, and Kit's about to drop an equally devastating bombshell. The elf's been searching a thousand years for a bloke like Denny. He \"gets\" Denny's kinks, adores role play and women's panties, and now he needs Denny's love to survive. Is Kit preying on Denny's emotions, or can Denny trust him? If so, dare Denny break the law and gamble his life to save the Ethereal Being in his bed?
