  "description": "Alvin woke in a room that was not his, to discover that he had died and his brain had been bargained off cheaply to pay off someone else's debt. It did not sit well with him. It didn't surprise him that even in death, people were still using him for their own purposes. He had never exactly been a good guy, but everyone had their breaking point, and he had found his.The bastards in charge had uploaded his mind into a virtual death game. The whole world could now pay to see him play it and probably die. Alvin questioned whether he was really a bad guy, if this is how they wanted to treat him. Regardless, he was not about to wait for death to come for him. He would kick open the damn Apocalypse Gates and see about crushing everything that challenged him. It was time to make the world aware that he was done with pretending to be nice.Welcome to Apocalypse Gates!(This audiobook contains adult themes, including gore, death, drug use, and graphic sex.)",
