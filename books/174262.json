  "description": "Wil Rice has been a Dom for over ten years, but he has yet to find the perfect submissive to share his dark desires. Maybe he wants too much. He’s looking for the whole package—a partner, a lover, a man who will trust him enough to surrender body and mind.Wil plays at an underground sex party, and a scene with Aiden Murphy convinces him that he’s found his submissive. But Aiden belongs to someone else—a sadistic police chief who’s not about to give up his property. Wil knows he should walk away, but he’s hooked. He can’t get Aiden out of his head, and he’ll do anything to get his hands on the boy again.",
