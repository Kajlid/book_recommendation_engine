  "title": "The Gospel of Judas",
  "description": "The Gospel of Judas is the story of an American priest brought to Rome to decipher an ancient scroll that appears to be a Gospel written by Judas - with a very different view of Christ's crucifixion from the ones handed down in the Bible. Already beset by a crisis of faith and on the brink of his first sexual affair, Father Leo Newman must tease out the meaning of this document even as he wrestles with its authenticity and what its revelations mean for him. This is a profound book about loss, faith, redemption, and the possibility of a complete re-interpretation of Christianity. It is also a love story and a literary suspense thriller that is impossible to put down.",
