  "description": "Ventryvia is a land of wizards, dragons, and magic that has been taken over by an evil wizard who confines King Kylandar to the third floor of his palace while the wizard continues running the country in the king's name. Since an army of the wizard's enforcers stand between the king and any chance of escape, Kylandar's best option may be a stranger named Max Strider, who offers to help. But Max is no wizard, though he does have some unusual contraptions he uses. What chance does Max's inventions, training as an engineer, and technologies have against the most powerful wizard on the planet--especially after the wizard vows to destroy him?",
