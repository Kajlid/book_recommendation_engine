  "description": "We all have our moments- those moments that break in and wreck our carefully placed façade. The poems of Private show how each shard of that broken exterior makes up the inner pieces of who we are– the deep down beliefs that torment us and some days threaten to take over. Private tells us that even the most carefully shrouded individuals have a downward spiral of thoughts that they deal with but that those thoughts can be conquered and in the end the deep, torturous beliefs can be released and our private realm becomes our sanctuary instead of our dungeon.",
