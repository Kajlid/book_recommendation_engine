  "description": "Old hurt runs deepâ€¦  After she left, I was given a second chance at life thanks to my savior and adoptive father. A chance I refused to waste. Determined to be invincible, I became a true fighter in every sense of the word. Nothing and no one would get in my way.  Not even the guy who sat behind me in class.  Zack Graves had the entire world in his hands. A promising hockey career and the confidence and gorgeous looks that had every girl throwing themselves at his feet.  Except me. I was only too happy to wipe the sexy smirk off his face while tossing him on his smug ass.  And he kept coming back for more.  I kept my scars hidden, until Zack managed to trace the lines straight to a place I fought to keep guarded.  Zack was fighting his own immortality, his own scars becoming visible the closer we got. He challenged my guard at every turn forcing me to fight harder, only to realize he would be my undoing.  But some wounds refuse to heal.",
