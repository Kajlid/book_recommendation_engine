  "description": "Jake opened the next drawer and froze. There was a file toward the middle. It was raised above the others, like it had been recently crammed back into the overstuffed drawer. It was clearly labeled 'Jake's Adoption Papers.' 'What the ?' He stood frozen, his jaw dropped, sucking in air. Finally, he managed, 'Silver. Honey, come here! Silver, look what I found! Look! This can't be!' 'Who am I really?' That's what Dr. Jake Sorenson asked himself after finding his own adoption papers in his dad's filing cabinet after his parents' unexpected death. This alarming discovery about his childhood sends Jake's mind into a tailspin and brings anger and confusion into his otherwise privileged life in south Mobile, Alabama. Jake quickly realizes that in order to bring total peace back to his life, he must first forgive the people who kept this startling secret from him all these years a task that, as he finds out, is not as easy as it seems. Is true forgiveness more than a spur-of-the-moment apology? Find out in Eldon Reed's riveting and compelling novel, Indebted.",
