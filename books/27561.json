  "description": "For hundreds of years Elek Keros never questioned the way of his kind. Until the moment his soul awakens and he finds himself in love with a human. But how can he bridge the divide between their two worlds and claim what is rightfully his? Content with his life, Elek Keros never questions the ways of the Unicorn. Until one night the sense of something coming awakens him from a deep sleep. He breaks Unicorn law by leaving the enchanted glade his kind lives in to search for what is calling to him. Each night he returns home without answers, but he cannot stop entering the forest day after day to find what he seeks. The answer lies in a small child Elek rescues. Over the years, he watches over the boy, learns all that he can about the human and steadily falls in love with him. But how can the love he feels possibly breach the divide between their two worlds?",
