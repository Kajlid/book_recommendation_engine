I really enjoyed the idea behind this book as it is a question that we all ask at some time in our lives.\" -- Readers' Favorite\"The Death of Death by K. N. Parker is a gorgeous fairytale like story that is equal parts haunting and beautiful... Parker manages to weave this truly dark tale in a tone that can only be described as sweet... The amount of imagery in this book was great from the description of the guides to the world around them...\" -- Online Book ClubSYNOPSIS:Death guides usually have rather normal names like John, Mary, Harry, and Jessica. And even ones not quite so normal, like Bartholomew or Ambrosia. They also have the most interesting tales behind their deaths. But one particular death guide has a few problems: she cannot remember her name or the details of her demise, and thus has no story of her own. One fateful night, she meets a young girl that may change her death forever.Inspired by and in the style of Children's tales of old, The Death of Death is a tragic, yet sweet little tale about loss and acceptance. Suitable for ages 12 and up.",
