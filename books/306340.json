  "description": "A troubled prince. A deadly curse. A mysterious cup.And the power to save or doom the kingdom. Of course things didn’t go as planned at the Royal Games. When do things go as planned? Now Zora is on the run, and has to join a disgraced prince in order to retrieve a powerful magical artifact that might undo her valley’s curse. For the first time in her life, she has real hope for her people. Problem is, for the second time in her life, she’s falling for someone she shouldn’t. Finding a hidden object is hard enough on its own, she could do without the heart palpitations and lack of air. And she could certainly focus better without the constant memory of his lips on hers, his arms around her… Gaah! See? How can she avoid pursuers and decipher enigmatic writings when her brain has been turned to mush? Painful, hopeless mush. But the real trouble is that there’s more than one curse in the kingdom. And not enough objects or time to get rid of them all. The Curse and the Prince is book 2 in the series Kingdom of Curses and Shadows, an enemies-to-lovers or hate-to-love YA romantic fantasy for readers 15 and up who love witty banter, adventure, and magic.",
