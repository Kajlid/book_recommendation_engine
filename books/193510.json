  "description": "First they learned to fly penguins-tricky birds that almost never flew in a straight line.Then, the best of them, went on to master the coveted Hispano Spads, sleek ships that refused to go down.And those who could stand the firey pace became the men of the Lafayette Flying Corps, ready to do combat with the top German aces.Facing crackling machine-gun fire, the wings of their planes often riddled with bullets, they struck at the heart of the enemy's winged power.",
