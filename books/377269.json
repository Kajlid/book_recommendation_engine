A confirmed bachelor, he can barely handle the brides that come in wanting buttercream this and frosted that. Yet when family friend Caroline Scott offers to help out, Logan isn't relieved. Caroline is his polar opposite. He's motorcycles and wildlifeâ€”she's business suits and ledgers. The one thing they have in common? Not wanting to get married. Until everyone else's wedding cake wishes have them dreaming of their own.",
