  "description": "A Gentleman's Game is the story of young Timmy Price, whose mastery of the game of golf inspires awe among the adult membership and envy among his peers on the shaded fairways and immaculate greens of exclusive Fox Chase Country Club. But when his self-made father forces Timmy to become a caddy at the club to teach him a lesson in humility, he is thrown into the hardscrabble world of the behind-the-scenes workers who make the game possible. And when his best friend and fellow looper, Jamie Byrne, abruptly stops showing up at the caddy hole, it begins a series of events that will force Timmy to confront the dark secret that hides behind the community of Fox Chase. Soaring and lyrical, A Gentleman's Game is an internationally acclaimed debut about an extraordinary young man and the game he loves that is like no other. \"A stunning first novel.... It will make you love language. And it might help you understand what a man wants.\" -- Melissa Katsoulis, The Times (London) \"An emerging writer's master stroke.\" -- Gary Mullinax, Wilmington News Journal \"A Gentleman's Game has tremendous heart.... A book about fathers and sons, and a great one at that.\" -- Joey Sweeney, Philadelphia Weekly",
