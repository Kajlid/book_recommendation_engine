The treacherous demons from a past she never knew she had, are coming for her.  Only the Gypsies know how to deal with the monsters of myth, but can she trust them? Nicholas proves less than truthful from the get-go but who else can she hold onto amongst a sea of mystic if not hostile strangers? He is dangerous, captivating, and the only one who she knows will stand toe to toe with the creatures of the dark that seek her. But what will it cost and is it a price she can afford to pay? In search for the truth Piper will find more than her identity. She will discover her destiny, what she is made of, and the family that determines her fate.",
