  "description": "Andy Larkham is late. He is due at the funeral of his favourite school teacher, who once told 'It's hard work being anyone.' It's especially hard for Andy - stuck in a dead-end job, terminally short of cash and with a fianc√©e who is about to ditch him. When the funeral leads to unexpected consequences, Andy has to ask how far will he go to change his life?From early-twentieth-century Turkey to modern day London, Nicholas Shakespeare takes us on an extraordinary journey that explores the temptations of unexpected wealth, the secrets of damaged families and the price of being true to oneself. At once a love story spanning many decades and a tragedy of betrayal and missed opportunities, it is a romance for our times.",
