  "description": "These stories precede all of Nin’s published work to date. In them are many sources of the more mature work that collectors and growing writers can appreciate. Written when Anaïs Nin was in her twenties and living in Louveciennes, France, these stories contain many elements that will delight her details remembered from childhood, of life in Paris, the cafés, theatres; characters including dancers, artists, writers, women who devote themselves to their work and visions as well as romance, strangers met in the night; themes such as the scruples of lovers, the search for brilliant, imaginative living; the writer’s experimentation with exotic words like “sybaritic” and “violaceous”. In the craft of these stories readers are treated to a deft sense of humor, ironic wit, much conversation as well as ecstatic prose, and surprise endings. Throughout all, the Nin personality shines, a wonderful mixture of feeling and rationality, of vulnerability and strength.",
