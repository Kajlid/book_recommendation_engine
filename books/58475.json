  "description": "Joey and His Friend Water is a playful book that introduces children and their parents to the idea that everything around us from people, to plants, to trees, to rocks, is energy vibrating at different speeds. And, in this way, everything in the universe is connected. The importance of the water cycle, mycelium and trees in healing the earth is talked about alongside Maseru Imoto's work on water and the idea that the way in which water reacts to words and emotions has implications for our bodies and our environment.",
