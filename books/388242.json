  "title": "Soul in Love",
  "description": "Soul in Love is a fictitious paranormal romance that centers on a seventeen year old girl named Amber Olive. One evening, after spending time together, Amber and her boyfriend, London, end up in a horrible car accident in which she somehow survives, but her boyfriend does not. Then, while Amber mourns his death, she begins to see and feel London again. At first, she questions her sanity, but then starts to believe in him. Through this newfound belief, she takes a metaphysical journey which ultimately answers the questions to London's appearances and her own reality. This book deals with the issues of loss, grief, and love. It challenges the idea of how far we will go to try and get back the person we once loved; even after something as profound as death. Soul in Love also raises questions relating to what each of us will truly believe after something tragic happens-spiritually and otherwise.",
