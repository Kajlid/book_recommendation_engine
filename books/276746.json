  "description": "It's hard to believe it's almost over. After three years of living in the wildest apartment in the craziest neighborhood, the clock is ticking down. College is ending. My friends and I, known around Violent Circle as the Frat Hell Guys, have managed to make it to graduation without a major injury or arrest record. It was a close call. My career path as a video game designer is laid out clearly before me, but I have one more objective to achieve before the school year is over; show the beautiful, stubborn, infuriating woman I’m in love with that she’s mine. She just doesn’t know it yet.  Can be read as a standalone.",
