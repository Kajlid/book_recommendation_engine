  "description": "(Gay Dark Fantasy)When Erick disappeared it wasn’t that big of a surprise. Ben’s drug-addicted, lowlife brother was always pissing off dangerous people, so it was easy to assume he’d made the wrong person mad. Sure it sucked, but Ben got over it.Then one night, four years after Erick vanished, Ben comes face-to-face with a mysterious man with silver hair, the same person who was last seen with Erick. After a failed attempt to get answers from him, Ben becomes obsessed with finding the silver-haired man he’s sure killed his brother. Though who he ends up finding isn’t quite his brother’s killer, but an odd young man with pointed ears, who brings Ben to a new world that he’d never fathomed existed.And all the more baffling, this strange-looking young man is telling Ben that not only does he need Ben to help him save their kingdom from a rebel king…… that rebel king is none other than Erick.",
