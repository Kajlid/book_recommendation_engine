  "description": "Bartholomew Bartleby knows who killed Jack the Ripper. In the dark streets of deepest London, Bartholomew searches for answers. But when the answers find him, he's thrown into a hidden world of the creepy, the crawly, and the downright monstrous. Under the tutelage of—or perhaps, kidnapped by—one of the last hunters fighting the secret war between man and monster, Bartholomew investigates the death of a man seemingly dropped from the sky, the latest in a series of murders around the city. One tenuous link connects them all - the legendary Bethlehem Hospital... Bedlam. As Bartholomew and his mentor immerse themselves in this new mystery, others begin to surround him with their nagging questions; who is the cackling coach driver with silver hair and laughing eyes? Why is the house tended by a giant, undead creature, who serves sandwiches as delicate as their voice? Why does everyone flinch from his mentor, the man who works beside him? Just who is Jean Reynard?Beasts of London is the debut novel from Australian author, Jonathan Maloney, and is the first in the Method of the Kill series.",
