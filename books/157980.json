  "description": "For Willow, relationships have never been a high priority. Focused entirely on her university studies, she is content to plod along, keeping to herself, leading a quiet and uneventful and entirely controllable existence. When she meets Max, not only does he catch her off guard with his irresistable enthusiasm, he also catches her heart and it's not until after she's fallen in love that she realises Max is not all he intially seemed to be.For Jace, relationships equate to putting yourself on the line and he has no intention of letting anyone in. When he finds himself confronted with an ugly truth about his family, he turns to an old friend and quickly learns that accepting and giving love is not always as simple as making a choice.For Roni, escaping an abusive relationship was the best thing to have ever happened to her. Focused only on taking care of her young daughter and coming to terms with some terrible news about her mother, she is not prepared for falling in love and sees no room in her life for anyone else. But Michael is determined to show her just how worthy she is and despite her inhibitions, she takes a leap into the unknown by letting him into her ordered world and in turn, makes a significant difference to his.A coming of age story that explores the many facets of being in a relationship, the highs and the pitfalls, and the deep truth that who you fall in love with is not necessarily who you get in the end.",
