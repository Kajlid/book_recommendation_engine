  "description": "Edinburgh has always seemed like a magical place; with its rolling hills and towering abodes, everything seems possible. Perhaps, its just magical enough that Saatchi, illustrious marathon runner and notorious college student, can finally leave her past grievances beneath her thrumming feet. Even newcomer Emmylou, running away from an oppressive past, may be able to find exactly what she's been missing out on in from under her mother's heel. But, is it magic enough for the both of them? Or are they destined to trip before the finish line? Saatchi Saatchi just wants to run. It's all she's ever known and it's all she's ever loved. The cobblestones of Edinburgh thrumming below her feet are her only peace of mind as she grieves her past self. But she's lost all of the freedom with the mounting pressure to make her once adored hobby a career. Emmylou Emmylou is on the run. She's finally put herself first and decided to take a leap of faith that's led her to a country she's never even visited, all to escape a controlling mother. The problem is, she thought it'd be easy once she made that leap but, instead, it's only made her realize she's just as lost as before.",
