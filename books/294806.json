  "title": "Amaryllis",
  "description": "With Earth at a tipping point from over population and other ills, three siblings embark on a mission to a distant planet with the alluring name, Amaryllis. Among those selected to make the hazardous, four year journey, Ashley, Josh and Jordan travel to the planet on different ships but vow to find each other once they land. When they arrive on Amaryllis, they become leaders in establishing the colonies that will eventually be populated by more people from Earth, a last resort in an effort to save the human race from extinction. Nothing about the mission is easy; however, as they encounter exotic life forms, dangers, and challenges they never imagined in their wildest dreams. Meanwhile, on Earth, their parents struggle to accept the loss of their children and to survive the near total destruction of their world. Justin Freeland's debut novel is a fast paced adventure, a page turner, and a story that could be a foreshadowing of things to come.",
