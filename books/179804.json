  "description": "The second part of EMBER, a three-part series from New York Times and USA Today bestselling author, Deborah Bladon.  Bridget Grant has never met anyone like Dane Beckett. He has been her savior and the more time they've spent together, the more she has realized that he sees only the best in her. He's pushed her to take the steps she needs to in order to change her life and just as she's on the brink of making her dreams come true, it all comes to a screeching, and horrifying, halt.  As Bridget begins to pick up the pieces of her life after a terrifying accident, Dane is right by her side. He offers her the comfort she needs and the more time they spend together, the more she realizes that he's everything she's ever wanted.  His past hangs over both of their heads, stalling the promise of what might be. Bridget worries that she'll lose the only man she's ever truly cared for to a woman she's never even met. She knows she needs to be careful, but her heart is guiding her in a direction she knows she may regret.  When Dane finally makes a decision that will clear the path for the two of them, Bridget is forced to face the shocking truth about the man who she's been sharing her bed with and the life he abandoned the night he met her.  Note: This ends in a cliffhanger. The final part will be released within the next few weeks.",
