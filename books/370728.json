  "title": "Italian Slow and Savory",
  "description": "Italian Slow and Savory celebrates the pleasure of taking time when it comes to friends, family, and good food. In this inspiring cookbook, acclaimed author Joyce Goldstein presents more than 120 recipes for slow-cooked soups, stews, pasta sauces, braises, roasts, and casseroles, with rich, full flavors that are unmatched by faster cooking methods. There is nothing better than slow in the kitchen when these savory favorites are bubbling on the stove or in the oven. Taking time to cook, while leaving cooks time, these dishes are amazingly easy to prepare braised pork ribs and sausages smothered in tomatoes and red wine, fennel-scented beef sauce served over polenta, hearty white bean soup with mussels, lamb stew flavored with citrus-scented olives. In a world where even fast food seems to be getting faster, here is a mouthwatering homage to putting on the brakes and dining the Italian way.",
