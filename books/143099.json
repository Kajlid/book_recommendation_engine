  "description": "First it was water.Then blood.And finally smoke.Gwen Conway never knew there were so many ways to die. Honestly, it was something she would have been happy not knowing.Maybe, they really are just dreams. Nightmares. But they won’t stop. And dreaming of her death is getting old. Then there’s the sleepwalking. She’d like to pass on that too.Gwen’s pretty sure the dreams have something to do with her new job. Which of course, is definitely not just a ‘job.’Don’t get her wrong, working for the Archiver of the Time Streams has its perks. Having the power to travel to any past or future time is fantastic. Plus, there’s Rafe, the ex-gladiator from the future. She’d like to keep him around too. Not that she would tell him that. It’d go straight to his head.But she’s less than pleased to find herself in the middle of a time travelers’ war. Especially against a crazed half-god who has the power to obliterate the existence of any time or place. And the Guardians, her so called allies? All the help they offer is strict rules and smug superiority. Plus, they seem convinced she’s already lost, that she’s already died.Gwen is starting to wonder whether she should have read her employment contract more carefully.",
