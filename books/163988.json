  "description": "Some Marriages End with a Bang. . . Grace McDonald feels blessed - she has a strong marriage, healthy kids, and satisfying work as a therapist. And she has no idea how easily it can all be lost.Some Marriages End with a Whimper. . .For Mandy, marrying a hunk like Danny Rivers is a dream come true. So, when Danny treats her badly, she does what millions of women do to keep their families intact - she makes excuses and puts up with it. Until, one day, she reaches out for help. But in Every Marriage, Without Exception, the Beginning of the End is a Secret. . . Fall from Grace crosses genres. It is a psychological thriller where characters trump action. At the core is a murder, but more compelling is what happens to an array of relationships - friendships, families, therapist and client - in the aftermath. Pitting integrity against DNA, and intuition against evidence, Fall from Grace challenges our illusions of control and our assumptions about who will stand by us when we are faced with the unthinkable.",
