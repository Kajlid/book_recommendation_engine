  "description": "Long before Dracula, vampires stalked the literary scene. These early literary vampires are sometimes terrifying, at times melodramatic, and occasionally ridiculous, but they are always out for bloodâ€”and their vampiric descendants continue to fascinate and captivate us. Beyond the Count is a collection of vampire stories, plays, and poems from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This collection gives students, scholars, and vampire aficionados the opportunity to examine works often long out of print and to contextualize the development of vampire legend beyond that most famous of literary Counts.",
