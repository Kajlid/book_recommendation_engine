  "description": "Max hasn't been handling his wife's death very well, and for the last year, he's been doing his best to keep her memory alive until he can make plans to join her in death. But he has just one thing to do before he goes anywhere. He has to find a place for her beloved cat, Abner. When Max locates a tranquil cat rescue far outside the city, Abner takes immediately to the mysterious proprietor. However, the woman understands far more about Max's situation than he anticipates, and she reveals to him a dark and powerful secret that lies at the heart of her own grief. Abner's Wisdom is a short story that once appeared exclusively in Dickson's collection DEAD WIVES TALES, and it is now available as a standalone download.",
