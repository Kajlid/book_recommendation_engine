  "description": "Rossalyn Channing is a tough single mom, who does all that she can to keep her thirteen year-old son safe. In this shocking and emotional installment of the Hawg Heaven series, Ryan Channing experiences life and death as he never has before, and faces a danger so profound that he might not make it out alive.  Burly biker Tom Hundman is called upon to rise above and beyond the call of merely being a good neighbor, and shows his true colors when Rossalyn's past comes a-calling. Love is a powerful motivator in this compelling tale, but sometimes love goes too far and someone ends up getting hurt.  With a murderer on the loose, and a stalker who gets more bold by the day, Rossie is faced with a reality unlike anything she ever imagined. Readers, grab your tissues and snuggle under the covers with a flashlight, you're in for a wild ride.",
