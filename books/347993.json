  "description": "Whether writing about butter mints, the daisy chain of a group of daughters locked arm in arm, or a man burying his dead wife, Terri Kirby Erickson's poems have the characteristics we all strive for in our poetry. These lyrical narratives are sensuous, tender, evocative, and familiar, bringing to life things we've all noticed but lacked the wisdom to put into words. - Scott Owens, editor of The Wild Goose Poetry Review",
