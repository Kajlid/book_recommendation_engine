  "description": "If you think monsters are scary, you don't know Jack!Wisecracking cryptozoologist Dr. Obadiah \"Jack\" Jackson has hunted plenty of dangerous creatures over the years. But he finds a lot more than he bargained for when he travels to Malaysia to save a beautiful missionary and her village from being ravaged by ghoulish, blood-feeding monsters straight from local legend...creatures known as the jenglot...creatures that are very dangerous, elusive, and intelligent. But that's the least of Jack's troubles. It seems that the blood-crazed cryptids aren't the only ones bent on using Jack as their favorite chew toy. Other denizens of the Malaysian jungles have their sights set on him as well including a local witchdoctor threatened by the missionary's message of hope and a mysterious guerrilla leader who appears to have a dark and secret agenda. Jack and his team must keep their wits about them to escape the jenglot and discover the answers to the deep mysteries surrounding their existence.",
