Facing his sixty-third winter, internationally acclaimed novelist Paul Auster sits down to write a history of his body and its sensationsâ€•both pleasurable and painful. Thirty years after the publication of The Invention of Solitude , in which he wrote so movingly about fatherhood, Auster gives us a second unconventional memoir in which he writes about his mother's life and death. Winter Journal is a highly personal meditation on the body, time, and memory, by one of our most intellectually elegant writers.",
