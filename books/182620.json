  "description": "Poetry. Carolyn Forche calls Susana Gardner's first full-length collection, [ LAPSED INSEL WEARY ], \"an extended social lyric of longing that refuses isolation because the 'grandmany' is all around, in ancestry and memory and books and shared future.... This poetry is full of heart and intelligence.\" Geraldine Monk calls it \"Disturbingly beautiful\" while Elizabeth Treadwell describes the work as \"architecturally wild and sturdy.\"",
