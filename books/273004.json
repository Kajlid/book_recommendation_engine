  "description": "He still owns me.  His wicked touch ruins me, corrupts me into wanting things I shouldn’t. Now I’m no longer an unwilling prisoner, but rather an eager participant.  The need for ecstasy, and the burn to be consumed by my captor makes it impossible for me to hate him. I know I should, but I can’t. Not when my body obeys him so willingly.  But the tables have turned, and a strong family now stands divided. Castello’s determination to keep me for himself started a war.  The war of brothers.  The war of blood.  In the end, only one will survive.",
