In Laven-lay, wolflings and wood fauns are sharing counsel for the first time in a generation. In Danda-lay, cliff fauns and cats have joined forces in a last desperate attempt to save the city from the swamp faun invaders. In Kazar swamp, cats and their shelts have been reunited after hundreds of years of separation and abuse. But have all these answers and reunions come too late? Time is running out to stop their true enemy. The ruin of Selbis is awaking to welcome her king. Gabalon is coming home. This is the third book in The Prophet of Panamindorah trilogy.",
