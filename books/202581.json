  "description": "Passionella Davenport has been unwilling to risk her heart since her husband Fletcher, an off-Broadway director, confessed his preference for men. Now, ten years later, she is about to get a second chance at life and love in the unlikeliest of places. Divorced, unemployed, and running out of money, she journeys to rural Newbridge, Connecticut, to house sit Fletcher’s boyhood home—and falls hard for Jeff Woodrow, a local woodworker and weekend musician. In every way, Jeff is the opposite of Fletcher—masculine, rugged, handy—and when he grabs her in a passionate embrace, she feels wanted. But there’s a problem. Jeff’s ex-wife Julie is Passionella’s new next-door neighbor and new best friend. And one thing is becoming inconveniently clear: Julie is just not ready to let Jeff go. As Passionella gets entangled in an increasingly complex love triangle, she must ask herself: Is Jeff the life partner she has been secretly longing for, or just another Mr. Almost Right? Hilarious and heartbreaking by turns, Almost Right with the World is a wry look at the limits of friendship, the bonds that survive divorce, and the lies we tell each other and ourselves in our love relationships.",
