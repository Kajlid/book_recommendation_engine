  "description": "From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Laurelin Paige comes a new story in her Slay series…  Camilla Fasbender has a secret.  Underneath her posh accent and designer clothes lies the evidence of her pain.  Every heartbreak, every bad day, every setback has left a scar.  From behind her camera, she shows the world what to see. And it isn't her.  Until him.  He sees right through her carefully constructed facade.  And he's going to slash it all to pieces.  **Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**",
