  "description": "Charles Preston Carmichael is the most infuriating man I’ve ever met. I want to sock the golden boy of college hockey right in the mouth. He enjoys telling me everything I’m messing up. Publicly.And since he’s my roommate for the next year, I can’t avoid him. Yet there’s something about him that makes me watch him. Something dark. A secret I want to uncover. When he returns from a weekend away, broken and haunted, I can’t keep my distance anymore. He needs someone and I’ll be damned if it’s not me. Soon my life no longer revolves around hockey, but the nightmares he’s living with. Desperately I want to save him but I can’t, not yet. The timing has to be just right. Can I watch him destroy himself as he tries to hold tight to the things that matter or will I be the final hit in the destruction of his life?",
