The diary entries that follow – up until the opening of their final feature film, The Meaning of Life , in 1983 – chart the tumultuous story of how the now famous shows and films were conceived and brought to life.Palin records the evolution of Monty Python’s comic style, the moments of creative inspiration as well as discord, the persistent self-doubt, and the happy accidents that shaped what are now classic comedy moments. He captures too the group’s many anarchic exploits (John Cleese in a bikini; driving a Budget Rent-a-Van up Glencoe in full chainmail; filming ‘Scott of the Sahara’ on the beach at Torquay), as well as their battles with BBC suits, budget-conscious film producers and self-appointed censors.Thanks to Palin’s as-it-happened accounts, we are taken behind the scenes to watch with unrivalled intimacy the creative processes that led to the finished work, seeing how it was actually put together. By distilling everything about the Pythons at work, this edition of Palin’s diaries serves as an intimate guide to the legendary shows, films, books and albums.
