The company unexpectedly runs out of cash and, to make matters worse, a massive data theft follows. A critical funding round is stalled.Is someone trying to kill MyMagicHat?When Inspector Dhruvi Kishore is brought in to investigate, she finds that in the dog-eat-dog world of e-tailing, crime too, is driven by technology. Hidden in the mountains of data and unverified claims lie clues to a massive fraud – one that justifies anything. Even murder.Saboteur is the third novel in RV Raman’s corporate thriller series that explores white-collar crime in India.Hindustan Times:“RV Raman knows how to take the simplest of subjects (which are relevant, too) and turn them into novels that you wouldn’t want to put down.”“Raman stays true to his reputation of delivering an intricate plot with characters of substance, the right dose of suspense and bind it all together by keeping the narrative pacy. The corporate setup is easy to understand even for those with no business background.”\"Every reader will be compelled to treat the case at hand as if they are the person solving it, because Raman’s narrative (which at times will remind you of Agatha Christie’s work) allows you to speculate and theorise quite often\"",
