  "description": "He champions local produce and loves growing his own, and this irresistible collection of recipes ranges from fancy dinners to impress friends, to those times when you just need to grab lunch for one in a hurry.Much-loved for his trademark wholesome, hearty British food, in this book James shows off a fresh, light and ultra-modern side, too, in dishes like Shaved cauliflower salad with barbecued honey tomatoes. The very British love of spicy foods is properly indulged with recipes from all over the world, including Indian deep-fried soft-shell crab with a delicious home-made lime pickle. There is also the true comfort food — such as Chicken and wild mushroom frying pan pie — and old favourites such as chicken Kiev.",
