  "title": "The Theory of Special Connectivity: An Approach to Human Teleportation",
  "description": "Why after some days a uniform layer of dust appears over any surface of untouched mass? Why every light source converges to a point source as we move away from it? Why does shadow appear when a mass comes in between the path of light and why it has three parts? Why matter has a dual nature? Why polarization exists in nature? Why we are not able to make human teleportation a reality when it is mathematically possible? Why gravity is still a known mystery? These were some questions from where my journey had started. As it is always necessary to question the existence, the theory of special connectivity has been proposed. This book is all about gravitational waves, how they govern universe, how our current understanding of gravity has been affected, how they are governing each and every realm of physics, how using them human teleportation can be turned into reality. Book does not explain the complete theory of special connectivity, which will be given in later versions, it only explains the basics of special connectivity.",
