When a woman in the grocery store claims that Maddie’s father did not kill her mother, the revelation forces the journalist toward a reckoning. Is it possible that her father has sat in prison for almost forty years for a crime he did not commit? And if he didn’t do it, who did?  Maddie barely has time to absorb this earth-shattering news when she is called to report on what appears to be a suicide. Tilly Dawson is found shot to death on her driveway, a gun by her side. But right away something about the situation doesn’t feel right to Maddie. Before long, the tough television reporter finds herself delving once more into a dark world of violence, secrets, and intrigue. This time around Maddie must put her own life on the line to guarantee that the truth will prevail.",
