  "description": "Lisa Etron was the typical high school student. She had a wonderful best friend, a loving boyfriend, and everyone in the small town of Willow Springs loved her. Little did the people of this quiet North Carolina town know that this beautiful cheerleader hid a disturbed personality. Harboring a rage and evil that no one would ever expect, this seemingly innocent girl is getting ready to unleash a wave of terror on the unsuspecting town, and the only people standing in her way are a dedicated detective who's out for vengence and a young teenage boy whose love for Lisa blinds him to the truth.This is the story of the masks people in society wear every day, and how we never know where the darkest and most sinister spirits often lie in those we would least suspect.",
