  "description": "A one-stop-read for those seeking a comprehensive primer to sustainable living...Will getting your dream job, buying your dream car, living in your dream home, and going on your dream vacation enable you to live happily ever after? Will eating balanced diets, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep be sufficient for long-term health? Contrary to what you might think, the answers are no and no.Why? Because happiness is not something you can conquer in the outside world, but an ongoing, positive state of mind that must first be cultivated within you. And total wellness requires us to take care of not only ourselves, but also the planet that we all call home. Through the use of research-based evidence, easy-to-do exercises, and suggestions for how the reader can participate in creating sustainability in all areas of life, Thrive shows you how to build psychological riches, boost your holistic physical well-being, make informed and sustainable food choices, shop for non-toxic, eco-conscious daily consumer products, and travel in ways that will not only transform you, but even the communities that you touch upon.Are you ready to begin living toward true personal wellness and world sustainability?",
