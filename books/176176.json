  "description": "\"Between life and death, lies fate.\" Could there be any greater nightmare than living through the death of your child?  Yes! Reliving it again and again.  A tragic accident takes Dawn’s only child right before her eyes. The following surreal days are filled with soul-destroying grief and moments she never wants to live again—until, inexplicably, she finds herself back again, living that day. It’s a second chance to save her son. But changing fate is not as simple as it first appears. Time is not Dawn’s ally.  “She’d lost count of the number of times she’d lived through this. Every time it hurt as much as the time before. Eventually, she thought that she must become immune to the events, and that her heart wouldn’t shatter into a thousand, million pieces— But it always did.”.",
