  "description": "What Sinners Love is the explosive final book in the Sinners of Hawthorne University series!Note: The blurb below contains spoilers for the first two books, so I'd highly recommend not reading it until you've finished both When Sinners Play and How Sinners Fight.***All it took to blow my world apart was a single word.A name.Sabrina.Like a patchwork reforming in my mind, snapshots of my past are starting to filter back. And with every piece I remember, fury grows inside me like a hurricane.The man who captured me wants to bury the past, and me along with it. But I’m not afraid of him. I won’t let him hide his secrets in the dark.Because I’m not alone anymore.For the first time in my life, I have people in my corner. Declan and Elias knew it long before I could see it, and Gray has finally realized the truth just like I have—we’re stronger together. We’ll have to be to hunt down the monsters that stalk me.There are people in this town who are rotten to the core, and my Sinners and I are going to burn them down.We’re going to make them bleed.We’re going to make them pay.Even if we have to walk through hell to do it.",
