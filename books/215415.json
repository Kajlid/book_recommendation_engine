  "description": "From \"Superman\" to ManRogers' first book From \"Superman\" to Man, self-published in 1917, attacked notions of African inferiority. From \"Superman\" to Man is a polemic against the ignorance that fuels racism. Its title is a twist on contemporary works, both George Bernard Shaw s Man and Superman and Nietzsche s idea of the \"Superman.\" The central plot revolves around a debate between a Pullman porter and a white racist Southern politician. Rogers used this debate to air many of his personal philosophies and to debunk stereotypes about black people and white racial superiority. The porter s arguments and theories are pulled from a plethora of sources, classical and contemporary, and run the gamut from history and anthropology to biology. Many of the ideas that permeated Rogers later work can be seen germinating in From \"Superman\" to Man. Rogers addresses issues such as the lack of scientific support for the idea of race, black historical vindicationism, and the fact of intermarriage and unions among peoples throughout history.",
