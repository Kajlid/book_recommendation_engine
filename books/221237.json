  "title": "Elvis the Rooster Almost Goes to Heaven",
  "description": "Elvis is a proud rooster. After all, his crows make the sun come up and wake the world. At least they did until the terrible morning that he swallowed a bug and the sun came up without him. Poor Elvis! Is he all washed-up? Is it over? Should he give up and simply pass on to the great chicken coop in the sky? Not if the chickens - Daniela, Gina, and Lia - can help it! The popular rooster from Denys Cazet's Minnie and Moo books proudly takes center stage in his first zany adventure.",
