  "description": "What happens when the prey becomes the predator? Bethany has no idea, she’s enjoying being pounced on too much.Bethany Buchanan is a wererabbit among the werelions. At least she used to be with the werelions. Now she’s in Deal’s Gap, North Carolina hoping to create a home where she doesn’t have to hide (much) and can be herself (mostly). The neutral zone—where hybrids and unwanted abound—seems to be the perfect place for her. Her old werelion clan—don’t ask how that happened—may not have wanted her (or known what to do with her) but no one in the small town cares that she’s prey. Wait. There’s a hotter than hot and sexy as all get out, tiger-wolf hybrid (who has this habit of purring around her) is all about caring. He wants to eat her… in a very naughty way. He loves every odd inch of her wererabbit body and is willing to do anything to make her happy. Why? Because apparently Bethany is his mate and he’s never letting her go.A mating between a rabbit and a tiger-wolf hybrid? Impossible? Nah, it’s totally pawsible.",
