  "title": "Town for Sale",
  "description": "The tenth novel in the Alexander Wright Murder Mystery Series has our hero, Alex, entwined in a civic lesson of greed and unethical underpinnings. If you think politicians can be corrupt, this is a local-level example of corruption and greed. It may be thought of as a victimless crime, but greed is only a gateway drug to worse. As bad as that seems, Alex is still able to hit the prime surf spots of Southern California, the envy of the world, and advance his love life and family life. Although a chronological series installment, Town for Sale can stand on its own just like the other nine books in the series.",
