In Duncton Wood, home of spiritual truth and liberty, resistance lives on. Its champion is the timid Library aide Pumpkin, while in holy Uffington, Fieldfare inspires revolt. Even in dread Wildenhope, headquarters of the Newborn leadership, the once-evil Thripp, strives to undermine Quailâ€™s position and right the wrongs he originally inspired. Meanwhile, Stone followers everywhere await news of Privet, female scholar and scribemole, and of her quest for the lost Book of Silence. Even if she finds it, will she have the strength to bring it home?",
