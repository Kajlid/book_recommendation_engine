  "description": "An aristocratic birthright and the luxurious comforts of profound wealth did nothing to comfort Fontaine Pratina following the death of her beloved parents. After two years in the guardianship of her mother’s arrogant and selfish sister, Carileena Wetherton, Fontaine’s only moments of joy and peace were found in the company of the loyal servants of Pratina Manor. Only in the kitchens and servant’s quarters of her grand domicile did Fontaine find friendship, laughter and affection.The life of a wealthy orphan destined to inherit loomed before Fontaine—a dark cloud of shallow, arrogant associations—of aristocracy, void of simple joys—and void of love. Still, it was her lot—and she saw no way of escaping.Yet, one cold winter’s night, a battered stranger appeared at the servant’s entrance, seeking shelter and help. He gave only his first name, Knight—and suddenly, Fontaine found herself experiencing fleeting moments of joy in life. Knight was handsome, powerful—the very stuff of the legends of days of old. Though a servant’s class was his, he was proud, strong and even his name seemed to validate his persona—and he blissfully distracted Fontaine from her dull, hopeless existence.Still, there were devilish secrets—strategies cached by her greedy aunt—and not even the handsome and powerful Knight could save her from them. Or could he? And if he did—would the truth force Fontaine to forfeit her Knight, her heart’s desire—the man she loved?",
