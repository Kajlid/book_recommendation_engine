  "description": "David “Dax” Xavier knew he was supposed to stay away from Arya Rossi. Not only was she too young for him…Arya was the sister of one of his Silver Saints MC brothers. But even Nova’s threat of death to anyone who touched her wasn’t enough to keep Dax from claiming Arya for himself. Arya didn’t know she was delivering herself to her own kidnapping, but she didn’t complain when she found herself alone in a cabin with the man who’d been starring in her fantasies. If Dax wanted her on the back of his bike, she was more than willing. No matter what her brother had to say about their relationship.",
