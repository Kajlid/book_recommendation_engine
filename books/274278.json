  "description": "Recovering from the terrible fright of the blackened sun, the royal family of Quachil Thecou found itself receiving a foreign delegation from the far east, an ordinary enough event but for the possibilities the Lady Female Sun saw. The exotic “eastern barbarian” and the tribute collector who had brought him were there for her to play with and make them serve her goals. However, Tattooed Serpent had plunged into the grand royal game with as little hesitation, using the very “figurines” his exalted sister had cast her eye on. Thus Ahal and Iciwata found themselves caught in the unscrupulous struggle for power between the two royal siblings, trapped in a grand game far beyond their depth, pitted against each other, trying to do the right thing, with Sele engaging in imprudent adventures of her own, underestimating the danger, playing with it.",
