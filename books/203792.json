  "description": "The first time Flynn Long sees her, she's lying on a bed in lingerie. The picture is soft, just like her curves, and instantly he's obsessed.  Cali Carr is at the end of her full-figure modeling career when she's hired for a new campaign. But when the owner of the company steps out of the shadows and starts calling the shots, a job is the last thing it feels like.  Love at first sight isn't supposed to be real. One-touch isn't supposed to ignite so much. A single picture isn't supposed to drive a man insane. But luckily for us, it's happening in Curvy!  Warning: Over the top isn't strong enough for what this short story is. It's velvety sweetness coated in insta-love cheese, and it's waiting for you to take a bite.",
