  "description": "In the gritty novel Mouth to God’s Ear, God is leaving forever and it is going to be one hell of a farewell.Although 33 year old Brooklyn hospice counselor Godfrey Thorn should be enjoying the conventional pleasures of life, Godfrey (or God, as he is known) feels dead inside. So he has decided to fight with a mercenary group in an illegal war in some ‘godforsaken’ jungle in Africa. But on this, his final day before leaving for war, God says goodbye to a series of unsuspecting friends, relatives and ex-lovers. As the day turns to night, God’s narcissism escalates into a red-wake of shocking action and God soon finds himself hiding from the police and employing the very people he loathes in his escape from the country. And what’s with the mysterious cuts that have covered his hands since the morning?",
