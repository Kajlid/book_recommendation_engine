  "title": "Earth, Sea, Sun, And Sky: Art in Nature",
  "description": "Art can be a garden; a spiral of broken pebbles or dandelions; a wheat field in a former garbage dump. It can be made of wood carved with a chainsaw or a drawing using dust and earth. It can be transitoryâ€”painted on sand only to be erased by waves; or it can be built to last, like sculpture gardens by renowned artists. Filled with beautiful images, this book will help children appreciate the different ways that artists employ nature in their work. It examines an array of examples, including sculpture gardens, mazes, land art, and nature-related works in museums while exploring the works of international artists, including Niki de Saint Phalle, Daniel Spoerri, Antonio Gaudi, Christo, the Ant Farm, Nancy Holt, Joseph Beuys, Agnes Denes, and Andy Goldsworthy. The book provides readers with a wealth of ideas for creating their own paintings, drawings, sculptures, and experiments. Children will experience hours of inspiration as they discover the artistic possibilities that exist in the natural world.",
