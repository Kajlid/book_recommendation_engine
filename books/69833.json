  "title": "Paddington Bear at the Circus",
  "description": "The circus has come to town! Paddington Bear and the Browns have front-row seats, and they can't wait to see the show. Inside the circus tent there's a ringmaster with a top hat, a very, very tall clown, a band ... and a funny-looking man hanging from a rope above Paddington's head. Always willing to lend a paw, Paddington rushes off to save the trapeze artist. The circus is turned upside-down, but the show must go on - and it does, thanks to a surprise performance by Paddington Bear. Paddington Bear has charmed readers for nearly forty years. Now another generation of fans can join the beloved bear from Darkest Peru on a variety of adventrues written by Michael Bond and beautifully illustrated by artist R.W. Alley.",
