  "description": "Welcome to a world of war and ancient magic, where to fight means to kill, and to kill is mercy. This is Ingleheim. For thousands of years, Golem Mages ruled the volcanic mountain ranges, conjuring powerful entities out of the elements and harnessing their powers to serve humanity. However, when Herrscher Heinrich declared himself F端hrer and murdered the other Golem Mages, he became the sole individual capable of bending golems to his will. The F端hrer's bloody Regime began, and a critical imbalance of power rolled throughout the landscape. Divided by violence and fear, Ingleheim's ancient connection to the golems and their magic was severed. Now, twenty years later, the Regime has discovered the resting place of the Golem of Death, an Alpha golem, who wields an immense, destructive power that could crush the F端hrer's enemies once and for all. Katja, a passionate Golem Expert, has been tasked by the Regime to help bring the Alpha under their control. However, no one knows that she is covertly studying the ancient secrets of the Golem Mages, hoping to prevent such unimaginable power from ever reaching the F端hrer's hands. She teams up with a member of the Steinkamp - a faceless and nameless soldier trained in the art of death - who harbors his own mysterious reasons for bringing down the Regime. Together, the unlikely pair challenge immense power, but their most trying task is learning how to trust in a world where everyone is afraid of you-or they want to kill you.",
