  "title": "The Death of Ganymede",
  "description": "In mythology, Ganymede was a young man whose beauty was so profound that Zeus abducted and appointed him cupbearer to the gods. In modern society, Ganymede (analogous of gay male teenagers) has been taken and made subservient to the desires of others, often (via HIV infection) at the cost of life. \"The Death of Ganymede\" is a collection of works that focus on gay teenaged males and the manner in which they are exploited (or engage in exploitation). The characters delve the extent of their faith, humanity, and savagery in alternately graphic, violent, and poignant interactions with one another.",
