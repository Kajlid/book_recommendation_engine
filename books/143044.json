  "description": "The theatre was swamped with a silence that felt heavy. It was not the anticipatory silence of a show about to start, but the dead silence of a show come to an end.“By the pricking of my thumbs…” murmured January to herself.The house doors are open at The Alexandra Theatre and the stage is set for a production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, but a there is a darkness backstage that has less to do with the fall of the curtains and more to do with the death of an actress the year before. Jasper works backstage in the theatre owned by his brother and is haunted by memories of Alice, the girl who died, and his own guilty conscience. When a face from the past returns and Jasper is plagued by disturbing visions, it becomes clear that he is not the only one haunted by The Alexandra’s dark past and there is more than just his sanity at stake.Wings is a twisty love letter to the gothic, set backstage in a late Victorian West End theatre, where Shakespearean tragedy meets the rise of spiritualism.",
