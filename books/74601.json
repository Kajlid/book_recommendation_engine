  "description": "The world is no longer the same. People are changing. Though calm on the surface, beneath Jane's skin lies a torrent of apathy, rage, and malice. Her mother vacillates between denial and the horror of what her daughter has become. Filled with symbolism, Choking Butterflies is a descriptive chronicle of a slowly-decaying humanity and those who passively watch.",
