  "description": "Row, row, row…Gently down…The Stream. It flows. It connects the mind to others, provides it access to information, saturates it with entertainment. But can the Stream, as Jadon believes, become self-aware? Can it become God?Killian’s clients are stabbing themselves in the head. As their Stream psychiatrist, he’s supposed to adjust their filters so they don’t lose their mind in the flood of data. The priests blame Killian’s defiance of Jadonism for these deaths. To stop them from further seizing power, Killian needs to find the real cause of the suicides. But each time he revisits one, he stabs holes in his own sanity.When Killian glimpses Ophelia, he realizes he can’t remember his life before the Stream. He knows she tried to destroy it, but he can’t imagine why he betrayed her. Before he can decide if he’ll help her this time or submit to the priests, he’ll have to unlock his memories. Even if it means braving the world outside the Stream.",
