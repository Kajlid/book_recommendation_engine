  "description": "The dynamic coupling of the humorous, studious Anthropologist, Antonio Dominguez and his lovely, flame-haired partner, the mysterious and spiritual Amanda Messenger, must combine their multitude of talents to outsmart the evil factions sent against them by OPERA, an underground sect hidden deep within the confines of the United States Government. Come and join them as they continue a journey fraught with espionage, mystery and suspense, a journey that was foretold by King Solomon himself, and that holds the key to stopping the cosmic annihilation of the human race. From the gathering of the Chosen to the final call for action; our erstwhile heroic couple move like shadows in the night from one summit to the next in a story as old as time, with a modern twist.",
