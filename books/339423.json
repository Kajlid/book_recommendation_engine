  "description": "“Joven has put together a fine recipe for a thriller.”—Washington Post A novel of the Voynich mystery, The Book of God and Physics is a gripping, fascinating, and eminently intelligent literary thriller akin to the genre-bending masterworks of Michael Gruber and the “secret histories” of Dan Brown (The Da Vinci Code et al). Author Enrique Joven centers his compelling, fast moving story around a very real historical artifact—the indecipherable Voynich Manuscript—and spins an extraordinary tale that  asks whether legendary scientific figures (Brahe, Koeppler, Galileo, Copernicus)  might have hidden some of their secrets within its pages.",
