  "title": "We Ship It",
  "description": "This rom-com debut has the fierce girl energy of the movie  Booksmart,  blended with the awkwardness of Kelly Quindlen’s  Late to the Party,  topped with a thrilling international meet-cute a la  Love and Gelato. Olivia Schwartz has a plan. It’s even color-coded. And the plan is a perfect SAT score, a prestigious college, and a straight path towards her dream of becoming a doctor. The last thing she wants to do—the summer before her senior year of high school, no less—is go on a cruise. Especially with her parents, younger brothers, and all the unspoken things between them since her older brother’s death so many years ago. Then Olivia meets Sebastian. He’s everything she’s charming, exciting, willing to take risks and run with them. For the first time, Olivia feels like she can have  fun... But there’s a lot bubbling up under the surface on this cruise, and when past secrets begin to come to light, Olivia must face all the truths that she’s ignored for so about herself, Sebastian, her brother, the past she  thought  she understood, and the future she’s always planned.",
