  "description": "Monstrous is as monstrous does...I've finally accepted my fate. I can't bury my head in the sand while vicious fiends threaten everything I care about.Even if protecting the beastly men I love means committing a betrayal more brutal than anything they've ever done.Even if getting a handle on my powers requires walking into the den of the most monstrous human beings I've ever known.I'll find the answers to defeating our enemies, whatever it takes. I'll find my way back to the life I was supposed to have.Or maybe I'll die trying. But you'd better believe I'll do everything in my power to take the worst of the villains down with me.",
