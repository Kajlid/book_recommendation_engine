  "description": "They say that lightning never strikes the same place twice, but for Zach Jacobs, that just isn’t true. It’s hard enough being seventeen-- juggling school, football, friends, and teenage romance-- but Zach’s about to find out just how complicated it can get when he begins to suspect that maybe he was the lightning. Teenage woes hardly seem significant when you’ve got lightning shooting from your fingertips and a couple of murderous Titans trying to settle an ancient score. Olympia The Pantheon , is the first of a four book series under the Olympia Heights name.",
