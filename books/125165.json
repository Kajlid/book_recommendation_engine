  "title": "Merleau-Ponty: A Guide for the Perplexed",
  "description": "Maurice Merleau-Ponty was one of the most important figures in the existential and phenomenological traditions in twentieth-century Continental philosophy. Merleau-Ponty: A Guide for the Perplexed is the ideal text for students encountering Merleau-Ponty's philosophy for the first time. The book assumes no prior knowledge of the subject, and takes the reader though the key themes in Merleau-Ponty's work, casting light on complex ideas, including - crucially - his interpretations of 'perception', 'embodiment' and 'behaviour'. Most importantly this Guide for the Perplexed offers a full and authoritative explication of Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological account of human behaviour.",
