  "description": "What if Jesus made an unexpected appearance before His final coming?Joshua Ben-Yosef attracts a huge following. He was born in Nazareth to parents named Mary and Joseph and speaks more than a dozen languages fluently and without accent. His words ripple with wisdom and authority. And the crowds that follow him are enthralled as he heals the sick, gives sight to the blind, casts out demons, and even raises the dead.Is Dr. Melvin Merton, the well-known leader and author of end-times books, correct about the imminent return of Christ? It seems everyone is a believer in this \"Messiah\" including Jonathan Weber s wife, Shannon especially when Joshua performs the ultimate sign by raising a disciple from the dead. Plagued by skepticism, Jonathan faces the ultimate challenge in uncovering whether this is the actual return of Christ or the most devastating hoax ever carried out.",
