  "description": "Everyone knows Ty's sister fell off the cliffs and drowned. But something—is it a feeling?— gnaws at him, driving him to search for her in barbarian Gaul. When Ty and his father visit the Ulster king in ancient, Celtic Ireland, Ty and his new friend, Prince Cairell, flee for the coast at midnight. Ty is attracted to Cairell's mysterious sister, Sorca, but she refuses to remain behind. Cairell's brother pursues, planning to kill them all to secure his inheritance to the throne. After Ty's father, Taran, returns home, the druids plan sacrifices to the old gods. Too old to help, Taran knows only Ty can bring the clan back to the truth. But years pass. And where is Ty? Ahead, the armies of Clovis, king of the Franks, drive the Romans from Gaul. How, amidst such chaos, can Ty learn the truth about his sister or win the heart of Sorca?",
