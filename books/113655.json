  "description": "This story begins in the year 2030. Earth is sending ships on missions to find other planets suitable for humans to colonize, as Earth has reached a point where its resources have become very limited. Jamie's father is an astronaut for NASA and during a mission, his space ship encounters a meteor storm. The ship loses transmission and disappears from Earth's radar. He and the crew are presumed dead, the theory being, they were hit by a large meteorite at the time. Jamie believes his father is still alive. The Cooper Chronicles follows the journey of Jamie Cooper as he embarks on a mission to find his missing father. What follows is an amazing adventure where Jamie and his sister Kristyn are kidnapped and taken from their space ship to the city of Voltair. After escaping, they travel though the desert on Knaks until they reach the country of Baltor. It is there that they learn their father is being held prisoner in Borsch castle. They set out with the help of a friendly alien, Femir, to find their father, clinging to the hope that he is still alive. What they will find along the way will ultimately change their lives forever.This book has something for everyone. It has adventure, excitement, humour and in the second part, even romance. Most of all, it is pure escapism into another world that people will love to lose themselves in.",
