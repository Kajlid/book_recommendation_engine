What he wants, he takes, and what he wants now is Miriam. But her father, the king, has other plans for his daughter’s future. Strong-willed and defiant, Miriam tests her father’s patience in a battle of wills. Rebellious and determined to break free from his oppressive hold, she turns to drugs for the escape she so desperately craves.

Thrust together under one roof, it’s only a matter of time before Io and Miriam succumb to their mutual attraction and fascination with each other.
