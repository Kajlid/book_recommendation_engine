  "title": "Wolves Among Sheep",
  "description": "Tammy Loboman is an 18-year-old girl who tells her best friends Genevieve and Monica everything. Everything, that is, except for the fact that she and her family are all \"strays\". Her secret is compromised as three \"leeches\" move into their sleepy town and two of them start dating Genevieve and Monica. Her problems increase as she realizes her new friend Emily is a self-proclaimed \"demon hunter\", determined to wipe out the werewolf pack her parents thought they had finished off years ago. A revolution in the Christian market, \"Wolves Among Sheep\" might be the only one of its kind; a vampire and werewolf novel geared at both Christians looking for an alternative and non-Christians just looking for something good to read.",
