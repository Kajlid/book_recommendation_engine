  "description": "Being in charge is a pain in the…  Posterior. Rear end. Junk in the trunk. Those were some of the words that came to mind when the captivating woman walked into Red’s office that day. She had a spectacular, eminently spankable one. Trouble was, his huge conglomerate had just bought out her dinky publisher—and this sexy little author was the key to a smooth transition.  For all intents and purposes, Piper was his new star employee—so Red should not have cleared his schedule to take her dinner. He shouldn’t have flirted like it was his freaking birthday, and he sure as hell shouldn’t have gone and fallen for her. One more thing he shouldn’t have done? Omit the fact that his company owed her a lot of money.  When his dirty little secret gets out, more than Red’s new business acquisition is on the line—his jaded heart is hanging in the balance, too. Unfortunately, his golden way with a merger might not be enough to save him now.  Can Red convince Piper that her tentative trust in him wasn’t misplaced? Or will their new relationship go the way of her missing royalties?  There’s only one way to find out.  Step into his office and let Padraig “Red” MacLellan show you why he’s the boss.   About the Series: The heroes of Triple Threat are scorching hot and have three things in common: each one is tall, dark, and handsome. They think they've got all the moves, and they're ready to take the women of New York by storm. There's just one little problem...  Sometimes you know how to win the girl, and sometimes you don't.",
