  "description": "Was she in the right place at the wrong time? Cressida had lost her parents and badly needed a new focus. So going to Holland to help an elderly Dutch doctor with a book he was writing, giving up her own nursing job for a while, seemed ideal. Her new employer had two partners. One was elderly and friendly, like himself, while the other was younger and...not quite so friendly. Giles van der Tiele always seemed to be snubbing Cressida, putting her in her place. But when he wanted to, he could be extremely charmingâ€”too much so for her peace of mind!",
