  "description": "Grace Kelley survives a savage assault while in nursing school. She throws herself into being the best possible nurse in the surgical arena as she travels around the U.S. with her four-legged companion, Cali. Jared Murphy is a firefighter that specializes in mountain rescue. Like his father and brothers, he lives for his job and his family because a previous relationship taught him that he can't trust a woman to want the same things he does. A chance encounter on a deserted road brings these two lost souls together with an intensity that leaves them both breathless. No one says that love has a timeline and it certainly didn't follow any rules for these two.  For mature audiences only. MFF scenes and other naughtiness. 18 years of age or older.",
