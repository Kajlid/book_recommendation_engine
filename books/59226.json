  "description": "Book 3 of The Fern Witches Series **************************************** After two years in Fern, Dana Quinn's love for the people and the place outweighs the challenges she's met. She now craves what she has feared, love and family, but wanting is only half the battle. The fight within her soon becomes a regrettable exercise in self-indulgence when events collide and send Dana and Carla reeling. To their dismay, Dana's powers fail her when she needs them most, and her search for answers leads her to the one witch she must rely on for help. Alexandra Conti, High Priestess and free spirit, initiates Dana in more ways than one. Hannah and Julia reconsider their relationship, while Liz searches for the dark woman she'll marry in a year's time. Jude gives Dana the ride of her life on a midnight run. Ruby Gray-Quinn surprises both of her mothers. Dana calls on inner strength and innovative magick while she hangs on to an old thread that might be her undoing. She has found her home, her people, and phenomenal power, but will she find the courage to embrace her new family and her own future when the past threatens to leave her wanting nothing?",
