  "title": "69 Things to Do with a Dead Princess",
  "description": "This is where the novel has a nervous breakdown. Anna Noon is a twenty-year-old student with a taste for perverse sex involving an enigmatic older man and a ventriloquist's dummy. Anna lives in Aberdeen, Scotland, and her sex life revolves around the ancient stone circles in the region. The sublime grandeur of the stones provides a backdrop against which Anna is able to act out her provocative psychodramas.This is a book about the body in which the carnal is a manifestation of consciousness: a book in which it is virtually impossible to distinguish the ancient from the postmodern. Drawing on literary and continental philosophy, as well as pulp appropriations, 69 Things suggests that schizophrenia may well be the only sane response to capitalism.",
