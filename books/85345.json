  "description": "Ian Laidlaw is an equable man. Quiet, cultivated, efficient, head of the political science department at a Scottish university. His uneventful days are measured out with scrupulous care until Alicia Anna Davie laughs in his face one afternoon--and his ordered world crumbles about him.There is another side to Ian Laidlaw, a side that matches the scarred horror of the left side of his face, mangled in youth by a vicious hound. This side draws Alicia into a bizarre relationship; but as she toys with ugliness and danger, Laidlaw becomes locked into an obsessive passion at once disorienting and hideously destructive. Alicia's crime is the carelessness of youth--Laidlaw's punishment reflects the dislocation of his universe.",
