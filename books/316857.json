  "title": "Candy, Sweet & Sour",
  "description": "A coming-of-age story of a young girl in the opiate-south. Candy navigates growing up in a situation that is less than ideal with humor and spunk. She is hilarious in her observations, smart, and completely irrepressible. Her \"Candy-isms\" are real and brutally honest! This book explores the boundaries of a mother's unconditional love, and delves into themes of the importance of family and relationships above all else in the South, especially for those living in poverty. Set in the foothills of the Appalachian mountains in North Carolina, themes of domestic violence, drug abuse, drug addiction, criminal activity, and coming of age are developed as Candy resiliently makes it through all of the traumas life throws at her with an often sardonic sense of humor. Even though this is not the most functional family in the world, they ARE a family that you could drag yourself to when you've been shot in the butt, and they'd help you, no questions asked.",
