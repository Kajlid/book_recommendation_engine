  "title": "Her Lover, Her Mistress",
  "description": "Lucy, a student at a prestigious university, finds her life, her companions and her sex life unsatisfying. She pushes away the fantasies which come into her mind unbidden, which disturb and delight her. Fantasies of cruel female hands, torturing her to orgasm after orgasm. Being made to kneel and serve and submit and adoring every humiliating moment of it. She meets Ricky entirely by chance: a flicker of a glance across the room. But in that instant, their destiny together begins to unfold. Ricky recognises the submissive within Lucy at once. Lucy finds herself following Ricky to her bedroom, and falls into an alternate world, where she realises her destiny as a Sapphic submissive.She lay down behind her, wrapping her arms around her and gently kissing the scarlet bite marks on her neck, gently stroking her belly and thighs.\"You were so good. I'm so proud of you.\"\"I... wow. I sort of can't believe that actually happened.\"\"Me neither. I've been looking for you for a while.\"\"I have so many fantasies about being dominated by a woman. And they just all came true, without any warning.\"\"I know exactly what you mean.\"\"Can I do anything for you? To get you off, I mean.\"\"No, not yet.\"\"Mmm, when?\" Exhausted though Lucy was, she was desperate to have Ricky force her head down and make her pleasure her until her tongue ached.\"I need you to do something first.\"\"What?\"\"An assignment. I'll give you a task, and I want you to go away and do it. Once you've done it, I'll know that you're ready for me.\"\"I just took your fist, doesn't that... ow!\" she yelped as Ricky slapped her tit, its nipple still raw.\"If you're going to be my fuckpet, you're going to have to learn how to take an order.\"",
