  "description": "'Iniquitous Solace' is the tale of two lovelorn strangers. Chance has placed them in each otherâ€™s path, and their encounter is captured through powerful erotic poetry. Through the eyes of our poets, we follow them on an emotional journey through life. As we delve deep into their souls, we share their joys and heartbreaks, their passions and lusts. The poetry is written in the raunchy style you've come to love from these writers, and now all they ask is you take the plunge, and indulge in 'Iniquitous Solace' - their Rhythmic Words of Lust and Love.This book is no longer available.
