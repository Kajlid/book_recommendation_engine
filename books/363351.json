  "description": "Having devoted all her time to work Lizzy doesn’t have much of a life, but it takes something unexpected to make her realise it.Lizzy’s mother signed her up for a dating show but she’s determined her new friend Jane will win “the boyfriend” even if she has to fight the production itself. There isn’t a lot of reality in reality TV, manipulation is the name of the game.The terribly named “Bag a Boyfriend” consumes Lizzy; she swings between mocking every aspect and enchanted with the love story developing … till it comes crashing down effecting her life behind the cameras. Out in the real world she keeps running into reminders; fellow contestants…and a pesky, possibly cute, producer.When the show finally screens she has no idea how she’ll be portrayed and her new friends don’t know the whole truth. Turns out life away from the cameras can be just as dramatic.Austenite Frances Duncan’s reimagining of Pride and Prejudice set in New Zealand is an amusing romp through reality TV clichés where everyone gets a happy ending.",
