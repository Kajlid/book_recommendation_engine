  "description": "Something weird is happening: the moon is lopsided, with a bluish glow along one edge. When Kayla Kane finds a magic stone, Morath (one of three wyrd sisters) drags her off to Elsewhen, armed only with a jar of Glamour Remover and A Guide to the Old Ones or Little Folk. As the reluctant keeper of the stone, Kayla must discover the secret of why magic and technology are combining, bringing When and Elsewhen closer together. She is aided by an eighteenth-century Cockney, a cryptic Anglo-Saxon, a messy piskie, and other eccentric characters. But will she be too late to save both worlds?",
