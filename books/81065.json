She’s made a habit of staying under the radar by being a floater among social circles at school, which has kept her out of trouble—until now.After a missing persons case stirs up the entire town, Dani finds herself caught right in the middle of the scandal. When she’s labeled a possible suspect, things quickly go from bad to worse. The sudden return of her old flame, Parker Reed, manages to make her whole situation even more complicated. When an elusive unknown person begins to blackmail Dani by threatening to reveal her deepest secrets, Dani refuses to play along. That is, until the person’s actions take a violent turn. Holden Ridge begins to lose its sense of quaint town security, and Dani is caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse.Who can she trust when anyone around her could be a suspect? One thing’s for certain though: Never underestimate the power of one tiny secret.**Mature Content Warning** Recommended for 17+ due to language, violence, and sexual content.",
