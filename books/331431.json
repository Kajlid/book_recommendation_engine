  "title": "Hoax: The Untold Story",
  "description": "Everyone has a story to tell. Even the dead.Trapped in limbo between Hell and Earth, I’ve been dealt a fate worse than death. To witness the suffering of those I love, unable to communicate or help. Or am I? With the appearance of a demon I’ve yet to decide is foe or friend, I’m discovering my spirit isn’t as useless as I’d previously thought. The odds are stacked against me, the possibility of holding Mania again a pipe dream, but one thing is for sure. My brothers and my girl need me, so this is not the time to give up.As asked for by the readers, this novella is solely from Hoax’s point of view. To avoid spoilers, I highly recommend for this book to be read after Kings of Madness - book two in the All My Pretty Psychos series. All of your unanswered questions await, and Hoax is ready to reveal the truth behind his story. #GiveHoaxAVoice.",
