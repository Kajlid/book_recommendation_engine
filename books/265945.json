  "description": "When I arrived at your resort, I was broken. Emotionally and professionally, I had nothing left. The last three books I published bombed and the ink was barely dry on my divorce papers. The divorce I never saw coming. All I needed was peace and quiet, and you gave it to me. That and so much more Hope. Courage. Friendship. Passion. The last thing I want to do is leave. But if I stayed, Iâ€™d only be staying for you.  Staying For You is a friends-to-lovers contemporary romance with a push and pull that will keep you turning the pages.",
