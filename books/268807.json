  "description": "This book is about Qualities that an individual needs to develop during his lifetime so as to ascertain success in his career and life, viz. Modesty, Discipline, Patience, Hard work, Dedication and commitment, adaptability, ability to concentrate for larger periods of time, enhancing one's temperament etc. It is not about the career and achievements of Sachin Tendulkar, the cricket legend. It is about the reasons for his huge success. The author deals with all the reasons why he succeeded so much during his cricketing career and what led to him being considered a legend of the game, rising from very moderate family background. The book has a very methodical and practical approach. It gives out a clear message that without the development of the abovesaid qualities, nothing big is going to happen in one's life. The one-on-one co-relation between a particular quality and the manner in which Sachin showed it during his career has been beautifully depicted in this book. Ideal reading stuff for those in their teens and aspiring to achieve huge heights in their careers and lives.",
