  "description": "Facing death from cancer, Pablo Neruda wrote no book more direct and passionate in its language, and this translation—the first time these poems appeared in English—was cited by Bloomsbury Review as a Book of the Year and called one of the \"most valuable Neruda books we have today.\" In this lyrical suite, the poet meditates on his imminent death, embraces solitude, and returns to nature as a source of regeneration. Bilingual with introduction.",
