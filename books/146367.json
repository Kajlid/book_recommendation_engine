  "description": "Noelle wasn’t unduly alarmed when the Amazonian women took her and fellow scientist/friend, Monica, captive. She reasoned that their own colony wasn’t far and someone was bound to come look for them and free them. In the meanwhile, she had an opportunity to study the all female society.  When the alien ship swooped toward the village, however, and sent the fierce Amazonian warrior women into a blind panic, she thought it might be time to panic herself … especially when she saw the fierce, huge, barbarian male charging down the gangplank and headed straight toward her.",
