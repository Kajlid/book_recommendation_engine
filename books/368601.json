  "description": "“Extraordinary writing . . . a not-to-be missed reading experience.” —RT Book Reviews on Against All Odds (41/2 stars, Top Pick)U.S. Marshal Jake Taylor has seen plenty of action during his years in law enforcement. But he’d rather go back to Iraq than face his next assignment: protection detail for federal judge Liz Michaels. His feelings toward the coldhearted workaholic haven’t warmed in the five years since she drove her husband—and Jake’s best friend— to despair... and possible suicide. As the danger mounts and Jake gets to know Liz better, he’s forced to revise his opinion of her. And when it becomes clear that an unknown enemy may want her dead, the stakes are raised. Because now both her life— and his heart—are in danger. Full of suspense and romance, Fatal Judgment is a thrilling story that will keep you listening late into the night.",
