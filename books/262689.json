  "description": "Everything that has transpired since Lady Emma's intimately spicy wedding night has been leading her to one place....

All they must do is submit to Madame Silk and her devilish instruments without surrendering to pleasure. A simple ask... yet countless girls have sought the great prize that comes with victory and none have succeeded... Now Lady Emma must follow her husband into the den of iniquity and try her hand at the great game.

But Emma must succeed where so many have failed... for time is running short and only by winning can she grant the dying wish of the woman both she and Edmund love...",
