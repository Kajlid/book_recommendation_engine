  "description": "The almost Aesop-like parables in Star Trek laid down a philosophy of moral rectitude. However, the show did more by giving a positive vision of a future thought of as science fiction and unattainable in the 60s, such as existing as non-corporal beings and being able to manifest whatever we wanted with mind power alone. Now, more than 40 years later, we realize we can achieve these things, and it has been easier to accept current concepts evolving during these years because Star Trek paved the way. Also during the 60s A Course in Miracles was being scribed, and it espoused the same principles essential to Star Trek: we create our own reality; love is stronger than force of will; and all our reality is an illusion based on our perception.",
