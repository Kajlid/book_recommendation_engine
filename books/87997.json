  "description": "Meaty Balls is an insightful and equally hilarious collection of essays by Vincent Daniels which the Metro Times calls \"a welcome and original addition to the humor genre\" and \"perfect for fans of Sedaris, Chelsea Handler, and Tucker Max.\" The nature of Daniels' observational and frank humor will be a hit with fans of Jim Gaffigan, Aziz Ansari, and Louis C.K.Meaty Balls holds nothing back in its honest, charismatic, and laugh-out-loud funny discussions regarding life's awkward moments, glorious mishaps, and shameless victories. Daniels recounts drunken Latin barbecues with ex-in-laws, breakfast buffet fecal explosions, unintentional golf club assaults, court battles for stolen corn dogs, a comic book hoarding centenarian's birthday party, a funeral for a stripper's church-going brother, and a highway run-in with his doppelganger. In between such expositions, Meaty Balls tackles hearty topics such as Vincent's summary on the F-word, a commentary on nicknaming, a rant on attractive people, an explanation of prolonged laughter, a guide to office laziness, and instructions on how to properly utilize impersonations. Daniels finds humor in tender subjects, like the coveted snacks his father wouldn't share, his regrettable career ventures, his love of foods that cause diarrhea, and his penchant for being accosted by strangers. This collection of smiley-faced cynicism and downright funny storytelling is delivered in Daniels' unmistakable voice, undoubtedly one of the finest fresh voices in American humor.",
