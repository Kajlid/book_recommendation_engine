  "description": "Immortal, eternally beautiful, strong, and sexy, vampires take what they need, stealing the life force from those unlucky (or lucky) enough to cross their paths. Edited by noted erotica writer D.L. King, The Sweetest Kiss takes readers into shadowy alleys and dark bedrooms to experience the frisson of terror and delight that only a vampire can inspire. Satisfying their lust in contemporary and period settings, the seductive creatures of The Sweetest Kiss join a growing cast of characters that mesmerize us in every medium, from books and graphic novels to movies and television shows. These blood-drenched tales give us new meaning to the term \"dead sexy\" and feature beautiful bloodsuckers whose desires go far beyond blood.",
