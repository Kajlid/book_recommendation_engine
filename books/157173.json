  "description": "Angels. Spirits. Superheroes. Gods. Whatever their name, they are always watching. A frightened runaway in northern Massachusetts. A traumatized widow in Missouri. A tense barroom altercation in Texas. A drowning child off the sunny California coast. A sudden abduction in New Mexico. And in Cape Cod, a teenage girl who catches a glimpse of two faces from her past she was never meant to remember. Through these circumstances and more, there is but one connection. The presence of extraordinary, awe-inspiring, legendary beings—beings whose existence has forever remained mythical and unproven… That is, until now. Welcome to the world of The Beat & Case…where the unbelievable not only exists, but exists in plain sight.",
