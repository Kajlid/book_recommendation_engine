  "description": "Zeus is the third book in The Balance series - a collection of paranormal thrillers dealing with the unseen world of balancing powers. Too often life is viewed in terms of good and evil, black or white, and the balance point tipping in either direction is ignored. Why should the afterlife be any different? We are given a choice when we die to move on to the Source, stay on earth and slowly evolve into more of what we were (good people become angels and bad people become demons), or a chosen few can work to keep the Balance between them. The title character Zeus is such a warrior who works to maintain that balance.After his little brother’s sacrifice to save a friend and fellow angel, Zeus left his service to the Balance and has wandered the globe looking for a way to make Malign pay for all those she had harmed – including his lost brother. The other Balance warriors continue to do their jobs and at the same time try to track down Zeus to help him. Zeus, hiding from them, not wanting to tip the Balance with his own actions turns to the only source of help he can safely utilize, a former enemy and vicious demon to help him take on Malign. Is the enemy of his enemy now his friend, or is it still his enemy?The novel is written in two styles. Each chapter begins in a soliloquy from the title character Zeus, where he tells pieces of his backstory intertwined with philosophical musings on his family, friends, life and dealing with loss, with the following bulk of the chapter told in a third person narrative.",
