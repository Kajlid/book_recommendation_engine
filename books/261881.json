  "description": "People are curious about how life in Iran today, under the Islamic republic, differs from life as it was during the reign of Shah Mohamad Reza Pahlavi. Gail Rose Thompson, who lived there in the 1970s, working for the imperial court as the Shahs horse trainer, has many tales about life during that time and also about the way of life in the country postrevolution. She visited Iran in 2017 after an absence of forty years, the first ex-employee of the Shah to return. She paints a picture of a beautiful historic country that dates from the fourth millennium BCE, when the Persian Empire was the most powerful kingdom in the ancient world. Iranians are proud of their heritagebeing polite, hospitable, and extremely family oriented. Iran from Crown to Turbans is a fascinating book of stories that will enlighten the reader about a country that has been misrepresented.",
