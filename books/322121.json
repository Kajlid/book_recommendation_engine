  "description": "The duke, his brother, and the lie. Or in other words, how I came to be trapped between two men in a remote castle in Scotland.Once upon a time, in a more carefree life, I met a man.Our gazes connected over the top of his newspaper as he watched me suffer through the most embarrassing moment of my life.Older, sophisticated, and so very hot, he saved me from that awkward encounter,Then tried to send me away with a pat on my head.But I wasn’t going anywhere . . .And the rest, as the saying goes, is history.Passionate, heart-stopping, the night of my life kind of history.There was just one tiny problem. I lied to him.I told him I was a tourist and only in town for one night.So he wasn’t too impressed when I turned up again.In his Scottish castle.Yes, his freakin’ castle.His killer suit traded for a kilt, and his seductive smile for a frown,When he glowers my way, I don’t know if I should be worried or turned on.Because the Duke of Dalforth has secrets he’s not sharing.And a brother who’d like nothing more than to cut in on him.When I do the wrong thing for the right reason,I have to believe it’ll work out in the end.Because the duke is No Ordinary Gentleman.And I’m just a normal girl, fighting not to fall in love with him.No Ordinary Gentleman is a standalone title featuring a brutally handsome and curmudgeon-y duke, a sunshine-y girl who doesn't baulk at telling a fib or two, a castle in a remote part of Scotland, a crazy cast, lots of love, laughter, steam, and a happily ever after!",
