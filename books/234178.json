Her dark guide, as always, is her strongest aid, but will she have the resolve to do what is necessary? Will Sinder, Son of the Cold, prove to be friend or foe? Will the truth about Owyn’s past come to light?In a struggle of trust, loyalty and sacrifice, Medo plays her hand in this gentleman’s game. The result won’t just determine the survival of her companions, but will cement her very future in the Torn Realms.general series blurb:It's common enough for a book of dragons to center on a young wizard harnessing his power, or a knightly lad (usually a farmhand) learning to vanquish evil. The Merlins and Arthurs, if you will. Too rarely do we get to glimpse the other side of the coin. The Madam Mims and Morgan le Fays certainly had their own humble beginnings, but those stories are seldom told. Those climbs to power are somehow neglected.Within the pages of The Tatterwing Chronicles you'll find such a story. A story of a girl well on her way to becoming the notorious witch known as Tatterwing. A story of her rise to power, her flirtation with the darkness, and her tendency to ride the line between hero and villain as the odds stack against her.",
