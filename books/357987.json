  "title": "The Secret of New York City Revealed: Being the Autobiographical Fragments of the Then Recently Married Thomas Howard Chronicling His Numerous Discoveries in the City of That Name",
  "description": "Howard reveals his unique writing gifts and original insights as a young married man recalling the amazing variety of experiences he had during his years living in New York City. He presents a sort of wide-eyed response on the part of a new, young husband to the great, twinkling kaleidoscope of New York, playing off the thousand diversions offered by that incredible city (opera, ballet, dining, sports, social life, etc.) against an increasingly strong awareness that the hidden mysteries of domestic fidelity, marriage, fatherhood, and routine duties, are at the \"Center\" around which New York life whirls. This is a timely book about the unique mixture of human and spiritual experiences that make up life in a great, complex city, confronting tensions that are timeless and ubiquitous. Illustrated.",
