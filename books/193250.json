Following her parents lead, Blue’s love of flying takes her on many adventures, in many countries, as a CIA Clandestine Operative. From Antarctica to Budapest, to Iraq, to the Pyramids of Egypt and beyond. Her love for adventure, leads her further and further into the world of espionage, as she goes deeper and deeper into the underworld of Al-Qaeda. No encounter seems too big to be challenged as Blue rockets through life at the speed of sound, constantly seeking the next adrenaline high. Her grandfather’s genes as well as his brilliant mind, has passed from generation to generation, from war to war and from love to love. Men are drawn to her, some good, some bad, but in her heart she holds only one true love. The only man she is willing to settle down with and only he can calm her restless spirit. As Bud says to her, “when you think of Texas, think of me. I’ll be here waiting for you Blue.”",
