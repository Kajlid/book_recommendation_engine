  "description": "Of Dragons and Men is set in the summer one year before the events of The Dragon’s Treasure Series begin. It tells the story of Welsh King Talorcan of Môna and a dragon named Shandikhaar from dueling points of view.Talorcan is torn. His responsibilities to his island kingdom, his forced and loveless marriage to Lucia Cassia Septimus, great grandniece to the High King of Britannia, and the needs of his simpleminded daughter from his first wife all conspire to drive him into a depressed state. He has begun to think he cannot handle it all…but what else can he do?Shandikhaar is carrying five eggs within her. Wild men, “vermin” to her, have driven her from her home in what will one day be known as Western Canada and she must find a place to safely lay her eggs. Her greater problem, though, is a source of báldrangur, the volcanic rock that not only provides a dragon’s flame, but also cures the recurring pains that all dragons suffer. She cannot go back and there is none in the wide-open lands ahead to the east. Over all that is another, even greater problem—she is convinced that she, and the eggs she carries, are all that is left of her once-proud and dominant race.Two desperate characters, two separate species, and one simple problem between them…what will they do?",
