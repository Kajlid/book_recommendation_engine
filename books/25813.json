  "description": "Death. Theft. Marriage. It’s an average day in the Other Realm.Someone keeps bludgeoning people in the Other realm to death. A couple of the murders were virtually in our back garden, so Emory has asked me to try and find the culprit. I’d feel better if I didn’t have Shirdal along with me, cracking jokes and on the verge of a deadly killing spree of his own. Plus, there’s the small matter of the missing multi-million pound Eye of Ebrell that I still need to locate.Having overcome the damned challenges, you’d think I’d be welcomed by the dragons with open arms – but no … the court is still full of intrigue and hostility. A few weeks ago we flew to Lucy’s rescue and made some questionable decisions. Now it’s time for the consequences. The Elders are visiting Emory’s court and they’re here to decide Emory’s fate – and by extension, mine.At this rate, I’m not sure we’ll survive long enough to get our big white wedding. Damn it, I was really looking forward to the cake.Written in British English. For the maximal reader experience, it is recommended that you read The Other Wolf series before you read Betrayal of the Court, though the events in the Other Wolf series are explained if you prefer to dive right in.",
