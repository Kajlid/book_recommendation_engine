  "description": "Captain of the Temple Police is not an easy job. Gerard wasn't expecting it to be easyâ€¦but he also didn't expect to have to fight off the Priestess's overtures at every turn. While he isn't against killing, torture seems dishonorable, and a visit to the dungeons leaves Gerard feeling more than a little sympathy for the pirates he's been ordered to capture. Nevertheless, if he's to protect his gentle, talented wife, Gerard must do his job and eliminate the anti-wyvern pirates. He's made a valuable friend and ally in the wily Admiral of the Temple Sea Watch. Together, they track down the charismatic pirate leader, Gwain, who agrees to meet with them. However, Gwain's chosen site for for their parley is a dangerous island gamepark where the stakes are high, and everyone is prey. This is the illustrated version of the second book in the Cowry Catchers series.",
