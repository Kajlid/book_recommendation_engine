  "description": "DERAILED PASSIONAs a corporate executive in her family-owned railroad company, Jenna Weldon was always on the go. So when she had the opportunity to take a cross-country train ride as part of a promotional gimmick, she gloried in the idea of such old-fashioned luxurious travel. She even found the costumed actors in the parlor car amusing, for they were dressed in clothing from the last century. But all too quickly, Jenna realized that the joke was on her . . . somewhere along the line she had fallen backward in time --- and into the arms of the original Marlboro man! IRON HOT ECSTASYMorgan Trahern had never seen such astonishing beauty before in his life. Although he didn't understand a word the blonde-haired vixen was saying, he knew he wanted to silence her with a kiss. Everything about her was sensual --- from her sparkling blue eyes to her soft creamy flesh --- and he longed to teach her the endless ways of love. Nothing would compare to the passion-filled night he planned when he'd capture her heart, make her his own --- and unite their souls as TIMESWEPT LOVERS",
