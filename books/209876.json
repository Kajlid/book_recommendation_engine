  "title": "The Occasional Swearing Of Politician Perrin",
  "description": "In this series of books titled “The Occasional Swearing” comedy writer Jimmy Perrin takes a look at different topics, then tries to figure them out. Some readers call it clever wit, some readers call it rambling sh^t, but one thing is for certain... You will be able to relate to some of the things he writes about and will have a laugh.  The former best selling novelist, has turned into a factual writer. Where he tangles with myth and reality, then bravely takes on whatever subject is thrown his way.  INSIDE THIS BOOK... Jimmy goes head to head with the government, tangles with rules that control our daily lives, then shows you how the country would be run better by someone living in the real world. He also tackles taxation head on, changes a few laws, then most importantly, turns this boring subject into a lot of fun, as he crudely plays out what a live debate would be like, if he was on stage behind that podium too.",
