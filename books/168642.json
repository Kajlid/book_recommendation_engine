  "description": "This novella is not a standalone. Please read the boxed set of Sacrificed to the Dragon first.  Melanie Hall-MacLeod finally releases her book about the dragon-shifters. The reception of her book, however, is anything but peaceful.  Tristan wants nothing more than to whisk his mate and two children off to safety, but Mel refuses to hide. As the danger increases and threatens his new family, Tristan battles the need to protect his mate with the need to make her happy.  Can Melanie and Tristan survive the strain between the new danger in their lives and their new twins? Or, will Tristan lose the battle with his inner dragon, surrender to his protective instincts, and take care of the threats at the cost of his mate?  25,000+ words (estimated) / 18+, explicit language and sexual situations / HEA and no cliffhanger  Next Up: Arabella's Story",
