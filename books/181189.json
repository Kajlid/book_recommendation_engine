  "description": "Some people work their whole lives to have it all. “I think it goes without saying that I miss you. So much that some days it feels like my heart might stop beating from it.” Some people search for that one thing that will complete them. “I wake up in the middle of the night and I can’t breathe knowing you aren’t next to me.” Some people have it all ripped away in the blink of an eye.“I don’t know how people deal with this kind of loss.”And some people find solace in their own special way. “I know I can’t have a future with you, but I’m beyond grateful for the past we shared.”",
