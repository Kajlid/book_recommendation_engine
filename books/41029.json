  "description": "A savant unravels the UFO/alien abduction phenomenon.Lewis is a math savant who sees the world in terms of equations and mathematics. Like most savants, he lacks emotions, feelings, and even the ability to interpret facial expressions. But that changes after a series of alien abductions, which leave him with an unexplained connection to a woman trapped in a dystopian world of rust and steel.A fluke incident gives Lewis an opportunity to search for the woman imprisoned in the decaying alien ruins. He wants nothing more than to simply meet her and experience the basic social interactions that most people take for granted. Survival alone becomes an arduous task, but the real prize—a normal life together—would place them at odds with an obscure alien agenda… and exact a price that neither is willing to pay.Approximately 107,000 Words",
