  "description": "Contemporary vegetarian food -- without a lentil in sight. Enjoy will appeal to vegetarians, certainly, but also to the large numbers of people who like eating fresh, full-flavoured, original food -- which just happens not to have meat or fish in it. Nadine Abensur is one of the most original vegetarian food writers working today. Born in Morocco of French-Jewish parents, her food influences stretch from North Africa to Asia. Now living largely in Australia, Nadine has created a collection of recipes which re-define vegetarian food. Dishes such as Chickpea and Broad Bean Salad with Cumin, Paprika and Lemon or Cinnamon-scented Pilaf with Fennel and White Chocolate and Pistachio Creme Brulee burst with flavour and colour. The dishes cover all the times of the week cooks need to cater for -- from quick post-work dinners to laid-back lunches with friends when you might want to prepare lots of small dishes for everyone to tuck into. Photographed in Australia's Byron Bay, the pages are full of light, sun and conviviality. Teaching cookery courses, Nadine is very aware of where cooks can go wrong with a recipe or which ingredients need some explanation, for example, so her recipes are wonderfully user-friendly.
