  "description": "When eighteen-year-old Scylla is kidnapped from a carnival, she is convinced things couldn't get any worse. Her parents are dead. Her brother is missing. She hears voices no one else can hear. Disaster seems to follow her everywhere, until she meets Athen, the mythological faun who took her captive. His reason? She is his symbolon--the mate prophesied to him. Whisked to a land she didn't know existed, among creatures she's only read about in fairytales, Scylla learns there is more to her captor than meets the eye. He is kind, he is wise, and he is one of four Fae generals who fought for the survival of mankind nearly one hundred years ago.He is also the last faun in existence.As she learns from him, her feelings for Athen burn deeper and deeper. Terror turns into trust, exchanged smiles turn into fiery kisses. But Scylla's brother is in trouble and wicked forces in the Fae world threaten to sear Scylla's budding bond to Athen. Together, they must find her brother and put an end to the evil spreading across the land--or risk the annihilation of the human race.",
