Even though her memory of that day is hazy, she has spent ten years trying to put it behind her and focus on the future.Armed with the knowledge that her career will be her only legacy, Alexis works night and day to prove that she is more than just her last name. It’s not that she doesn’t have time for love – she doesn’t have the heart for it. After all, there’s no point in starting something that you can’t finish. Adam is dark and brooding and strangely charming. The film student is the perfect distraction from the mundane life she’s created for herself. Unfortunately, Adam’s memory isn’t hazy . . . not in the least. And, what she doesn’t remember, he can’t forget.",
