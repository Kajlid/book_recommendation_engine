  "title": "Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters",
  "description": "Irreversible Damage\n is an exploration of a mystery: Why, in the last decade, has the diagnosis \"gender dysphoria,\" transformed from a vanishingly rare affliction, applying almost exclusively to boys and men, to an epidemic among teenage girls?  Author Abigail Shrier presents shocking statistics and stories from real families to show that America and the West have become fertile ground for a \"transgender craze\" that has nothing to do with real gender dysphoria and everything to do with our cultural frailty. Teenage girls are taking courses of testosterone and disfiguring their bodies. Parents are undermined; experts are over-relied upon; dissenters in science and medicine are intimidated; free speech truckles under renewed attack; socialized medicine bears hidden consequences; and an intersectional era has arisen in which the desire to escape a dominant identity encourages individuals to take cover in victim groups.  Every person who has ever had a skeptical thought about the sudden rush toward a non-binary future but been afraid to express itâ€”this book is for you.",
