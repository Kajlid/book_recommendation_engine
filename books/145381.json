  "description": "Song of the Manatee: Aria of Light is book one of a two part saga that will take you around the cosmic block, back in time to Earth's early Eocene and far into its future, across galaxies and alternate dimensions of time. In 2199, sixteen year-old Swan Black lives in an ideal society. Every need is supplied by the ostensibly benevolent Central Government, which strives to encircle and protect the Citizens--with a few notable exceptions. As far as most Citizens are concerned, Swan Black shouldn't have been born. Being an albino fated her to scorn and ostracism in a society where sensible couples conceive in vitro and select only perfect embryos. She might have led a lonely existence if not for her devoted father, Michael Black, a brilliant paleontologist and exceptionally kindhearted man. He undertakes Swan's education onboard his science vessel; by age sixteen she has become a capable research partner. Under the control of their dictatorial Central Government, Dr. Black has been researching the evolution of the extinct Florida Manatee. Father and daughter are close to an astonishing discovery-when the unthinkable happens. Only Swan saw the unidentified spacecraft materialize directly above the forbidden springs where her father was cave-diving, then vanish without a trace-along with Michael Black! Unknown to Dr. Black, the covert objective of his research was to ensure man's dominion over earth- by derailing the evolution of an infinitely peaceful, intelligent species. To the detriment of the planet, he unwittingly succeeded. Swan must travel the rivers of time to find her father and reset the universe, so that the blessed meek shall truly inherit the Earth.",
