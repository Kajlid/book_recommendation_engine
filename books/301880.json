  "description": "WHAT A PRETTY PICKLE SHE'D GOT INTO--AND IT TASTED MORE SOUR BY THE MOMENT! Blessed with beauty, Mrs. Manners never bothered with the lesser skills of grammar and spelling. So, in order to entrap a second husband, namely the dashing Duke of Denbigh, she needed Miss Verity Bascombe. Surely the modest chit would be honored to write her love letters. Poor Verity!

But alas, what began as a tiny deception became troublesome indeed--for Verity soon found herself enamoured of the handsome duke herself!",
