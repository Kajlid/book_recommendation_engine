Publishers Weekly called The Islands of Chaldea \"a story to cherish\" in their starred review.Aileen comes from a long line of magic makers, and her aunt Beck is the most powerful magician on Skarr. But Aileen's magic has yet to reveal itself, even though she is old enough and it should have by now.

A powerful talking cat changes all of thatâ€”and with every obstacle Aileen faces, she becomes stronger and more confident, until her magic blooms.",
