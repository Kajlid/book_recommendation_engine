  "description": "The book GO, GIRL, GO is suitable for any group, from  second grade through high school--but it is interesting enough for older audiences as well.  The story is a heart-warming presentation of an extraordinary girl who has multiple handicaps but goes through life with an attitude that is awe-inspiring.  Shoshana  touches  the heart of everyone she meets, for she embraces life and people  with the joy of living and with caring for others. But there is much more to Shoshana. She sets and meets high goals, whether it is  making the honor roll, winning races, working on computers or doing what seems impossible.  She is a winner and an inspiration.  This book should be required reading for any student.             Professor  Mary Custureri, Ed.D.,",
