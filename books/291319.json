  "description": "Seventeen years ago, different dreams pulled Simon Mizrahi and Lana Kuo apart. But when Lana takes a position as a chef back in Manhattan, her apartment search puts her right in her ex-husband's path. Music teacher Simon is also hunting for a new place to live, and when Lana proposes they be platonic roomies, well...it's not the worst idea he's ever heard. A sunny uptown two-bedroom sounds far more appealing than the cramped, noisy space where he's currently struggling to work. Still, Simon has seen firsthand that Lana's a flight risk, so he agrees on a trial basis. Three months. With strict boundaries. Living together again feels wonderfully nostalgic, but when the ex-couple's lingering feelings rise to the surface, the rules go out the window. Of course, chemistry was never their problem. But while Simon's career feels back on solid footing, Lana is still sorting out what she wants. With their trial period soon coming to an end, they'll have to decide if their living arrangement was merely a sexy trip down memory lane or a reunion meant to last.",
