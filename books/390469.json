  "description": "When the Scottish outlaw Tobias Longdirk used gramarye, or magic, to defeat the Fiend, he did more than save Europe from abject slavery. He made himself the most feared and most envied man in all Italy. Now, with the hordes poised once more to sweep down over the Alps, Toby and his friend Hamish must unite the quarreling city-states when no ally can be trusted and traitors lurk in every shadow. At stake is far more than just a continent's destiny. At stake is a woman's love!",
