  "title": "Fifteen Dollars' Guilt",
  "description": "Some find their life’s calling in a flash of insight, or through sleepless nights of toil. For others, it takes an act of kindness. But when one man’s charity helps another realize his calling is to end a third man’s life, what then? And what is one to do when the intended victim is the president of the United States?  1881 AD: After a close brush with death in a steamship disaster, Prometheus encounters another survivor who gripes about how aimless his life has become. Prometheus helps him find his purpose, inadvertently setting in motion the assassination of President Garfield.  A short story from The Prometheus Saga.",
