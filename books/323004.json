  "description": "Since he fled from his religious fundamentalist family over a year ago, young Chris Brenner has completed his first year as an initiate at the Center for Restoration, and become a student of Theresa Smith, one of the founders of the organization. Now, alone in his former teacherâ€™s apartment in Manhattan, delving into the deceased Master's past through her writings, Chris begins to find the purpose and life-direction that has eluded him.Book Four in the RESTORATION series finds our three heroes in wildly different place. Chris has begun to carry the messages of RESTORATION to the younger generation through socially disruptive vlogs. Mary pursues her calling to help women overcome patriarchal barriers by creating and managing a day-care center for working poor mothers. And George, narrowly rescued from not one but two gold-digging blondes, must now do all in his power to protect his aunt from a man who seems to be a complete gigolo. Set against the backdrop of the decaying American empire, this series of novels details the efforts of young people to escape from the patriarchal shackles of their various religion-dominated families. Reprogramming their minds is only the first step in RESTORATION, and eventually they must resume the journeys that were interrupted, finding careers, love, and heartbreak.",
