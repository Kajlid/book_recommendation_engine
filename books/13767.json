  "description": "It is a must after reading Post-Human. It is adventurous and thought-provoking. It will take you into the epic journey of humanity as it will be forced to face a future more advanced than it could have imagined if it wants to survive. Nineteen months have passed since the A.I turned against humanity and was subsequently destroyed. In the meantime, James Keats has turned over the AI's powers to a non-intelligent, easily controlled operating system. He and Thel have left the planet and spent six months vacationing on Venus, which has been newly terraformed without the consent or knowledge of the Governing Council.",
