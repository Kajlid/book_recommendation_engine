  "description": "FuseBeing who I am, most people, not a member of the club, assume I got my road name for being able to fix shit and my brains. What I’m really known for is my short fuse. Being a part of the Inferno’s Clutch MC, I handle shit for the club that could easily put me behind bars for years. I also go to fights to release the aggression that builds within me.When she entered my life, I realized quickly she can anger me in ways not many can. It makes me despise the way I’m attracted to her. She’s nothing I normally go for. Worst of all, I hate that I have to bring her close to me in order to protect her from whoever’s after her.Will I be able to control my temper? Or even be able to hold back the temptation to make her mine?",
