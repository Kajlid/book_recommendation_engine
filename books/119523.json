  "title": "The Little King December",
  "description": "Little King December comes from a place where, the day you are born, you wake up fully-grown and fully clothed. That very first day of your life you go into your office, make some deals, sell a few books, or, in his case, rule a kingdom. And every day you get a little bit smaller and you forget a little bit more, so that at the end of your life you are tiny, and you spend your days forgetting things, eating brightly colored gummy bears, and chasing shadows in the garden. But don't let size fool you. Little King December is full of big questions that require big answers. What do you know already when you are born? Why do you feel small when you look at something big? With an upside-down logic and a knack at finding the funny truth of things, the little pot-bellied king teaches the narrator and the reader what life and dreams are all about.",
