  "description": "The sixth of the \"Williamsburg\" novels, \"This was Tomorrow\" displays all the charm and dramatic power readers look for in the work of Elswyth Thane. Her skilful and delicate portrayal of the loves of Jeff and Sylvia, of Stephen and Evadne, will delight and fascintate. Jeff was a foreign correspondent, widely travelled and charming, Stephen and Sylvia were musical-comedy stars, whose gay and light-hearted performances delighted London audiences. But it is Evadne who dominates the story. Evadne, whose short chestnut curls and gentle curving smile made her quite irresistible to Stephen, had a passionate desire to help the world - a crusading complex - which lead her to adopt a Cause and very nearly to lose her Stephen. It was only Stephen's tact and understanding that helped Evadne to cease her vain pursuit and to direct her energies into a love that made both their lives rich and exquisitely happy. The loves of these two couples trace a bright thread through the rich pattern of English society at the time when the rise of a European dictator and the snare of appeasement where producing an ominous situation - that could happen again, tomorrow.",
