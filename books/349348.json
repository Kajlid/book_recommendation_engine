  "description": "Nearly 25 years after Housekeeping, Marilynne Robinson returns with an intimate tale of three generations, from the Civil War to the 20th century: a story about fathers and sons and the spiritual battles that still rage at America's heart. In the words of Kirkus, it is a novel \"as big as a nation, as quiet as thought, and moving as prayer. Matchless and towering.\" GILEAD tells the story of America and will break your heart.",
