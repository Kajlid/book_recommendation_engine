  "description": "**Book one of The Love Series, but can be read as a stand-alone.** **A slow burn love story.**There were a few things in life that Kole Masters considered of utmost importance – tennis, family and keeping the secret that she’d been forced to tell to the media and fans years ago. And, up until recently, she’d been juggling the three quite well. But there’s a problem with keeping secrets and holding everyone at arm’s length – the load can get heavy. Especially when you have an overbearing father like Bernie Masters for a manger, whose expectations will never be met. When a knee injury during the French Open Final provides her with the escape she’s secretly been pining for, Kole takes a leap of faith. Only, she doesn’t realize the part of the plan that lands her beneath the same roof as the fiery, anti-American tennis player, Santiago Martinez, until it’s too late.  So with a bum knee, an uncomfortable living situation and uncertainties about her future, her once picture perfect life is a crumbling, chaotic mess. Kole begins to understand that in order to figure out her future, she must sort through, and come to terms with her past. And the fact that her feelings towards Santiago – somehow and most certainly against her will – have progressed past snide remarks, heated conversations and death threats to longing for caresses that she can’t understand, jealousy that won’t go away and a desire to let a complete stranger closer to her than she ever has before…Well, she’s in it up to her elbows.",
