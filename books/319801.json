I’m an adult living with my parents as I contemplate my future. I’ve given up everything to make the ultimate sacrifice, but at some point I need to put what happened behind me. It’s time to imagine new dreams, create new goals, and cheer for touchdowns that aren’t scored by Jack Dalton.Maybe then I can pick up the pieces I left behind.\nTOUCHDOWN is the final book in the VEGAS ACES: THE QUARTERBACK series. This series must be read in order.",
