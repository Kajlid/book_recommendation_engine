  "description": "When Adam Freedman - a straight, cis teen from Piedmont, California - goes to stay with his older sister, Casey, in Brooklyn, he fantasizes about a summer of freedom, new friends, and falling in love. He’s in for a surprise.It’s 2006, and Casey has thrown herself into NYC’s lesbian and trans activist scene - marriage equality marches, L Word-watching parties, BDSM sex clubs, and trans rights protests. Adam tags along, having fun in places he’d never have expected, but he’s surrounded by lesbians, and it seems like the last thing he’ll find is a girlfriend. That is, until he meets Gillian. Adam is soon hopelessly, desperately in love...only there’s just one small problem. Gillian thinks he’s a trans man.Ariel Schrag’s scathingly funny and poignant debut novel puts a fresh spin on questions of love, attraction, self-definition, and what it means to be part of a community.",
