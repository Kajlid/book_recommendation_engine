  "description": "A legend that tells of a star…\nIt’s been hundreds of years since the Dark Lord fell from heaven. Now his power is growing, and as his pall settles over the free world, four adventurers plot his downfall. If Pluriel and his companions can cheat a cunning dragon and retrieve a legendary sword, there’s a chance – a small chance – they could save the world from evil’s tyranny.Still, getting past the dragon is the easy part. Even if they recapture the sword, the Dark Lord will not die until the Star falls from the sky – and how is such a thing possible? But that’s beside the point. With the sword in their hands, there’s some hope for Militer. Without it, there’s none.",
