  "title": "The Last Flower: A Parable in Pictures",
  "description": "Originally published in November 1939, two months after World War II officially began, James Thurber's parable in pictures-- a graphic novel ahead of its day--about eternal cycles of war, peace, love, and the resilience of one little flower remains as relevant today as it was then. The New York Times called it \"at once one of the most serious and one of the most hilarious contributions on war.\"    Civilization has collapsed  after World War XII, dogs have deserted their masters, all the groves and gardens have been destroyed, and love has vanished from the earth. Then one day, \"a young girl who had never seen a flower chanced to come upon the last one in the world.\" Written among the sorrow and chaos of war, dedicated to this only child \" in the wistful hope that her world will be better than mine.\" The new printing will feature new scans of Thurber's original 1939 drawings.",
