  "description": "It’s almost love at first sight when a chance encounter at a local bakery, called Sweet Treats, brings Grayson James in close proximity with the woman who may change his life forever – Tanley West. Looking to place a large order for his charitable event, Grayson isn’t prepared for the connection he feels with the beautiful woman across the counter. Tanley has never been much for the dating scene, but this might all change when she lays eyes on the handsome cowboy. His very presence nearly brings her to her knees. Taking his order proves to be more complicated than she bargained for, as she tries to keep her composure on the outside when she’s all but swooning on the inside. Somehow, she manages to get through the ordeal - that is until one text message changes everything… True love and a happily-ever-after may be the frosting on the cake for this baker, but only if she’s brave enough to reach out and grab it with both hands.",
