  "description": "DEDUCTIVE DOG DETECTIVEWhen Takeru adopts his new pet, he's in for a surpriseâ€”the dog is none other than the reincarnation of Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective. What's more, this \"Sherdog\" has decided that Takeru is the reincarnation of his long-time assistant, Dr. Watson. Takeru may think Sherdog (or he himself) is crazy, but with no one else able to communicate with Holmes, he's roped into becoming the canine's assistant all the same. Using his exceptional sleuthing skills, Holmes uncovers clues to solve the trickiest crimes.",
