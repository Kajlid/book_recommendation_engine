  "description": "Asher Lake, a wolf in his ani-shift form and Keeper to his people and the protégé’s left in his care, knows what he wants. He wants to reform the Union, become a better man, and test fate. Determined that Elle Ison has a place in his life, he sets out to discover just what that place is—while pursuing the one thing that might open doors to provide answers, to the curse hanging over his life, namely his stolen medallion. Elle Ison, along with Asher’s brothers, Ari and Nixon, share two specific things in common—a love for Asher—and a desire to keep him alive anyway they can. Even if that means setting off on a fool’s quest or making certain sacrifices to keep him that way.",
