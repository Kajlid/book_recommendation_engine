  "description": "Venomous Proclamation is a standalone in The Unholy Confessions world. It is time for Daryl & Marilyn's origin story.White is the Devil’s true form of color.Although a bright and vibrant, clean white is not what people usually think of when they think of acts of the Devil.Instead, they think of those deep and heated reds. Those blacks that are so dark that they blind everything colorful around them until they are nothing. Until they match that very darkness.In my reality, the Devil wore white and surrounded himself with pretty, perfectly formed belongings. Mainly, those belongings were people. Human beings who were only in the Devil’s orbit because of money. Purely because he had paid to have them.To own them.The only reprieve I had from a life with the white Devil was when I closed my eyes and dreamt. Those dreams were always the same. Filled with a long-haired biker in his black leather jacket. With those icy blue eyes of his and a cross tattoo on the palm of his hand.That was the only thing that the white Devil could not take away from me.My dreams.⚠ Although Venomous Proclamation is an unholy confessions novel, it can be read as a complete standalone and does not contain any spoilers from the previous books.
