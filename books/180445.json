  "description": "Phae’s journey has only begun as she is swept across Obsidia in search of Ancient scrolls for ways to defeat Demise, an entity of immense power. Vido and Gomel trail her as they all find new companions and many more adversaries along the way. A quest from Axel brings Kaine east to the region of Berylum to fulfill a promise and to begin a chain of events that crumbles a Kingdom on its approach to supremacy. During his journey he will experience something that will change his entire life. Emperor Rudellus discovers secrets from the voice that has plagued him for the last two decades, and that he may truly be alone in the world. His General, Zamus begins his control of the power given to him, and seeks out everything Rudellus knows, and will stop at nothing to learn them. Archsage Avilina and Eryin unearth Ancient secrets of Magick, and with Galluf’s help, aid Celestia in its time of peril. This tale brings about broken alliances and friendships; love shattered and new relations brought to life; pain, death and sorrow alongside hope, desire, devotion and adoration. Will the prophecy come true? Or will Demise succeed?",
