  "title": "No Solid Ground: Renewable Contentment and Sustainable Happiness in an Age of Uncertainty",
  "description": "In No Solid Ground, Jeffrey Joe Miller manages to shake the foundations of our world, while at the same time ushering us into a new vision of contentment and grace. He observes that our modern view of existence is founded on a cherished notion that our earth is stable, and describes how clinging to a fantasy of \"solid, separate, and certain\" in the midst of the chaotic change we are now experiencing during a rapidly unfolding phenomenon known as the Sixth Extinction Event, creates a perceptual disconnect that results in profound unease in the human mind. A trained psychotherapist with specialization in Ecopsychology and Somatic Psychology, he guides us through a series of five steps and related exercises (organized as a journey through Earth's seasons) that realign our minds and bodies, and by extension, our society, so we're in sync with the uncertain and fast changing circumstances that accompany finding ourselves living in a twirling planet that's embedded in a dynamic solar system. This journey is a time-honored spirited path to recognizing our birthright of renewable contentment and sustainable happiness, even in the midst of continuous and unavoidable uncertainty.No Solid Ground is a profound and profoundly moving work that skillfully melds hard science and ancient wisdom, resulting in a direct and practical path to organic sanity. It is a deeply important book for our modern age, and one that could change your life.\"410 pages. 44 illustrations. Extensive References section. Over 30 personal exercises.",
