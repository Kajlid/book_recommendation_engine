  "description": "I saw himCouldn't leave him where I found himHe changed my life irrevocablyReminded me of the loves and lossesAll pieces of me.Intensely personal, shamelessly honest, and oftentimes an admission of inner ugliness, Only for a Moment explores ideas of transience, transition, and redemption through the battlegrounds of metamorphosis from young girl to woman. Each poem presents a snapshot; a puzzle piece of what ultimately becomes a collective consciousness. A road map to trace back through the labyrinth of people and experiences that define us.",
