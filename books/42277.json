  "description": "Satisfying readers’ cravings for romance novels with a suspenseful, supernatural touch comes a faith-filled story of a woman with a mysterious past, an even more unexplainable power, and the need to discover the truth. Their hit-and-run accidents happen at the same time . . . in two separate cars. Julia Johnson survives. But her father is killed. And it sparks a search into the mystery of who she is, where she came from, and why someone wants her dead. A fifteenth-century diary may hold the keys to the puzzle. But when she and her Uncle Oliver journey to the Cumberland area of Tennesse to uncover her past and follow the clues, knowing who to trust with her life—and her heart—becomes a deadly game. Guided by a secret, unknown friend with whom she shares unexplainable telepathic powers and a connection of the soul, she must seek the faith, courage, and wisdom to stay ahead of her enemies, and live.",
