  "title": "Sunset Song",
  "description": "Sunset Song is the first and most celebrated of Grassic Gibbon's great trilogy, A Scot's Quair . It provides a powerful description of the first two decades of the century through the evocation of change and the lyrical intensity of its prose. It is hard to find any other Scottish novel of the last century which has received wider acclaim and better epitomises the feelings of a nation.",
