  "description": "It was bad enough that Maggie had to spend the days with her boss and nemesis. Now to find out he’s a Dom at her favourite place to play?Maggie Carpenter needs an escape from her everyday life and her overbearing boss. David Tomlinson has ruined her life and career by acquiring her family’s business and tying her to an untenable employment contract.So she and her girlfriends head for an evening at the Den to explore their wildest fantasies…only to find David there looking ridiculously sexy in a leather vest with a set of handcuffs attached to his belt loop.David is just as shocked to find his spitfire employee at the Den. He leans against the wall, watching, unable to wrap his mind around the idea that the woman who constantly challenges him might be a sub. But when another Dom approaches her and she casts her gaze down, he sees another side of her.His reaction to the submissive Maggie is immediate and sizzling hot and so is the unwelcome jealousy he experiences. He’s always had a strict no-fraternisation rule, but he’s determined to have her in his cuffs before the evening is out, despite the dozens of reasons he shouldn’t. He wants Maggie surrendered to him, in his cuffs, literally as well as figuratively.",
