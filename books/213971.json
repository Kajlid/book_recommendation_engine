  "description": "NFL bad boy Knox Beckinsale has made headlines one time too many. Injured, suspended from the Torpedoes, and needing to clean up his image—fast—he heads to Fort Collins to help his Grandma Rosie after her heart attack. No women. No parties. No trouble. Until he meets Leila Patton, who’s nothing but trouble with big blue eyes and a girl next door demeanor that does nothing to hide curves that could make a man forget his religion. Knox Beckinsale is cocky, arrogant, and sexy as sin—everything unemployed journalist Leila isn’t looking for in a man. Which makes him absolutely perfect for banishing the memory of her former boyfriend who broke her heart—and fired her. But one night turns into another, and before long Leila realizes there’s more to Knox than just a pretty face and killer abs. When secrets from Knox's past surface, Leila is forced to choose between writing the story of a lifetime...or taking a chance on her own love story. EACH BOOK IN THE HARD MEN OF THE ROCKIES SERIES CAN BE READ AS A STANDALONE",
