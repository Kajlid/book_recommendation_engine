  "description": "“I’ll take everything you want to give me, love.” His voice was dark. “I’d gladly take your heart.” – Calix McKnight Only four days after Nova was captured by Calix McKnight, she lost her heart to his darkness and her soul to the dominance residing within the man. Only four days, and everything she’d known had changed. He owned her body. He possessed her heart. He captured her soul. With no hope of running from him, Nova does the only thing she can do. She accepts him. She accepts his darkness and cherishes his edges. After their wedding only two weeks into her capture, Nova is taken across the world to honeymoon with Calix in lavish romance that tricks her mind and heart into falling deeper than the blue abyss of the ocean, in love, with a monster. But it’s not all bliss and romance, because Calix really is a monster, and he’s more than determined to keep Nova as his own – forever. Even the revenge that powered his every action has withered in comparison to the need Calix feels to possess Nova to completion. However, there are some actions that even true love cannot forgive. In the quest to bind her irrevocably to him, will Calix overstep his boundaries and push Nova away from him forever? ***This novel does end in a cliffhanger. There is dark subject matter intended only for those who are 18 years or older!***",
