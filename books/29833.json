  "description": "When a dead dancing girl with all the wrong connections is found with Nick Valentine's name scrawled on a scrap of paper in her pocket, life gets a lot more complicated for the disgraced Great War hero.pUnwillingly drawn into a web of espionage and crime in the underbelly of 1930's London, Nick soon discovers that who killed her may be less important than why.brWith British Intelligence leaning on Nick to use his underworld connections to investigate the girl's killing, it soon becomes clear that there's more to the murder than meets the eye.pNick soon finds himself at odds not just with the authorities, but on the wrong side of Soho's gangland bosses and pursued by a foreign spy ring. Trawling Fitzrovia and Soho's demi-monde of clubs, cabarets and pubs for answers, Nick realises that the stakes go beyond national security, and that no one can be trusted.pAs the net closes and the case draws to an increasingly bloody conclusion, Nick is left to tie up the loose ends at a terrible personal cost. pThis dark and brooding thriller lifts the covers on a fascinating 1930s' London few know, while the plot's twists and turns keep the reader guessing right up to the final page.",
