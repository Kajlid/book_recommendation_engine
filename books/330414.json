  "description": "College is supposed to be a time of exploring new things, learning about yourself, and having a good time doing it. For Max Henley, it was the hardest time of his life. During his sophomore year, his best friend and lover, Nick, was killed in a car wreck. A car Max had been driving. Now two years later, Max has thrown himself into his studies. Side-lined from football due to an injury sustained during the wreck, Max's entire focus is on academics. Well, that and his Professor, Alec Demakis. The problem is, whenever Max thinks about his Professor, the guilt over Nick's death returns. Can Max ever forgive himself enough to love again?",
