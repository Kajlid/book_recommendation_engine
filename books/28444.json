  "description": "If Untamed by Glennon Doyle lit your soul on fire, you will love She Who Wins.If these past years have taught us anything, it's that so many women are stuck―stuck in jobs they despise, marriages that are joyless, roles they didn't ask for, and even in their own heads. The pandemic shook our world and now as we emerge from the cover of COVID, going back to \"normal\" seems insufferable.If there was ever an opportunity to shake things up, it's now. Through the pages of SHE WHO WINS, Renee Bauer breaks down some uncomfortable truths about the things holding us back from truly winning in life. Because if we can survive a pandemic, homeschooling, loss of income, and even a toilet paper shortage don't we deserve to win?Using her over two decades as an award-winning divorce attorney and entrepreneur, Renee Bauer shares her own vulnerable stories of divorce, failure, and ultimately, reinvention, to embolden, empower, and inspire women to choose the path most uncomfortable. This self-empowerment and motivational book is equal parts mindset and strategy, that can catapult women's lives from flatlined to fabulous by leaning into doing the hard thing.",
