  "title": "The Castle",
  "description": "Franz Kafka’s final novel tells the haunting tale of a man known only as K. and of his relentless, unavailing struggle with an inscrutable authority in order to gain entrance to the Castle. Although Kafka seemed to consider The Castle a failure, critics, in wrestling with its enigmatic meaning, have recognized it as one of the great novels of our century.Unfinished at Kafka’s death in 1924, the manuscript of The Castle was edited for publication by Kafka’s friend and literary executor, Max Brod. Both Brod’s edition and the English-language translation of it that was prepared by Willa and Edwin Muir in 1930 have long been considered flawed.This new edition of Kafka’s terrifying and comic masterpiece is the product of an international team of experts who went back to Kafka’s original manuscript and notes to create a text that is as close as possible to the way the author left it. The Times Literary Supplement hailed their work, saying that it will “decisively alter our understanding of Kafka and render previous editions obsolete.”Mark Harman’s brilliant translation closely follows the fluidity and breathlessness of the sparsely punctuated original manuscript, revealing levels of comedy, energy, and visual power that have not been previously accessible to English-language readers.W. H. Auden likened Kafka to Dante, Shakespeare, and Goethe as the single most important writer of his age. Here, in this new edition, is a Kafka for the twenty-first century.",
