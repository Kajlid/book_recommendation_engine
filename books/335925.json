  "description": "In his debut poetry collection, author Alex Armoredes discusses topics of friendship, loneliness, and feeling out of place and inadequate in a world that doesn’t appreciate those who don’t follow the crowd.A collection perfect for navigating the difficult periods in life, and finding hope even when everything seems lost.They only see the outside of me,And that’s the only way they decide to judge.If only I could show them what’s on the inside, but we,As a group, only decide to hold a grudge.",
