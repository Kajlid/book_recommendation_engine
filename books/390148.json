  "description": "It's 1924, the Jazz Age, but in Harry Turtledove's alternate history America, the Roaring Twenties are rumbling toward war. In the Confederate states, the fascistic Freedom Party is on the verge of seizing control of the presidency. In the United States, the Socialists rule the roost, led by President (erstwhile novelist) Upton Sinclair. The U.S. still controls Canada, but an independence movement there threatens to explode into open rebellion. Ireland, now free of Britain, has formed an alliance with the United States and Germany. After the Great Depression hits, international tensions mount precipitously.",
