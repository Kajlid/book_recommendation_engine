  "description": "Dan Shaw has been practicing law only four months and he’s already burned-out. Add the fact that he’s just lost his girlfriend and the cops are scouring his dubious past, and it’s no wonder Shaw decides to set sail for the summer. But even alone in the middle of the sea, trouble finds him.She’s naked, nearly drowned, and has little memory as to how she got that way. But the real story is even more twisted. Cesar Cardinal is a diplomat who takes diplomatic immunity literally. A playboy and high-stakes gambler, he’s feigned his wife’s suicide at sea and taken their young son to a heavily armed compound in the Dominican Republic, where U.S. law can’t touch him. But that’s not going to stop Shaw. From Bell Harbor to Monte Carlo, he’s baiting a trap with his own life…and there’s no telling what he’ll catch.",
