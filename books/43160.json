  "description": "Les Cossor is typical of the huge number of young Australian men who, without hesitation, 'joined up' for military service during the Second World War.Born and raised in the town of Albury on the New South Wales border, his story spans five years of service in the Australian 9th Division Cavalry Regiment as a motorcycle despatch rider and outlines the activities of the Regiment through his personal experiences.From basic training in Victoria and voyage to the Middle East for duty in Palestine, Lebanon, the rugged mountains of Syria and baking western desert of Egypt, this story reflects the warm and enduring friendships formed by ordinary young men in the midst of the most complex and tumultuous conflict the world has ever seen.",
