  "description": "Three young women have been murdered in a cult-style ritual. Or maybe they jumped off a beach cliff to their rocky deaths somehow to cleanse their sins. Each have small concentric circles tattooed on their breasts. It’s a variation of one used by local Indigenous groups.What would you do if you learned of the malicious acts?If you’re Beatrix Patterson, recently settling in Santa Barbara with her fiancé Dr. Thomas Ling, Chinese British scientist, you’d vow to uncover the truth. She refuses to allow these women be buried as Jane Does. First, in the sleepy beach town, she must dig out who would want them dead. That would be enough for most “finders” but then she’s begged to unearth the secret behind of the recent death of a New Orleans high-roller. Who to believe, the man’s over-the-top drag queen son or the cold evidence in the city’s morgue?It’s 1946. There’s no Internet and no way to search social media for instant answers. Beatrix discovers that the brutal killings are merely one layer of the mystery before her and she must unravel the lies, some decades old, before she also ends up dead.",
