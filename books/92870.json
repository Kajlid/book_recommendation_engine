  "title": "The Warden War",
  "description": "The Warden War continues the quest begun by Prince Donald in The Warden Threat. His father, the king of Westgrove, has been told that the neighboring kingdom of Gotrox has discovered a magical means to animate a mysterious and gigantic ancient stone warrior, the Warden of Mystic Defiance, which it plans to use it to spearhead an invasion of his kingdom. Donald is convinced this is a hoax carefully crafted by his fatherâ€™s chief advisor to bring about a war. Donald is determined to thwart him. It will not be easy. Chief Advisor Horace Barter has resources, connections, influence, and the almost unquestioned trust of the king. Donald, sadly, has none of these. What the young prince does have is a nominal position with the diplomatic team being sent to Gotrox and the companionship of a few rather unique friends including a pair of 15,000 year old androids, one of which is a dog--or a reasonable facsimile thereof.",
