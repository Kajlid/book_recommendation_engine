  "description": "Stress-eating after a breakup? Frustrated by the cost of a good cocktail? Stymied by the weirdness of abstract art? These penguins share your pain.The \"Random Penguins\" are a set of quirky, lovable weirdos with minds of their own. They understand the agony of social awkwardness, the power of the perfect smoky eye, and the arm-(or wing)-flapping terror of having a bee in the car. In fact, these winged characters get into the same sticky situations we all do. They are Penguins with People Problems. So meet your favorite new flightless friends. They're brutally honest (except when they're lying), comically insecure, and totally relatable.",
