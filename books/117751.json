  "description": "In this sequel to Survival Instinct, a small group that made it out of Leighton alive is now settling in at the Bishop cabin. It has been only one week since the Day, and they’re all still reeling from it. Despite this, they intend to survive and are preparing the cabin for the long months ahead. That is, until a plane lands on the lake, and an occupant inside delivers news that one survivor just can’t ignore. Meanwhile, at the North Leighton Correctional Facility, the dead are piling up outside. The walls are completely surrounded, and both citizens and mercenaries taking refuge inside are far from safe. Not only is the pressure building within, but something new has arrived outside the prison. It’s watching them. It’s waiting for them to make a mistake.",
