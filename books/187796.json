  "description": "“Gina Gordon never disappoints,” declares Jen McLaughlin! In this sizzling novel, two outsiders trying to turn their lives around find everything they’re looking for in each other’s arms.  I thought that reinventing myself as a corporate go-getter would be easy compared to my old life as an escort, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. After taking a full-time office job, my past has come back to haunt me, my love life is nonexistent, and I miss sex—even with the lying cheats who used to be my clients. The trouble is, the closest thing to a man in my life is Ben Lockwood. After pushing me away, that jerk has the nerve to ask a favor—so why is he so hard to resist? \n\n Working my way up from cameraman to vice president of an adult media company has been . . . interesting. To focus on my career, I swear off all distractions—especially sex—and turn to Grace Nolan, the most poised and polished woman I know, for help cleaning up. But after my little vow of celibacy, spending time with Grace is pure torture. I can’t touch her, and yet I can’t stop thinking about her. And deep down, I know the reason why.Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from another Loveswept title.",
