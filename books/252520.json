  "description": "My name is Ace Bissett, and I’m a paranormal detective that doesn’t believe in magic.Or at least, I didn’t before I met them.The day I inherited my aunt’s old house, everything changed. One moment, I was convinced that magic was a hoax. The next, I’m surrounded by four winged, fanged, ridiculously hot guys who are definitely not human, and who insist that I'm the only one who can break the curse that binds them to the night.I know I should run far, far away from this hot mess, but there's a connection between us I can't deny. I'm seeing things I can't explain, feeling things that don't make sense. The detective in me has never been able to resist a mystery, and this one is just begging me to dig in.But all that will have to wait, because there’s a new threat stalking my city. One with a taste for blood and bone, unable to be killed or captured by normal human means.It’s a good thing I’ve got four new roommates to help me hunt them down. But even if I didn’t, I’d figure out a way. Because I never give up. I never give in. And I always protect what’s mine.",
