  "description": "Tom Shaw, the mild mannered CEO of Pure Industries, a small pharmaceutical lab in California, is wracked with worry. A terminally sick wife, a distraught young son and a business on the verge of collapse. But these worries dwindle into insignificance for him when Dr Rachael Leo, his young but brilliant Chief Scientist informs that she has made the greatest discovery in the history of science. Following an simple accident in the lab, Pure Industries have discovered the Elixir of Life, the news of which releases a fire-storm of violence and treachery which penetrates to the very heart of the US Government. There are currently over a hundred labs in the US alone trying to devise an antidote to the process of human aging. Elixir is a fast-moving, powerful and thought-provoking thriller that imagines what might happen if one of them actually succeeded.",
