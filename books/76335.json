  "title": "Transforming Your Self: Becoming Who You Want to be",
  "description": "Learn a model for changing the beliefs that impact us the most -- those about our own identity. Everyone agrees it's good to have high self-esteem, but almost no one knows how to actually get it. Practices such as \"just loving yourself more\" don't usually work. This model shows how to discover the unconscious structure of identity, and how to align your identity with your values. The result is a resilient self-esteem that naturally leads to \"becoming who you want to be.\" This is an advanced NLP book, most useful for those who have background in Neuro-Linguistic Programming.",
