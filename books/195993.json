  "description": "Peter Gruber is a young boy living in Hamburg, Germany in 1939. His resourcefulness is the only thing keeping him and his mother from crushing poverty, until world events destroy everything he has ever known. Leaving his childhood behind, Peter now faces a different kind of horror – pledging allegiance in an elite training camp for SS officers in Nazi Germany. Inspired by a true story, The Pact sheds light on indoctrination, propaganda, insidious racism and a child’s basic sense of morality.",
