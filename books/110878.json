  "description": "Trauma surgeon Justin Wellington is accustomed to handling gunshot wounds... just not over his Cobb salad. When a lunch date with his best friend, the woman with whom he's quietly and desperately in love - homicide detective Kathleen Murphy - becomes the scene of a drive-by shooting, Justin's surgical skills are called upon to save the life of a young waitress. His heroism that day sets into motion a chain of events that brings him to the attention of a dangerous and disturbed individual, threatening his career, his own life and the lives of those he holds dear. Obsession: Because sometimes what we think is love is really only madness.",
