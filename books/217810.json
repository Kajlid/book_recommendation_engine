  "description": "Kerri’s excited to be able to help plan the wedding of her sister’s friend. Decorating her sister’s middle-of-nowhere cabin and taking some R&R after finally finishing cooking school is exactly what she needs before she starts her job hunt. Unable to sleep, Kerri heads out into the woods before dawn on Christmas Eve to cut pine boughs to decorate the fireplace mantel. It’s cold and dark, but Kerri finds herself enjoying the early morning walk in the woods. Until an unwanted guest in the form of an enormous polar bear intrudes on her quiet morning. At dawn on Christmas Eve, Sullivan, an arctic shifter, goes with two members of the NPC security team to scout out the location for a close friend’s wedding. Deciding he’s a better hunter in his shifted form, he chooses the polar bear, his favorite of his four shifts. Heading into the woods that surround the cabin, he follows the scent of something amazing and comes face-to-face with a beautiful woman who watches him shift back into his human form and promptly passes out. When Kerri awakens, she feels immediately connected to a man she’s pretty sure she saw change forms from bear to human. She can’t explain why she feels drawn to him, but he can. He’s a quad shifter, part of Santa’s sleigh team, and she’s his fated mate. For a human who never realized that shifters, or Santa, were real, Kerri has to make a choice…fast. Either she’s waiting when Sullivan gets back from the Christmas Eve run, or he’ll leave her behind. Will Sullivan get his Christmas wish for Kerri to accept being his mate and join him in the North Pole, or will this be a blue Christmas for everyone?",
