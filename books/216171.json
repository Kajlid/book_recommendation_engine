  "description": "Cass, Nix, and Del are good at two things: finding treasure and killing demons. Lying low is a close third—but not because they want to be good at hiding. They’re FireSouls, some of the unlucky few to inherit a piece of the dragon’s soul. On the surface, the perks are sweet—they have the power to find and steal any type of magical treasure, including the powers of other supernaturals. But it doesn’t come without a price—stealing powers requires that they kill, and others would destroy them if they discover what they are. In a world full of magic, hiding their powers is the only way to survive. That's not too hard, except for the fact that they’re being blackmailed by a criminal overlord who holds their lives in his hands. He wants a pair or rare daggers hidden inside a deadly temple. If Cass, Nix, and Del don’t get him the daggers, they’re dead. But when they get’s into the temple, they realize that things are even worse than they’d imagined. What was supposed to be a normal job is decidedly…not. And surviving it might be impossible.",
