  "description": "Take it off. Take it all off. To say Harlan Sheppard is hot for teacher would be the understatement of the year. Working closely with Professor Sawyer Addison has taught Harlan one thing. Persistence doesn’t always pay off. With graduation only a day away, Harlan is willing to do anything to get the object of his affection to see him as more than just another student. Unbeknownst to Harlan, Sawyer sees his sexy TA for exactly what he is—an attractive, brilliant man who just so happens to moonlight as a stripper. A fact Sawyer discovered one night at Tricky Dix, a gay strip club. Since then he’s been avoiding the club—and Harlan—like the plague, refusing to allow his career to be overshadowed by his lust. At least for a few hours more. Until graduation. Harlan has waited long enough. He’s ready to show Sawyer just what makes Harlan the hottest headliner around. And if Sawyer won’t come to the club, Harlan will just have to take his show on the road…straight into Sawyer’s bedroom.",
