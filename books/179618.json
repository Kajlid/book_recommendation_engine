  "title": "Gratitude Renewed - A Journey Journal",
  "description": "This is not a traditional self-help book. It is a life plan designed to renew gratitude and strengthen faith. The authors of this book are not trained psychologists or ordained clergy (although they received plenty of input from professionals). They are a father and son with a combined one hundred years (plus) experience of Life. They have faced challenges, experienced failure and explored their faith. There are several journal pages included at the end of each chapter. They are intentionally left blank for you, the reader, to fill. As seen in the motion picture \"God, Where Are You?\" (Starring Wade Williams and Kibwe Dorsey, written and directed by De Miller).“It is well written and easy to understand and is prospectively a great self-help tool.”Theda Sturm, M.S., L.M.F.T., In Harmony Counseling“Mark and De have a great gift in writing given to them by God.
