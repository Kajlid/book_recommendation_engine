Naoto, his personal attendant, is everything Koji has ever fantasised muscular, long-haired, ruggedly handsome, gentle yet commanding. Naoto is a White Tiger, after all, trained in the erotic arts, knowlegeable in every way to bring a man to bliss. Naoto's appreciative eye sees the honourable and sexy man Koji-san is under the work-driven shell. Little by little, his massages and more coax the real man, the passionate, artistic, sex-loving Koji, to the surface. Yet, the more time Naoto spends with Koji, the more he finds his own soul craving a partner again, the one thing he thought he'd never find after his lover was killed three years ago. He's not sure he's ready to get that close again. And even if he were ready, it doesn t mean that Koji wants the same thing. In fact, Koji once mentioned that he was supposed to get married. Yet, when an agonising secret from Naoto s past is revealed to him, Naoto wants only to turn to Koji. When Naoto comes to him for help, Koji is suddenly faced with a harrowing remain in his work-driven, soul-killing world or follow the path his body and heart have really chosen for him? And he must choose - for in a world where passion and spirit find union, there is no in between.",
