  "description": "Chris Bacon is dead. Long live Chrisander Baccioni? Unable to walk or talk coherently after a hit and run attack, Chris finds himself on the other side of the world with Jase firmly in babysitting mode. Pity and betrayal, even if it was for ‘his own good’ wasn’t something Chris tolerated from anyone, least of all from an ex-lover who was hanging around only out of a misguided sense of duty. The barely breathing battered boy was all Kathleen had to wipe away her daughter’s shame and continue the Baccioni dynasty. Despite Chrisander’s unfortunate childhood, her grandson was young enough to mould into a god-fearing family man. Surely only an idiot would reject a life of respect and luxury with a beautiful, intelligent woman by his side, for a grubby little flat and a dirt poor, ex-army sergeant.",
