  "title": "A Beautiful Bag of Fish",
  "description": "'We shouldn’t follow other countries and how they police their communities, if this happens we may as well put the army on the streets, I hope this never happens.'  Every single day UK police officers work to make sure that the public they serve are protected and safe. They continue to plug on, even though the Government fail to support their efforts. ‘A Beautiful Bag of Fish’ is a first-hand account of life as a police officer on the front line and the psychological effect the War on Drugs had on both the officer and his family. Investigating criminals would invariably be natural to the author who grew up on the gritty streets of a northern English working class town. After becoming a police officer the author joined the divisional drugs unit, investigating criminals who during the late 1990s attempted to introduce heroin and crack cocaine onto England's mean streets. During these investigations, the author received death threats after several criminals were imprisoned for shooting and kidnapping offences. Unwilling to be defeated, he trained as an undercover officer to buy Class A drugs, which lead to over 60 convictions, and commendations from the Chief Constable and Crown Court judges. The author shows a genuine, personal story of life as a police officer working in England’s toughest neighbourhoods.",
