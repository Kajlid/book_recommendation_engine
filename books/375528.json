One morning Grasshopper finds a lovely road to follow. Off he goes on his journey, past plenty of busy characters. They wonder why Grasshopper isn’t as busy as they are. But Grasshopper—well, he is happy just walking down the road. Arnold Lobel's beloved Level 2 I Can Read classic was created for kids who read on their own but still need a little help. The classic Frog and Toad stories by Arnold Lobel have won numerous awards and honors, including a Newbery Honor, a Caldecott Honor, ALA Notable Children’s Book, Fanfare Honor List ( Horn Book ), School Library Journal Best Children’s Book, and Library of Congress Children’s Book.",
