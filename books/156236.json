  "description": "Get ready to fight, Sector 7!  It's Battle Month for the thirteen shinobi clans spread across Shaaku Den. A tournament where students represent their skill must prove themselves and their skills in the Ninjutsu Art.  The Kitsune Clan enters into the tournament, lead by the second-in-command Akira Miyamoto, who grudgingly brings along Sector 7. Not only is Sector 7 one person short of a complete team, but five out of the six members are new students and ranked as fresh meat.  Can the members of Sector 7 survive the tournament? Or will the nerves of competition and other shortcomings keep them from victory?",
