  "description": "\"I feel content, like this is what my entire adult life has been leading up to, like I'm the cheesy female lead in the final scene of a made-for-TV Christmas movie. The pastor's wife who finally figures out what life is supposed to be about. Whatever. It's probably just the mulled wine.\"Peyton Northam does feel like things are starting to make sense for her and her young family. Her “nemesis,” Pastor Long is even cooperating by announcing his sudden retirement. But life is never static, and with new people entering Brice and Peyton’s lives on a seemingly daily basis, there's always something... or someone... different to worry about. Like the new assistant pastor who sets off Peyton's Creep-O-Meter. And the enigmatic local artist who tends to make Peyton forget she's no longer that trendy single girl from merely a few years ago. And even the most familiar people aren’t as recognizable as they once were. Her husband’s saying and doing out-of-character things, and her two best friends sometimes feel like strangers to her. In fact, it seems like the only constant in Peyton’s life is… Peyton. Because, as usual, she’s still holding on to all the old grudges, insecurities, and memories that make her The Secret Keeper.",
