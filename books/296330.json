  "description": "Grace Jamison had left the little town of Everly twelve years ago with her son and vowed never to return. But in order to move on with her future, she finds she has to return to her hometown and fix the wrongs of the past-starting with the only man who had ever had the power to hurt her. The last person Trick Burnett wanted to see on West End property was his adulterous one time stepmother-the woman responsible for his father's murder. Too bad his body seemed to have a mind of its own where Grace was concerned. Trick hated secrets and Grace was a walking cache of them. He wasn't above committing sexual blackmail in order to trick the truth from her time and again. Her sweet responsiveness always left him hungry for more until the mere revelation of her dark secrets was no longer enough. He couldn't rest until he had everything from her-mind, body and soul.
