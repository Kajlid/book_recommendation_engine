  "title": "Years of Infamy: The Untold Story of America's Concentration Camps",
  "description": "\"In 1942 110,000 West Coast residents, many of them United States citizens, were placed in concentration camps for no reason other than that they were of Japanese origin. One of them, Michi Weglyn, a teenager at the time, recounts their experience, drawing on Government documents and on her own memories of one of the camps. An appalling story of neglect and even brutality.\"―New York Times Book Review\"Weglyn writes with a compelling mixture of passion, thorough research, and a fierce tough-mindedness. Her book should be of immense value to anyone interested in minority experience, World War II, or the squirmings of public policy under pressure.\"―James D. Houston, Harper's Bookletter\"Certainly the most thoroughly documented account of World War II Japanese American internment. . . . Formidable.\"―Kirkus Reviews",
