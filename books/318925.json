In a secluded temple, he contemplates his life as an assassin, determined to walk away from his employer, the Citadel forever. But a vast, global conspiracy draws him back from the shadows.

Now all of them find themselves in a life or death struggle against a vast international conspiracy that threatens to consume the entire planet.
