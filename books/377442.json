  "description": "Alternate cover available here.The French Writer and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (1900-1944), was born in Lyon. His first two books, Southern Mail and Night Flight, are distinguished by a poetic evocation of the romance and discipline of flying. Later works, including Wind, Sand and Stars and Flight to Arras, stress his humanistic philosophy. Saint-Exupéry's popular children's book The Little Prince is also read by adults for its allegorical meaning. Saint-Exupéry's plane disappeared during a mission in World War II.",
