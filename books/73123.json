  "description": "Who can think about having kids when you still are one – at least on the inside?Taylor Ellison never wanted to grow up. In fact, if she could have stayed twenty-two and blissfully ignorant about life, she probably would have. But life doesn’t allow you to stand still. So at twenty-eight, with not a marriage worthy guy in sight and suddenly jobless, Taylor decides to stop trying so hard to grow up, especially since searching for Mr. Right sucks anyway. She wonders if maybe it’s time to just have some fun. And when her best friend, Josh, talks her into opening a pub with him, she finally feels like her life is falling into place. Josh is a perpetual bachelor who Taylor knows won’t get serious with anyone. He’s holding onto his youth as tightly as she is. Then one night everything changes, and Taylor starts to realize that Josh might not see her as just a friend. But does she feel the same way? And is she willing to take a risk on a friendship and a partnership with a guy who might never grow up? Then again, maybe a guy like Josh is exactly who she’s been searching for all along.",
