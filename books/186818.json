  "description": "WILD AT HEARTFaith Mendes needs to get her life in order and get a job--yesterday. Thankfully, the live-in house-keeper position at the King brothers' ranch is up for grabs. Problem is, she'd be working with her old childhood crush, Nate King. He's sexy, wealthy, and his Texas-sized charms are legendary...and, clearly, impossible to resist.Nate never thought twice about his best friend's little sister. Back then, Faith was off-limits. But now that she's all grown up, Nate's whole world has turned upside-down. Razor-sharp, down-to-earth, and hotter-than-heck, Faith is everything Nate has ever dreamed of in a woman...and maybe even in a wife. But Faith has loved and lost enough already to risk it all on another known bad-boy. How can Nate convince her that he is the real deal--and that he's ready to rein it in and never look back?",
