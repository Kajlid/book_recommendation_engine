And his latest mission--to uncover intelligence about a secret Nazi weapon--is his most perilous yet. Especially since he'll have to work with Katarina Kerensky.

In a race against time, Jack and Katia forge an alliance to take down the enemy...and learn whether love can survive in a world gone wrong.",
