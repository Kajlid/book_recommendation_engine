  "description": "In this latest film from director Danny Boyle, a massive epidemic has swept the world, leaving in its wake a host of rabid humans seething with hatred and bent on destroying anyone untouched by the disease. Four seemingly unaffected people—a young man, a young woman, a father, and his daughter—flee London through an apocalyptic landscape as they try to reach the coast, beset along the way by attacks of “Infected” at every turn. When they arrive at an isolated house in the country, inhabited by a small group of soldiers, they think they have found a haven from the violence outside. But they soon find they’ve jumped from the frying pan into the fire.",
