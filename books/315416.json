The only woman in his life is his childhood best friend, Corrine Harrison.

But he quickly discovers their charade is a little too real for comfort…Corrine always had a thing for Weston. But she knows she blew it when she announced her fake engagement. Her ex was so snide and dismissive that she blurted out the lie, failing to consider what a burden it would be for Weston, who had stuck her firmly in the friend zone. But after a single burning kiss from this smoking hot Navy SEAL, she's not so sure her feelings are unrequited anymore…They planned to stage a break-up before Weston shipped out to his next post. But suddenly, this fake engagement is feeling all too real. And when someone tries to sabotage her new bridal shop, Weston stands up to protect her. But who will protect her broken heart when Weston finally leaves?",
