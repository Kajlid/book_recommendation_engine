  "description": "In this revised edition of the best-selling book The Measure of a Man , Gene Getz delivers the newly enhanced message of what it takes to be a man of God. Men will gain encouragement for what they can be in Christ as fathers, husbands, and mentors to other men. Since 1974, The Measure of a Man has taught hundreds of thousands of men around the world how to live according to God’s direction faithfully, lovingly and spiritually. True masculinity is not measured by the strength of a man, but by these 20 biblical guidelines. With life applications and words of inspiration, here is Gene’s greatest work, fully rewritten and updated to reach the new generation of modern men.",
