  "title": "Memoirs of a Highland Lady, Volume One",
  "description": "These hugely readable and long celebrated recollections of Elizabeth Grant of Rothiemurchus (1797-1885) have enjoyed a devoted following since their first publication in 1898. The recent discovery of the original manuscript has now made it possible to publish for the first time the complete text of this absorbing masterpiece.In her vivid and inimitable style she describes her earliest years in Edinburgh and London where her father, Sir John Peter Grant, pursued his legal and political ambitions. Holidays are spent amongst the leisured members of her class in spas and resorts, and at Oxford where her uncle was Master of University College. But mostly she writes about the society that was changing so dramatically in the early years of the 19th century in the Highlands of Scotland, to this day the home of the Grants of Rothiemurchus.",
