  "description": "The baby wasn’t on the guest list…But at least the invitation said +1?   Nate Kensington was trouble. One night with him and this good girl bridesmaid became a Maid of Dishonor. He'd promised no strings and no regrets… but what happens when once isn’t enough?  Falling for a sworn bachelor complicates everything, especially when this groomsman is the life of the wedding party. With two months until the big day, my family is a one spoiled shrimp-ring from total meltdown. The bridezilla might kill the groom, my divorcing parents are constantly fighting, and the wedding invitations were mistakenly printed on indigo paper…  …The same color as the positive line on my secret pregnancy test.  To get everyone to the church on time, I have to keep the baby a secret until after the wedding. But the bad boy daddy-to-be won’t stop chasing me, and I can’t risk my heart on a playboy who’s only after one thing.  I’m already in over my head.  I can’t go in over my heels too.  Bad Boy’s Bridesmaid is a standalone romantic comedy with no cheating and a guaranteed happily-ever-after. This fun and flirty book also includes two full-length bonus novels—Bad Boy’s Baby and Bad Boy’s Revenge. Each book is about 70,000 words or 350 paperback pages. I hope you enjoy!",
