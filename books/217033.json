  "description": "One week to solve a murder. Londinium, 83 AD. Vibius Maecenas, spy for Emperor Domitian, lies on an underground altar ... his throat slit to the spinal chord. One week to stop a civil war. Arcturus, the governor's doctor and sometime investigator, must find out who butchered him--and why--before Agricola and all of Britannia are plunged into civil war with Rome. He'd also like to know where the blonde fits in ... Welcome to Roman Noir. NOX DORMIENDA is the first of a new series in a new Roman Noir. Featuring Arcturus, a hardboiled protagonist in the best Philip Marlowe tradition, NOX is a different kind of historical mystery, a suspense thriller that combines a classic noir style with the rich texture of the ancient past.",
