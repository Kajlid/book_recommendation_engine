  "description": "Christina Rossetti (1830-1894) was born in London of Italian parents. With her vivid imagination and innate talent for composing verse, she was an accomplished poet by her late teens. By 1866 she was established as a leading poet of her day.Prematurely in 1871 she was stricken with Graves Disease, becoming increasingly preoccupied with the relationship between earth and heaven, life and death. She had inherited a devout Anglican faith from her mother, and from this point on her verse became almost entirely religious.This volume focuses on her poetry marking the feasts and fasts of the Christian year. Divided into sections including Advent, Christmas, Lent and Easter, it is designed to be dipped into at the appropriate times, an aid to gentle reflection throughout the year.",
