  "description": "Freebooter at heart, spacer by trade, Beka Rosselin-Metadi doesn't want to hear about her father whose rugged generalship held back the Mageworlds -- or her highborn mother whose leadership has held the galaxy together since. Beka pilots spacecrafts -- as far from her famous family as possible. But when Beka's mother is assassinated on the Senate floor, her father offers her the title to Warhammer, prize ship from his own freebooting youth -- if she agrees to deliver the assassins to him \"off the books.\"Looking for assassins has a tendency to make assassins look for you. In doing so, Beka has arranged her own very public death and adopted a new identity. Now all she has to do is leave a trail of kidnappings and corpses across five star systems, and blow the roof off the strongest private fortress in the galaxy.The war with the Mageworlds is over. Now it's time for the real struggle to begin.",
