  "description": "Patty Panda is hungry but doesn't know what to eat. All the people she meets are happy to share their food but Patty has something very important to learn before she can indulge. This delightful rhyming story, written and illustrated completely in collage by Lavender Laine, teaches children that we are all different and what's good for one is not necessarily good for someone else. It might also inspire children to make art out of old odds and ends such as left over yarn and buttons, paper cut from old magazines, fabric off-cuts, and food packaging etc, as Laine has done here, encouraging recycling and resourcefulness.",
