  "description": "The eagerly awaited, immensely entertaining sequel to A House Called Awful End, now in paperbackAh, life is never easy for Eddie Dickens. In this brave and hearty installment of the Eddie Dickens Trilogy, he narrowly avoids being blown up, trampled by horses, hit by a hot-air balloon, and arrested - only to find himself falling heels over head for a girl with a face like a camel's. He also falls into the hands of a murderous gang of escaped convicts. They have \"a little job\" for him to do. All the old favorites are here - including Mad Uncle Jack and Malcolm (or it is Sally?) the stuffed stoat - along with some worrying-looking new ones. A good time will be had by all. Except Eddie.",
