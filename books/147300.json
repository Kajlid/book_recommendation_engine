Jack Simon’s road to the White House has been a smooth one until a night with the notorious Donovan James becomes a roadblock he can’t escape. Suddenly he’s America’s number one story and it has nothing to do with politics.

But that’s hard to do when the one thing standing in his way, is the one thing he wants the most… Donovan James, international singing sensation, has made a living singing songs about heartache and pain, two things she grew up on. But it’s time to set down some roots and the only man she wants is a man she’s all wrong for. A man she’s never stopped loving—Jack Simon. They’d had it all once, until they didn’t. And yet she can’t help but wonder if a second shot together just might be the game changer she needs. Or if old secrets can still ruin the only man she’s ever loved…",
