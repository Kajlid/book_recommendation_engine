And three lives bound by fate must rise against destiny before the barrier between worlds falls and all Hell breaks loose—literally.Perfect for fans of This Savage Song and Only a Monster, Darker by Four will pull readers into a world of love and desperation and revenge—a world where every deal has a catch, no secret stays buried, and no one is exactly who they say they are.",
