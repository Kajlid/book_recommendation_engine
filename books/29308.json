  "description": "Mother Bear has a secret! In fact, she has two of them. They're her brand new cubs â€” Boxer and Woof-Woof. The arrival of the Green Forest's newest inhabitants has Peter Rabbit, Chatterer the Red Squirrel, Prickly Porky, Hooty the Owl, and other forest creatures all astir over the goings-on in the Bear household. Young readers, too, can share the excitement as they learn how the twins get even with Peter Rabbit, find out what happens when the bears meet their father, discover why Mother Bear has to rescue her cubs, learn why Boxer gets a spanking, and much more.Brimming with traditional values, gentle humor, and real lessons about nature and wildlife, Thornton Burgess's engaging tale reveals why he's a grandmaster at storytelling. The simple text, reset in large, easy-to-read type and complemented with four charming illustrations from the original edition by Harrison Cady, will captivate today's readers as much as it charmed audiences generations ago.",
