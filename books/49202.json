  "description": "I wrote this story to entertain the erotic minds of all independent artists - everywhere. This is a story about me trying to realize a sexual fantasy to completion. It's a sexy comedy with no actual detailed encounters. Meaning, rated R, not X. :-DThis story talks about what it's like to be an independent author who is using twitter to sell her books. I meet a man who inspires my sexual imagination and then I tell all about it. Written for a laugh. I hope you enjoy.",
