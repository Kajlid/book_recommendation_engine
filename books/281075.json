  "description": "Bran  There are worse ways to make a living than traveling the worlds killing men. Especially if you’re a woman with a grudge and a gift. Like me.  I am part of the Zyrnx, but apart from them, as well. They believe in rescuing slaves. I believe in killing slave masters. I am not a savior of helpless victims—I am a killer of monsters.  But as Taal says, sometimes I see a monster where a man stands.  And the monster I have come to kill, he believes we are fated mates. Lifemates. Born for each other.  I do not believe in such things. I believe in sex, fighting, and death--not love. Or maybe just not love for--or from--me.  Gael  I've been waiting for this female my entire life. She's mine. I'm hers. Simple as that.",
