  "description": "Can a clash of wills …When a mad lass in trousers shoots at him, Munro “Bear” MacLawry isn’t sure what impresses him more—the girl’s sure aim or her irresistibly tempting curves. Catriona MacColl has fled to the Highlands with her half-sister to escape an unwanted wedding and wants no part of him, or any man. But he can’t abandon the flame-haired, sharp-tongued wildcat now that he’s discovered her—not when she fits so perfectly in his arms.Lead to a love for all time?Munro has more than earned his nickname: he’s a well-muscled, well-favored mountain of a man with an engaging bad-boy grin and a string of well-satisfied lasses behind him. Bringing Catriona food, blankets, candles, everything she needs to survive a winter in an abandoned abbey, Munro is an unexpected gift in her reckless bid for freedom—and an unexpected complication. Clan MacDonald has plans for her, and they don’t include her falling for a MacLawry. But this man makes her feel like a woman—and he may be her one chance to live a life about which she’s only dared dream.",
