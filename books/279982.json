  "title": "How to Bring Your Children to Christ... & Keep Them There: Avoiding the Tragedy of False Conversion",
  "description": "Eighty-eight percent of children raised in evangelical homes leave church at the age of eighteen never to return. Nothing is more important than where your kids will spend eternity. As a parent, you don't want to suffer the heartache of your children rebelling against their Christian upbringing. In this practical book, noted author/evangelist Ray Comfort counters the unscriptural belief that a child can be saved merely by \"asking Jesus into his heart,\" and shows parents (and children's workers) how to guide their children to experience genuine salvation and avoid the pitfall of rebellion. Filled with creative ideas for family devotions, tips for safeguarding kids from harmful influences, and great suggestions for helping kids learn God s holy standard, the Ten Commandments.",
