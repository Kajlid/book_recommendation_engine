  "description": "[Siren Everlasting Classic Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, shape-shifters, elves, HEA] Dr. Valentino Prayze was new to Brac Village, only having been there a few months. He was the local vet and loved his work. But when he gets a call from the Lakelands to come look at one of their horses, Valentino finds more than he ever expected. Abe helped the shifters rescue Cole and Curtis, and knew he couldn’t stay behind and face the wrath of his tribe. After Malcolm agrees to let Abe stay on the ranch, he finds the life isn’t what he had imagined it would be away from his tribe. He had been passing the time, having a bit of fun, and just plain old lonely when he flirted with the Lakeland men. Now the stakes are high and the flirting actually means something when he realizes that the vet is his mate. But when he loses his wallet after accidently shimmering into someone's closet, little does he know that the Head Vampire Hunter was the one to find it, and now his sights are set on Abe. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
