  "description": "Allie Parker is dreading Christmas vacation in Thornhill. She'd rather stay at her boarding school than go home, where she'll have to watch her flaky twin sisters and their superficial friends earn their Ph.D.'s in flirting. So when Allie meets cute Ben Harrington on the way there, things begin to look up.But Allie's hopes for a winter romance vanish when she discovers that Ben moved from Thornhill last year and is part of her sisters' crowd. He's a star basketball player who has dated the most popular girls at Thornhill High. Allie writes him off. There's no way he'd be interested in a serious girl like her, anyway. But the more Allie sees of Ben the less he seems like a typical jock. Is there more to Ben than meets the eye?",
