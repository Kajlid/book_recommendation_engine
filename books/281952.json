I tried to feign shyness, a slight indifference even, though such subterfuge was one of the greatest trials of my life. In the end, my animal instincts got the better of me …Marriage to Gerald has transported Philippa from her cosy farm in the Slieve Bloom Mountains in Ireland to his stately mansion, Woodleigh Hall. The enterprising Philippa shows her grit and determination in yet another commercial venture and experiences the down-to-earth warmth of Mr Manifold, the overly warm embraces of Canon Goodhue, the slyness of Gerald’s relatives, the joy and love of Flora, a final sad parting – and a wonderful discovery.'A real talent as a storyteller… a triumph.’ BBC'Fine and subtle storytelling.'
