  "description": "For her entire academic career, Catherine Newmeyer was promised that the world would be her oyster the moment she had a diploma in her hands. Unfortunately, the “real” world isn’t the crackable mollusk she thought it was. The job market isn’t kind to posthumans, so instead of becoming the Next Big Thing, Catherine works as a bouncer at a strip club. When one of the girls doesn’t show up for work one day, disappointment becomes the least of her worries.• One-Shot/Rated M",
