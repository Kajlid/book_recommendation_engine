  "description": "They say love is beautiful.  They lie.  Love is a dark, broken man with whiskey-colored eyes. Love is knowing he will never return my feelings. It is the final chord of a guitar riff as it bleeds into silence.  Love is Zeke Danton.  I convinced myself I needed him. I thought there was no one better to record my debut album with…  I was wrong.  Encased in layers of ice, he wears his pain like a protective shield.  Wanting what I can’t have might ruin me. But so help me, I crave his destruction.",
