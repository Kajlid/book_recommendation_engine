  "description": "A faerie curse promises that one perfect love awaits Laird Nial Maclee. To claim its passionate promise, he must find his fated lady while avoiding the traps, snares and schemes of females lured by his position, looks, charm and the blasted legend. A single misstep will condemn him to his father’s fate - a lifetime of craving the love he can never have nor ever forget. Despite his vow never to face that fate, Nial knows that a laird must put the needs of his clan first, even if it means wedding the wealthy heiress and daughter of the only rival clan on the Isle of Skye, “Heather the Hag.” To save the Clan Maclee and secure its future, he should marry the dowdy lass even though she won't “set the claws of passion” to his manhood, as the curse provides, so she can't possibly be his faerie fated forever. Before his solution to the dilemma sent Heather fleeing to transform herself for launch on the marriage mart in London, Nial should have recalled that faeries sometimes make the impossible the inevitable.",
