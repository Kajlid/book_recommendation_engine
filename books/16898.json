  "title": "A Book of Nonsense: The Centenary Edition",
  "description": "From the macabre to the brilliantly off-beat, the nonsense verse and illustrations of the celebrated writer and artist Mervyn Peake can be enjoyed by young and old alike, as the author blends his extraordinary imagination with his love of the absurd and bizarre. This memorable anthology was selected by his widow, Maeve Gilmore and son Sebastian Peake and introduces an extraordinary gallery of characters and creatures rivalling the best of Lewis Carroll and Edward Learâ€”creatures, such as the Dwarf of Battersea, Footfruit, the Hideous Root and Aunty MIg who became a pig. Quirky and comical, occasionally alarming - but always magical.Illustrated by Mervyn Peake and, in this new edition celebrating the centenary of Peake's birth, including twelve previously unpublished drawings.",
