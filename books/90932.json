She admired Ryder James, the heir to James & Son's Manufacturing, from afar her first day on campus.

When tragedy hits not once but twice, no one can help save them except for Melody. But can she?This unique love story will have you rooting for the heroine as she finds strength within herself and captures your heart along the way. Can Melody save Ryder and herself from the dangers ahead? Has she gotten in too deep or has she finally found a place where she belongs?",
