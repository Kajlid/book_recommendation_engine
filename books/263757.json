  "title": "The Hundred Dresses",
  "description": "This Newbery Honor classic, illustrated by a Caldecott Medalist, is a beautifully written tribute to the power of kindness, acceptance, and standing up for what's right. Wanda Petronski is ridiculed by her classmates for wearing the same faded blue dress every day. She claims she has one hundred dresses at home, but everyone knows she doesnâ€™t. When Wanda is pulled out of school one day, the class feels terrible, and classmate Maddie decides that she is \"never going to stand by and say nothing again.\" A timeless, gentle tale about bullies, bystanders, and having the courage to speak up.",
