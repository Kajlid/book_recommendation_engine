  "description": "Wargs: Curse of Misty Hollow, is the first volume in the Wargs Trilogy which follow the exploits of Dr. Mathew Kershaw, a professor and crypto zoologist. Matt is on a quest to find and document a new lupine species he believes may have escaped extinction and could be the true basis for Native American tales and legends of skin walkers, waheela, shunka warakâ€™ins, and big foot. In Curse of Misty Hollow, an old college friend contacts Matt seeking his help to investigate an unusual wolf attack on one of his forest rangers. Intrigued by the report of the incident that includes a detailed description of exceptionally large wolves with strange features, Matt agrees to look into the matter. Believing he is on the trail of a true cryptid reported by a credible witness, Matt cancels his research plans for the summer to investigate the attack. A seemingly simple investigation turns treacherous when Matt finds himself in the middle of a conflict between real life transgenic wolves, therianthropes, and human-animal hybrids.",
