  "description": "IN THE ROLLICKING, TABOO-BREAKING TRADITION OF HEINLEIN AND STURGEONFive decades ago, a mysterious vortex appeared in Earth orbit, drawing two spacecraft and their crews into it. Now another vortex has appeared, this time sending an alien vessel with an invitation and an appeal for help. Twenty men and women will travel to the homeworld of the Kenalen, an advanced race with three sexes and an enigmatic devotion to joy. What can humans learn from them, and how can we help them to fight a devastating disease? Some of Earth’s travelers will be fascinated by what they find … some will be frightened … and some will make a remarkable choice. As human and Kenalen interact – sometimes in the most intimate ways – their two worlds will never be the same again.",
