  "description": "The scene is set for Cold Calls, the fifth and penultimate instalment of Logue's Homer, an ongoing project - a piece of performance-art for the page rather than the stage - which has taken several decades to unfold, and has been described as, 'Less a translation than an adaptation. Less an adaptation in fact, than an original poem of considerable power.' (Derek Mahon)",
