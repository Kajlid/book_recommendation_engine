  "description": "Lady Sylph's only concerns should be inheriting her title, marrying well, producing an heir, and lording it all over the peasantry. It's what her father insists upon, and she never knew she needed anything or anyone else until her magic comes, an ability her class is not supposed to possess.Thana never coveted the title of monarch's pyradisté because her knowledge exceeds her ability. She hopes the royals will never depend on her, but then the palace's pyramids go haywire. On top of that, a beautiful, spoiled noblewoman needs her help to conceal a new power.Could Sylph's ability and Thana's magical mystery be related to a new kind of crystal being smuggled into the kingdom or a possible pyradisté coup? They'll have to work together and overcome their biases, admit their feelings, and maybe surrender to their fierce desire before time runs out.",
