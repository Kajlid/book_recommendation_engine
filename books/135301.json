  "description": "JUPITER'S BOUGHT THE DOME! Donal, an Irish lad, and Myron, a Cockney-Jamaican mix, meet aged seventeen as book reviewers and trainee journalists. Before long they're onto the hottest stories in London. DEATH CAUSED BY CAFFEINE In their future, Stansted Airport has been converted to a space shuttle base and Londoners are recruited to mine the asteroids. AHOY NEPTUNE! ESTUARY BOMBS TO BE CLEARED While exploring the other planets, we found that they were all inhabited. Now those people are coming to Earth and looking for work. They're also opening ethnic restaurants in central London. THE SMOKING GUN Befriending immigrants makes Donal and Myron unpopular with some, while their investigative reporting lands them in trouble with wealthy organisations, criminals and the Home Office. Their romantic prospects are compromised. But you can't keep a good team down, especially when they report for London's Eye, and they've got every book ever digitised at their disposal....
