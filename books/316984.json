  "description": "Tianna Clifford, young woman also known as Tee-Tee to many, and her alias–Fairy ‘Fro–to few. Being the minority, she’s no stranger to hardship and being unpopular. She’s tough, strong-willed, wise, and charming on the inside. Raised in a single-parent household and then as a young child losing her mother on duty as a police officer gives her a different perspective to everyone else. But one night, after unintentionally saving a hair salon from catching fire after leaving a protest, she meets a mysterious hairstylist who gives her the opportunity to make a difference in her community. As her struggles grow even greater, she’s forced to reconsider her position, and her views on tough conversations changes. As her journey progresses, she begins to reconsider her views on colorism, police brutality, and masculinity.",
