  "title": "Psychic Healing: Using the Tools of a Medium to Cure Whatever Ails You",
  "description": "Sylvia Browne now brings us an amazing volume on self-healing. Largely made up of actual research trance transcripts from her spirit guides, this book is a must-read for those who suffer from chronic physical problems but can’t seem to find relief from conventional medicine. (However, this work is not meant to replace medical treatment, but rather to augment it.) Sylvia also shares her innovative and proven methods of healing using cell memory and morphic resonance. Sylvia is one of the few deep-trance mediums in the world today, and the information that comes from her guides not only gives us the tools to cure ourselves and become more spiritual, but also delivers insights into preventive methods that ensure health and happiness so that we can enjoy optimal wellness—both inside and out!",
