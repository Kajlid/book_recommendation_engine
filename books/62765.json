  "description": "\"Koren stood and slowly turned in the smoky dust from the shattered throne, her swords still ringing from their violence. She growled behind eyes flaming with battlefield ferocity, “We will have no more sitting – We Go To WAR!”\"Victory in the violent Kelvin Arena sowed envy and filled the tribal leaders with contempt against the savage warrior Koren. While scarcely believing a human could best the fearsome eight armed kelvin gladiators, they grudgingly gave her blades uneasy respect.But now strange enemies wielding ancient magic murder whole villages of the mighty kelvin without a breath of resistance. Koren urgently seeks salvation from the magic with the ancient Sword of Aleron – a broken blade scattered across the dangerous Swamps of Kal at the end of the last Great War – and it must be forged anew in the fires that made it.Attacked by nightmarish creatures and pursued by relentless teams of Rubied Assassins can Koren save the kelvin from slaughter? Will treasonous kelvin leaders betray her when confronted by old emotions, ancient enemies, and a War now unearthed? Can she forge the chaotic tribes into a single force to repel the impending menace? And what are the disturbing visions seething within her Fire Gem – an ancient Destiny she cannot escape?",
