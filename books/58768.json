  "description": "Best friendship blossoms into something more in this gorgeously written queer literary romance.\"The heartache and longing of witnessing a beloved character pine hopelessly over her best friend has never brought me this much unadulterated joy.\" –National Book Award Finalist Sonora Reyes, author of The Lesbiana’s Guide to Catholic SchoolOver the past five years, Mitra Esfahani has known two constants: her best friend Bea Ortega and The Book—a dogeared moleskin she and Bea have been filling with the stanzas of an epic, never-ending poem since they were 13.For introverted Mitra, The Book is one of the few places she can open herself completely and where she gets to see all sides of brilliant and ebullient Bea. There, they can share everything—Mitra’s complicated feelings about her absent mother, Bea’s heartache over her most recent breakup—nothing too messy or complicated for The Book.Nothing except the one thing with the power to change their entire the fact that Mitra is helplessly in love with Bea.Told in lyrical, confessional prose and snippets of poetry Just Another Epic Love Poem takes readers on a journey that is equal parts joyful, heartbreaking, and funny as Mitra and Bea navigate the changing nature of I love you.",
