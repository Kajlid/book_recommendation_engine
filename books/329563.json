  "title": "Amazing Grace",
  "description": "In a future where a simulated sun shines upon holographic trees and surveillance drones swarm the sky, a police detective must hunt down a serial killer terrorizing the streets of New York. While androids threaten to displace humans in all echelons of society, he struggles to cope with his girlfriendâ€™s disappearance years ago. His partner dying in the hands of the killer only deepens his crisis. After he survives a fall from a building, time seems to shift back and forth and he can no longer distinguish between the real and the virtual world. When a simulacrum of his girlfriend appears before him and his colleagues vanish into a portal, he begins to question his senses and even his sanity. Only the hope of finding his girlfriend drives him to catch the killer, who may be linked to her disappearance. From the writer of Sharper Mind Darker Dreams comes another mind boggling science fiction thriller, where artificial intelligence threatens human existence and reality and illusion seem to intermingle into a dreamscape. If we cannot trust our senses, and if our memories may deceive us, how do we discern reality from fantasy?",
