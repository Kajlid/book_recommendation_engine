  "title": "Courting Balance",
  "description": "The God of Balance walks a dangerous tightrope.  Thrown into a new culture, Arianna does her best to adapt while attending to her duties. When the God of Balance takes an interest in her, Arianna struggles to determine if reciprocating will break a taboo—or anger the curse that binds her.  Nalithor intends to unravel the mystery that is Arianna, one way or another. If she’s an imitation created by exiled gods, he will end her.  With the Balance itself at stake, Arianna and Nalithor need to decide where they stand—with, or against each other, before it’s too late.  Of Astral and Umbral is a slow burn romantic fantasy series, and is not a clean read. Expect swearing, violence, and mature themes.",
