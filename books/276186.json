  "description": "Remus...\n\nHappily committed and content in my harem, I assume I’m chosen to go after my brother Travek due to my faithfulness. I’m not excited to go off-planet, but I’ll serve my council mother and church Sacred Mother in whatever capacity they request...\nWhen I arrive, I’m dismayed to see mating marks have developed on my chest, and the pull to meet the human female inspiring them keeps me distracted - and feeling guilty...\nDo I let this mating progress and betray my Ermada? Is it possible to even deny a mating pull?\n\n\nWhen her life is in danger, any rational thought disappears as instinct takes over!\n\n\n\nJo-Anne...\n\nStruggling to be “normal” at the college I’m attending, I find it aggravating to visit the shrink. She doesn’t understand or believe that I’ve been abducted by little, grey aliens!\nWhen I’m sucked into their bright light while at a study group, I’m shocked that they’re abducting me from a room with other people - why can I suddenly remember not only this visit but dozens more? And who is this strange, new alien claiming I’m his mate?\n\n\nPlease Note:\n \nThis book contains Adult Language and Steamy Adult Bedroom Scenes. It is intended for 18+ Readers & Adults Only.",
