But now there is an extra corpse on board -- a newly slain interloper suspiciously dressed in 1920's clothing. It is Anna Pigeon's jobas a ranger with the U.S. National Park Service to help protect wild and lonely places from civilization's corrupting touch. Now a bizarre mystery held firmly in a Great Lake's icy grip is drawing Anna into a nightmare of greed adn cold-blooded murder. And what she finds waiting beneath the surface could prove fatal.",
