  "description": "An epistolary novel with a twist, Please Write chronicles the correspondence between Vivienne, the alter ego of a recently widowed Cleveland artist, and Zippy, a mixed-breed terrier rescued off the streets of Baltimore. Their letters change and enrich their lives as well as that of Zippy's owner, Pamela, a harried journalist whose life is unraveling. Combining the canine viewpoint of A Dog's Purpose with the poignant style of The Guernsey Literary Potato Peel Pie Society , Please Write , with Disney-like charm, delivers a distinctive account of coping with heartbreak and loss through the power of imagination and love.",
