  "description": "The last days of the Tribulation are counting down to Armageddon, and only the strongest Christ followers have persevered. Mass executions have decimated their numbers. But a few Tribulation saints have survived with grit and guile and unshakable faith. The Mason family is among the hardy souls counting on Christ’s return to set things straight and to free them from the Antichrist’s tyranny. But their faith is sorely tested when one of them is captured and slated for execution. Meanwhile, another story unfolds in the spirit realm. An epic battle is taking place on the Mount of Olives. Millions of angels and demons are fighting to control the mountaintop. Andrew Maddix and Michael the archangel co-lead an angelic army in a bold offensive to rout the fearsome demon horde and prepare the mountain for Christ’s return. On the great and terrible day of the Lord, mortals and immortals alike will arrive at the same conclusion: the end is where we begin.",
