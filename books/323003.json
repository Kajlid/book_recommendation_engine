  "description": "What kind of mage would be crazy enough to crush on a shifter? Me. Apparently me.\nThe world is a messed-up place. Especially for those of us who have magic, and I know just how terrible it can be firsthand. Which is one of the reasons I try to stay away from people… humans and shifters especially.Unfortunately, the NHSO forces magi to work alongside shifters to help protect the humans from taragorians—scary beasts from another realm. Which means I’m thrown onto a new team and forced to work with Cosmo Ono-Nai, a lion shifter.And for some reason, I can’t keep my eyes off him.The Scars That Bind Us is a 115K word novel and the first book in the MM urban fantasy series, The Magi Accounts.*Intended for adults only. Please read the trigger warnings at the beginning of this novel.",
