  "description": "Abigail Pritchard, programming jock, writes custom simulations in a future world where the most popular Friday night entertainment is virtual reality. Her world as she knows it comes crashing down when she writes a sim for a mysterious client who turns out to be none other than Dyson Pearce, the world’s first trillionaire and President of space exploration giant Stratosphere Futuristics. Confronted with an opportunity she can’t say no to, Abby finds herself adrift in a foreign world where people vie for your favour even as they scheme behind your back.

This is the first book in the Sine Qua Non Cycle. *** Book 2 - Q1 of 2021. Contains explicit language and depictions of adult situations. Content intended for mature audiences. 135,000+ words",
