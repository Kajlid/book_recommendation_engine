  "description": "Richard Charles had a dream, a strange dream, one that made him think that things that seemed impossible just might, with a following wind and a cheese sandwich, be possible. With a bit of research, some astute ebaying and a bit of application, you never know he could \"clean up,\" make a fortune, win a Nobel Prize. He decided to record everything in a diary on his beloved Kindle.",
