Self-indulgent and too impressed with himself, the rakish knight seemed unworthy of his noble heritage. And yet...AND YET! Why then did she sense a power and RIGHTNESS about him that answered her heart's deepest yearnings?Escorting the strong-willed Brigid across the marshy wastes of Wales strained Stephen's temper near the breaking point. NEVER had he encountered a more contentious yet arousing female than Mistress L'Estrange - whose eyes bespoke a destiny that would change his life forever!",
