  "description": "Dinners and Nightmares is a highly experimental collage of genres, including plays, conversations, interior monologues, free verse, and lists, a postmodern text long before that term become mainstreamed. It remains a powerful testament to the complications and triumphs of Beat bohemia for women.Publisher Last Gasp proud to bring back this early Beat classic Diane di Prima has long been recognized as one of the strongest voice of her generation, and one of the few women who was able to break through the male-dominated beatnik scene. Her poetic portrayal of lowlife Bohemians and revolutionary mentalities shatter the conservative myths of the Fifties and lay bare the emerging sexual experimentation that would shape the Sixties.",
