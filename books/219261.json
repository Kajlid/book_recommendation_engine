  "description": "It's the Biggest Caucus Circus of All Time. After years of emceeing insipid singing competitions, TV personality Bryan Seafoam can't wait to host American President, the world's first reality show to elect a country's Chief Executive. It's the chance he's waited a lifetime for--an opportunity to be a real journalist, unearthing skeletons and playing hardball with the top ten candidates. But it doesn't take long for the contestants to start digging up dirt of their own and throwing it back at him--literally, in the case of billionaire candidate Ronald Chump when he's challenged to dig his own moat along the Mexican border. To make matters worse, Bryan's producer pressures him to be nicer to the candidates, and his former crush, now an experienced political correspondent, shows up--and shows him up at every turn. When a cheating scandal rocks the show, Bryan suspects it's just the tip of a very ugly and underhanded iceberg. Will exposing the plot to wreck the most hysterical--er, historic--election of all time cost him everything? Or lead to a reward like nothing he's ever imagined? With a keen eye on the evolving roles of social media and pop culture in shaping public opinion today, Craft's fast-paced, sharply-honed narrative paints a humorous picture of the horrifying specter of modern American politics.",
