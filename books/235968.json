  "description": "Margot Roberts has loved Landon Bishop for as long as she can remember. Unfortunately, so has the rest of her family, which has made it impossible for her to break out of the friend zone.Until now.MargotHe wasn’t just the best man at my brother’s wedding. He was the best man, period. I knew it deep in my bones the first day I met him. Well, maybe not the first day. I was only six, after all, and he was just a boy. But even then, his presence made me feel both firmly grounded and like I was walking on air. It was a curious feeling to have, especially as a kid. As I got older, my cravings for his company intensified, and I began aching not only for his attention, but for his touch. Too bad I could never tell if he felt the same. There was only one thing I knew for sure, which was that his loyalty to my brother knew no bounds. And for good reason. But I didn’t care about that. Not like I cared about him. Because I loved Landon Bishop at first sight…long before he became my brother’s best friend.",
