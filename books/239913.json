  "title": "Dracula in Istanbul: The Unauthorized Version of the Gothic Classic",
  "description": "For the first time in English comes a remarkable literary discovery. In 1928, Turkish author Ali Rıza Seyfioglu pirated Bram Stoker’s Dracula, rewriting it with new material, patriotic overtones, and Islam. A rare example of a “bootleg” novel, it’s also the first adaptation to plainly identify Dracula as the historical warlord Vlad the Impaler.  When a modern Istanbul is threatened by the invasion of an ancient vampire, three veterans of the Turkish War of Independence are thrust into a conflict with their nation’s hereditary enemy. Seyfioğlu boldly reworks Stoker’s classic tale, retelling it from the unique perspective of a people once routed by the real-life Dracula.  Dracula in Istanbul: The Unauthorized Version of the Gothic Classic, edited by Ed Glaser, also includes a foreword by Anno Dracula author Kim Newman, an introduction by Turkish translation scholar Şehnaz Tahir Gürçağlar, an afterword on the 1953 movie adaptation by film scholar Iain Robert Smith, and several rare photos from the film. From movie and vampire buffs to literary scholars, there’s enough here to delight all the children of the night.",
