Now he's stuck in small-town Lively St. Lemeston until London's Season opens and he can begin his embarrassing job hunt.His instant attraction to happy-go-lucky maid Sukey Grimes couldn't come at a worse time.

Yet her heart warns her not to fall for a man with one foot out the door, no matter how devastating his kiss.Then he lands a butler job in town--but there's a catch. His employer, the vicar, insists Toogood be respectably married. Against both their better judgments, he and Sukey come to an arrangement. But the knot is barely tied when Sukey realizes she underestimated just how vexing it can be to be married to the boss... Contains a butler with a protective streak a mile wide, and a maid who enjoys messing up the bed a whole lot more than making it.Books in the Lively St. Lemeston 1. Sweet Disorder2. True Pretenses3.
