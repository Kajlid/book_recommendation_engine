  "description": "I'm lucky, I get to do what I love for a living. I can stay indoors for days at a time and wear whatever pretty clothes I want, dance to whatever songs I want, and create to my heart's content. I have more than enough time to sit and devour multiple books without the worry of having to fit in hours for sleep (I'm partial to romance, but that's a secret, so you can't tell anyone - not that anyone would ask).  Until now, I had only one true lover, and he came in the form of a body of water. Odd, I know, but I was content with our arrangement. I would visit and cry over my issues, and he would sit back, listen, and comfort me. Our relationship was silly, but my love for him was immense.  Okay, that wasn't entirely accurate. The truth is that my love went much deeper than that, borderlining on obsession, and for reasons I would never be able to admit out loud. So of course Ethan didn't know. He had seen some darker bits and pieces of my mind from the paintings, but he had no way of knowing just how disturbed I really was. And to be honest, neither did I sometimes. It was easy to forget, especially when playing normal.  If you're wondering who Ethan is…Well, I suppose I could go on and on about how seemingly perfect he is. Looks, money, secrets, and all that jazz. But for now, let's just say that he's…magic.Author's Warning: This story is a billionaire romance and contains cliches, insta-love, fluff, lengthy inner dialogue, and scenes of detailed graphic violence.
