  "description": "Tobias Monroe has never been just a step-brother to me. From the moment we met as little kids, he’s been my everything. My best friend, my protector, the person I could always rely on for anything.As the years went on, our relationship developed into something more, something deeper than what was expected of us.My stupid heart thought that one day, we would take that step over the line that both of us were tip toeing around.That was until one summer I found him kissing another girl and my whole world crashed around me.He never showed interest in anyone, giving me the impression he only wanted me. I guess I was wrong.After that summer, he went off to University, joined the hockey team with his best friend Bishop and everything changed.We drifted apart slowly, each of us forming lives without the other.But now I’ve graduated and attending Silver Valley University in the fall. There's no way he can avoid me now.I don’t know what changed that summer, what made me go from being his entire world to just his little step-sister.But I intend on finding out. I want what we had back, I want what could have been. I will break him down, get the answers I need. And I’ll stop at nothing to get them.",
