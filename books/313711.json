  "description": "Sometimes, one last wish is all that we get...It should have been me.I was supposed to be the one who died in the car accident that day.Not my best friend who had a family to leave behind.But like most things, life is unpredictable and filled with unexpected changes.Like stepping in to help her family pick up the pieces after their world shattered around them.Or the epic cross country road trip that we took to honor the bucket list she made when she was a little girl.I never expected to become a part of their family along the way.I tried to keep the lines clear and avoided getting too close.After all, it wasn’t just my heart that I feared breaking.I wasn’t looking for love, but that didn’t mean that it didn’t find me.",
