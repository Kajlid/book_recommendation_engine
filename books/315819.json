  "description": "LawsonI have one rule when it comes to my sex life: I only hook up with guys who identify as straight. It’s a tried and tested way of avoiding the cling factor, which I’ve found to be a huge problem in the past. A one-night stand with a curious ‘straight’ guy is the perfect situation: no strings, no mess, no dodging unwanted texts and phone calls. Is it the most healthy way to handle my commitment issues? Probably not, but it’s what I’ve got right now. Of course, there’s one straight guy who’s completely off-limits. And because irony’s a bitch, he’s the one guy I just can’t stop thinking about… George Goode is sweet, charming, hilarious, and sexy as hell. And he’s also become one of my best friends since I moved to the tiny town of Finchley about a year ago. But let’s make one thing clear: I do not have feelings for him. I don’t get feelings. I’m not wired that way. I just think about him all the time, I miss him when he’s not around, and I seem to spend a lot of my time daydreaming about snuggling on Sunday mornings and visiting famers markets together. All totally, one hundred percent normal stuff to be thinking about one of your best friends…right? You’d think, given everything, that when George decides to express a little curiosity, I’d be a hundred percent on board. But for some reason it’s not quite as simple as all that… Come visit Finchley, CA, where the sun’s always shining, the locals are always gossiping, and you won’t walk two steps without bumping into a member of the Goode family. If you’re lucky you might find gold; or, even better…true love.",
