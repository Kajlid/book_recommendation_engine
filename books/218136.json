  "description": "This four book collection follows Laura Nelson from her days as a medical student in Detroit during the 1967 riots through her assent to the position of Chief of Surgery in Tampa. Tragically, at the peak of her professional success, a fall on the ice and a devastating hand injury ends her surgical career. But Laura proves resilient and lands the top research job in a large pharmaceutical company. Seven years in Laura’s life separate each of the four novels in the collection. Laura’s personal life evolves just as do the threats—initiated in the dark days of Detroit—that have haunted her along the way.",
