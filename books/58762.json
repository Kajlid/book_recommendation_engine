  "description": "In this highly-praised autobiographical work, the author of \"The Great War and Modern Memory\" recounts his own experience of combat in WWII and how it became a determining force in his life. \"Doing Battle\" is at once a summing-up of one man's life and profoundly thoughtful portrait of America's own search for identity in the second half of this century.",
