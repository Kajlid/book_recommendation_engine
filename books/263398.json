  "description": "Like every other mobster, the longer he stayed in the life, the closer he got to a shallow grave . . .  New York, 1947. Mob fixer Gabriel Leveson needs to leave this city behind. But his plans to flee are upset when he’s given a job by the boss of all bosses, Frank Costello. A job he can’t turn down . . . Meanwhile, a killing spree in a Harlem flophouse has left an innocent black man on Death Row. In order to save him, the man’s father—ex-private investigator Michael Talbot—and his old partner Ida Young must track down the real killer. While across town, Ida’s childhood friend Louis Armstrong is on the brink of bankruptcy, until a promoter approaches him with a strange offer to reignite his career. Both a gripping neo-noir crime novel and a vivid, panoramic portrait of New York, The Mobster's Lament takes you to the heart of a city where the Mob has risen to the height of its powers.",
