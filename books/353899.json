  "description": "Picco’s Moon was where it all began for Esen-alit-Quar, Youngest of Ersh’s Web. It was here where Ersh, the Oldest, had chosen to make her home; here, too, where Esen received her early training as a shapeshifter and a member of the Web.When Ersh’s Web was destroyed, Esen and her human friend Paul survived, and together they founded Esen’s Web, a group composed initially of the two of them but one which expanded slowly to include a chosen few selected by Paul. For in their universe there were all too many species ready to destroy Esen, should they discover her true nature.Still, despite the need for concealment, life had been good to Esen and Paul. They now had well-established identities, a thriving business, and numerous friends. It seemed as though they’d finally created a safe haven for themselves. At least until they received word that someone was mining Picco’s Moon, desecrating Ersh’s Mountain.Esen and Paul had no choice. They had to go to Picco’s Moon and put a stop to the situation. But before they could even set out, they found themselves under attack on every front. Their carefully built haven gone, and loyal friends suddenly transformed into vengeful enemies, was there anywhere Esen and Paul could run, anyone they could turn to for help, any way to defeat a foe they couldn’t even identify?",
