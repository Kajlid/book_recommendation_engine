  "description": "Free falling into a war zone, Lieutenant Colonel Alexandra “The Fey” Hargreaves learns that her former intern, Sergeant Larry Flagg, and his Special Forces team have failed to report. One missing team, one personal worry, magnifies as the shocking disappearance of nearly two hundred active Special Operations soldiers becomes reality. When Alex uncovers a hidden threat to national security, she and her Fey Team are caught in a web spun by a computer genius. The fourth installment in Claudia Hall Christian's Alex the Fey thriller series, Lean on Me is a journey across the globe; atop the canyons of Paktika Province and under the North Dakota plain, south for a day on Harkers Island and south again in the Indian Ocean as Alex and the Fey Team rescue hostages, outsmart an old enemy, and discover a trail that leads from the murder of the Fey Special Forces Team to the destruction of the world. Alex takes on the gut-wrenching mantle of command and comes to terms with her own first rule of “Wherever you are, it is your friends who make your world.”",
