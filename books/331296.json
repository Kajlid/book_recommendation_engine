My plan’s simple: Work hard, play harder, and never—ever—get involved with anyone. But one chance encounter with Simon Kelly turns my world upside down. He’s too pretentious, too arrogant—and don’t get me started on his storm gray eyes.When a picture of us lands in the tabloids, we come to an arrangement. We’ll pretend to date, then go our separate ways.SimonAddison wants to play pretend?Fine. We’ll restore our reputations and I’ll accept that no amount of guilt can change the past. But the feelings are real—too real to let her go. I know what I want, and I’m going to get it. I’ll prove to her we’re better together than apart.I’m here to change her story.",
