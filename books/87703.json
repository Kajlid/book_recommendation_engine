The one she finds is her ′Nai′, a high society American in Asia.

Above all it is an intelligent, insightful and deeply sensitive love story that will take you to places beyond your wildest dreams and open up the most secret aspects of your erotic identity. It will make you lust, think, feel and cry. Senta′s message to her readers is passionate and clear: Never give up looking for your true sexuality.Real romantic BDSM with all the thrills (and more...) of fantasy, plus a real life size relationship and a positive message to women: ′you can go for your sexual dreams′.",
