  "description": "\"The world is my cloister, my body is my cell, and my soul is the hermit within!\" St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226)John Michael Talbot shows that you need not live in a monastery to know the peace of God and be a blessing to the world. You can cultivate solitude, silence, and sacred stillness on the spot where you are standing. You can live from the hermit within wherever you are. In chapters ranging from meditation to community, the gift of tears to the music of life, John inspires all of us to live the life of the spirit as expressed by our spiritual forebears.",
