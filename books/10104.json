  "title": "The Past Through Tomorrow: Vol. 1",
  "description": "Here, in volume one of two volumes, are approximately half of the stories, novelettes, novella, and novels which make up Heinlein's famous Future History -- the rich, imaginative architecture of Man's destiny that many consider his greatest and most prophetic work. Heinlein wrote most of the Future History stories early in his career, between 1939 and 1941 and between 1945 and 1950. Most of the Future History stories written prior to 1967 are collected in the two volumes of The Past Through Tomorrow, which also contains the final version of the chart. That collection does not include Universe and Common Sense; they were published separately as Orphans of the Sky.Contents: Introduction (The Past Through Tomorrow) (1967) â€¢ essay by Damon Knight Life-Line [Future History] (1939) / short story by Robert A.
