  "title": "Strong Female Lead: Lessons from Women in Power",
  "description": "Women have been taught to \"lean in\" and act like men to get ahead, but as the financial, environmental, and social systems crumble, isn't it time we had a different plan? The first two decades of the twenty-first century have seen financial collapse, a global pandemic, the devastation of our environment, and the disintegration of democracies. But while some at the top are telling us \"it is what is it,\" there's a new generation of leaders showing the world how to be better. They're building trust, investing wisely, and acting decisively. And they've got one thing in common.In Strong Female Lead, Arwa Mahdawi investigates the qualities of female leaders who show us how it's done, including original research and interviews with Madeleine Albright, Mary Robinson, Alicia Garza, and many others. Above all, she asks the question: What can women in power teach all of us about leadership?",
