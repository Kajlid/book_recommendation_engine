  "description": "Wren has contemplated the fine line between pleasure and pain for years, but when he finally gets up the nerve to make his fantasies reality, things go terribly wrong. His father’s best friend, Leo, comes to his rescue, and Wren knows instantly that Leo is the perfect person to introduce him to the world he longs to explore.  Leo has never met Wren before, and once he realizes who Wren is, he vows not to touch him again. Leo knows Wren’s father won’t approve of their relationship, especially considering the edgy play Leo enjoys. Leo values that friendship too much to risk it, but walking away from Wren isn’t easy. There’s a lot more between Wren and Leo than lust. They’re pulled toward one another despite the trouble their relationship could cause. Ultimately, they give into their desire and begin seeing each other in secret.  The more they explore, the more obvious it becomes that Wren can take everything Leo wants to give, no matter how kinky or intense. They are a perfect fit in bed and out. Neither of them wants to keep hiding their relationship, but they both worry that once Wren’s father knows about them, staying together will be too difficult. In order to make things work, they’ll both have to believe in the power of love.",
