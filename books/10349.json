Why are relationships difficult? What is awareness in relationship? Do I really know what love is? What does it mean to learn in a relationship? What is the role of thought and memory in relating to another?\"There is no escape from relationship. In that relationship, which is the mirror in which we can see ourselves, we can discover what we are, our reactions, our prejudices, our fears, depression, anxieties, loneliness, sorrow, pain, grief. We can also discover whether we love or there is no such thing as love. So, we will examine this question of relationship because that is the basis of love.\" -J. Krishnamurti Madras, India, 1982\"Why does the mind think about sex at all? Why? Why has it become a central issue in your life? Sex has become an extraordinary, difficult, and complex problem so long as you do not understand the mind, which thinks about the problem. The act itself can never be a problem but thought about the act creates the problem.\" -J. Krishnamurti, The First and Last Freedom",
