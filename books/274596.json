  "description": "Major Kenneth Gavin -- one of the few anguished souls left to contemplate the end of biological existence, the silent spring, the dying of love, desire, and hope -- was one who had pushed the button that ended everything. One who had nothing left but perception and remorse. One who had killed millions by remote control could kill no more -- not even to save himself.",
