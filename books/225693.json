  "description": "Chance Tartaglia, a cop with a nasty reputation for embezzling, pimping and drug-dealing, has been found shot to death. To nightclub owner Wesley Farrell--who knows all about secrets--he was just another low-life who didn't pay his tab. Until Farrell is hired to find the killer, and forced to hitch a ride with his own private demons. Now, the lie Farrell's been living for so long is about to blow up in his face. Because there's more to Tartaglia's death than a bullet to the chest.",
