  "description": "Roads to Mussoorie is a memorable evocation of a writer's surroundings and the role they have played in his work and life. Ruskin Bond describes his many journeys to, from and around Mussoorie, delving with gusto into the daily scandals of this not so sleepy hill town. The pieces in this collection are characterized by Bond's incorrigible sense of humour and eye for detail, as well as his enduring affection and nostalgia for the home he has lived in for over forty years.",
