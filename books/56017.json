All voices are heard: well-known figures from even better known myths as well as ordinary people and slaves who have hitherto been silent in our recorded history. Achingly familiar tales are told from a refreshing new perspective, revealing hidden insights and striking resemblances to our world today.The collected stories and poems include retellings of the myths of Galateia, Pentheus and Agave, Alkestis, the Minotaur and many more. Hegeleen Kissel treats the source material with care and expertise, having a Master's degree in Literature and Linguistics of ancient Greek, and brings the world of the ancients to life with her vast knowledge of antiquity.Expected release date: August 14th 2023",
