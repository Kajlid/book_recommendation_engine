I moved around the bar with the grace of a baboon, knocking over glasses and serving bad cocktails.How could I focus on work when the sexy stranger was staring at me with those arresting blue eyes? In my head, I have a sex life worthy of a porn channel. The reality is…different. So, of course I seized my opportunity. In Greece, I had no inhibitions.One final summer of fun before I moved to London to start my trainee contract at London's most elite law firm.I was too busy fluffing my CV and researching interview questions to check who was at the top of the hierarchy.Our CEO welcomes the new trainees.It’s not until he is halfway up the room that my blood runs cold.It can’t be. He can’t be…Nine million people live in London, one of them is bound to look like him. He’s closer now. No, it’s definitely f**king him. He might not recognise or remember me. He’s probably had a million one-night stands since then. Gone are the jeans and T-shirt and in their place, is an expensive tailored dark blue suit.When those intense blue-grey eyes collide with mine, my heart stops. Oh. He recognises me all right.There are three stand-alone books in the London Mister Series",
