But even heroes can be unlucky, and when the legendary SEAL sacrifices his life overseas, Zak is moved to follow in his footsteps. His fast and furious fling in high school, Amy Dobson, is still the wild child daughter of the local Chief of Police, doing her best to excise her demons by partying with half the male population of their town. Barging back into his life, they spend one stolen night together before Zak ships off for his first deployment. But will this be enough to sustain them to a Happily Ever After when she is targeted by a home grown terrorist cell?",
