  "description": "**FLAWED LOVE is a standalone second chance romance with a HEA** Rainer Torrence is everything I could have wanted in my life and more. He became my best friend when I was Thirteen years old. From then on, we were inseparable. He was my first love and my first heartbreak. But I always thought it was forever. Until his Father died and things went bad. Then suddenly, he disappeared. Ten years and I didn’t see or hear from him. Then came the call I’d be praying for– he was back in town. Only the man I remembered is not him. This man is quiet, deadly, and so incredibly beautiful. He also doesn’t remember me. He looks into my eyes, and he sees nothing. Nothing. So, I let him believe I’m just a girl that walked into his bar. I let him believe I’m just a friend. I let him use me on the cold, dark nights. I let him believe that I am as emotionless about our relationship as he is. I just let the secret go on and on. But all secrets have an end, don’t they?",
