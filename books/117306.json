  "description": "When the Selfish Giant builds a high wall round his lovely garden to keep the children out, the North Wind blows, the Frost comes and the Snow dances through the trees. The Giant wonders why Spring never comes to his cold, white garden. Then one day the Giant looks out to see a most wonderful sight . . . Oscar Wilde's much-loved fairy-tale is brought to life again with beautiful illustrations by Michael Foreman and Freire Wright.",
