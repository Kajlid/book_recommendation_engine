I would do whatever it takes to climb my way to the top of the social ladder, not caring who I had to step on to get there. The girl who started that rumor about your eating disorder?​That was me.  The girl who made out with your boyfriend?​Me again.   The girl you don’t ever want to cross?​You’re looking at her, b*tch.",
