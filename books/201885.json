  "title": "Maps of the Disney Parks: Charting 60 Years from California to Shanghai",
  "description": "The maps of the Disney Parks are more than just atlases used by guests to find their way to Big Thunder Mountain. They are snapshots of a place and time, relics treasured by collectors, and gorgeous pieces of artwork. In fact, it was a map-drawn by Herb Ryman and imagined by Walt-that was used to sell the idea for Disneyland to investors. This book will include maps of the domestic parks from 1955 to today, as well as highlights from the international parks. Alongside the maps there will be photographs depicting how the parks have changed over time, explanations of why the landscape was altered, and details on attractions that were added or taken away.",
