  "description": "Rapunzel visits the trendy '70s in this far-out retelling...Rapunzel, like everyone else in the 1970s, has long hair. But only Rapunzel, from atop a penthouse in which she is imprisoned by her evil Aunt Esme, has hair so long that it sweeps the sidewalk in front of the building. The elevators don't work, so Aunt Esme uses Rapunzel's hair to come and go. And poor Rapunzel spends day after lonely day surrounded by orange-and-brown-patterned walls and shag carpeting, listening to her beloved LPs. Then, at last, a handsome stranger climbs up Rapunzel's hair...why, he's the glam-rock prince of her dreams! David Roberts's funky 1970s illustrations give this Rapunzel an exciting new twist. Bellbottoms, disco balls, and long sideburns make this the funkiest fairy tale ever!",
