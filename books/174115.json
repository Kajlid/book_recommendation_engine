  "description": "Mira Stanley has come to Cape San Blas, Florida for one reasonâ€”to save Claire Peterson, her boss's aunt, from being swindled and losing her home. She realizes it will be a challenge to defeat Bradley Lane, the unscrupulous land developer, even with her accomplished skills as a lawyer. However, another element adds itself to the equation when Mira meets the attractive Sean Thorndale. The chemistry between them leaves Mira confused and frightened.  Sean Thorndale has always been confident and driven with one personal agenda. And it promises to be dangerous. Even if he must deceive others by following Bradley Lane's orders, he'll do it to get justice for someone close to him. At least that's how he feels until he meets Mira Stanley. The attraction builds. Is the danger to Sean worth the risk to their relationship?",
