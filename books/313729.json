  "title": "The Snow Tourist",
  "description": "A bracing and beguiling quest for the world's deepest, purest snowfall that takes us from carrot-nosed snowmen in frosty gardens to the most perilous peaks on earth - a book that does for the white stuff what Robert Macfarlane did for mountains.In this unique book, part eulogy, part history, part travelogue, Charlie English goes in search of the best snow on the planet. Along the way he explains the extraordinary hold this commonplace phenomenon has over us, and reveals the ongoing drama of our relationship with it. Combining on-the-slopes experience with off-piste research, Charlie English's journey begins with the magical moment when his two-year old son sees snow for the first time, before setting off in the footsteps of the Romantic poets over the Alps, following the sled-tracks of the Inuit across Greenland, and meeting up with a flurry of fellow enthusiasts, from snow-making scientists in Japan and global warming experts at Caltech to plough drivers in Alaska. This is a book for anyone who reaches for their mittens at the sight of the first flake.",
