Fruits and veggies form some of the most nutritious components in our given that they are high in minerals, vitamins, fiber, phytochemicals and are low in calories. This perhaps explains why experts recommend that if we want to live a healthy life, we should aim to take an average of 5-9 servings of fruits and veggies daily. How can you pack a ton of vegetables and fruits in a single meal; rather than in 5 or 6 plates of salad or from entire pan of roasted veggies? Well, doing so doesnâ€™t have to be a complicated process or one that requires any special training in food and nutrition. All you need to do is to juice the ingredients and you will have a perfect blend of fruits, veggies, spices and any other ingredient in one or two glasses. Every glass of vegetable and fruit juice is packed with powerful detox, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, vitamins and other properties that can transform your life in ways you never thought was possible.",
