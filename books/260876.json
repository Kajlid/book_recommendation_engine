There, he will face not only the aliens he has come to offer peace, but contend with creatures that once were human, with traitors in his midst, and with a meeting that will bring him face to face with no less than the oldest enemy of mankind.If he succeeds, he will usher in a peace unlike any in recorded history. If he fails...the galaxy will burn.",
