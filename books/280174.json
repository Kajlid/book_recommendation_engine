  "description": "In a far away kingdom, an immensely powerful soul is trapped in a jewel called a dragon tear. Whoever holds it has access to great magical power, but, as in all times and places, power is seductive and dangerous.  And, as with all trapped souls, this one wants to escape.  ~  Orphaned at a young age, Zenia Cham has fought and scraped her way into a position of honor as an inquisitor for one of the city's temples. But an even greater destiny awaits. Impressed by her deeds, the king offers her a prestigious position as one of his elite Agents of the Crown.  The missions will be dangerous, and she’s not sure she wants the partner she’s being assigned—a cocky noble lord from a wealthy estate—but she has the opportunity to distinguish herself as she serves not only the city but the entire Kingdom.  How could she say no?  There’s just one problem. The king gives her a mysterious dragon tear that’s nothing like the other magical gems she’s seen. She may need its power to stay alive in this perilous new job, but dare she rely upon it?  For a limited time, you can get the complete Agents of the Crown fantasy series for a massive discount.
