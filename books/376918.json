  "description": "“The Broken Heart Surgeon” is what they call me. TV viewers loved seeing a top flight heart surgeon with a loving family, a man who had everything, make a single tragic mistake, something so minor that if I had done it in a bar I would have gottenlaid or bitch-slapped. Who in the world would have ever thought it would have led to this. I know I didn’t. Doing twenty years in a maximum-security prison. Surrounded by people I paid a great deal of money to live away from on the outside. So this is how it ended. Me behind bars. Explaining to you everything that happened in the middle will take awhile, but what the hell does it matter. Telling you howit all began is easy. I remember it like I remember my name, like the first time I made love to my wife, like the day my first child was born. It all started simply enough. It all started with just a little tweak.",
