  "description": "Teesia, the middle child of the ruler of Caralon, is a passionate soul who cannot resist luring the rugged Ralen of Charelton into an intimate encounter on their first meeting. But when she is later given in marriage to Ralen, he is outraged. Royal daughters are supposed to be pure, and his previous experience with Teesia gives Ralen doubts. He understands immediately that his new wife needs to be taught that she belongs to him and him alone in the bedchamber, and given that he harbors some...unusual sexual appetites, her lessons are sure to be an erotic adventure for them both. Note: Caralon is a land where anything can and often does! happen. Featuring scenes of same sex interaction, multiple partners and public sex, the series is definitely not for the faint of heart. You have been warned...Show more Show less",
