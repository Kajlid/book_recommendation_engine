  "description": "When your daughter is everything, what are you willing to do to save her?  Cassandra is on a desperate flight with her teenage daughter, willing to do anything to get them both away from the dirty Sheriff who's chasing them. She's tired and worn down but determined to go on when she gets unexpected help from a group of men who are downright scary. Except they make her feel safe, and then there’s Black, who makes her feel a whole lot of other things.  Black is Sergeant at Arms in Thor MC, and he’s not expecting to feel so protective about the soft, sweet woman with her ridiculous plan to take her daughter across the border and into Canada. He’ll sort out her problems because he really wants to get into her panties, but that’s it. Or?  What should be a brief fling turns out to be more, but life hasn’t been easy for either of them, so they’re both quick to give up when things go sour in ways neither expected.  And then life hits them again.  Please note: This book contains crude words and somewhat explicit adult scenes. If this isn't your thing, then this book might not be for you.",
