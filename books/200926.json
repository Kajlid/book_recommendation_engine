  "description": "SynopsisSkye is more than the cold, seemingly-emotionless young woman everyone sees. She is the living, breathing manifestation of the Void, a timeless entity that has always been. She has unknowingly experienced thousands of lives, one of which has left her riddled with trauma and nightmares, self-loathing and fear. When she meets Vale, the lover from her past, they are plummeted through a series of memories, strewn across dimensions and eventually come to meet their previous selves in the flesh. Together, the four of them strive to piece together their shattered memories while battling the cause of Skyeâ€™s suffering: a cold, heartless enemy that has followed her from beyond space and time.",
