  "description": "The cruise is going to be the trip of a lifetime for Evie Hines. At least that's what her friends say when they drag her on board for a birthday celebration. Evie expects to get seasick. She doesn't expect to run into her high school football coach who looks better than ever and still makes her heart skip a beat. Richard Diaz is keeping his newly divorced sister and her sons company on the cruise. Running into Evie Hines is a surprise he didn't see coming. The watergirl with the most adorable blush in school is all grown up, and her bronzed skin, tiny bathing suit and bold, new demeanor become an irresistible temptation. No matter how much he resolves to stay away, her determination to forget the past and have fun in the present battles against his self-control. She is looking for a vacation fling with the man of her dreams. He'd rather jump overboard than break her heart. Is it possible to throw caution to the wind and give in to their lust or will they both walk away with regrets?",
