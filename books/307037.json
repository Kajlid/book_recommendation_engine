  "description": "What do you do when your neighbor turns up strangled beneath your bedroom window? In The Chosen Few, private investigator Max Lovely straps on his Ruger .357 Magnum, climbs into his battered Chrysler convertible, and hits the streets of Boston looking for clues. Max is a seemingly sluggish detective with surprising powers of perception, a dangerous overabundance of empathy, and a strange collection of friends. He'll need all the help he can get when he uncovers the Chosen Few. As he draws closer to the truth, his own life becomes the target of the malevolent forces he has uncovered. Author Matt Simon imbues the story with a strong sense of place, with rich descriptions of Boston and plenty of local culture. From the spiritual beliefs of the Puritans to the socioeconomic history of the South End and Back Bay, readers will know Boston better by the time the mystery is solved. THE SECOND BOOK IN THE MAX LOVELY SERIES IS NOW AVAILABLE ON That's What Little Boys Are Made Of.",
