  "description": "Bleeding Souls Saved by LoveA Fable Retelling of AladdinLilian Calvert believed in wishesOnly, she was running out of the quota she allotted herself for the year. She’d be damned if she didn’t waste two wishes already to try and get out of the bind she found herself in. How the devil she ended up ten thousand dollars in debt AND on the receiving end of the New York MC Demon Riders’ wrath, she had no idea— actually that’s an outright lie. Rage Crux, their VP, didn’t take kindly to her dumping his ass and running away. Now, he was out to destroy her, leaving her with no choice but to go into hiding. She had one wish left and she better make it count. That meant she had to reach out to the one man she swore to stay away from at all cost— another rough MC rider she ran away from before. But desperate times called for desperate measures. Axle Santiago, Vice President of the Wicked Warriors MC New York Charter, was intent on running the MC Demon Riders out of his territory. They were cruel, ruthless and contaminated the streets of New York. It was time to end it and a dangerous heist was the only way to get it done effectively, but he needed an insider to pull it off. He didn’t expect to find the solution in the one woman he’d come to hate. The one who had turned his heart dark. But she was persistent and the devil inside him spurred him to take her up on her offer. Who knows, making her pay for past mistakes might just be what he needed— committing to make her wish come true was a small concession to make. It just might be fun in the long run… The question was, could he trust her or was he about to make the biggest mistake of his life… again?",
