  "description": "Adrianna is drowning her grief. Sixteen months ago, her mother died. With her father traveling so much, and her older sister away at college, no one notices that she’s been slowly draining her mother’s extensive wine collection. She drinks to forget an awful secret. She drinks until she goes numb. Now, she can’t seem to quit. Since moving to a new school, she has no really close friends or teachers who know her, which means that eighteen-year-old Adrianna has nothing to stop her free-fall. There is no one to help her deal with her pain. Then she meets Ian.",
