But being a twenty-seven-year-old virgin on a pro hockey team was messing with my head and my game.

We promised each other it was only temporary, our dirty little secret. We had an expiration date. The season would start, Maddie would go to school, and my best friend wouldn’t have a clue about what transpired between us. Maddie keeps her end of the deal… it’s me who can’t follow through.Full length standalone novel. HEA, no cheating.
