  "description": "\"The Spider's Thread\" (Kumo no Ito) is a 1918 short story by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, first published in the children's magazine Akai Tori.The Buddha Shakyamuni is meandering around Paradise one morning, when he stops at a lotus-filled pond. Between the lilies, he can see, through the crystal-clear waters, the depths of Hell. His eyes come to rest on one sinner in particular, by the name of Kandata. Kandata was a cold-hearted criminal, but had one good deed to his while walking through the forest one day, he decided not to kill a spider he was about to crush with his foot. Moved by this single act of compassion, the Buddha takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell. Tested with iPhone app only now (7/16/2009)",
