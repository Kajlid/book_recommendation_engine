His gift has afforded him nightly sensual pleasures and exotic treats for centuries, but beneath the surface he yearns for much more. Ilona can give him what his soul craves, but only if he trusts his heart. One fateful choice made out of desire puts all he cares for in danger. With a civil war and the threat of Archon hunters at every turn, this Son may lose everything if he can't find the balance between heart and mind.",
