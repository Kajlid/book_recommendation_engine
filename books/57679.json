In a world that has been divided amongst the Hunters and Warriors, prisoners who have fallen prey to King Cyrus' decrees are forced into the arena to fight until death. Winner is granted mercy and privilege to see another sunrise. Death unto the weak. In an attempt to reclaim her freedom, seventeen year-old Princess Echo becomes another victim in a battle that will change everything and everyone. And then there’s Ayden. His very existence as a Hunter is forbidden, and with those otherworldly violet eyes . . . Echo is finding it hard to stay away from him. And he just may be everything she needs to bring her world, and her title to the throne, to a frightening end.",
