  "description": "Lexi, the 70-pound family mutt, lived the diva life of a beloved house pet, before everything changed when Mom and Dad came home with triplets! Despair, loneliness, and jealousy overwhelmed to the point she wondered, do they still love me? She lives in a tech savvy household, so, out of desperation, she built her own device from discarded pieces and parts in the basement. Then she began rallying the canines, seeking support and counsel through social media, by growing a following through Lexi's Triplets Blog.",
