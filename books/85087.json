  "description": "Sometimes life feels like it’s going to end just before it really begins. That is just what Leah and Jeremy discover after their chance encounter. Can Jeremy help Leah find a new way in life and show her the hope that he sees in her? Just when he thought it was all about helping her he discovers it is Leah who has helped him to find his way again. In this story of purpose discovery two unlikely characters form a friendship that will change their lives forever. \"The impact doesn't happen quite like I expect it to. Suddenly, my car is moving back to the right, only in a straight line, like I’d been hit broadside. I open my eyes for just a second and am startled to see the deepest green eyes I’ve ever seen looking back at me through the window. I want to see the face the eyes belong to but suddenly the airbags go off and my passenger side windows crumble. It hurts really bad, I didn’t realize the airbags would burn me like this. I close my eyes hoping to be consumed by the pain and lose consciousness, but apparently I'm not hurt that badly enough. My heart has been broken and now my body burns, but the pain isn't enough to actually kill me. It doesn't seem fair. I want them to be sorry. If I had to go through this humiliating experience, I want the car to have killed me so they can feel guilty about what they have done to me, but no, fate decides to make me face life. I look down at the burn marks forming on my arms and am furious with Heath. Not only has he humiliated me in the middle of the school cafeteria, but now I have physical proof of my stupidity.\"Show more Show less",
