  "description": "The invasion of the Warui ninja was the biggest event that had ever happened in the small town of Sera, Missouri. Now, in the summer of 1992, something even more defining is happening. A group of racists has moved into the town, and they will use threats, extortion and violence to further their hate-filled agenda. To this end, they have targeted the Robertsons, the only black family in the tourist town. What they haven't counted on is young Louis Robertson's friendship with the members of \"Adventure.\" Jamie, Yoshi and their friends are joined by new faces as they face a different kind of \"klan.\" But can they fight the effects of illogical hatred?",
