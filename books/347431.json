  "description": "Adrian Cahill didn't realize his ideal woman, his soul mate, was right in front of him, so Lynn walked away from their stagnant relationship. She had no idea she'd soon be involved in a near fatal crash that would change her appearance and leave her haunted with nightmares of accidents and death. No longer the same person, Lynn took on another girl's name and carved out a new identity. While recuperating from reconstructive surgery, she bought a rundown cabin in the mountains of Pennsylvania. With the help of local handyman John Logan, she brought the structure back to life, turning it into a wonderful retreat. He also helped her remodel an abandoned factory near Bolton air field in Columbus, Ohio. Over the years the two became close friends, though Logan remained a mystery, never revealing much about his personal life or his past. After five years and in her new incarnation as Diana, Lynn made up her mind to go back for the man who rejected her, and goad him into chasing her until she catches him. Could she create a new ending for an imperfect past? And how will Logan, her mysterious mountain man, feel about losing his best friend?",
