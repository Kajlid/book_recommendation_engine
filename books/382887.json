Both grow cynical as they are exposed to the horrors and hatred of ambitious leaders with deadly agendas.Crushed and to the point of ultimate despair, Paige finds a cause worth living for when she encounters the Jesus Movement and begins a personal journey with God. When Travis returns from the war, broken and disillusioned, Paige embarks on one last crusade, to bring him to the Christ who healed her.Join the thirteenth generation of the Morgan family in America for the dramatic conclusion to the series that began in the castles of England and stretches more than 300 years to the jungles of Southeast Asia.",
