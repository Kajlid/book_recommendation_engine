And no one gives him more pleasure than Gavin. Only Gavin wants more. And it doesn't include sharing Cole with other wolves. He could fight for what he wants...or he could surrender tothe wolf. Publisher Note: In the Channing's Wolves Series, each book focuses on a different relationship within the pack, but the unfolding of the overall plot takes places over the course of the series. While each individual short story is complete, for optimal enjoyment this series is best read in order.",
