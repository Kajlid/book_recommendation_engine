  "description": "This spoof will probably set astrology so far back that the ancient Chaldeans will have to start over! The play begins with an unexpected astrologer in direct and devastating communication with your audience. This wild astrologer, we secretly discover, is actually the quiet and sincere high school science teacher who couldn't get adequate funds to equip his classroom. In a sense, this comic spoof becomes a modern retelling of the classic situation in which astronomers could only get help for scientific study by telling horoscopes. In the disguise of an outrageous astrologer, our modern science teacher rediscovers the same thingâ€”the world is his, along with the girl he cares about, if he'll just remain an astrologer!",
