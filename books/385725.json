  "title": "The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner",
  "description": "Written in 1824, a period when political and religious controversy flared high, James Hogg's Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner marks a pinnacle of Scottish literature.Against a background of historical realism, the story tells of the degradation of a pious young man who uses the Calvinist doctrine of predestination to justify the murder of his brother. A peculiar blend of mockery, disturbing frisson and black humour, it is a portrayal of the stages by which a human spirit can descend into darkness, a portrayal set in a society which, while very different from our own, nevertheless shares its widespread harshness and intolerance.",
