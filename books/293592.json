  "description": "Tall, dark, and gorgeous with cobalt-blue eyes.  It doesn’t hurt that he’s the billionaire owner of the resort we’re staying at.  And all of it is just what I needed for my celebration weekend after graduating with my master’s.  It’s our last girls’ weekend before my friends and I go our separate ways, and it’s going to happen with a bang.  Literally. Hopefully.  It would be a first.  The desire was to keep things casual, but our connection is far too deep for that.  Him being ex-military and me being an Army brat.  The rules we each set up are shattered thanks to the raging passion between us.  But eventually, I have to go home.  What I never expected in a million years was that he might follow me.  Enough swimming in the shallow end of the pool.  We’re diving in deep.   This is book 1 in a 3 book series. You will have to read books 2 and 3 to complete the story.",
