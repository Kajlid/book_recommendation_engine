Vivian Halliwell will be the first to admit that she’s the ultimate definition of a bitter bitch. And rightfully so. Surviving an explosive past, Vivian has guarded her heart with steel walls and a barbwire attitude. Only letting a handful of people close to her, she has built a life that suits her just fine. Well, that was until… When Sex-On-Legs Corporal Jax Maddox walks into her life, Vivian’s world is tossed upside down. Always keeping her emotions at bay, the six foot two Marine shows her that love is worth fighting for, even if you have to break down a few walls, deal with a butt picking, lollypop licking mini adult, slap a smile on your face, and point out a few crusty empanadas along the way…the ride is totally worth it. (This book is intended for readers 18 and over due to explicit sexual content and foul language)",
