  "description": "What do you do when a hideous frog saves your greatest treasure from a deep, dark well?Kyriana promises her world. Imagine her shock when she has to keep that promise.Deception has cost Germania its throne. Crown Princess Kyriana is the only person free to save it. Unfortunately, her biggest asset is a soldier called Frog—aptly named since he looks like he just crawled out of the pond in search of a good fly.Disgusted by her companion and terrified at what might happen to her kingdom, Kyriana sets out for Daneland to seek help from the prince to whom she is betrothed but has never met. Along the way she and Frog must learn to put aside their differences and work together, especially when they are chased by a mysterious hunter who seems to know more than he lets on.Just as Kyriana begins to see past Frog’s appearance enough to open her heart to him he disappears, leaving her to enlist the Danes’ help on her own. Through kidnappers, traitorous villagers, and a sarcastic prince who insists on marrying her, Kyriana wonders what has become of her Frog, and more importantly, if she can save Germania without him.",
