  "description": "David Chapman has achieved almost everything he's ever wanted. He may not have been anyone's first pick, and he may not have the respect he knows he deserves, but he also knows he has no shortage of chances to prove himself. And he has Jake. So it doesn't make sense for him to feel so dissatisfied. And it really doesn't make sense for him to feel so afraid.",
