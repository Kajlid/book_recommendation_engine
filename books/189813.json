  "description": "As Crown Prince of the Kalquorian Empire, Dramok Clajak seems to have everything he could possibly want. He lives a life of carefree adventure, with scores of lovers to indulge himself with. Yet he still wishes for what he can’t have: the two men he loves above all others.  Imdiko Egilka has been promised as Clajak’s clanmate for 14 years. The prince is a duty to the elder Egilka, a boy he helped shepherd through his formative years. Yet the boy has become a man, one whose passion and penchant for trouble jolts the Imdiko from his quiet, studious life. Love becomes a possibility ... if Egilka can survive Clajak’s adventures.  Nobek Bevau is not the typical Kalquorian warrior. As a rare dual-breed, he knows Kalquor will never accept him as its eventual monarch. His only choice is to walk away from Clajak and Egilka, the two men who own his fierce but loving heart.  Life and love are a struggle, but real tragedy awaits the three men and the Kalquorian Empire. Unthinkable catastrophe will drive Clajak, Egilka, and Bevau together, forging an unbreakable bond ... or it will tear them apart and destroy the Empire’s leadership.  Contains erotic situations with BDSM elements",
