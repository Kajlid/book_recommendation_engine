  "title": "Rth Rising",
  "description": "Kat Stans and Davd Palfy have very different experiences growing up in a space colony far from the over-polluted Rth of their ancestors. However, both end up as Enforcers for Puter, the computer programmed on Rth supposedly to serve, but now showing signs of controlling the colonists. Kat is assigned by the head enforcer to hunt down and return a \"shirker,\" any colonist who tries to escape Puter's authority. This shirker turns out to be more than she bargained for. Sparks fly when Davd himself turns the tables on her, capturing and kidnapping her. Spirited away to an unmapped village hidden in the wilderness, her growing feelings for Davd hamper her foresworn duty and threaten the safety of the family members—still controlled by Puter—that she’s left behind.",
