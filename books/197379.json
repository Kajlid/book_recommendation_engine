  "title": "Child of None",
  "description": "Some of the worst things imaginable happen to children.Pieced together from the fragmented remnants of more than one hundred unfinished letters, Child of None recounts Robin’s great journey, in her own words. From her early years as a victim of sexual torture, through her sentence as an abused wife, until her final days as an invalid living from pill to pill. Each chapter not only provides an illuminating exposé into a life of poverty, but also offers an heartbreaking glimpse of Robin's relentless struggle to survive in a cold, uncaring world.\"Simon, I want you to know something. I did love you, I did want you. I did not force you away, you were stolen from me. Fifty years later, I still remember your birthday. I suffer quietly, still wondering where you are. Many questions remain unanswered. Are you even still alive, or have you long since left this earth? I do not want to take you away from the people who raised you; I do not want to replace their love with mine. I just want you to know that I did not surrender you willingly.\"Sombre yet inspiring, Child of None is not only a memoir, it is an emotional experience that will leave a lasting impression upon every reader.",
