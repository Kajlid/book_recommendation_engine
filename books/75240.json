  "description": "Three centuries from now, in what remains of Europe after several devastating earthquakes and an asteroid hitting the Earth, unlikely friendships are forged, and lives changed forever. Three teenagers meet in a palace in Moscow, not knowing how their actions will affect each other's lives. Two Persephone, stubborn, loyal, and beautiful; and Phoenix, complex, scarred and intelligent, fight for what they believe to be right. They soon find out that nothing is as it seems. But what if the greatest mystery of all is Persephone herself? Decisions are made with little thought of the consequences, but will things end happily for them, or will they be thrown into a torrent of disaster, tragedy and loss?",
