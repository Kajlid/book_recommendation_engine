  "description": "**Author Note** IWL has had a makeover inside and out!Nothing about the story has been changed, just given a nice spring clean of slight errors.♡Today’s love doesn’t always have to look like yesterday’s love ♡  Book 1 in a set of 2.  Falling in love with your best friend is so cliché and old as time. I’m just a southern girl in New York. I never imagined I’d meet my soulmate.  And not a big deal like Noah Fierro. He’s the classic type A personality with a side order of brusqueness. Far too handsome and a magnetism I was swept up in.  And … we’re both into guys.  Curve ball, right? Tell me about it. I was crushed. But he’s my person. My bestie.  And I need to ditch my enormous crush for good.  What if a friendship is so consuming it supersedes conventionality? We have love. But will my heart be broken?  I’m Sena Black and is he … Straight-for-me?  Disclaimer: Due to this book being part of a duet series the story does have one of those big ole stonking TO BE CONTINUED endings. BUT book two comes right after!",
