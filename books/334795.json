  "description": "I’m a man who knows what he wants and makes things happen.I have ambition in spades. Taking my family to the next level is my goal.As crazy as it sounds women have never interested me.No woman ever excited me the way the underworld, making money, racing cars, beating the living daylights out of men as big or bigger than me, and most importantly learning the ropes so I can take over the family business, has.Not until her .She may not be Italian but she fits perfectly into our culture…and my life.She lives with passion, takes risks, and isn’t afraid to fight.My kind of woman and one that I’ve never encountered before because I didn’t know she existed.She belongs to me. And I’m not taking no for an answer. No other man will have her but me. Mine.",
