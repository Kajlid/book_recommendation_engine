A scraggly coyote trotted into sight, and when it stopped a few yards in front of his pickup, Lincoln wrapped his arms around the steering wheel to study the animal. Seconds after hearing the report, bullets pinged off his pickup...\" Â The discovery of a mutilated body on remote farmland is only the start of Sheriff Lincoln James' latest investigation. A mysterious religious sect and an intimidating biker gang add fuel to the fire. Within the sheriff's circle of friends is someone with a hidden connection - If only she'd be willing to step forward...To add to his problems, Lincoln has a fiercely contested election to win if he's going to continue as sheriff. His opponent is a smooth out-of-towner who is making friends among the local people, so it's going to be a fight.",
