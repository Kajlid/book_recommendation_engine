  "description": "From USA Today best-selling author, Willow Winters, comes a tempting tale of fated love, lust-filled secrets and the beginnings of an epic war.There was never a question of whether or not I would be his. It’s simply what fate demanded. There’s a knowing when the werewolves find their mates. It’s an aching need, a desperation… one they would die for. But for their mates, it’s a trance, a pull, a submissive desire that’s at odds with the shadows of my past and how I’ve learned to survive. I didn’t know how hard I’d fall. I didn’t know what destiny would bring. I didn’t know it then that I would die for him as he would me. This is book 2 of the To Be Claimed Saga. Wounded Kiss is book 1 and should be read first.",
