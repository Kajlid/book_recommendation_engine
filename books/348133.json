  "description": "Four friends. Four mysterious powers. They seem like ordinary girls living in Los Angeles. But they each have a secret. Vanessa can become invisible. Catty can travel through time. Serena reads minds, and Jimena has premonitions. As they become friends, their incredible powers bind them together as The Daughters of the Moon. In Book One, Vanessa, who has always had the power to become invisible, discovers that she and her best friend Catty, a time-traveler, are goddesses of the moon who must fight together to overcome the evil Atrox. In Book Two, Serena, a moon goddess who has the gift of reading minds, is torn between joining the dark force of the evil Atrox and staying with her friends. In Book Three, ex-gang member Jimena is terrified by the reappearance of Veto, who was once the love of her life. Veto was killed a year ago by a rival gang. Or was he? Jimena discovers that he has made a devil's bargain, which could cost both of them their lives.",
