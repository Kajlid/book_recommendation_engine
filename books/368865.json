  "title": "Sir Thomas More",
  "description": "\"Sir Thomas More\" is especially valuable for the light it throws on the doctrinal issues that were at the center of the Reformation. This is a detailed, well-researched and thouroughly conventional biography of the life of Thomas More. To put it succintly, this biography is more a discussion of ideas than of events of that time, since More was a rather second-rate political figure.",
