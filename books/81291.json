  "description": "All's fair in love when Manipulating a Master...Five years ago, businessman Lucien Masters made a deal with his grandfather to save his sisters’ inheritances that required he marry by his thirtieth birthday. Ten days before the deadline and his fiancée in the wind, Luc scrambles to find a replacement bride. Fortunately, the solution to his problem is sitting right across the office and struggling with a few issues of her own.Elise Hamilton has more on her plate than she can handle. Temporarily assigned as Lucien's assistant, she's overworked, over-stimulated, and overwhelmed especially when her brother informs her the tax police are ready to slap the cuffs on their mother. Fate intervenes in the form of a lightning bolt and induces Elise to accept Luc's last minute proposal, but if he thinks she'll fall headlong into his arms just because of an ‘I do’, he has another thing coming.",
