  "description": "Can you really fall in love with a stranger?\nAt thirty-three, my life was passing me by and I hadn’t even noticed. After walking in on my cheating ex, I took off on a solo vacation to figure out where things had gone wrong.  I wandered into the restaurant across the street from my hotel late that night for a beer and something deep-fried. Instead, I found a gorgeous man with a kind ear to go along with his sexy blue eyes.  I didn’t plan on falling into Joe's bed and definitely didn’t expect anything more than an awkward parting of ways the next morning. But you know what they say about the best-laid plans…It all felt too right too fast, but there was no room in our lives for more than just a summer fling.You’re supposed to feel sad when vacation ends, but is it supposed to break your heart?No Vacancy is a feel-good romance full of delicious banter, scorching chemistry, and bar apps with a dirty-talking hero and beach-side backdrop. It’s a STANDALONE spinoff of the Second Chances series.",
