  "description": "In early July of 1947, something crashed in Roswell, New Mexico. The military claims it’s a weather balloon. Witnesses insist they’ve seen bodies of aliens, and the wreckage of a UFO. Sixty-eight years pass. On September 15th, 2015, an incident involving the Roswell wreckage escalates into a massive nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States, leaving five billion dead.2098. Another eighty-three years have passed. Project T.I.T.O.R. becomes a reality. Quantum physicists Ephraim Caine, Jeff Waldron, and Rose Rios have designed hop machines, crafts capable of breaching the time barrier. Time is short. The wounded, post-apocalyptic earth, with her dwindling resources on the verge of exhaustion, can barely support life. The hop pilots and crews of T.I.T.O.R. must risk driving the fragile hop machines back through time, in a desperate gambit to find some way to save the earth. Their mission goes awry when Hop 206 tumbles from the sky, crashing, to their horror, in early July of 1947, near Roswell, New Mexico.In a mind-bending, unthinkable twist of fate, they've knocked over the first domino, inadvertently setting off the inexorable series of events that, if unchecked, will culminate in a nuclear war, and the slow, agonizing death of their living planet. They've created a paradox, and caused the precise scenario project T.I.T.O.R. was intended to stop. With everything stacked against them, can they succeed in changing history? Or will time continue to block their every effort to change it, eliminating humanity in the process?",
