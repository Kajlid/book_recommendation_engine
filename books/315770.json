  "description": "All I needed was a date. One measly date to go with me to my company’s Christmas party to show my ex— and current boss— that I was over him and had moved on. It wasn’t like they had to love me— heck, they didn’t even have to like me. They just had to show up. When I got stood up on ANOTHER blind date, I was starting to panic until a gorgeous stranger swooped in and pretended to be my boyfriend. Luckily for me, my ex and his new girlfriend just happened to be there to see it. Pretending to be in a relationship with the beautiful man wasn’t hard. In all honesty, it felt pretty natural. Soon, we had everyone convinced that we were the perfect couple. In fact, we were so good at pretending that we almost fell for it ourselves. Everything about him felt too good to be true. And one thing that I’d learned quickly was never to trust a man who promised he could make your wishes come true, even if it was something as simple as a Christmas wish.",
