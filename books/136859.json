  "description": "The Billionaires Bundle is a box set of three novellas that have all previously been published separately in the past. Each has in common a hot, handsome billionaire who, eventually, gets his girl. Each story is complete and, I should warn you, Dear Reader, that each is heavy in Adult Content.Bind me TightA car accident on a dark, country lane throws Jessica and Justin together. Jessica is sweet and not entirely innocent but innocent of men like Justin. He is handsome, arrogant but most of all controlling and very soon he is controlling Jess. He is unlike any man she had ever met and very soon she is falling for him hard. But Justin is flawed. He must control - control her life, her friends but most of all the time they spend in bed together.The Shameless SubmissiveWhat is a girl supposed to do when her current boyfriend is a poor lover? Tara thinks she has the answer – the sex shop. Despite never having been in one before she plucks up courage and drops in during her lunch hour. There’s such choice – such thrills to be had but most of all, the hunky salesman is only too willing to help. He introduces Tara to a very different, kinky type of sex that she quickly embraces and can’t wait to try again. But Tara craves more, and falls under the spell of a much firmer Dom, who very soon becomes a Dom too far.Taken by the BillionaireWhat can a girl do when she reaches a certain age and is still a virgin? How does she get to indulge her passions when no one in her circle of men friends is suitable? Sophie’s been told about a club, a club where a girl can go and find a solution to this little problem. No names, no questions and no guilt; it sounded just perfect.",
