  "description": "Save your cookie for the monster.  Reem lives a secluded, sheltered life inside Community One. Sold to one of the alien beasts who now rule the Earth, inexperienced young Reem is terrified she won't know how to please her husband, and he'll end up eating her instead of bedding her.  After years of waiting, Troy finally gets his mate. When he lands her on his lap during their pairing party, he confirms her virginity. He can't wait until they're home so he can show her the only thing she should fear is his big... heart.(***Please note Virgin Beast Mate is Book #0 in the Beast Mates series. It is set as book #0.5 on GR as GR overrides series numbers per their policy.)",
