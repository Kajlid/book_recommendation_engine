  "description": "Quarterback Clayton Karz knows football, he is football…until an injury takes him out of the game he lives for. Even after months in therapy he still isn’t any closer to returning to the field. Unsatisfied with his slow recovery, his team brings in the big guns. Enter curvy, tattooed, foulmouthed and unorthodox sports rehabilitation therapist Roxy Shaw. Not only does she love the sport but she’s got no qualms going toe-to-toe with a hardheaded athlete. Honestly? She lives for it. The chemistry between the two goes from blatant disdain to lust that can’t be controlled. Clayton, who was content with one-night stands and his playboy lifestyle, finds himself wanting more with a woman he would’ve never guessed. Roxy went in with her eyes wide open and she’ll be damned if she lets her guard down enough to get her heart broken… Will Clayton be back in pads come pre-season? Is their time together going to be over before the first down? Contains one hellcat that’s the number one reason the star quarterback wears his cup well past game time!",
