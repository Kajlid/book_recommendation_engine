  "description": "When the king isolates himself and lets the country fall into ruin, Simeon, a soft spoken military leader takes it upon himself to make one last, desperate attempt to save the kingdom. With the Historian as a witness and his trusting younger brother at his side, Simeon joins forces with a dark mercenary, called Hunger by his enemies, to kidnap the king. When their attempts to teach him self-reliance and humility end in tragedy, king and soldier alike must decide what they are willing to sacrifice in a war that may have already been lost.",
