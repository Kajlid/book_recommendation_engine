And he’ll cross any line to keep her safe. But he can’t seem to walk away.Mila met Lyosha when he brought in a half-starved stray cat to the shelter she volunteers at.

When someone threatens her, he’s convinced it’s linked to his past. He’s made it clear that he’ll protect her with his life—but he won’t give her his heart.

And Lyosha finds himself unwilling to let her go without a fight.Red Stone Security Series, #16Author note: all books in this series may be read as stand-alones, complete with HEA.",
