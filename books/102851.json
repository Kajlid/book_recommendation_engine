  "description": "Bailey, the Border Collie was not just another rescue dog. She was special. Everyone told her so. She lived life with purpose every single day. Adopted as a senior at age 7, this graceful girl made many people happy along the way. Today she is a teacher of several important classes in the town of Hyfryd. She lives in a newly renovated and expanded DogTown House den with Barkley the Jack Russell puppy and three cats, Tarzan Cheetah and Freedom. Bailey had a voice and a story that needed telling. Her mom was doing that for her at first, but then when life suddenly changed, she decided that she too, wanted to write. This is a true love story for those whose life would seem incomplete if they did not share it with furry ones. Bailey and her mom wanted to share their love story hoping that others would read their story of love and share their stories as well. Our next book will tell many more stories of adventure and love from people we have not yet met.",
