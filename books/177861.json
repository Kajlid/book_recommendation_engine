  "title": "Alexey Dyed in Red",
  "description": "A century has passed since warlock Alexey arrived in Kalinstad, chased across the ocean and dying from fever. His memories of what brought him to such a state were lost; since then he passed his days quietly, buried deep in the snowy mountains in a place rarely visited by outsiders.  His life of peace is brought to a sudden halt with the arrival of two Darkrow, sent by the Blue Emperor to unravel a mystery they will not explain. More than mere Darkrow, they are demons, dangerous and cold, but also beautiful and fascinating in the way they touch and cling and silently watch.  When they offer Alexey a chance to become a Darkrow, he acceptsâ€”and his whole world falls apart.",
