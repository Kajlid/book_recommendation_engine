  "title": "My Lord John",
  "description": "The reigns, deaths, and ruthless struggle for power of Richard II and his cousin Henry IV is viewed through the eyes of Henry's youngest son, John of Lancanster. John, Duke of Bedford--very human, very powerful, intensely virile--he is an unforgettable figure in England's most turbulent and bawdy era. He grew to manhood fighting for his father, King Henry IV of England, on the wild and lawless Northern Marches. A prince of Royal blood, loyal and strong, he was the greatest ally that his brother - the future Henry V - was to have. Master of court intrigue, perilously close to the awesome responsibilities of the Crown, he remained a full-blooded young Englishman--an unrestrained lover, an unbridled seeker of adventure and pleasure.Filled with the clash of bitter rivalries and deadly power struggles, this is Georgette Heyer's last and most ambitious novel.",
