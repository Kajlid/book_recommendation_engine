  "description": "A girl’s first time should be private.  I’ve been watching the big, brooding stranger from across the canyon with my paintbrush in hand. Does he feel me? Sometimes I swear he looks right through my tinted windows.  A risky escape and one rash decision land me right where I need to be. In his strong, protective arms, his primal hunger consuming me. But he’s not the Hollywood Hills millionaire I believed him to be. He’s an enemy to my father. And we’re…always…being watched.",
