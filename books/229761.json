  "description": "When I walked out the door of my parents’ house at 17 years old, I thought things could only go up from there. What could be worse than growing up with nothing but two self-absorbed junkies as family? My decision to leave may have been a bit impulsive, but I had been taking care of myself for a long time by that point. I may not have had a plan or even much more than a handful of cash and a notebook to scribble in, but I thought I knew what I was doing.I was wrong.My name is Aubrey. This is my diary. AUTHOR’S NOTEWarning: This book contains disturbing situations and possible triggers such as dubious consent, graphic sexual content, violence, domestic abuse, child abuse/neglect, and drug abuse. This book is a work of fiction and the author in no way condones these themes.Aubrey’s Diary is the first book in a three-part series. Though it does not end in a cliffhanger, there will be some unanswered questions that will be addressed in the next two installments.",
