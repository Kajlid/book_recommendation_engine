Nikos isn’t ready to give up his playboy lifestyle, and Cassia is far from the glitzy socialite their elite circle expects. Events force them to live separate lives. Ten years later, Nikos is ready to make it work with his wife, whom he only sees once a year. Cassia is also ready to settle down… just not with Nikos. Will Cassia once again surrender herself to the man who scarred her forever? Or will she give up her inheritance and never look back? Will they still be able to fulfill the terms of their billion-dollar marriage contract, even when death and danger stalk them at every turn?",
