  "description": "\"A fascinating and distinctive voice from an unexpected quarter.\" - Ian McEwanA novel of magic realism, akin to much of Latin American fiction. Recounts the construction (and deconstruction) of a suburb, the spiritual quest of a mouth-organ-playing-minister, the havoc wreaked by long-drowned sailors, and an ale-oiled tale told beneath a whale skeleton, while the rain falls and falls.",
