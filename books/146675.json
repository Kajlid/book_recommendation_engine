  "description": "Race Kendall knows monsters. But not the monsters of horror flicks or the imaginary beasts that lurk beneath children's beds. He knows real monsters-men who walk among us, who stalk the weak and vulnerable. Men who prey upon women. Race has spent his life seeking out such monsters. He hunts the hunters-and he destroys them. He is a man driven, but no matter how many monsters he defeats, nothing can purge the demons that haunt his own soul. Race wants to find love and he wants to build a family, but his past and his secrets prevent him from achieving happiness. And then he meets Candra Brandt. From the first moment Candra sees Race she can sense his pain, and as a professional therapist and sexual surrogate she believes she can help him. In fact she needs to help him in ways so deep she can barely fathom. But Race's healing comes at a price, a price neither of them may be able to afford to pay. It could cost them everything. It could cost them their very lives. Note: Story contains scenes of violence that may be disturbing to some readers.",
