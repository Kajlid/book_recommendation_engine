But when her plans to be with her chosen one are interrupted, she discovers just how far she will go to keep the hope of love alive.In a corrupt world where appearance is everything, what makes us open our hearts to others?Steve Holden's haunting debut novel reminds us that the search for love requires courage, no matter whose skin you inhabit.",
