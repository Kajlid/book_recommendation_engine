  "description": "A Deluxe Success and Productivity Volume. This volume contains two books; How to Live on 24 Hours a Day by Arnold Bennett and The Power of Concentration by Theron Q. Dumont.  In How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, Arnold Bennett offers practical advice on how one might live (as opposed to just existing) within the confines of 24 hours a day.  This timeless classic was first published in 1908. It was a best-seller in both England and America. It remains as useful today as when it was written and offers fresh and practical advice on how to make the most of the daily miracle of life.  The Power of Concentration was first published in the USA in 1918. As a pioneering self-help book, it deals with developing the faculty of deep concentration to achieve your personal and professional goals.  In The Power of Concentration, Dumont describes how you can achieve self-mastery, how to gain what you want through concentration, how to obtain business results through concentration, and how you can use concentration to overcome bad habits, among others.  These two powerful books are combined in this volume.",
