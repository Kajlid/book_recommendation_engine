  "description": "Poetry. GLAD STONE CHILDREN is Edmund Berrigan's third collection of poetry. His previous work includes DISARMING MATTER and Your Cheatin' Heart. Son of noted poet, Ted Berrigan, Edmund has a style all his own; GLAD STONE CHILDREN has a musicality and flow of consciousness. He considers the romantic and the political as well as praise and critique for lyric. \"Eddie Berrigan gives a nod to his lineage, acknowledging his upbringing as poetry's child. Berrigan's music, laced with undercurrents of violence and tension, is elegant and hysterically absurd by turns. These poems are a blueprint for a new generation of young American Poets\"-Brenda Coultas. Praise for GLAD STONE CHILDREN and Edmund Berrigan is never-ending: He is a \"rare sort of spy for the imperfect pitch\"-John Coletti.",
