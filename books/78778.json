  "description": "First published in Weird Tales in 1933, Catherine Lucille Moore exploded onto the pulp scene to become one of the most important science fiction and fantasy authors of all time. In her first story, 'Shambleu', Moore revealed a vast imagination, beautifully descriptive prose, and a throbbing sensuality rarely matched by her male counterparts. It also marked the first appearance of Northwest Smith, the quick-drawing outlaw of the spaceways who would become a science fiction archetype. Here, for the first time ever, all thirteen of Northwest Smith's adventures have been compiled into one rowdy thrill-ride, as sure to inspire readers today as it was seventy years ago.In a time when women were marginalized in genre fiction, Catherine Moore stepped forward and opened the door for generations of female science fiction and fantasy authors. Earning praise from contemporaries like H.P. Lovecraft and Fritz Leiber as well as modern authors from Greg Bear to Michael Moorcock, C.L. Moore remains a giant in the genre, and the stories in this compilation comprise an essential addition to any science fiction library.",
