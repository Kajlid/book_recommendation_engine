  "description": "I am a content lone wolf. Maybe not a happy lone wolf, but that’s fine. Better than staying in my parents’ cult, right? Point is, I’d made a life for myself. A life that is turned upside down when my literal dream man, who has featured in every fantasy I’ve ever had, shows up out of nowhere and is all “hi, I’m your fated mate.” That should be it, right? Game over. Happily ever after.But that would be too easy. Because this supposed mate of mine has a secret. I may not have known about him, but he sure as hell knew about me.This is the first in a series of standalone wolf shifter books, suitable for readers 18+",
