  "description": "\"What are you doing?\" Alijah questioned as she backed into the door.\"What I've wanted to do since the first time you walked into my office,\" Kieran replied in a husky tone. \tHe closed the distance between them, trapping her luscious body against his and the door. He left nowhere for her to go and that was his intent. He'd been fighting his desire for this woman long enough, and he wasn't going to do it anymore. He was going to fulfill his every need and hers. Her body was calling to him, begging him to touch her and he was going to do just that. Picking her up, her legs instinctively wrapped around his waist. He pressed his hardened member between the apex of her thighs and allowed her to feel his need for her, his desire. Without a word, he captured her lips with his and dominated the kiss. He was hungry for her and was damn sure going to get his fill of her. Even if it took all night.",
