  "description": "A Second Chance Romance Tucker thought he had it all: a promising career in football, a huge house, and enough money to be set for life. But everything changed after he rescued a woman from a burning car. After the injuries he sustained, his football career is over, and the fame he once enjoyed is now crushing him on his difficult road to recovery.  There is, however, a glint of hope in his life when he's reunited with his high school sweetheart, Ryan. Tucker soon realizes his forced retirement from football is nothing compared to the regret he carries for having ever left Ryan behind. But is Ryan willing to give him a second chance?  Ryan has had great success as a therapy dog trainer, but despite that, he remains hopelessly single. Nobody compares to Tucker, his old high school sweetheart, and he's pretty much accepted that his dogs will be his only companions in life. But soon a bittersweet opportunity arises when he learns of Tucker's condition.  Ryan believes he can help Tucker with the aid of a special shelter dog and, perhaps, help himself too. He wants nothing more than to rekindle their past love, but is Tucker willing to take that step?  Love in Overtime is a standalone novel featuring two hot men, one sweet rescue dog, and a happy ending for all three of them!",
