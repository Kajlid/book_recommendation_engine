A gripping read.”—Han Nolan, National Book Award–winning author of Dancing on the Edge\nA junior ROTC cadet at North Covington High, J.T. is at war—with himself, his enemies, and his past. But no matter how hard he throws himself into the intense demands of the military program, J. T. is unable to escape the traumas of his life. His father died in Desert Storm. His mother was killed in a car accident that J.T. may have caused. After her death, J.T. was placed in a string of bad foster homes. Haunted by self-doubt, J.T. focuses on his latest assignment at school: whip a new group of recruits into shape so his commanding officer, Sergeant Maddox, will be proud. J.T. has to be the best cadet in Covington County so he can win a scholarship to the Citadel. The rigors of training, combined with his unresolved issues from the past, wreak havoc on J.T.’s mind. J.T.’s last hope may be his new foster dad, who is contending with his own violent past.",
