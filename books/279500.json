  "description": "“Darius.” It came out choking from his chapped lips, and his head jerked as he tried to look up into her face.“What now?”“‘S my name. Darius. Thank you.”Of all the humans drowning around her, she had to be stuck with the one who bothered to mind his manners as he was dying. She bit back a laugh. “Well, good to know. Stay alive, Darius.”“Death feels so warm,” he whispered, those brown eyes hooded as they looked into hers. “Didn’t know there were mermaids in heaven. Ice mermaids…So beautiful. Jewels for eyes, pearls for hair.”Behind them, the great ship that had the words \"Titanic\" painted on its bow was cracking as it tilted into the freezing waters of the ocean.Lorelei gave a frustrated sigh and tightened her hold on him. ...Ice Mermaid is a Salt for Air novella about a mermaid who witnesses the sinking of the Titanic. It's not necessary to read it before Salt for Air in order to understand the series, but it definitely adds to it.",
