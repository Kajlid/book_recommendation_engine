  "description": "English poet and scholar, whose verse would influence later poets, although only two slim volumes appeared during his lifetime, this being one of them. Partial Contents: Beyond the moor and mountain crest; Her strong enchantments failing; In valleys green and still; Could man be drunk for ever; The night my father got me; The sigh that heaves the grasses; Onward led the road again; and When lads were home from labour.",
