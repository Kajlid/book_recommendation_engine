  "description": "Have you ever looked at the amazing things that God has made and wondered, \"Is it possible that what God created was intended to, also, convey hidden gems of spiritual truths that point to God's very nature and character?\"The goal of this book is to answer that question in a fun, personal and even, at times, humorous way. It delves into things like light vs darkness, gravity vs centrifugal force, male and female and faith vs fear, and attempts to give the reader a very detailed and intimate portrait of the God of the Bible.It is a great book for believers who want to know God better and for those who are seeking answers to questions like \"Why are we here?\" and \"Does God really exist?\"It is not deep or preachy, but is written in a conversational style that is warm and endearing and will be entertaining to those who have been Christians for years and seekers, as well.It is a great book to share with a friend or a family member, to help you share your faith. It answers a lot of questions and fills in the gaps. (less)",
