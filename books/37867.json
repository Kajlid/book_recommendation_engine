  "description": "New York City native Leah Fisher, an actress you probably haven't heard of, is getting her big break in the premiere of a brand new musical... All the way down in North Carolina. In Durham she meets Sophia Medina, the understudy unexpectedly playing Lady Macbeth in the theater season's token Shakespeare play. Leah is smitten, but trying to balance lust and drama isn't easy, especially when her director, her leading man, and the entire South might be conspiring to ruin her.",
