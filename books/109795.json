  "description": "Dawn at Last is an intriguing debut novel about one person at war with her past and it's future. It's about fear and love, real or imagined, and the close bonding of six misfits.Single, 37 and never married, Donna Belauche – therapist, fugitive, entrepreneur – has everything in control until a chance meeting with an old sponsor. She must start again, leave Victoria, but she's tired – she needs other options. She tries to go it alone but they get in her way, those five other misfits.This is a mosaic of fascinating characters, searching for a taste of love in their own delicious ways. Their stories blend – Ben the painter, Sunaria and Andrea, youthful dreamers, Pierre and Charles, more than just partners. It snaps a picture of love's morality, or lack of it, the clash between the material and the spiritual, and the art of life.Lawrence Grodecki exquisitely portrays our strengths and frailties, capturing the tender moments where we find a little love . . . or where love finds us?",
