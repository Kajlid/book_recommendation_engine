  "title": "How Could You Do That?!: The Abdication of Character, Courage, and Conscience",
  "description": "How Could You Do That?! illustrates Dr. Laura Schlessinger's philosophy of personal responsibility through her usually provocative but always stimulating moral dialogues with callers about everyday ethical dilemmas. In her lively pull-no-punches style, Dr. Laura takes on the moral dilemmas of our time: from the mindless pursuit of pleasure and immediate gratification, to taking the easy way out when those actions produce uncomfortable life-altering consequences. She demonstrates in no uncertain terms that personal values are never someone else's responsibility but your own, and why choosing not to honor them compounds unhappiness. Dr. Laura delivers not only a compelling argument for an ethical approach to life but also an invaluable inspiration to rebuilding character, conscience, and courage. Here is a work that can make a genuine difference in the quality of your own life and the lives of those we love.",
