  "description": "The popular tie-in novels to the USA Network series Psych   When the Santa Barbara art museum unveils its newest acquisition, the long-lost masterpiece by Dante Gabriel Rossetti isn't the only surprise behind the red curtain-so is the museum's curator. Dead. The case has everything Shawn likes: it's bizarre, it's baffling, and there's a snack bar at the crime scene. But the investigation gets a lot less fun as he and Gus begin to realize that the clues are leading them towards a centuries-old cabal desperate to hide a terrible secret-and more than willing to kill the two detectives who are trying to reveal it.",
