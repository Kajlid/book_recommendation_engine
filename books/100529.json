For Josie, perfect love came from another place and time and swept her off her feet, just before disappearing into nowhere.The otherwordly connection between Josie and Cameron shouldn't have happened. It should have been impossible.It's not the way things are done, and it must not be permitted to continue. Josie used to think, like the rest of the world, that the worst punishment a person could suffer is death, but now she knows differently. For Josie, a punishment worse than death is being denied her one true love. And she'll do anything to get him back.",
