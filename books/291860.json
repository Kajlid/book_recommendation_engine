  "description": "After an injury cripples her dance career in the US, Sam is scouted by a wealthy Russian investor seeking ballerinas for his Versailles-esque campus in rural Russia. Not only is she geographically cut-off from the rest of the world, Sam isolates herself from friends and family as her heroin addiction takes control.Similarly alone, Jonah, her brother, is monitoring elephants in the thick of Gabon. An unfortunate crossing with a poacher soon pulls Jonah into the orbit of ivory traffickers whose connection he cannot sever until he has carried out exactly what they have asked of him.And then there's the third and oldest of the siblings whose life, by his own reckoning, has gone most awry. Gavin, in the midst of a quarter-life crisis, has just been written off his fledgling TV show, newly-dumped, and ruined his chances with a regional production (and an engaged regional director). All three siblings reunite in their home of Chicago to confront their past and prove that the bond between siblings is unshakeable... even in the throes of an unfathomable, and foreign, danger.",
