  "description": "John Pagano is the “good son” of his family, the one among his brothers who has always done what was expected of him, who was never a disappointment or a trouble. He’s built a good life in that quiet space. But he’s not happy. Despite the strong foundation of his family, his work, and his town, John is missing what he really wants: something—someone—of his own. A family and home that’s his. As he’s gotten older, that need for what’s missing has begun to make cracks in the foundation of his good life.Katrynn Page has had no such strong foundation of family. The product of an unconventional upbringing, she has learned that love is a wavering, unreliable thing. Working with Bev Pagano at Cover to Cover Books, becoming close friends, Katrynn has spent her years in Quiet Cove as an honorary member of the Pagano family—just close enough to really see all she does not have, has never had. Everything she most wants. John comes to see that Katrynn is what he’s been missing. Katrynn comes to see that John is exactly what she wants. But a drunken encounter gets them off to a disastrous start, and Katrynn must first find it in herself to forgive John and then learn to trust him, and herself, enough to believe that love can be steadfast. She will have to take a leap of faith.Note: explicit sex",
