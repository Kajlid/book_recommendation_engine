  "title": "When Food Is Love: Exploring the Relationship Between Eating and Intimacy",
  "description": "In this moving and intimate book, Geneen Roth, bestselling author of \"Feeding the Hungry Heart\" and \"Breaking Free from Compulsive Eating, \" shows how dieting and compulsive eating often become a substitute for intimacy. Drawing on painful personal experience as well as the candid stories of those she has helped in her seminars, Roth examines the crucial issues that surround compulsive eating: need for control, dependency on melodrama, desire for what is forbidden, and the belief that one wrong move can mean catastrophe. She shows why many people overeat in an attempt to satisfy their emotional hunger, and why weight loss frequently just uncovers a new set of problems. But her welcome message is that the cycle of compulsive behavior can be stopped. This book will help readers break destructive, self-perpetuating patterns and learn to satisfy all the hungers - physical and emotional - that make us human.",
