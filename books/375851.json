  "description": "Tamerlane and Other Poems is the first published work by American writer Edgar Allan Poe. The short collection of poems was first published in 1827. Today, it is believed only 12 of approximately 50 copies of the collection still exist. The poems were largely inspired by Lord Byron, including the long title poem \"Tamerlane\", which depicts a historical conqueror who laments the loss of his first romance. Like much of Poe's future work, the poems in Tamerlane and Other Poems include themes of love, death, and pride.",
