  "description": "Raised by her aunt as a baby after the death of her father and her mother being institutionalized, Alexandra \"Alex\" Hensley grew up determined to put the past behind her. As such, her boyfriend Matt and best friend Lauren, became her new family, and her love for them was unquestioned.  On a night out, the trio meet Dante Delavega, owner of the hottest nightclub in Sydney. Despite Lauren's advances, Delavega hovers over Alex like a mysterious, protective shadow, all but completely ignoring her friends. His actions flatter Alex but confuse and anger both Lauren and Matt.  To prevent losing the two people that have been there for her for as long as she can remember, Alex feels she owes it to them and herself to find out what it is about Dante that is pulling them apart. But once she delves into his world, Alex cannot go back. For Dante holds the key to the truth about her family. When Alex discovers what really happened to her parents, she unlocks an Australian secret kept hidden since the First Fleet.  But no truth comes without a cost. A secret of this magnitude has remained due to one simple rule: they join us or die. Suddenly, Matt and Lauren disappear and Dante's greatest battle begins. Can he truly save Alex? Or will Alex have to make the ultimate sacrifice, for those she loves?",
