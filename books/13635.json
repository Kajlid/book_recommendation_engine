  "title": "The Essentials of Mysticism",
  "description": "'Nothing is more striking in the literature of contemplation, and of high aesthetic experience, than an experienced reality, a joy and richness, which can never be conveyed save by allusion.' Offering a unique introduction to the wide-ranging thought of one of the foremost writers on mysticism, this innovative collection of essays brings together some of Evelyn Underhill's most enduringly valuable work. The volume exemplifies the variety of issues Underhill considered in depth, from the mystical life to the ordination of women, and from the nature of prayer and the power of contemplation to social reform and education. As relevant and challenging today as it was in Underhill's time, this delightfully clear and accessible book will offer valuable advice and true inspiration to all those seeking insight into spirituality in our complex modern world.",
