Lately it seems Dr. Isabel, America's favorite self-help guru, can fix everyone's life but her own. Even the shelter of a simple stone farmhouse nestled in an olive grove can't provide Isabel with the refuge she needs--not when the townspeople are scheming to drive her away, her plan to restore her good name has come up empty... and a movie star villain with a face to die for refuses to leave her in peace!Viciously handsome and sublimely talented, Lorenzo Gage makes his living killing people ... on the silver screen, that is. Despite his success, he hates the feeling that everything he's neglected in life is catching up with him. Then he spots Isabel sipping a glass of wine in a sidewalk cafe. A good guy wouldn't think of seducing such a tidy-looking woman ... but Ren Gage never saw the fun in playing the hero.Sometimes all it takes is a special place...a special love...a little breathing room... for life to deliver all its glorious promise.",
