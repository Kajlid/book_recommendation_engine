  "title": "Rory's Boys",
  "description": "When Rory Blaine inherits his grandmother's crumbling London mansion, he's persuaded to create Britain's first retirement home for gay men. As a teenager, Rory had been exiled from the house, the only home he'd ever known, when he discovered his sexuality. Now middle-aged, he appears to be a tough, carefree hedonist but in reality is rootless, damaged, and lonely. Funny, sharp, and moving, Rory's Boys is about one man's struggle to accept himself, and about the need most of us have to find some sort of family. \"\"It is the insightful, tender way Mr. Clark deals with the important underlying issues that will make this book a classic in its own genre-and hopefully within the mainstream genre, too.\"\"-New York Journal of Books, Aug. 8, 2011",
