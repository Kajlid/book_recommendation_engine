  "description": "I was cursed before I even met you-cursed by my own blood, cursed by an ancient spell to become what I am now. Tatiana Sinclair has lived a perfect noblewoman's life, until the night her brother Henry forces her to cover up a horrible crime. Now, haunted by the only witness to her deeds, Count Spoleti, Tatiana is led into a world she never dreamt existed. \"Vampiro,\" Marcello stated, his accent thick and heavy as it lingered on that one word for what seemed like an eternity. \"I am a vampire. But, more importantly, I am your master.\" Count Marcello Spoleti is intrigued by the female who dares to try and control the vampire. But, he also knows there is more to Tatiana than just a pretty face--much, much more. Forcing her father to give her over to him, lest he tell of his children's crimes, Marcello plans on keeping Tatiana in his complete control. Rating: Contains graphic sexual content, adult language, and violence.",
