  "title": "Fat Girl Food",
  "description": "The most basic tenet of Fat Girl Philosophy is that Fatness has nothing to do with a number on a scale (or gender, for that matter); if you have ever taken one more bite of something (even though you were full) simply because it tasted too good to leave on your plate, you are a Fat Girl. The recipes inside this book aren't health food, but they are good for you. Some people refer to this style of cooking as down-home or comfort food - most just call it delicious. Go on, flip through the book. Notice all the (mostly) helpful notes from me in the margins. Marvel at all the Remix Ideas, recipes-within-a-recipe providing tips on how best to use leftovers. Be inspired by all the Variations on a Theme, sections devoted to helping you turn one basic recipe into endless tasty varieties. You deserve to be this happy!",
