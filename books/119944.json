His only addiction was being on the water. He loved it, he thrived on it, and he needed it in his life. After a very stable, loving childhood with a few bumps, Sebastian married the love of his life: the one person who he knew would always be there. Julia was his rock, and he loved her more than life itself. Sebastian kept his addiction to the water under control, wanting to keep his time with his wife and son his number one obsession. That was, until he saw her.Ysabelle Telle hit him hard, knocking the wind from his lungs. This new addiction haunted him, the one compulsion that he couldn't control no matter how hard he tried. Coming from worlds apart, beautiful, dark complected Ysabelle didn't have the rich, protected background that Sebastian had. She had lived a life of hell, growing up in poverty and horrific living conditions with a drug-addict mother who never cared. Ysabelle now lived for one person, and one person only: herself. She was pure perfection. Her beauty, along with a flawless body, had men lined up and driveling over her- ensuring her success as a VIP.There are too many words that describe the effects when two diverse worlds like theirs collide. They both have too much to lose to get caught in the forceful pull, which could destroy them both.Warning sex/drugs/language. Mature readers only.",
