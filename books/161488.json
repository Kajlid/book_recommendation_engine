  "description": "Sassafrass, Cypress and Indigo is the story of three \"colored girls,\" three sisters and their mama from Charleston, South Carolina: Sassafrass, the oldest, a poet and a weaver like her mother, gone north to college, living with other artists in Los Angeles and trying to weave a life out of her work, her man, her memories and dreams; Cypress, the dancer, who leaves home to find new ways of moving and easing the contractions of her soul; Indigo, the youngest, still a child of Charleston—\"too much of the south in her\"—who lives in poetry, can talk to her dolls, and has a great gift of seeing the obvious magic of the world.",
