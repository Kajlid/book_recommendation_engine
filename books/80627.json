  "title": "Ice Cream Snow",
  "description": "Judith Weinshall Liberman wrote and illustrated ICE CREAM SNOW in 1996, but it was not until 2012 that she decided to publish the story and illustrations as a book.  ICE CREAM SNOW is written in rhyming verse to convey the fast rhythmic pace of the story. Tissue paper collage was selected for the illustrations because the transparency and vibrant colors of the medium help to express the enchantment of the narrative.  ICE CREAM SNOW tells the story of two young brothers, Marty and Ben, who discover one night that it is snowing, except that the falling snow consists of colorful balls of ice cream. Needless to say, the brothers are eager to eat as much of this manna as possible, and to preserve the rest for later consumption. The interactions between the two brothers and the surprise ending add an exciting dimension to this imaginative tale.  Born in Israel (then called \"Palestine\"), Judith Weinshall Liberman came to the United States in 1947 to pursue higher education. She earned four American university degrees, including two in law. After settling in the Boston area in 1956, she studied art and creative writing.  Since the early 1960s, Ms. Liberman has created numerous series of artworks, using a wide variety of mediums. Her art has been widely exhibited, and is represented in the collection of museums and other public institutions.  During her long career in visual art, Ms. Liberman wrote and published several books. Her book THE BIRD'S LAST SONG (Addison-Wesley, 1976), which she wrote and illustrated, won a citation as one of the \"fabulous books of the year.\"  Ms. Liberman's archives can be found in the Special Collections Department of the Boston Public Library and at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.",
