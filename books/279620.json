  "description": "Come to the United States, they said.Freedom and endless opportunities for all, they said.So we did—made the ninety-mile trek overseas from Havana to Key West.What they didn’t tell us was how hard these supposed opportunities would be to obtain when you’re an illegal alien. A fact that forced both my brother and I onto a dark path in an effort to help our family.The difference between Tommy and I?He didn’t get caught.Had I stayed away from Arcángel—the illusive, faceless mastermind behind the Upper Echelon—I might not have gotten caught either.Now, I’m paying the price, rotting away at the hands of the judicial system and facing possible deportation after serving my time.Can’t get worse, right?Wrong.Enter Andrés Bala—the new C.O. at the Annex who fits the tall, dark, and handsome stereotype to a T. It’s clear the man wants me, and I don’t understand why.Why I want him.I’m a criminal...he strives for justice.So wrong yet so right, we end up crossing the line, and after a sneaky, whirlwind affair, he vows to wait for me.The question now can Andrés handle la Jefa outside the confines of her cage?",
