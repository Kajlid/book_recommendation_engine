  "description": "In December 1994, on the acceptance of only the second Nobel Prize awarded to a Japanese writer, Kenzaburo Oe gave a speech that was a message for one that pledged his own faith in tolerance and human decency; in the renunciation of war; and in the healing power of art - the power to calm and purify.Other key addresses he has given elsewhere join the Nobel lecture in this volume, giving a wider view of the work of a literary activist who sees himself as one of a dying breed in the intellectual life of his own country.",
