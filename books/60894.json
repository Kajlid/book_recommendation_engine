  "description": "When Mason’s best friend Robbie is dumped by his boyfriend a week before his birthday, it’s up the “Fancy Man” to try and repair the bartender’s broken heart with a natal day fantasy. He comes up with the idea of offering Robbie three “princes” each with a special gift—and sexual expertise. Even as these princes woo Robbie “on-stage” however, backstage has its problems. The submissives playing the princes need Mason to master them, and his own slave, Charles, is acting strangely. While Mason has always been master and director during the fantasy, he’s not so certain about his role after the fantasy ends. This time, the reality as much as the fantasy will determine not only Robbie’s future happiness, but that of Charles and Mason. (M/M+, Novella - 27,000 words)",
