Now their professor, Bryan McAllister, believes that a dark cult is at work—and that their next gathering will happen in America.When psychologist Jessica Fraser is approached by Bryan for her assistance, she is hesitant. Something about Bryan unnerves Jessica deeply, yet she cannot ignore the incredible pull she feels toward him. Now, as reluctant allies, they unite to seek the truth. The search takes them from the forested mountains to dimly lit clubs in New Orleans' French Quarter, where perversion goes beyond sexual to life-threatening.And everywhere, whispering on the wind, is the dreaded word…vampyr.",
