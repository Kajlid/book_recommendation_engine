  "description": "I have a wolf in my head. Her name is Esme, and she likes killing things.\nI’m Lucy, alpha werewolf of a pack that hates me. I inherited the pack when I mercy-killed the current alpha at his behest. I did the right thing, but it’s left me head of a werewolf pack who resent that I still live and breathe while their old alpha doesn't.The problem is, I wasn’t born to the Other realm so magic is all new to me. I’ve got to get up to speed – fast. Luckily, I have super soldier Greg Manners on side to help me, or this loneliness would be crippling.My new packmates are making it clear that I’m about as welcome as a malodourous, flea-ridden mutt. Disrespect is one thing, bullying is another. I’m trying to take their pranks as light hearted fun, but my gut tells me there’s no affection behind them. I’m going to have to find the pranksters and put a stop to their shenanigans before they erode what little shred of authority I have left. Because if the pack doesn’t respect me, I’ll be replaced as alpha. It’s a position you can’t resign from. It’s do or die.It's time to get my paws dirty…",
