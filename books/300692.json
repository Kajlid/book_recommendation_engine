  "description": "My Little Book of Hope is designed to help create a bridge from where you are to where you desire to be. We often overlook the many gifts we have been blessed with in life and focus on all the lack that we have and what is missing. With this book, Stefanie Miljas endeavours to shine a light on these areas and showcase how we can utilize them to our maximum benefit as they were intended. This book is divided into three segments. The first segment illuminates and explores the gifts that we all possess. The second segment focuses on the different tools, strategies, and techniques that we can incorporate in conjunction with these gifts. The third segment includes a strategic Thirty-day Power Plan that you can immediately begin to use, to shift and uplift yourself and begin to move towards the life that you desire. My Little Book of Hope is a journey of self-discovery on the path from a life you hope to live to the life of your dreams.",
