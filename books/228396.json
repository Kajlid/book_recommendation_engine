  "description": "A love letter to misanthropy. A cocktail of sociopathy and vague spiritual ennui. A dumpster full of human meat.When civilization is washed away in an apocalypse of burning tar, one pill-popping misanthrope goes to war against the forces of good; putting the tyre iron to the horrors of morality, justice and the curse of \"being human\".Life is good in the New City; if \"good\" is a relative and very flexible term. No law. No bureaucracy. No death. And for some it is a beautiful and violent cycle of amphetamines, chaos and shine.But nothing lasts forever - and the animal desire to cluster into disgusting \"societies\" and enforce arbitrary \"morals\" is a habit that dies hard.When the ugly face of humanity begins to surface once more; it's time to take up the tyre iron - pop a couples of blues - and toss a few do-gooders in the meatbin.But the New World is cruel, and beyond the comfort of the city a brutal breed of life is growing - one that will test the bloody resolve of even the most violent sociopath.Channel your inner sado-masochist, chew those amphetamines to dust - and crack some skulls in the name of chaos.",
