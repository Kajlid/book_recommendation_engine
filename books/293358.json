  "description": "Tanasia Davis-Ramsey was born and raised in Newark, NJ. Tanasia has always had a passion for film, poetry, and writing. She's currently in her third year of college at Rutgers University. She has always loved to write short stories and screenplays. Famous writers that have inspired her include Walter Dean Myers, James Baldwin, Ntozake Shange, and Toni Morrison. For Tanasia, writing is a way to tell the stories of her people, and their experiences in all aspects. Tanasia feels that it is extremely important that we see ourselves depicted in literary pieces that reflect our lives. She hopes to one day transform these stories into films. She wants her words to someday inspire somebody else to continue to tell her people's stories.",
