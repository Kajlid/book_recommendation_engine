He doesn't care if it means destroying an innocent in the process.Lady Leonora Forsythe is content to lead the quiet life of a spinster. At nine-and-twenty, she's suffered enough awkward seasons to know she wants nothing more than to find a husband and make a family of her own. When the wickedly handsome Marquess of Searle ruins her, she's certain he harbors ulterior motives. After all, no man would want an opinionated bluestocking with a deformed ankle as his wife...Would he?Morgan never imagined he'd become captivated by Leonora's keen wit, striking beauty, and gentle kindness. But the more he uses her to gain his revenge on her brother, the more he finds himself drawn to her. Soon, reprisal is the last thing on his mind.\nWill he abandon his plans and give Leonora his heart? Or will he give in to the darkness and destroy her love in the name of retribution?",
