Liam Cross grew up on the rough streets of New York City. Out on his own for most of his life he learned from an early age that the only person he could count on was himself. Angela Reynolds, a woman born into a life of privilege, is the girl least likely to capture Liam's heart. Through a chance encounter the burning chemistry and uncontrollable passion between them is undeniable, but when Liam's past threatens to tear them apart they are forced to face the truth about who they really are and what they truly need. While opposites attract, can they ever rise above their differences to share a future together? Is Angela willing to risk it all to love the boy from the wrong side of town, even if it means leaving behind everything she's ever known?",
