  "title": "Lady and the Tramp",
  "description": "Some years ago James Thurber remarked, \"I am not a dog lover. To me a dog lover is a dog who is in love with another dog.\"This book is about dog lovers in the Thurber sense. It is about a carefully nurtured, beautifully pedigreed little cocker spaniel named Lady, and a raffish, freedom-loving wanderer of a dog who wares no man's collar named Tramp.There are several other minor characters, such as human beings, but they are really important only to advance the plot.You will find out yourself that it is a wonderful story, but if you need any proof, Lady and the Tramp is going to be Walt Disney's major full-length feature picture next year.",
