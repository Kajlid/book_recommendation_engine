  "description": "A mysterious archive. A powerful enemy. And a cunning plan.Librarian spy Irene thought her to-do list would be her undoing. She's on missions for both the Library and a dear friend – the detective Vale. And she’s also training her new Fae apprentice, who's more interested in the stacks than sleuthing. But now someone is trying to kidnap her and kill her friends. As Irene, Kai and Vale try to track down the would-be assassin, they uncover a plot. It’s even more insidious than usual and could threaten Irene’s headquarters, Vale’s home and the Library itself. Someone is creating links between high-chaos worlds and Vale's world. Someone who wants Irene well out of the way - and will do anything to make this happen. When the allies’ investigation takes a wrong turn, they find themselves trapped deep underground. And while they wander among long-abandoned archives, Irene's old enemies are closing in. The Dark Archive is the seventh book in the Invisible Library series by Genevieve Cogman.",
