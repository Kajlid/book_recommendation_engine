  "description": "I’m the head of the Masciantonio family. I’m a dangerous, ruthless, unforgiving man, and I know how to fight dirty.  Fate put Emilia Trassato in my path. I saw a future with her—I saw hope. But she didn’t agree, and I let her walk away.  Now she’s back, but I’m no longer free to claim her. However, the minute our eyes meet, I know there’s nothing in this entire goddamn world strong enough to keep me from her.  She’s the only woman I’ve ever wanted, and I don’t care how many promises I have to break, or how many lives I have to destroy…I’m not letting her go. Not again.  Because this time…she’s mine.",
