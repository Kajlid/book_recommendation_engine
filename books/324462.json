  "description": "What happens when you add an adrenaline junky and a math genius in Vegas? Disaster, that's what. From the moment this girl runs into my life looking like she's on an audition for an old western, I know I'm in trouble. She's gotten herself involved in a world that robs you of your innocence with no hope of getting out. Luckily for her, I have a brotherhood that specializes in getting women out of these situations. If I could only get her to trust me, I might be able to save her from whatever is chasing her around town.",
