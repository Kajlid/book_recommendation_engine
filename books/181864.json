  "description": "From a serial killer's yard sale to a hoarder's hideous secret. From a cartoon character made real to a man addicted to car accidents. From a bloody Halloween to child murder as a means for saving the world. The rules of normalcy and society no longer apply - you're now in a place of cruelty, terror, and things that go bump in the night.  In Shane McKenzie's first collection - he explores the horrific, the grotesque, the perverse, and the downright bizarre in ten short stories. Each tale includes an introduction providing insight into the creative process of one of the hottest writers in modern horror.  This collection also features an introduction and two bonus stories from the writers/directors of Dead Hooker in a Trunk and American Mary - the Soska Sisters!",
