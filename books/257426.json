  "description": "Blake knew she was different for a long time, but she had lived in denial for too long. Living in reprehensible conditions, she didn't think she had any hope of getting out anytime soon, with her half sister. It wasn't until she was confronted by her music teacher and series of events that she was forced to face reality. She was gifted with a special power and with the help of the new men that entered her life she would learn to control them. At least she hoped she did before her idealistic new life was torn apart by a man determined to use her powers for his own gain.    *Please be advised possible trigger warning.",
