  "description": "When Eve Dartwood returns home from her trip to Italy, she can hardly wait to confide the news of her engagement to her twin sister, Amy. The two have never really been separated from one another before; and in th epast eighteen months apart, Eve, the more outgoing, sociable twin, has missed her quiet and studious sister intensely.But when Eve arrives at their stately home with the crates of antiquities she has gathered for their father's celebrated collection, she discovers that her twin is quite despondent. For while Eve has just gotten engaged to the well-known poet Thomas Perry, she learns that her sister is being pursued by Lord Barras, a charming but terribly arrogant nobleman whose intentions have been a bit forceful.Virtually in tears over her predicament, Amy pleads with Eve to help her, and the twins come up with a plan. Before Lord Barras can finalize his marriage proposal, the Dartwood sisters devise a delightful scheme to prevent him from falling in love with Amy. The outcome is far from what they might have expected in this highly amusing Regency by the author of Arabella and the Beast.",
