  "description": "Book 2 in the \"Samantha Brennan and Annabelle Haggerty Magical Mystery Series\" - When fake psychic Samantha Brennan heads to Sedona, Arizona as spiritual advisor to the aging bad boy of rock, Rand Riker, she never expects to uncover the most shocking secret the government has kept for the last sixty years: the truth about the being in the spaceship that crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. With its rock stars and shape shifters, gods and haunting militia leaders, MAGICAL ALIENATION will turn what you think you know upside down. Even Samantha's favorite partner in crime, goddess-in-hiding FBI Special Agent, Annabelle Haggerty, wrestles with the most destructive paradox of her life. While the rock people twist the surface of the earth and Sedona heads into the darkest night the planet has ever seen, Samantha wonders which, if any of them, will survive. But she should know by now that when Celtic gods are involved, nothing is ever as it appears.",
