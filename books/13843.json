  "description": "\"The clear successor to Kushner's masterpiece, Angels in America, picking up many of the same arguments about love, sexuality, and politics while adding many more.\"—Minnesota Monthly\"Sprawling, yearning . . . packed with a level of complexity, sophistication and understanding that distinguishes it as a potentially important new American work.\"—VarietyTony Kushner returns to his big topics with trademark humor and passion in a play titled after two nineteeth-century treatises: George Bernard Shaw's The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism and Mary Baker Eddy's Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.In the Sumer of 2007, Gus Marcantonio, a retired longshoreman and cousin of the late congressman Vito Marcantonio, summons his three adult children to the family's Brooklyn brownstone to vote on the question of his committing suicide. The Intelligent Homosexual's Guide to Capitalism & Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures explores revolution, radicalism, marriage, sex, prostitution, politics, real estate, unions of all kinds, and debts both unpaid and unpayable. Originally commissioned and produced by the Guthrie Theater, the play will premiere in the spring of 2011 in a co-production between New York's Public and Signature theaters.Tony Kushner's plays include A Bright Room Called Day; Angels in America, Parts One and Two; Slavs!; Homebody/Kabul; and the book and lyrics for Caroline, or Change. His honors include the Pulitzer Prize, two Tony Awards for Best Play, and three OBIE Awards for Playwriting.",
