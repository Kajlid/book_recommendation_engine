  "title": "Full Circle: Fulfilling the Promise",
  "description": "Full Circle: Fulfilling the Promise offers several powerful stories within a greater story that hangs together like a novel. Readers will get inside the heart of Diane’s battle with infertility and endometriosis as well as join her on the emotional roller coaster of caring for premature twins—with one twin fighting for her very life after being diagnosed with heart defects. Full Circle gives insight into the struggles mothers face, regardless of the success they have had in their careers. From the impossible goal of a clean home (like the ones in the furniture catalogs) to children who are always polite and clean, Diane offers encouragement to other mothers as she admits to being completely overwhelmed and sleep deprived. Those in similar circumstances will feel a bond and have a chuckle along the way.  Diane’s story comes “full circle” as her faith journey leads her through the most challenging circumstances a wife and mother could ever face. She emerges more than capable of offering help and perspective to others. Finding faith and learning how to let go and ask for God’s guidance is the silver lining that anyone can find when they open themselves up to the possibilities.FULL CIRCLE - Fulfilling the Promise is: •\tfor anyone who needs to hear a true, inspiring message of hope.•\tfor a woman or a couple going through the challenges of infertility – to help them know they are not alone and to feel validation.•\tfor parents of preemies – to help them see the future.•\tfor parents of multiples – complete with chaos and sleep deprivation.•\tfor parents who have a child with congenital heart defects who needs surgery. •\tfor moms who are overwhelmed & feel they have lost their identity.•\tfor “luke-warm” Christians who are trying to learn what it is to have real faith.•\tfor lifelong Christians who have never really felt a “close” relationship with God.•\tfor doctors, nurses and medical staff, to understand the patient’s point of view.•\tfor everyone who drives to offer a reminder of automobile safety and learn what really happens in an automobile accident.•\tfor anyone who is interested in learning more about the life and soul of someone who is developmentally disabled.•\tfor anyone who enjoys hearing miracles of what good can even come out of death.•\tfor animal lovers who enjoy hearing how God can help “the little creatures” too.•\tfor women who have gone through surgical menopause & hysterectomy at a younger age.•\tfor anyone who believes in supporting childless couples achieve the dream of parenthood through a percentage of the book/speaking profits going to this cause.",
