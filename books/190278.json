The first thing we learn—never trust the Tario, even if they’re your own blood. People we thought were dead are suddenly turning up alive. Everything we seem to know about ourselves and our existence is now being questioned. The survival of the supernatural races rests solely on a young boy and a knife. What happens when the love of your life gives into his darkness and the only person who can bring him back is your enemy? What happens when the one you love kills hundreds of innocent people? Can you still love them? Loved ones will fall. Who will win the war? And at what cost? War…Betrayal…Lies…and death are thrown together in this thrilling sequel to Tainted Crimson.",
