  "description": "Runaways #1During the summer of 1890 Lily Blair is on the cusp of spinsterhood. So when an eccentric, world traveling relative offers her a tour of Europe she cannot resist getting away. Whilst enjoying her last few days in Brighton, a spur of the moment decision is made to visit a traveling circus. There she meets Alastair Murray, larger than life, a man scarred by fire yet wields the flames as though they were his to command. Nights spent with him haunt her long after her return to society life in the nation’s capitol. But she has left her own mark on the hardened performer, so much so that he follows her across the ocean right to her very doorstep. When Lily lies in Alastair’s arms she is desired, her full curves worshipped and she is free from the constrictive world that would see her married off against her will. In her the fire breather sees a woman beautiful, feisty and too high above him to ever dream of keeping. And yet he wants Lily for himself and will not settle for anything less.",
