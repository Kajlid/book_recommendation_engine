  "description": "Angels aren’t as pure as we think they are.I’m in a bad place, but I can’t leave my best friend to suffer alone.When a local Las Vegas pimp gets me caught up in a brothel against my will, I'll fight with everything I have to find a way out, for me and for Abby. I just didn’t imagine that a darkly possessive undercover cop might be that way out.Only, Alexander Malik is more than a cop. He’s an Angel, with odd, onyx-tinged wings and an attitude I don’t expect from someone sent from Heaven. And his sudden interest in me isn’t a professional one. He wants me for his own, and he is willing to do anything in his angelic power to get me out of here.But I can’t leave my friend, and there are rules this Angel-cop must follow so the demon that owns this brothel can go down as well. Only, Alexander has never been one for following the rules.And he will behave more like a demon and burn everything to the ground to rescue me . . .If you love star-crossed lovers, damsels in distress, forced proximity, bodyguard-style romance, then try Silver Guardian, book 1 in the Holy Shields Angel romance series today!See Strawberry Chase's social media pages for information about themes, tropes, and any CWs.",
