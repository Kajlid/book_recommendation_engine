She’s banished him from their bedroom over suspicion of yet another affair and threatened divorce.But Louis will always be Louis. After meeting and falling for an attractive Philadelphia radio personality, his tightly controlled world comes undone. When he finds himself separated from his wife and facing an ugly, public divorce, one that he’s certain, based on his past infidelities, will lead to the loss of his position and any claim on his wife's much better assets and income, he determines to fix the mess he’s created with an unorthodox plan – the murder of his wife in their home.",
