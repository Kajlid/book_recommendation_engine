  "description": "Patient Twenty-nine.A monster roams the halls of Soothing Hills Asylum. Three girls dead. 29 is endowed with the curseâ€¦or gift of perception. She hears messages in music, sees lyrics in paintings. And the corn. A lifetime asylum resident, the orchestral corn music is the only constant in her life.Mason, a new, kind orderly, sees 29 as a woman, not a lunatic. And as his belief in her grows, so does her self- confidence. That perhaps she might escape, might see the outside world. But the monster has other plans. The missing girls share one common thread...each was twenty-nine's cell mate. Will she be next?",
