  "description": "The last thing Russell wants to do is go back to the home that his childhood Wolf pack exiled him from. Yet, like it or not, that's where Russell's sorry ass is going. The fact that he's doing so in order to attend a wedding between his old Alpha and a feline shifter only make it more aggravating. Just when Russell least expects it, a most welcome diversion comes, via way a cute, sexy Lynx shifter named Dalton.",
