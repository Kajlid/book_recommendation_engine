  "description": "Toni Melville, who retreats into her own \"listening valley\" to seek solace, is the absorbing subject of this very well-written novel. A companion book, not a sequel, to 'Celia's House' set in World War II England and Scotland, it can be read on its own. Tonia's story is utterly compelling and returns the reader to the enchanted Listening Valley in Scotland, along the way.",
