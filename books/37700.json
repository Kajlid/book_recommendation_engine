KEEPING THE WORLD STRANGE offers an archaeology of the archaeologists, examining PLANETARY and revisionism, decompression, future studies, proactive vs. reactive super-heroes, conceptions of the multiverse, and more. These essays offer new and different vantage points from which to see the genre-busting series, which continues to twist and to grow with each new reading.
