  "description": "PRESENTING THE AMAZING MORSE Guaranteed to astound, destined to perform for the crowned heads of Europe. At least that's the way it was supposed to be, the way Dave Morse dreamed it would happen when he was a child. Now The Amazing Morse finds himself working in an office cubicle, wondering where all the magic went. But then he chances upon a spiritualist. Through her, he is reminded that there are still things beyond the grasp of human reason, things unable to be captured on film or contained on a hard-drive. Human understanding is quite a small thing after all, a tool insufficient for dealing with the world in which we live. Dave experiences magic again, magic and mystery. And Terror. Now he is just praying it will stop.",
