  "description": "Mother Meg blew out the candle and closed the door behind her. A heavy weight landed on the bed and a husky voice asked, \"Might I have your attention?\" It is the black cat Grimbold who introduces the boy Muffler to the night-world, much more exciting than the day-time world, but also more alarming. Nicholas Stuart Gray was a professional actor and wrote many plays, both for stage and television. He was regarded as a pioneeer of children's theatre in Britain and also wrote many children's novels and collections of fantasy stories.",
