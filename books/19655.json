When her overbearing parents catch her flirting with these \"sex-crazed, non-magical delinquents,\" they slap a chastity spell on her to protect her virtue.The spell is triggered by lust, so just navigating the halls at her new school is an ordeal. She can't even touch a boy she's attracted to without blasting him with a jolt of magical energy that feels like a taser.When Channie falls in love with Josh Abrim, a BMX racer with dangerous secrets of his own, she rebels against her parents and turns to dark and forbidden magic to break the chastity spell... with disastrous results.",
