  "description": "Get the Astounding History Behind the Spear of Longinus Mentioned in Indiana Jones and the Dial of DestinyEver since it pierced the side of Christ more than 2,000 years ago, it has been said that the Spear of Destiny has been invested with amazing occult powers. In this book, Trevor Ravenscroft records its legend and involvement in the decline of the Roman Empire, the Dark Ages, and the 20th century. He tells the story of the chain of men who possessed the Spear, from Herod the Great to Adolf Hitler, and how they sought to change the face of history by wielding its powers for good or evil.The Spear of Destiny is identified as the Spear of the Holy Grail mentioned in the sagas of the Dark Ages. It is believed the holder of the Spear possesses the power of mind expansionâ€”as applicable today as it was at the courts of King Arthur and Charlemagne. The final chapters of this book describe a Manichean battle of the worlds behind the changing scene of the 20th century. For the first time, the Satanic occult development and faculties of Adolf Hitler are described in authentic and documented detail, showing how he furthered his aims and his conquest of the world by black magic.",
