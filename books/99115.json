Soon she’ll find out if Payne will be the love of her life, or the end of it — and she has no idea which possibility scares her more. And that's not even the worst of it. Strange shadows are haunting her dreams, and they're up to something that could put Bristol and the lives of everyone she loves in jeopardy.",
