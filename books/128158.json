He lives in limbo, never dreaming of anything that lies beyond the grave.In his mind, he’s a murderer, pure and simple.Hide and seek is Aysa’s game. She begs for small spaces and empty places. But, she secretly desires so much more.When they find each other, a hope for something new is sprung.But Ezra’s skeletons are out for blood.“I hide shock well. I’m a pro at hiding. I have no idea that whatever he had to tell me would be so personal—so heartbreaking. But, I quickly remembered that heartbreak was all around him every time he turned around. He needs no more empathy or sympathy in his life. He craves someone to give him a different take on a tired situation.And different is practically my middle name.”",
