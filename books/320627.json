  "description": "After being ‘purged’ by the Academy of Enchantment, Everly loses all her memories of Ever Dark Academy, Dread, and the men who live there.Luckily, she’s got a good friend in Griim who patiently helps Everly as she tries to relearn everything about Dread and Ever Dark. Little by little, Everly finds herself growing closer to Griim, much to Harlow’s discontent.Then there’s also Jean-Claude—getting to know him the second time around doesn’t change the fact that Everly is drawn to him, though she isn’t sure why. Regardless, she can feel an attraction to him, a bond she can’t explain.Meanwhile, Ever Dark Academy is looming very close to a potential battle with The Academy of Enchantment. On the surface, the reason why appears to be the fact that Jean-Claude, Griim and Harlow broke border protocols when they entered Arcadia uninvited. But Riven knows the true reasons run much deeper.Those reasons have everything to do with the fact that Everly was able to read Dorian’s book—a journal no one has been able to decipher and one that’s believed to hold important information. And it’s that information the Academy of Enchantment is so worried about.Now it’s just a matter of time before the Academy of Enchantment declares war on Ever Dark Academy and Everly seems to be stuck right in the middle.",
