  "description": "You’re invited to a very special Wardham wedding…It’s been a year since Liam and Evie welcomed their daughter Ava to the world. A year of sleepless nights and laughter-filled days. Some fights. A lot of love. And non-stop parenting. Plus they had a wedding to plan.But now it's their time, and Liam wants to make the most of it. He's never had any problem showing Evie how much he loves her, and now that they’re making the ultimate commitment to each other, he wants to find exactly the right words as well. Then he’ll go back to showing her, over and over again.This is a sequel novella to When They Weren't Looking, Wardham #3, and probably shouldn't be read out of order, unless you really love weddings.",
