Now, she's been charged with deciphering the symbols on this centuries-old piece of clay, which legend says contains omens with healing powers. On a harrowing journey through Israel and into ancient Babylon, she tries to uncover the secrets surrounding her father's death--while fighting to stay alive herself. Along the way, she must decide if she will find answers to her own spiritual questions in the ancient mythologies of reincarnation or in the pages of Scripture--and the hands of God Himself.",
