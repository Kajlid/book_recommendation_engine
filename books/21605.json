He walks through comfortable suburbs, but Albert must take care not to be spotted by the NUPS on his short walk. As the grandson of Polish immigrants, he and his family are classified as noncitz and are no longer welcome in Britain. Little does Albert know that there is no school trip and his parents have made a sacrifice that will impact on the lives of everybody concerned.Edward is the teenage son of George Clark, the Minister for Family Values. Edward leads a privileged life, and his main concern is deciding whether to date the rebellious and hard-to-resist Florence, or Susan, his motherâ€™s choice and fellow political royalty.But Edward also finds himself questioning the political monopoly in Britain, with its brutal treatment of noncitz and lack of free press. A founding member of the Lily Allen Fan Club, Edward leads underground online discussions, but is forced into real action when his love life and politics mix to place his and other lives in danger.",
