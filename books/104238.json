  "title": "Cursed: Night Of Power",
  "description": "\"Night of Power\" is the first installment of the Cursed series- Young Adult novels that deal in the supernatural. Each book introduces new characters, supernatural elements, challenges and story arcs - then mix in some danger, some making out, lots of humor... oh yeah, and then there's the fact that someone or something is CURSED - and that is never cool. \"Night of Power\" introduces Charlotte (Charlie to her friends) and Jason- two teens who were all set for their final \"normal\" year of high school until someone tries to open a portal of death and destruction and now it's up to them to face off with a REALLY mean lady (who is hell bent on world domination), take out all her minions and still have a social life. Along for the ride are Gwen, Charlie's BFF, Jester, the class clown and two mysterious foreign exchange students. Breaking curses has never been this much fun!",
