And when she moves in with her new roommate, Kelsey Davenport, she has no idea her world is about to be turned upside down and torn in two. Kelsey's sexy, overbearing, older brother, Lucian, doesn't trust Brianna yet his instant attraction to her overwhelms him to the point where he figures if he could just get one taste of her, he'd get her out of his system.... That? Well, that never works. While helping her out of a sticky situation, and after a mind blowing spring break week with Brianna, things quickly go downhill with the arrival of Lucian's longtime girlfriend, Samantha. Enter Andrew Spencer..... Drew is the brother no one ever mentioned so Brianna didn't know who exactly she was flirting with when she headed to New York for an internship at KSL Global. Soon, she is torn between two hot billionaire brothers and her reckless lifestyle from the past and the present is quickly catching up to her.",
