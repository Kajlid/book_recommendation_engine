  "description": "A worldwide phenomenon and the most important French novelist since Albert Camus, Michel Houellebecq now delivers his magnum opusâ€“a tale of our present circumstances told from the future, when humanity as we know it has vanished.Surprisingly poignant, philosophically compelling, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, The Possibility of an Island is at once an indictment, an elegy, and a celebration of everything we have and are at risk of losing. It is a masterpiece from one of the world's most innovative writers.",
