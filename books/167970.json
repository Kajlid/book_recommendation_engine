  "description": "At the age of 20, Miranda K. Simon, a na√Øve, young college student with a one-year-old son to support and nowhere else to turn, is desperate--her rent is due and her son needs food. With a strong Christian upbringing, Miranda never imagined she would, or even could, dance with men for money, go out with sugar daddies, or strip naked on stage. Yet she does all this and becomes trapped in a vicious cycle. She wonders if she can make it out of this shady underworld with her self-worth, ambitions, and priorities as a mother intact.",
