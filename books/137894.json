  "description": "She wants a baby.He’s just the man for the job.I’d finally given up on having a family of my own.Until ex-con Jake Brand walks in. He’s six foot five of ink and muscle and the farthest thing from a family man. He’s also leaving in a few weeks.So, when he offers to help out—in my restaurant and in my bed—I cave in and say yes.But I’ve got rules, strict ones, to keep everything between us clear:No touchingNo kissingNo emotionAnd the lights stay off. Always.Except, it turns out, dirty talking Jake doesn’t do rules.He busts through them one by one and every time, he cracks another piece of the shell protecting my heart.Now as we’re counting down the days until he leaves, I can’t help but wonder just how much of me will be left when he’s gone.Author note: Please check author website for content notes.",
