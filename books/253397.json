  "description": "Finley Cartwright is the queen of lost causes. That's why she's standing on a barstool trying to convince Friday night drinkers to donate money to her failing charity. Hitting on the guy on the next stool wasn't part of her plan. Still, hot but grumpy venture capitalist Caleb Sherwood might just be her ticket to success. Professional grifter and modern-day Robin Hood, Cal Sherwood is looking for a partner for a long con. Sexy Fin, doing her best Marilyn Monroe act for her cause, has the necessary qualifications. By the time he cuts her free, her charity would be thriving, and she'd have helped him charm billions out of arrogant, gullible marks to fund his social justice causes. But just when he thinks he's about to pull off the best con ever, his feisty new partner gets the upper hand.",
