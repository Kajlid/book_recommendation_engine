Raised in privilege, Jenny Chawleigh is the only daughter of a doting, self-made financier who's determined to elevate his daughter's status in society. But to do that Jenny must marry into nobility.... And the new Viscount Lynton seems quite suitable. But while society politely applauds the fortuitous marriage, Adam is still possessed by the thought of another woman-the one he couldn't marry....",
