  "description": "It was my con to end all cons. Three billionaire brothers looking for a surrogate.All I needed was just one of them to choose me. I never imagined it would be all three. My name is Memphis King, and I’m a trailer park princess, but my thick-with-manure surrogacy application would suggest otherwise. Rich-blooded debutante. Yale graduate. Tennis champion. Yeah, right.The truth is I have one brother in jail, another brother in rehab, and my con-artist ex just took off with all my money. I didn’t want to play this grift, but my ex left me no choice…To say I was a little shocked when the gorgeous AF Remington brothers wanted to hire me as their surrogate, would be like saying the sun is a little warm up close. And I was about to be engulfed in flames…Especially, when the brothers asked me if I wanted to do the job the old-fashioned way…There’s Remington, the chief executive hunk. Driven by power, I love the way he makes me submit.Boone is a sensitive and caring doctor, who is determined to examine every inch of my body.And then there’s Wells the tortured artist. He loves to paint me like one of his French girls. And when he looks at me, I feel like my ship is about to sink.I know the game is over the second they find out I’m not their Ivy league queen with impeccable baby-making genes. But these playboys have their secrets too…Turns out, I might not be the only one running a con here.18+ Only. Billionaire Brother's Surrogate is an extra spicy laugh-out-loud standalone why choose romance (formerly titled Meet the Surrogate). HEA guaranteed!",
