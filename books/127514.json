  "description": "Itâ€™s been ten years since the destruction of Tolen-Ire. The divine world is besieged, its portals cut off. The holy city is about to fall, and then a lost portal opens, giving Warren one last, desperate chance. Ambrose has spent the last decade as a slave and without magic he has grown hard and angry. As Ambrose regains his abilities, he unlocks the greatest magical power in the last thousand years. He has enough raw power to conjure storms of fire, restore the portals, maybe even raise the dead. Unless Xanthus can reach the humanity within him, Ambrose may turn out to be a destroyer of worlds, rather than a savior.",
