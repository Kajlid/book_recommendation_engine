  "description": "A long time ago, Old Bear was packed away in a cardboard box and taken to the attic. Now the day of his rescue has come. But how to find a way up to the attic door? Bramwell Brown, Little Bear, Duck and Rabbit try everything, from jumping on a bed to climbing a not-so-steady tower of blocks, to no avail. Then Duck stumbles upon an idea, and up Little Bear and Rabbit fly in their toy plane--to the rescue! In Old Bear, Jane Hissey has created a timeless story for the very young--or anyone with an old bear in their life.",
