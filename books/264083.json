  "description": "Power-hungry princes are Rosa’s greatest dread.Deep within the gardens of Faraway Castle sleeps a secret Rosa the gardener has sworn to protect with her life—the legendary princess Zafira. For three years she has hidden the princess almost in plain sight. But two nosy princes threaten to undo the work of a century. When asked to take his sister's old job as Faraway Castle's Magical-Creature Controller, Prince Briar leaps at the chance. But nothing works out the way he'd expected, and he is far too busy working to gain Rosa's trust to bother about uncovering her secrets. Until devious Prince Javier of Evora begins shadowing Rosa . . . and Briar suspects the rival prince of dark motives. Which prince will wake the sleeping beauty with a kiss?",
