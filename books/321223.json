  "description": "I thought the proposal was a joke at first. You would too, given the circumstances. Anyone would.When my brother’s best friend asks me to marry him—right after we fell into bed together!—it’s not for love. And it’s certainly not because he has his eyes set on a happily ever after.Oh no.He wants me to be the future Mrs. Malone because he’s in a bind and “kind of needs a wife.”But I’ve been head-over-heels, stupid-in-the-brain in love with the guy since I was sixteen. SIXTEEN.While he’s talking about a business proposal, I’m staring at a dream come true.Obviously, I should walk away from this crazy idea with my head held high, but when it comes to Jude, I’m weak. I always have been.Plus, after our drunken rendezvous the night of my brother’s wedding, I’ve got some very real reasons to say yes.I can get through this with my heart intact…can’t I?",
