  "description": "Incarnational Wonder, even though written in old age and through a bout of severe sickness, has been very revealing on a personal level. Its writing has brought me to a clarity, more than a conviction of mind, something deeper, of what it means to be a human being, at the heart of which is spirituality. Its main focus is to, initially, isolate spiritually and see it what it really the bedrock not only of personal reality, humanity, but indeed of all reality.",
