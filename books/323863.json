  "description": "I did something I’ve never done.I couldn’t help it. The man I met at the bar was too gorgeous, too fascinating, too sexy. The next thing I knew, we had a one-night stand.Except… It turns out he’s Denver Gilchrist, lead singer of the Road Kings, the legendary band that broke up five years ago.How was I supposed to know I was sleeping with a genius rock god? I’m just a piano teacher who plays jazz on Thursday nights. I have a happy single life with my cat. I don’t need Denver’s brand of chaos.But now I’m addicted. And so is he.Denver is a poet, a talent, a complicated intellect, a lost soul. He can bring me to life, but he can also break me to pieces. Stories like ours don’t get happy endings -- but I won’t know the end until I risk it all.",
