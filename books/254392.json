  "description": "The Horde took everything from him. He’s honor bound to avenge his people and take back his palace by any means necessary. Blane has kept his people hidden from the Horde since the day they came in and wiped out the dragon race, but they didn’t kill them all. Now he’s back, and making a move against the Horde. He’s going to take back what’s rightfully his in a step to wage war against those who took everything from him. The one thing he didn’t expect was to find her instead of the Horde King’s offspring. Ciara has lived in the shadows and survived torture at the hands of her own father. She’s trained hard to find her place among the Elite Guard. Until she is captured by him…changing her destiny along with it in one fateful night. Now, she will taste unbridled passion at the hands of her captor, and she isn’t sure she’ll survive the heat of the Dragon King. Not suited for anyone under 18. If you don't like alpha a-holes, this book isn't for you. Trigger warnings and adult content. I write a-holes who get knocked down by strong, sassy females that earn and demand the respect from the men.",
