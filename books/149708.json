  "title": "The 16 Rule",
  "description": "Fifteen-year-old Lucy Aceves lives in a cultural tug-of-war. She wants nothing more than to live a normal American teenage life. But her parents' dumb \"Sixteen Rule\" and their Latin beliefs force her to tell lies to just about everyone. Lucy attends summer school for one reason only... to meet a boy. When seventeen-year-old Evan Ellis catches her eye, she becomes obsessed with finding out as much as she can about him. She plots and schemes to gain his attention by wearing clothing and make-up her parents do not approve of. Lucy has never defied her parents. But, when her father's disapproval and lack of trust hinders her ability to keep her secret, ultimately she is faced with a difficult decision. Should she continue to lie and sneak around behind her parents' back, and suffer the consequences if she gets caught? Or should she obey their rule and gain back their trust?",
