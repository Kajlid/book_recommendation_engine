  "description": "Alone in the Everglades, Lori promises her dying mother she will care for her newborn brother. Competing for her affections, Lori will have to choose between two brothers, but Michael's welfare will always remain paramount. Born into the violence of Northern Ireland, Shaun O'Brien is recruited by the IRA. Under the tutelage of Hugh Devlin, a veteran terrorist, Shaun excels in his ability to spread death and destruction. While proliferating his creed, Shaun crosses paths with both Lori and Michael. Pursued by The RUC in the form of Inspector Pete Doyle, the two men will eventually meet in a confrontation that only one can survive. After the wrongful imprisonment of Michael, and to keep faith with the promise she made to their mother, Lori solicits the help of the I.R.A. to free Michael. The one man that can help her is Shaun O'Brien, but the price of his help is to kidnap a prominent protestant church leader and hold the British Government to ransom.",
