  "description": "It's not easy always being upstaged by Mom's trapeze act, which she performs right in the living room. When Dan, Nisha and little Stuie come to visit, they want to watch Mom, not TV. Then they find the Circus Costume Box and the circus takes over completely. To make matters worse, they won't even play Circus correctly. A bullfight works its way in, a safari, and a rocket ship. \"A circus doesn't have safaris, \" cries the young host, to no avail. Will he get his friends onto the couch in front of the television or will the circus finally work its magic on him too?Circus Play was born when author Anne Carter visited a friend who was a member of a female circus troupe and found that she had a trapeze hanging from her living room ceiling. In that home, as in Anne's, rich opportunities for play invited children into glorious fantasy worlds, worlds that Anne explores in her stories.",
