Stunned, Kathleen realizes she herself bears Cahira’s mark. Is Kathleen destined to continue the legacy in the twenty-first century?  To discover how the histories of these women relate to her own future, Kathleen must delve deep into the past to learn the truth about The Heirs of Cahira O’Connor… Aidan O’Connor Aidan O’Connor was raised among pickpockets and prostitutes in a Dutch colony on Java, Indonesia.
