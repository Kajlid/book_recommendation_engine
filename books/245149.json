  "description": "Once, I was Kenna Tierney, Professional Psychic Medium. My clients wouldn't make a decision without consulting me first. But my arrogance and a personal tragedy destroyed it all. After that, I just wanted to live a \"normal\" life--no more recognition, no more clients, no more ghosts--and rejected that side of my abilities. I went to school, worked my butt off, and now I'm an anonymous veterinary technician living in a new city. My furry patients are my life and I'm happier than I've ever been.Then my mother dies and I return to my hometown.My Spidey senses may be rusty but I can't miss the ominous presence in the basement of my family home or the freaky number of ghosts in town. I don't even want to know why there's so many or where they all came from. My plan is to ignore everything and play nice-nice with my siblings long enough to put the house on the market and escape.Wrong.Ghosts start physically affecting the living, causing the old guilt to gnaw at me. As far as I know, I'm the only one in town who can see and hear the earthbound spirits and understand what's really going on. If I reveal my abilities and try to help, will anyone believe me? But if I do nothing, the ghosts may cause serious harm to innocent people.And I can't let that happen again.Beset By Ghosts is the first novel in a psychic suspense series featuring a small-town setting, quirky characters, and ghosts with their own agendas.
