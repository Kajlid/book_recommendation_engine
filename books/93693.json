  "description": "Three By Moonlight: A collection of werewolf tales is a collection of three stories, each following the struggles of their hero as they navigate a world of werewolves and magick, one often hostile to their continued breathing, much less their man on man relationships.  Brennen juggles having a boyfriend, being a newly minted teenaged witch, and his first encounter with the werewolves in his home town.  Duke, on the other hand, is not just a mage, but also the mate to the sexy and powerful alpha of the local pack. So what does it take to keep even a small part of his life normal? Justin ran away from home when his drunk father nearly beat him to death. Now, after being rescued from the streets and addiction by the handsome werewolf Aiden, he returns home to reconnect with his sister and brother, but has to deal with the lingering emotions for his former lover, a local bruiser named Mickey.",
