  "title": "Paper Rad: Cartoon Workshop Pig Tales Digest",
  "description": "Comic strips, psychedelic imagery and lo-fi digital wizardry from the Paper Rad collective This follow-up to the Paper Rad collective's recent hit, Paper Rad, B.J. and da Dogs , is both a return to form and a move forward. Comic strips, psychedelic imagery and the group's trademark lo-fi digital wizardry lend Pig Tales Digest the feeling of an old-school variety show. Bounding from stories, to suites of gag cartoons, to drawings of Alf, Miss Piggy and other pixillated creatures, this book literally ricochets between silly humor and serious satire, raising the house style of exuberant digital Neo-Primitivism to new heights. This well-priced, accessible sampler, featuring an introduction by the artist Donald Baechler, is sure to reach a wide audience.",
