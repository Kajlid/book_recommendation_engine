  "description": "My name is Kate and I’m a princess. I had it all. Every little girl’s Working as a princess in a theme park five days a week. Prince Charming and I really hit it off, until he hit every other princess in the park. After beating him with his own sword I decided it was time to find a normal guy. I met one- or at least I thought I did. Now the princesses are snubbing me and the princes won’t even look at me. Worse, I’m about to be demoted to a fairy, which is like being sent to the seventh level of hell. What do you do when the fairy tale ends? When happily ever after sucks ass?",
