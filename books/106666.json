  "description": "In the year 906 A.D. the Kingdom of Mercia, England withstood Viking attacks. Ranulf was only a boy of sixteen when he was forced into service for the king's army. He returns home five years later as a fierce warrior who wears a mask to hide his scars. Fearing he is too hideous for the eyes of Gisella, his childhood love, he disguises his identity and allows her to believe he is dead until he learns the Druid priest Savarin is forcing Gisella to marry. Ranulf decides he must intervene to insure Gisella finds a proper spouse, but he soon learns love is blind, and a mask is but a slip of cloth.",
