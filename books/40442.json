  "description": "If you like your crime in a foreign clime, join Sonia Samarth and her Stellar Investigations Detective Agency as they confront a rash of baffling misdeeds plaguing the city of Pune, India–and solve them as only they can, with a unique combination of traditional Indian wisdom, modern-day detection, and ancient astrology.The Astral AlibiAfter a slow start to the New Year, Sonia Samarth’s crime-solving services are in high demand. There’s the bride whose arranged marriage may include murderous in-laws, the theatrical team whose death scene was no act, and the deceptively happy couple whose stars foretell domestic danger. Good thing Sonia has her opinionated assistant, Jatin, to help–except that even he may be caught up in the unlawful fray. Fortunately, it takes more than a few misguided souls–not to mention a preposterous proposal from the world’s most notorious diamond thief–to rattle this yoga-practicing, astrologically inspired sleuth.",
