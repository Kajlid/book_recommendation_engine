  "description": "The three Cadogan children, Jessica, Kirsty and Patrick, haven't spoken to each other for three years. An argument after their mother's death was the latest excuse to blame one another for their family's troubles in a long, unhappy series that's lasted almost a decade.When their father, Gerry, dies they are given instructions as to where he wants his ashes to be scattered. But first they must together drive his old camper van up the country to the Scottish Isle of Islay. For the journey, he's given them his old fishing tackle box containing three photo albums through which they can explore their past, and a bottle of single malt whisky he had been saving for the 70th birthday he never reached.Along the way, they'll be forced to confront the most painful moments in their shared history, lay to rest a ghost who's haunted them for years - and maybe even become a family again.",
