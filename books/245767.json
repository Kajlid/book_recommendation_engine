  "description": "After putting her life on hold to care for her dying father, Ivy Nichols feels stuck. Alone and disconnected, she’s struggling to pick up the pieces and move forward.  The mysterious William Cole walks into her life, like a beacon of light in a fog. He’s sensual and captivating—awakening Ivy in ways she’s never experienced before.  But he knows things about her—deeply personal things—that he shouldn’t. His explanation is impossible, but the alternatives are worse. Her friends insist he’s either a con artist, or he’s crazy.  With her heart on the line, Ivy has to decide who—and what—she believes. The rational explanation from her trusted friends? Or the impossible story from the man without a past? The man who swears he will do anything to protect her.  One thing she is sure of—William doesn’t just know facts about her life. He knows her, inside and out. He knows her as intimately as if he’d spent every moment of his life loving her.  And, according to him, he has.  ***Remembering Ivy is a stand-alone contemporary romance with a hint of mystery, and ends with a HEA. Contains mature language and content and is intended for mature readers.***",
