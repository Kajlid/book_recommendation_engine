  "description": "The most delightful of English poets ― mordantly amusing and fresh as a sassy cat Extraordinarily funny, with the fresh eye of a visitor from another world, Stevie Smith is a poet to savor. Wielding a throwaway wit and the strangest irony,Stevie Smith was deeply read in the classics and yet sprinkled her poetry with delightful doodles. Her poems are often very dark; her characters are perpetually saying “goodbye” to their friends or welcoming death. At the same time her work has an eerie levity. Countless are her witty ways. The title of her first collection says it A Good Time Was Had by All . I longed for companionship rather,But my companions I always wished farther.And now in the desolate nightI think only of people I should like to bite.",
