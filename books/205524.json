  "description": "He is going to take her. And it won't be gentle. After all, the last 700 years of torture and captivity haven't been gentle on Tain. This woman, this half-demon who leaves him burning with desire, is pretty tough herself. She needs to be, for the world is not safe for demon-kind these days. A violent backlash has disrupted the balance of power, and now Tain finds he may have to rescue the dark ones instead of fight them. He feels compelled to protect the alluring Samantha--whether she wants him to or not--but all he can think of is seduction. Ultimately, she'll either destroy him or bring exactly what he needs most...THE REDEEMING.Â©2011 Books In Motion; (P)2011 Books In Motion",
