  "description": "Angels want Eden dead. They’re calling for an extermination of her kind and she’s at the top of the list. A strange plague is unraveling mortal paths and granted, it’s the same plague that’s turning Eden to ash, but Heaven isn’t willing to wait. Eden’s never been afraid to fight--for Az, for her friends, for her very life. But with the Fallen on her heels and all the powers of the Bound crushing down on her, is there anyone left she can truly trust? It’s in the gray areas that heroes are made, in the spaces between life and death, good and evil. Heaven and Hell. What will Eden risk for the chance to be mortal again? What will she sacrifice for true love? Who will make it to the dramatic conclusion of Leah Clifford’s epic trilogy alive?",
