  "title": "Static: Tune Out the \"Christian Noise\" and Experience the Real Message of Jesus",
  "description": "Words communicate. Christians often use words to communicate to others; however, these words aren't understood by many of those outside the church. We can be so absorbed in our \"christianese\" that we don't realize others don't understand the jargon and cannot figure out what it is we mean by what we are saying. Static readers will become aware of what we are saying so we can re-focus our thinking to communicate clearly to those outside the church.",
