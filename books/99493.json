  "description": "As a three-month-old baby lying in her grandmother’s arms, author Marilou Trask-Curtin had the fantastic experience of remembering herself in other bodies, times, and places. In this fascinating book, she tells the stories of soul lessons and past-life relationships that were too powerful to ignore. With a supportive community of like-minded seekers, Trask-Curtin achieves a remarkable transformation, and now she is able to affirm this important  Reincarnation is real. It’s not easy for anyone to move past the limiting teachings of our culture, but Reincarnation shares a comforting idea― death is not the end, but rather a glorious new beginning. Join Marilou as she explores her soul’s path, returning again and again to fulfill what was unfulfilled in other lifetimes. With the true stories of Marilou’s remarkable experiences, this book reaffirms that empathy, forgiveness, and unconditional love are our soul’s most important lessons. \"[A]n entertaining and accessible introduction to the concept for readers new to the subject.\" ― LIBRARY JOURNAL",
