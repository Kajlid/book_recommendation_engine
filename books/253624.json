  "description": "After fleeing her city life for something quieter in the suburbs, Elizabeth Mavery grapples with her new existence. When she’s not going to Costco or day-drinking with her best friend, she’s trying to escape her past. And it seems to work – until an anonymous gossip blog begins spilling the women of Waterford’s darkest secrets.  Now, the blurred conversations and blank spots in Elizabeth’s mind give way to panic and anxiety. If her secrets – like a hospitalization for bipolar disorder and a suicide attempt - don’t stay buried, she faces social shunning. Because after all, life in Waterford must look Instagram perfect at all times.  With her mental health in tatters and her marriage on the brink of imploding, Elizabeth fights to protect her family, her reputation, and her sanity. The past, however, has a way of not being forgotten.",
