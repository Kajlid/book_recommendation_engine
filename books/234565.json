  "description": "In the heart of politically and religiously divided Rome, one 16th century artist risked it all to earn his place in history as Master Painter. Fate thrust him into a future of uncertainty when his heart surrendered to the affections of the wrong woman. Worse yet, this rebellious decision made him the new enemy of Romeâ€™s most untouchable family. In this intriguing tale of dreams and betrayal, Caravaggio finds himself in a world unfathomable even to his unbridled imagination when he realizes he is the key player in a conspiracy woven by an eminent pope and an illustrious Grand Master of the Knights of Malta.Caravaggio: Of Oil and Blood presents the first half of Caravaggio's life in all its complexity--his flaws and strengths, the beauty and tragedy that was not only his artworks, but his journey through life.",
