  "description": "The Lords of Creation have learned that although they rule the solar system, there are even more powerful forces to be feared lurking in the dark depths of space.  The necroforms are an empire of vampires, ruling a vast network of dead stars and planets they have drained of all life. And now they have come to the Nine Worlds, seeking the last refuge of living things to be found throughout the universe. But how can the Lords of Creation stop them when they are bitterly divided into rival factions?  SUPERLUMINARY is the latest and most outrageous creation of science fiction grandmaster John C. Wright, the Dragon-award winning author of THE UNWITHERING REALM, THE GOLDEN AGE, MOTH & COBWEB, and AWAKE IN THE NIGHT LAND. THE LORDS OF CREATION is the first book in the series.",
