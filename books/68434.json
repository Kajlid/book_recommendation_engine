  "description": "Thirteen-year-old Emaline is running an errand for her Mom when she is suddenly grabbed and forced into a brutal headlock. Her fear turns to horrified amazement as she sees one of her assailants conjure a glowing fireball in thin air. This chance encounter introduces Emaline to a world she had never known: one of spectacular feats and a centuries-old battle between good and evil that she is suddenly thrust into. When the evil obeah kidnap Emaline and hold her hostage, the Christ-following magi rally to mount a rescue. Throughout it all, Emaline finds herself pursued by the God who saw these events before she was even born.Emaline’s Gift is a Christian urban fantasy novel for young adults. It’s full of action, adventure, supernatural battles and the timeless truth of Scripture. Fans of the Harry Potter and Percy Jackson series may find a lot to like here, but all the excitement is strengthened by an exploration of God’s will and the importance of building a strong relationship with Him.Recommended for readers 12 and up (but the author’s 7-year-old daughter is a huge fan as well!).",
