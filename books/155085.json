  "description": "TALES FOR THE 21st CENTURY is a collection of diverse short stories written within the last 14 years, featuring vampires, volcanoes, trees, skeletons, and other creatures. It could be considered light horror.\"I woke up to a vague smell of smoke and my first thought was that someone downstairs had burnt a toast again, or a neighbour upstairs had fallen asleep while cooking brunch after a nightshift. Whatever it was, this recurring occurrence felt boring. Daylight was peeking from behind the curtains. Now that my brain was shifting into consciousness, I realised that if no smoke alarm was screaming abuse into my ears then no food was being cooked to a cinder.\" (The End of the World)",
