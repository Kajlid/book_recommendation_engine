  "title": "Anissa of Antioch",
  "description": "[\"Clean read\" edition - full details below] Anissa Toma fled war-torn Syria after narrowly escaping the massacre of her Christian family by Islamists. Fortunate enough to rebuild her shattered life in New York City, she soon captured the interest of two powerful men: Michael, an activist working to establish Antioch, the first Mideast Christian state, and Julien, her college professor and one of the cityâ€™s wealthiest bachelors. As Anissa's saga continues, the refugee-turned-rising-star must navigate between Michael and Julien, while trying to help her surviving relatives and other vulnerable Christians in Syria. As she gets closer to both men in a complex and evolving love triangle, can she unlock Julien's traumatic childhood to open up his heart? Or will Julien find greater solace from his nightmares and other demons in the sessions with his intriguing therapist? What will Michael do for Antioch and for Anissa? How far will each person go to help Anissa's remaining family and other persecuted Christians at risk in Syria? Find out in this stunning sequel to Anissa of Syria (which is summarized in a detailed synopsis for those who wish to read this book as a standalone). Anissa of Antioch might be compared to The Kite Runner, Exodus, and The Diary of Anne Frank. NOTE: This is a \"clean read\" edition of Anissa's Redemption (i.e., this version has no profanity and just a few, brief scenes of minimally described intimacy without reference to any explicit details or sexual anatomy). Due to war themes, this book is not recommended for readers under 16.",
