  "description": "In this large format volume, the dark mavericks of art, literature and music once again sally forth, contradicting preconceived conceptions of who are the important cultural figures of our times. And not a moment too soon.Here is an antidote to the usual propagandaâ€”a sparkling gallery of creators who weave in and out of society, spinning a web that connects high and low, the whole delivered under the similitude of a dream.With 608 pages and over 550 illustrations, this is a heavy book in more ways than one!Jacket design by John Coulthart.Mr Punch face by Harry Douthwaite.(Source: http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/sieg...)",
