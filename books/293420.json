  "description": "From Book 1: ** Adult Romance ** Benella is concerned with two things--avoiding the two village boys who torment her and scrounging for food to help feed her family. Unfortunately, the best wild fruit and vegetables are near the walls of the estate, a dark misty place inhabited by an unforgiving beast.  When her tormentors lock her behind the massive gates, Benella knows her fate is sealed. Yet, the fate isnâ€™t one she expects. Her encounter with the beast starts a bizarre cycle of bargaining for her freedom, a freedom the beast seems determined to see her lose.  A classic fairy tale with a seductively dark new twist, the Beauty and the Beast saga begins with Depravity.  Intended for mature readers due to sexual situations and moderate language. This book is part 1 of 3.  The completed Beastly Tales: Depravity, Part 1 Deceit, Part 2 Devastation, Part 3",
