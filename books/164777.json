  "title": "Double Dutch: A Celebration of Jump Rope, Rhyme, and Sisterhood",
  "description": "This colorful, vibrant treasury is the ultimate tribute to the unique sport and pastime of double Dutch. Written and compiled by celebrated author and journalist Veronica Chambers, Double Dutch is filled with her own personal memories of girlhood and jumping rope, along with poems, interviews, songs, history, quotes, rhymes, and photographs. At the heart of Double Dutch, though, is a celebration, not just of a sport, but of sisterhoodâ€”after all, it takes a few friends to make that rope really swing and those feet jump for joy",
