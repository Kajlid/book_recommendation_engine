I couldn’t have been more wrong…Coming back home with my tail between my legs after a bitter divorce and a failed business venture isn’t exactly the life I’d envisioned for myself.At least there’s Bennett. Strong and steady as always, even if there is a simmering anger in him that wasn’t there when we were boys.When that anger finally boils over, I’m braced for a fight, but what I get instead… is a kiss.A kiss that changes everything.But a surprise visit threatens the new life Bennett and I are beginning to build together. Now I’m faced with an impossible choice: Return to the safe, predictable life I’d always planned on with my ex-wife…Or take a chance on the unexpected love of a lifetime.* * *My Best Friend’s Secret is a friends-to-lovers, bi-awakening romance set in the cozy little town of Fairlake. And while Adam and Bennett will have cameos in future stories, each book in this series can be read as a standalone.",
