  "description": "\"I have always loved writing, but it has taken a promise to my mother before she passed away and the encouragement of my wife and several of my friends to bring me to this point. It is my hope that my poetry will be thought provoking, encouraging to some, and insightful to others. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to share my life, my heart, my thoughts, and my experiences.\" -RM Ullrich",
