When Kade does a favor for his adopted sister, Theresa, he discovers his mate is joining them, as the date of Theresa’s friend. The fact that Tom is human and knows nothing about the existence of shifters is only one of many hurdles. His mate doesn’t want to admit he’s gay, and Kade finds himself fighting for his future as Tom fights the mate-pull.A straight-laced marketing executive, Tom doesn’t understand his attraction to the tattooed, pierced biker with the burning green eyes and sensual smile. Tom is so deep in the closet, he may as well be chained there. But Kade turns up at the oddest times, and somehow he seems to know every one of Tom’s hidden desires, turning his body against him. It doesn’t matter how much Tom likes it, though, because he has family obligations that don’t include revealing his sexuality.Can Kade convince Tom that he can help him and his family? Or will Tom fold under the pressure?",
