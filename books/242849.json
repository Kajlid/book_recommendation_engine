  "description": "Mary Jane went around the USA nearly twice by Amtrak train and hired about twenty cars to get to out-of-the-way places as well. She was in America for the elections. She hiked with Republicans and got invited to Democratic Party Headquarters in Little Rock for election night but was not surprised Trump won. \n\n\nThe most memorable part of her trip was when she took the train to the Glacier, Grand Teton, Yosemite and Rocky Mountains National Parks before the snow hit. She nearly met a Grizzly Bear and now knows why Americans do not have to travel much worldwide, as they really do have it all in the USA.\n\nShe went to a black hairdresser's to meet the locals, and to the Civil Rights Museum in Birmingham, Alabama. The most boring City was Charlotte, which seemed to be dedicated to car racing. In New York, she loved to stay in Red Hook and went back there again.\n\nWith her backpack, she got mistaken for a homeless person in San Francisco.\n\nShe got invited to the pipeline protest at Standing Rock and went right in through the gate and was not impressed with stoned hippies who had joined the protest. She was impressed with Washington DC and Chicago.\n\nWith 409 maps, photos and other images.\n\n\"This is one of the most satisfying travel books available today,\" writes Amazon Top 100 and Hall of Fame Reviewer Grady Harp, \"sophisticated in content yet warmly personal, making the reader feel as though an accompanying companion on each journey. Highly Recommended.\"BY THE AUTHOR OF A MAVERICK NEW ZEALAND WAY, FINALIST IN THE TRAVEL CATEGORY, INTERNATIONAL BOOK AWARDS, MAY 2018.",
