  "description": "Life is so hard when you want to live like a magpie, stealing anything shiny you find, but you live in a small town where everyone knows your face.Nothing exciting ever happens here, unless you count us getting our very own movie rental shop right next to the sheriff’s station.Which, for the record, I don’t.That is, nothing exciting happens until my roommate is murdered and her body washes up on the riverbank for the police to find.Confused and angry, all I can really do is move on and let the police handle things…right?Wrong. I can use the questionable life skills God saw fit to give me and be the best stalker-I mean, investigator-anyone has ever seen.Until four sexy as sin strangers waltz into town like we’re some kind of fun tourist destination rather than the most boring place on earth.Lysander, Azriel, Nikos, and Rhys don’t belong in this town. Something’s off with them. Something is wrong behind their shrewd gazes and swoon-worthy looks. More suspicious still, they show up right as my roommate was found, and the reasons they give for coming here are flimsy at best.At worst? I’m starting to think they killed her, or they know who did.Is it coincidence that they’re here just after the first murder in over a decade occurs?And even if I’m wrong, what happens if the dust settles and I can’t keep living the only life I know?Well, let’s just hope my body doesn’t end up in the river too.18+ Dark Reverse Harem Romance. PWK contains graphic sex scenes and detailed violent acts that may be triggering for some readers. There are also MM and MMFMM scenes and relationships.",
