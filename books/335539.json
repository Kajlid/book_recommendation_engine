  "description": "B*E*A*S*T* series, book 3 Wade McAllister has one thing on his mind--revenge. Kidnapping Clive Covington's daughter seems like a damn good place to start, but he's made a terrible mistake. She knows nothing of the B*E*A*S*T* agency, and she's hardly the witch he's imagined in his nightmares. Oh, she still haunts his dreams. But now, in a much different way. Keira Covington doesn't know what to make of her captor. One minute he's got her bound and gagged, and the next, he's setting her free. But no matter how much her common sense screams at her, she doesn't hate him, and her desire escalates until she's begging for his kisses. When Covington hears his daughter has been kidnapped, all hell breaks loose, and Wade learns more about himself than he ever dreamed. Will Wade exact his revenge upon the man behind B*E*A*S*T*? Or will he have mercy--for Keira's sake?",
