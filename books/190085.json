It also means contending with new station manager Seth Armstrong as he trains her boys to be riders. But Rebecca soon sees he has her children's best interests at heart—and perhaps hers, too… Seth plans on staying long enough to teach the boys how to survive the trail, before continuing on to search for his lost mail-order bride. But now, as he works so closely with Rebecca and her children, he's glimpsing the possibility of a different future. Could changing course bring this cowboy the chance of true love and fatherhood he never expected? Saddles and Spurs: Daring Pony Express riders risk all for duty—and for love",
