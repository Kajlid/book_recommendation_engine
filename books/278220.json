  "title": "Mrs. de Winter",
  "description": "\"\"For twelve years, in so many ways we had been as one, everything had been shared, there had been no secrets. Yet the past still held secrets, the past threw its shadows, and the shadows sometimes separated us.\"Since Manderly burned, tormented Maxim de Winter and his demure second wife have fled the ghosts of a dark, unspoken yesterday. And now they have come home to England -- to bury what was and to start anew. But the sensual warmth of a golden autumn cannot mask the chill of a lingering evil. For October's gentle breeze whispers that Rebecca -- beautiful, mysterious, malevolent Rebecca -- is haunting their lives once more.",
