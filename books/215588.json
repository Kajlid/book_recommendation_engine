  "title": "Mind The Final Frontier: \"Decoding the Human Mind\"",
  "description": "From caves to condos, from spears to space ships and from stone to electronic tablets, human beings have broken multiple barriers to pave the path of progress. Today, we are materially much more prosperous than we were a couple of centuries ago, but are we happier and more fulfilled? For many of us, the answer is a bewildering 'no'. We often feel anxious and lost, as if living somebody else's life.The author argues that the answer lies inside our minds and it is within the highs and lows of our thoughts, we can find clues for addressing our discontent and confusions about life. He explores an innovative method - The Information Processing Approach (IPA) - to understand how the human mind works and throws light on questions such as 'Who am I', 'What's the purpose of my life', 'Why do I dislike my job' and 'How can I improve my personal relationships'. He takes you on a momentous journey of self-discovery.",
