  "description": "Between the end of Frank Herbert's Dune and his next novel Dune Messiah lies a mystery: how a hero adored by a planet became a tyrant hated by a universe.Paul of Dune begins the story of those twelve fateful years and the wars of the jihad of Paul Muad'Dib.It is an epic of battle and betrayal; of love and idealism; of ambition and intrigue. Above all, it is the story of how Paul Atreides - who achieved absolute power when scarcely more than a boy - changes from an idealist into a dictator who is the prisoner of the bureaucrats and fanatics who surround him.Have you read Dune ? And have you read Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's novels continuing the story? The latest are Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune .",
