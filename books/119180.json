  "title": "Disappearance at Hangman's Bluff",
  "description": "Just in case your memory's as short as a South Carolina snowstorm, I'm Abbey Force, and my best friend, Bee, and I spent the last few months solving this crazy mystery involving robbery, betrayal, and a lost chest of Spanish gold. We also managed to clear my dad of the crimes everyone thought he committed (even though he still hadn't woken up from his coma). Not too shabby for a summer vacation. Now school's about to begin again, but that isn't even close to the most distressing thing happening around here. First, my dad woke up, which is great, but he somehow got it into his head that he needs to start taking cases again. Then me and Bee saw something simply our neighbor's dog, Yemassee, getting kidnapped by a couple of rough-looking fellas with guns. And as if that weren't enough, we just found out that someone Daddy sued years ago is back in town, making shady business deals again. I don't know what all of this means, not yet. But I do know that if you try to mess with my dad, my friends, or my friends' dogs, you've got trouble on your hands. Trouble that goes by the name of Force.",
