  "description": "Just when they thought they were through…What are the chances of running into your ex-wife on a singles cruise? Apparently very high, as Darcy Lewis discovers. With their messy past, surely he and Emma can stay on opposite sides of the ship and leave each other alone.They can't. Instead, they spend a sinfully hot night together. Too bad the morning after proves they separated for good reason. Even when Emma tells him she's pregnant, they decide they're better apart. Or are they? Because somehow they keep turning to each other for support. And it's clear the attraction is still there. Maybe this is their second chance — a new baby, a new chance to make this work.",
