As it turned out I was wrong, our worlds do not play well together.Tank The first night I saw Pearl, I knew I wanted her. What I was not ready for, was her fighting against this attraction we have. I want her, I don't care that she has kids, or that she doesn't know shit about the type of life I have. She thinks that the fact that she's ten years older than me is an issue... its not. But the biggest thing she's mistaken on is the fact that she thinks this thing between us is just a casual thing.
