The one thing that slows Tagg down is the tug at his heart, the girl who chose her career over him, the girl he never stopped loving.After years apart, the remarriage of mutual friends brings Marie and Tagg to the beautiful north Caribbean islands of Turks and Caicos. While the memory of lost dreams keeps them apart, sparks still fly when they’re together. For a second chance at true love, they’re going to have to learn to trust one another again, and trust is harder to build than a billion-dollar company.",
