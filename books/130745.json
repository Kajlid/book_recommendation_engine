  "description": "Orphaned Julia never expected to be sent away, especially not to the ill-named House of Mercy. But adventure awaits her in this historical journey, based on a true story. “Go home,” eleven-year-old orphan Julia Delaney is told, but home for her is gone. Spirited and strong, Julia faces a cruel life at an orphanage—the House of Mercy—blistering cold winters, and countless disappointments. But not even hopeful Julia can imagine what awaits her in Montana—and with the help of a miracle or two, she sets the sun a-sailing. Like the heroines of the beloved American Girls series, Julia’s journey paints a vivid picture of United States history. Based on the true story of a real girl, with additional details explained in an Author’s Note, The Year We Sailed the Sun is historical fiction at its best.",
