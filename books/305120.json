  "title": "The Sirtfood Diet Cookbook: Have The Taste of The Best Recipes",
  "description": "The Sirtfood Diet was initially created and named by Masters in Nutritional Medicine, Aiden Goggins, and Glen Matten. Originally their goal was to find a healthier way for people to eat but, when they did a trial of their program, people started shedding weight rapidly. Considering the millions of people around the world who are struggling to lose a single pound, it would have been incredibly selfish if this health plan was not shared with the world. The plan that these men developed focuses on the combination of certain foods, eaten in a way to maximize the delivery of nutrition to our body. It incorporates an initial, very limited stage of restricting calories to give your body a period to reset and eliminate some of the built-up waste that is damaging your body. This is followed by a maintenance phase to help you acclimatize to the new foods you’re eating and, ideally, set you up for life-long success. During all the stages, you will incorporate powerful green juices and well-structured, well-planned meals. The diet is centered around so-called “sirtfoods,” which are plant-based foods that are known to activate a gene in the human body called a sirtuin. Sirtuins belong to an entire family of proteins, labeled SIRT1 through to SIRT7 and they have unique connections to health. These proteins help insulate and protect our cells from inflammation and other damage that comes from daily operations, helping to reduce our risk of developing major diseases, especially those related to aging. Studies have shown that when people eat diets rich in these sirtuin-activating foods, they live longer, healthier lives, free from diabetes, heart disease, and even dementia. You may be interested in the diet for its weight-loss potential, but it turns out that healthy body composition is actually a natural by-product of good health. Unfortunately, most Americans eat a diet that is notably lacking in sirtfoods, which presents a clear connection to our culture of disease and dysfunctional aging. The Sirtfood Diet is not a miracle cure or even a one-week program designed to get you wedding-ready. If you’re only interested in losing a few pounds so you can take some photos for your social media accounts and then return to your old habits, there may be other diets or programs out there that will suit your needs better. The Sirtfood Diet is a blueprint to help guide you through the rest of your life, choosing delicious foods that will not just impress your taste buds but will also enhance nearly every aspect of your health. If you make the switch from a Standard American Diet (SAD) to the diet and lifestyle showcased throughout this book, you will lose any weight that your body doesn’t need. This book contains the following • Breakfast • Main Dishes • Snacks & Desserts • Side Dishes • And much more! A healthy body doesn’t store extra energy. It asks for what it needs, and it uses it effectively. Grab this now!!!",
