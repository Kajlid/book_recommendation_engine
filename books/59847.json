Dazed, traumatized, and thrust headlong into the position of a ruler, fielding fairy tales from a magician seems a waste of time.But when her cousin, Haior, begins to speak of things he couldn't possibly know, she begins to wonder. Could the tales of magical covens be true? More importantly, could these imaginings have enough basis in fact to save her people from an unnamed threat? Fantasy novella",
