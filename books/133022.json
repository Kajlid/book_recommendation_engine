  "description": "Ashton is finally free, living under the cloudy sky of the Hood Canal—without Wolfe, who is still in Augland carrying on the rebellion from the inside. At least that’s what Ashton thinks until Wolfe leads an attack at the Colony and kidnaps Jagatha.Heartbroken and once again defeated by Augland, Ashton is forced to decide whether to accept the loss and keep her freedom, or fight against the tyranny of the Suits, even if it means going back into the dome of the Augland park she fought so hard to escape.Ashton soon discovers that the levels of Augland 54’s treachery go far deeper than she ever imagined and the only way to fight it is to become another version of herself. But even with the façade, Ashton is afraid she is unsuitable to lead the rebellion. Can the workers, exhausted and unprotected, rise up against the augmented and idealized world of the Suits? All Ashton knows is that she refuses to lose anyone else. It’s time for the rise of the UnSuited.",
