  "title": "The Six Lives of Henry the Eighth: The world's most unlucky cat!",
  "description": "This charming and humorous rhyming picture book follows the mis-adventures of Henry, the accident prone runt of a litter of eight black and white cats. As we all know cats have 9 lives. Henry though gets off to a difficult start in life and soon finds himself down to 6. After an unfortunate, but tasty incident with Aunt Dolly's parrot, our rather plump and lazy house cat finds himself cast out of the family home. The story follows our unlucky hero through a series of cunning plans, adventures and mishaps as he searches for shelter and something to eat. Each adventure ends unpredictably, but with inevitably disastrous consequences for poor Henry as he uses up each of his remaining lives. Will he ever make it back home? There's only one way to find out. Ideal bedtime reading that will keep mum and dad amused too! Suitable for and tested on kids of all ages 8 to 80!",
