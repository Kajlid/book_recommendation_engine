  "title": "No More Measles: The Truth About Vaccines and Your Health",
  "description": "The doctor wants to give your child or grandchild all of the recommended vaccines, on schedule. But you have never even heard of half of those diseases, much less seen an actual case. Meanwhile, the guy who sells herbal products over the Internet claims that all vaccines are useless and dangerous. Whom should you trust? This engaging and enlightening book explains that when it comes to questions about infectious disease, you should trust your doctor. The schools of alternative medicine that are popular today have been around for 100 years or longer, but they never made a dent in the death rate from infectious disease. Alternative practitioners can do nothing to protect you against serious diseases like tetanus and diphtheria--diseases that are now almost nonexistent in the United States, thanks to vaccination. Meanwhile, the medical profession and public health authorities have driven smallpox into extinction. They have driven polio to the brink of extinction. Measles, mumps, and rubella are next in line for eradication. No More Measles! tells the fascinating stories of how diseases like smallpox shaped history. It explains how doctors and public health workers conquered those diseases. After you finish reading this book, you will know more about infectious disease than any alternative practitioner learned in school!",
