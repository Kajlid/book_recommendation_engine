She’s got it all -- or does she? Mauritian society shuns her for being single and childless, and nothing she accomplishes will ever be enough.Lars isn’t looking for a woman, but his best friend feels he needs a break from business, and contacts 1Night Stand on his behalf to arrange a date for him.Simmi isn’t looking for a man, but needs a break from the pressures she faces, so she contacts 1Night Stand and lets Madame Eve know what she needs.Despite a big storm hitting the island, both attended the date wanting just one night to forget their precarious positions in this traditional, culture-driven society. The tempest, brewed by uncalled-for yearning in their hearts and the desire for something more substantial than one night of pleasure, builds between them, while outside, a real-life cyclone storms the island and ensconces them in a world where only the two of them exist.Before the night is over, both Lars and Simmi will have to decide whether each will walk out the next morning alone, or if they can put themselves on the line to step out together.",
