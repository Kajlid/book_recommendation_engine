  "title": "Never Dream",
  "description": "Two factions of vampires fight for possession of the Book--an ancient tome that holds the secrets of turning vampires into gods. If it falls into the wrong hands, no mortal life will be untouched. As a knight from the thirteenth century, Arthur knows what it means to have a code--and it's Arthur's strict enforcement of this Code that's kept vampires safely in the realm of legend. Terry is an American attending the University of Salamanca until an accidental discovery changes everything she ever believed about her world. She has no idea what she's gotten herself into, and no idea how to get herself out. Iago's involvement was something no one could have expected or foreseen--and the truth about him will challenge even Arthur's philosophy on dismissing legend. Some lies are best believed. The battle has begun.",
