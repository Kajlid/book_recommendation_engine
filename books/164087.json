  "title": "Inspired Poetry",
  "description": "Inspired Poetry is a book of poetry written over the course of several months reflecting my internal thoughts and emotions. Each poem is influenced by my environment, life experiences, and my relationship with God. The poetry ranges from inspirational and encouraging to fictional worlds of the imagination, and pictures of everyday life. My hope is that the spiritual message in many of the poems will serve as an encouragement in times of trouble to those who read this book.",
