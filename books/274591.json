  "description": "Life in the Scythian court was never easy. Just being born royalty painted a target on Maeve's back.Despite the deadly games, failed assassination attempts, and a truly monstrous parentage, Maeve discovered her true family; her brother and her dragon. They should've been enough to protect the kingdoms from devil growing in their midst. But that's the funny thing about love, it's blind.It took one moment for Maeve to lose everything she loved, and one more for her to irrecoverably change. Sometimes to destroy a monster, one had to become something worse. Every villain has his handmaiden, and the Warlord was no exception.The fairy-tales had it wrong. Monster's weren't born, they were made.In this heart - wrenching novella of the Internationally Bestselling Series The Aermian Feuds, Maeve will set in place a rebellion that will span hundreds of years and shake the very foundation of everything you thought you knew.",
