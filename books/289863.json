  "description": "WINNER OF THE ROBERT F. KENNEDY BOOK AWARD • “A searing trip into the heart of homelessness” ( Chicago Sun-Times ) that jolted the American conscience “Jonathan’s struggle is noble. What he says must be heard. His outcry must shake our nation out of its guilty indifference.”—Elie Wiesel Jonathan Kozol is one of America’s most forceful and eloquent observers of the intersection of race, poverty, and education. His books, from the National Book Award–winning  Death at an Early Age  to the critically acclaimed  Shame of the Nation , are touchstones of the national conscience. First published in 1988 and based on the months the author spent among America’s homeless,  Rachel and Her Children  is an unforgettable record of the desperate voices of men, women, and especially children caught up in a nightmarish situation that tears at the hearts of readers. With record numbers of homeless children and adults flooding the nation’s shelters,  Rachel and Her Children  offers a look at homelessness that resonates even louder today.",
