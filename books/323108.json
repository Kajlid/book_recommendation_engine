I was sold to monsters.I should know all about how to survive monsters though, I come from a family of them.We aren't Butchers in name only, and surely the Rossi family can’t be as bad as the devil that’s been destroying me since I was eight years old.New York City, the powerful head of the Cosa Nostra, is my new home. Where Lucian, Raphael, and Gabriel Rossi now think they own me.The thing they don't realize is that I'm more than what I seem.A dahlia has always bloomed best in the light, and even though everything about this place and these men is shrouded in darkness, I’m determined to thrive…to win.They play a game for keeps, a game where the only rule is that there are no rules.They want to ruin me. But what disturbs me most is that I just might like it.It’s me against them, and only time will tell If I'll be the winner or be destroyed in these cruel and merciless Mafia Wars.",
