  "description": "With great power, there must also come great responsibility - and when those in power abuse it, it's the people's responsibility to remove them. The year is 1933, and New York City is not-so-secretly run by corrupt politicians, crooked cops, big businesses... and suave gangland bosses like New York's worst, the Goblin. But when a fateful spider-bite gives the young rabble-rouser Peter Parker the power to fight the mobster who killed his Uncle Ben, will even that be enough? It's a tangled web of Great Depression pulp, with familiar faces like you've never seen them before! By \"Hardboiled\" David Hine, Fabrice \"The Spider\" Sapolsky, and Carmine \"Carbine\" Di Giandomenico! Collects Spider-Man Noir #1-4.",
