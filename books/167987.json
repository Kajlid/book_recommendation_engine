  "title": "A Month of Sundays: Stories of Love and Loss",
  "description": "A woman contemplates suicide as her best friend lies dying. A touching graveside ritual keeps love alive. The cracks in a long-time marriage are revealed when the scotch runs out. A young couple experience the ecstasy and agony of first love. A Month of Sundays shines a light on our most vulnerable moments and finds the grace and dignity within. There is beauty in survival, in knowing we can overcome. We suffer unbearable losses, love the wrong people, and make a mess of our lives, but we go on. Some of the most important moments happen when we are raw and exposed. This collection of a dozen stories explores those dark corners that define us, the emotional spaces we prefer to avoid.",
