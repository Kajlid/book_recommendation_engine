As a respected business owner, she has no plans on becoming known around town as Stephens' Flavor Of The Month. Her plans change when, after a quick tumble in her pool with John, she realizes that denying her attraction to him is the last thing she can do. Being with Johnny was a pleasure no woman should be denied.",
