  "description": "The reviews are in! \"Highly Arousing!\" \"I want to be Mr. Edwards!\" \"What a Sensuous Read!\"  *Crack* “Thank you master!” Mr. Edwards spoke again. “I was very impressed with you tonight Abigail.” *Crack* “Oh! Thank you master!” “I know that you did not want to leave, but your desire to do the right thing was very commendable.” *Crack* “Mmmm! Thank you master!” “In addition, you arrived right on time, dressed appropriately, and have shown the proper respect for our privacy by knocking – even after seeing my note.” *Crack* “Owww… Thank you master!” Olivia winced with the last blow clearly beginning to feel the pain on her welted ass.   Abby thought she had the upper hand with boys, but not with Mr. Edwards. When she agrees to babysit for her father's boss, she makes a critical mistake and ends up literally begging the man for another chance to please him. Can she agree to his terms? Will she be able to handle his punishment? What if she likes it?",
