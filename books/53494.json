  "description": "Science Fiction With a Romantic Twist.A, A' raises a troubling question: How would you feel if your lover died--and was replaced by a clone? Could recreate your relationship with someone who was physically exactly the same but didn't share any memories of your life together? In 4/4 (Quantre-Quarts), Mori, a teenager, is flunking out of an ESP training program. But when he meets Trill, a beautiful Unicorn, his latent abilities begin to blossom!Unfortunately, Mori can't control the psyhic powers Trill stimulates in him, and Trill can't cope with the feelings Mori has set free in her! In X + Y, Hagio uses science fiction to explore questions of gender and sexual identity. Time has passed, and once again, Mori finds himself inexorably attracted to a member of the Unicorn race--but this Unicorn is male..and so is Mori!",
