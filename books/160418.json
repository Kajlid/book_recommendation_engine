  "description": "Eleven-year-old Isla has a problem: thunderstorms. Two years ago, one nightmare of an evening scarred her internally. She has feared for her life thenceforth, struggling against the post-traumatic stress controlling her mind. During a particularly grueling thunderstorm, Isla sought escape and found herself far away from home in the wilderness of unknown lands. Here she fell into company with a simpler people. A frantic flight from terror became instead a journey towards bravery; bravery acquired through her fearful battle against a kingdomâ€™s secret enemy. Will Isla succumb to the terrible power of her supernatural nemesis, or will she learn how to become the master of rather than servant to her vicious internal battles?",
