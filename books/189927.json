  "title": "Waking Up: To The Way of Love",
  "description": "Waking Up is a vulnerable 30-page expose of the personal journey the author and most who call themselves Christian find themselves on in this life. A journey full of inconsistencies that are unsustainable and eventually lead to a fractured worldview. And yet that same journey can lead to a radical rediscovery of love, peace and identity in a world blurred by confusion, unworthiness and anxiety. Also includes the first of The Forgotten Way Mediations, a 21-day journey that will change your life. \"If there is one elephant in the room among most of us who call ourselves Christian, it is that what we think and say we believe and what we actually experience are all too often two, radically different realities,\" the author writes. \"Ironically, we ourselves are often the last to see this disparity.\" We claim to be saved in the next life, but can we find peace in the storms that rise up against us in this life? The answer is an unequivocal yes. But that yes means looking at ourselves and the world around us differently which leads to a new way of being in the world. So take a look. See what millions of Christians are now seeing. This short booklet is an invitation for all who can relate with the authorâ€™s writing to take the journey themselves through A.D 33, a radical novel of discovery, and The Forgotten Way Meditations, 21 short reflections on life that will change the way you see yourself and the world.",
