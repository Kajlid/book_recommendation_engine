  "description": "Fitz-James O'Brien (1828-1862) was an author and is often considered one of the forerunners of today's science fiction. While he was in college he had shown an aptitude for writing verse, and two of his poems—\"Loch Ine\" and \"Irish Castles\"—were published in The Ballads of Ireland (1856). His earliest writings in the United States were contributed to The Lantern. Subsequently he wrote for The Home Journal, The New York Times, and The American Whig Review. His first important literary connection was with Harper's Magazine, and beginning in February 1853 with The Two Skulls, he contributed more than sixty articles in prose and verse to that periodical. He likewise wrote for the New York Saturday Press and The Atlantic Monthly. To the latter he sent \"The Diamond Lens\" (1858) and \"The Wondersmith\" (1859), which are unsurpassed as creations of the imagination, and are unique among short magazine stories. Amongst his other works are \"What Was It?\" (1889), \"My Wife's Tempter\", \"The Child Who Loved a Grave\", and \"The Golden Ingot\".",
