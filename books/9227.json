  "title": "The Snark Handbook: Sex Edition: Innuendo, Irony, and Ill-Advised Insults on Intimacy",
  "description": "According to NewYorker.com, “Lawrence Dorfman assembled a heroic collection. I spent an hour in a state of catharsis, reveling in the sufficiency of the insults,” in his previous homage to snarkdom (Insult Edition). Now just imagine the reviewer’s state after an hour reading the Sex Edition. Here are sharply witty personal observations, jokes, quotations, he-said-she-said snarks, and much more. A taste of what’s to come:     • “I’d like to meet the man who invented sex and see what he’s working on now.”—George Carlin     • “We have reason to believe that man first walked upright to free his hands for masturbation.”—Lily Tomlin     • “Bigamy is having one husband or wife too many. Monogamy is the same.”—Oscar Wilde     • A couple was lying in bed one evening, when the woman felt her husband begin to touch her in ways he hadn’t in quite some time. His fingers started at her neck, moved down her shoulders, past the side of her breast and so forth. Then he suddenly stopped, rolled over, and became silent. She said, “Honey that was wonderful. Why did you stop?” “I found the remote,” he mumbled. With the same Snark Handbook style, this latest entry in the series will titillate, amuse, and entertain.",
