  "description": "In the summer of 1860, Prince Edward Island's inhabitants eagerly await their first visit from a British royal. Molly Orland is too poor to be invited to the ball in honor of the young Prince of Wales, but she is pleased to serve as a maid in the house where he will be a guest. There she meets Peter Stark, under-steward for the royal party. Peter is attracted to the beauty of the island and to Molly, whom he's determined to shield from the antics of the playboy prince. When they discover a long-buried secret that could bring shame to Peter's royal employer, will he remain a loyal servant or help Molly's family get the justice they deserve?",
