  "title": "Reconciling Science and Faith: An Exploration of Scripture's Role in Future Technology",
  "description": "God reveals Himself to us through Scripture and His creation; if we can't discern His will, the revelation serves no-purpose. Thus, God has given us knowledge (Proverbs 2:6). Since humans have limited capacity for all knowledge, He has also given us the ultimate gift—faith.Prophecy says, \"the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord\" (Isaiah 11:9b). A question arises, \"Besides the knowledge that God has already given to the people of Isaiah’s era, what will the new knowledge be?\" It must be science/technology and their connection with faith. Human beings are created to have body, mind, and spirit into one, we should expect to see Scripture interpreted from spiritual as well as scientific perspectives. Due to a limited space allowed, please see the EXCERPT-page in author’s website http://www.reconcilingscienceandfaith....This book is to share a belief, “By accepting science, one need not refute faith, nor should the religious faithful feel a need to reject science.”",
