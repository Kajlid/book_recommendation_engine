  "description": "In Run into Blackness, Henry L. Jones leaves nothing uncovered. He shares a wealth of poetic truth in subjects such as Blackness, love & relationships, spirituality, community “a village worth saving,” and freedom. The book is biographical and historical as he openly shares his words with candor and insight. He takes you to the event and speaks on the moment with you. From that event the emotions feed him to feel the joy, pain, or loneliness which his characters felt. He believes the experiences within Run into Blackness possess universal moments that anyone can see and feel.",
