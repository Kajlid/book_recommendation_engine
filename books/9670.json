  "description": "Nothing mattered in Evan Duvall's life as much as his sexy, timid Priscilla. Her touch could destroy and resurrect with one feathery stroke. Pleasure was all they could give each other--and Priscilla gave freely. Her presumed death annihilated Evan and brought to life Strafe, the notorious road pirate. After years of loneliness, Strafe finds Priscilla alive--and changed. She's feisty, independent and sensual as hell. She may be wary of the new Strafe but her body responds with a hungry need he finds impossible to ignore. Waiting for her capitulation becomes torture, so he begins a series of inventive, erotic teasing sessions that keep her in a constant state of arousal. But to properly care for Priscilla, as well as those who've come to depend on him, the pirate must strike again.",
