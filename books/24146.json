The two women are deeply attracted to each other, but there's one big problem that's keeping their love grounded. Paula accepts a job offer across the country, and Lauren, with a debilitating fear of flying, a son deeply rooted to his friends and life in Rhode Island, and a best friend who depends on her to keep her salon up and running, is in no position to up and move. Will these two find their footing together or crash land?",
