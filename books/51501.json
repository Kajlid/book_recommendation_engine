  "description": "Will Self's DORIAN is a \"shameless imitation\" of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray that reimagines the novel in the milieu of London's early-80s art scene, which for liberated homosexuals were a golden era of sex, drugs and decadence before the AIDS epidemic struck later in the decade. It is \"an age in which appearances matter more and more and more. Only the shallowest of people won't judge by them.\"",
