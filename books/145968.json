  "description": "Grant Morrison, legendary writer of such cult smashes as The Invisibles and The Filth, and renowned artist Steve Yeowell grab the high morals of Victorian London by the throat, infect it with computer technology and expose its true perverted nature! With the escapist skills of Houdini and the laser-sharp wit of Wilde, dandy Sebastian O is out for revenge on the members of a shadowy, sordid Gentlemen's Club that had him committed to a mental institution. Hunted by assassins, rogues and scallywags, Sebastian believes he will ultimately triumph using merely his exquisite fashion sense! A superb addition to the 'steam punk' canon, Sebastian O brilliantly blends farce, wit and searing social commentary to expose the hypocrisy of Victorian class culture.",
