  "title": "Canaan Falls",
  "description": "The rest of the stories were more typical: people staying overnight and staggering out white-haired and vacant-eyed, unable to speak what horrors had changed them; apparitions at the windows and on the staircases; voices in the trees. One, particularly gruesome enough to stick in my mind, had it that a young boy had been found dead in the front yard: sitting propped up with his back against the road-facing wall, staring into forever with an expression of utter, miserable, insane horror. His fingers, supposedly, had been worn to bloody stumps at the tips, with matching streaks of gore on the inside of the front door -- as though, even to the very end, he'd been clawing to get out. All, though, just stories, not even secondhand or thirdhand but fourthhand at best, warped and bewildered by reiteration and transmission. As far as I know, nobody any of us knew had actually been inside the house.23,000 words",
