  "title": "The Cleansing",
  "description": "A shy, but quietly determined young woman, working in a small southern African town, Romance is saving furiously for the future but living a day’s journey from her village and her husband. Life appears routine.The reader is exposed to her husband’s philandering, drinking and drug excess of which she is unaware. Following an ill-fated exchange with anti-poaching rangers, he finds himself drawn into the vicious world of tsotsi gangsters.As the start of the new millennium approaches, the tension builds. Romance receives unwanted advances from male acquaintances, a visit by her husband becomes problematic, and her young English boss with whom she has established an uneasy friendship, finds himself in a situation where he is being accused of a heinous crime of which he denies all knowledge.We are taken into towns where western values and aspirations encroach, into townships where the black economy and old rituals persist and through shanty towns on city boundaries where violent gangs run vice and drugs.Whilst she is facing up to the trials and sadness a lonely New Year brings, the consequences and implications of the traditional rites of the past, still practised throughout her country and more apparently around where she lives, force her to make some life changing decisions.Connor weaves a powerful plot, full of vivid encounters and fascinating characters. He depicts the harsh reality that still faces many, particularly the women, in Africa today, but never missing those opportunities for touches of humour and moments of gentleness that allow for hope to survive in desperate circumstances.",
