  "description": "A new world, more aliens, and even more Mechs! The Skaintz Imperium was eradicated from the backwater planet of Garm, but at great cost. The population of the world was cut in half within weeks, and Garm will never be the same. At least humanity can breathe easily knowing that the mysterious aliens are all dead.... But are they? Using their natural form of communication, Skaintz radio signals did chirrup and click, however briefly. Transmissions in their ancient language now spread at the speed of light in a growing sphere, reaching farther from Garm every year. In the vast oceans of nothingness between the stars unknown things float. And they listen...MECH 2 is the story of Neu Schweitz, a planet in a system 3.2 light years from Garm. It is a beautiful world of snow-topped mountains, green valleys and nearly a billion humans struggling with piracy and politics. Soon, however, they will be struggling for their very lives.",
