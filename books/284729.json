That's when I discover the voracious, commanding man in him, my next door neighbor. And I’m enthralled -- in and out of the bedroom. Every night we explore my fantasies, and every morning I try harder not to want more from him. Because there's no item on my list about falling for the guy. Besides, we agreed to the last item already -- when we're done we walk away. But every fantasy unlocks another. Each hotter than the last. Until I discover there’s one last thing on my to-do list to check off. One so daring I can’t figure out how to ask him or what it might do to my heart… The Virgin Gift is a red hot and sexy exploration love story exploring all sorts of fantasies.",
