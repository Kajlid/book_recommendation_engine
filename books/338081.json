  "description": "Merlin is one of the most powerful names in the annals of fantasy, a name to conjure with, a name that is synonymous with Arthur, Morgan le Fay, the Lady of the Lake, Nimue, the Knights of the Round Table, Camelot and Avalon. Was he the greatest of Druids, a true caster of spells, a weaver of tales and legends, a maker of kings, or a tragic hero in his own right?Introduction (Merlin) • (1999) • essay by John HelfersOld Merlin Dancing on the Sands of Time • (1999) • poem by Jane YolenCauldron of Light • (1999) • short story by Diana L.
