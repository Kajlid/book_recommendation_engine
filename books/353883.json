Before camp is over, they’ll perform Olivia’s musical onstage and in real life—though the ending may turn out differently than either expects.Jake Wizner’s story within a story takes the battle of the sexes to a whole new level in a bawdy, uproarious romp that’s laugh-out-loud fun.From the Hardcover edition.",
