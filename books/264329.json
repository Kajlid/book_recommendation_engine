She’s attending college, getting her degree and maybe, just maybe, starting to heal.  He wasn’t supposed to be here. He wasn’t meant for her.  Colton Dawson shouldn’t look at her the way he does, shouldn’t make her feel the way he does and yet he’s holding back, keeping her at a distance.  Can she cope with being so near to Colton, but not being with him, or will this time mean losing everything……….losing him?",
