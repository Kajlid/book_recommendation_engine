  "description": "Previous scientific explanations enabled us to identify factors that are essential for the production of manifestations by diseases but many of these factors, such as the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and the many factors that cause malignant cancer, cannot be removed from our bodies by our healthcare teams to cure these diseases and millions are killed every single year by these diseases in the absence of cure. But new explanations, which are justified by their complete agreement with facts that previous explanations disagree with and their ability to explain facts that previous explanations could not, have led us to the source of these diseases, whose effects nature already dampen (reduce the strength or intensity of) to eliminate the deadly manifestations of diseases and cure them despite the presence of causes.Such reduction of the strength of the effects of this source of diseases through which nature cures without eliminating causes would explain the existence of children who harbor large amounts of the virus that causes COVID-19 without the deadly manifestations through which the disease causes death in humans who are infected with this virus and why malignant cancers are unheard of in those bats that host a large number of high profile viruses such as SARS, MERS and Ebola that are essential for the production of deadly manifestations by diseases in humans and other animals that are infected with such viruses without suffering from such manifestations themselves.These explanations reveal that diseases, including those that we refer to as infectious diseases are already present in our bodies before we are exposed to those causes (such as the coronavirus that causes COVID-19) which are only essential for the production of manifestations by diseases, and therefore that these diseases are, like cancers, chronic diseases which produce some of their manifestations in the presence of certain infectious agents. And through such revelation, they enable us to understand why some cancers such as cervical cancers and Kaposi's sarcoma in AIDS patients produce deadly manifestations in the presence of viruses.And the book in which the explanations that lead to the identification of the source of all diseases are written is titled \"The Removable Root Cause of Cancers and other Chronic Diseases\" because the manifestations through which these diseases cause death will not be produced and cure will occur when we eliminate this source from our bodies or when, as nature already does, we reduce the strength of its effects to the minimum despite the presence of factors that are essential for the production of such manifestations, factors that include the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and others which our healthcare teams cannot remove from our bodies to cure these diseases. After all, the manifestations of plants also disappear when the roots of plants are eliminated from the ground despite the presence of factors that are essential for the production of such manifestations which include those such as water that we cannot remove from the ground to produce the disappearance of these plants.This book conveys a message of hope â€” that the many causes of diseases which are essential for the production of deadly manifestations by diseases only have as much power as they get from the source of these diseases (their root cause) which the white-blooded fish of the Antarctic, that do not suffer from anemia despite the absence of red blood cells, have already removed from their bodies and the effects of which our healthcare teams will be able to dampen to cure diseases (produce the disappearance of their manifestations) without removing causes just as nature cures children who harbor large amounts of the coronavirus and those bats that host high profile viruses without experiencing any of the manifestations that these viruses cause in others who are infected with such viruses.",
