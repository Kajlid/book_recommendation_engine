  "description": "Part two of Octave Mirbeau's autobiographical trilogy, ABBE JULES tells of a priest's lifelong struggle with his passions. With the realism of Zola and the decadent vision of D'Aurevilly, and reflecting the impressionism of Monet, Pissaro and Van Gogh, Mirbeau's novel presents us with a small boy's vision of provincial France, where family, education and religion conspire to produce a petit bourgeois tortured by repressed desire, violent fantasies, and forbidden lusts.",
