  "description": "Samantha Carmichael has made a business out of shuttling secrets—drop your secret and a dollar into locker #321, and it gets anonymously delivered without being read. Samantha ensures confidentiality and discretion, and her gig is so successful that You Girl magazine has named her a finalist for Tween Entrepreneur of the Year. But when her classmate Olivia starts a secret-passing business of her own, Sam learns that imitation is not always the sincerest form of flattery. And when a secret leaks out that puts Sam’s own clandestine crush at stake, the battle of the businesses gets personal.",
