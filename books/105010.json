  "description": "Gina McKenzie is a cheerleader with a super hot boyfriend who kisses like you wouldn't believe... She's looking forward to the prom, then graduation and senior week at the shore. The only thing she isn't looking forward to is the start of college, because it means she won't be near Mike. They are attending schools on opposite sides of the state.  But Gina's normal teen life ends the night she is brutally raped by her math teacher and Mike's baseball coach. Coach Smith threatens to destroy Mike's promising baseball career if Gina tells anyone what happened. To protect Mike, Gina keeps quiet and eventually, unable to deal with the effects of the rape, breaks up with Mike. They reconnect at their 20th high school reunion where the past catches up with them and Mike learns the truth about what happened 20 years ago.",
