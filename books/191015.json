  "description": "A Poem, which began as a challenge to write a poem about a picture, that contained and image one would not expect to see deep in a forest. A poem that at some point in its composing evolved into a poem, about making the choice that is right for you.The original version of this poem, was written over two year ago, and included in a book published under my pen-name. I have always been very pleased and proud of the original poem, which was done on a challenge from two friends to write a poem to go along with a picture. While it was never my intent the poem evolved into a poem for the two of them, and their wonderful relationship.I decided to re-write the poem, and while I did not in any way change the original context of the poem, I felt that it my rewrite had made it into a poem, that all might enjoy. So with my friend's blessings, I am publishing this poem, with its new title, \"So Says the Tree\" which is more befitting of the new verse. As I intend to never charge for this poem, it will only be available for download through Smashwords.com for free. I hope that you enjoy this piece, and read it often.",
