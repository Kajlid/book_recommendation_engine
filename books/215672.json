  "title": "Stacking Stones: Stories of God's Faithfulness in Far-Off Places",
  "description": "Tom and Janine Throssel spent 13 years as missionaries to Bolivia, South America. They didn’t expect to face all that they did—dengue fever, riots, political upheaval, tragedies and heartbreak. But they didn’t expect to find what they did, either—peace, joy, miracles, perspective and a profound depth of faith. Their new book tells some of their remarkable stories as they followed their faithful God.",
