  "description": "\"The first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels...everything that is good in the modern story can be found in The Moonstone.\" Thus T.S. Eliot described this extraordinary masterpiece a novel that to this day has the power to draw the reader into its world of danger, suspense, and shocking surprise--a world whose inhabitants come from the usually ignored underside of Victorian life. The indefatigable yet completely human police inspector, Sergeant Cuff; the extremely independent young woman, Rachel Verinder; the tragic loner, Ezra Jennings--these are but a few of the unforgettable figures who make this tale of a stolen jewel, foreign menace, and violent death both a spellbinding mystery and a telling social portrait. Replete with intimations of exotic evil and occult experiences, here is a fascinating excursion into the shadows that lie just beyond the ordered landscape of English society. To read The Moonstone is to enjoy what Dorothy Sayers called \"the very finest detective story ever written.\"With a complete bibliography and an Introduction by Frederick Karl, Professor of English at New York University",
