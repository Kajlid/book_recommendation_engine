  "description": "ONCE A RAKE, ALWAYS A RAKE!Gentle Reader, always remember that-and pray that I, Meredith Merriweather, heed my own warning. For I find myself caught in a scheme to prove that the notorious \"former\" scoundrel Lord Lansing, Alexander Lamont, is just as wicked as he always has been. To complete my cautionary guidebook, which will save young ladies from suffering at the hands of cads, I am dangling my very self as bait!Now the insufferable rogue believes that I am the woman for him. Even more scandalous, my great-aunts-the matchmaking Featherton sisters-are aiding his outrageous pursuit instead of encouraging the respectable gentleman I am determined to marry. I admit that Alexander's charming smile and laughing eyes are most intriguing. But good heavens, must I always be tempted to give my heart to the type of man no proper woman should trust, let alone love?",
