  "description": "DO YOU FEEL LIKE GOD NEVER HEARS YOUR PRAYERS? This powerful yet simple to understand book tells you how to tap into God’s power, pray prayers that get answered, and see miracles in your life. Becoming A Powerful Christian is designed to resolve the problem of why God’s power is foreign to you and teaches why God earnestly desires for you to use His power. This book reveals 7 secrets of God’s power plainly taught in the Bible, readily taught in the early church, but rarely taught today. I was a weak powerless Christian who determined to find the answers to why rare few people knew God’s power in their lives. What was the secret? Did God just randomly pick certain people? Did it require a certain level of spirituality? Was it for people who were good enough, read the Bible the most, or prayed longer than others? With the promise of “seek and you shall find,” I set out on a journey to find these answers. Turns out, God wanted me to know – needed me to know – the truth. The answer shocked me. But what really took me by surprise is that rarely were these truths being taught to Christians today. Having spent nearly two decades walking in God’s power and teaching this amazing truth to others, I have seen tremendous miracles. Every member of my household experiences God’s power, and many regular people (just like me) also begin walking in the power once they learned the secrets in the Bible I will show you in this book. When others learned these secrets, they and their families were no longer victims of fate, but now respond to circumstances in life with God’s perspective, living a life of miracles and answered prayers.
