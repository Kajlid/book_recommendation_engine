This is a guide to help you when the going gets tough. It acts as a smoke detector - to help spot the early warning signs of approaching difficulty, and as a fire extinguisher - for immediate use in a crisis. It will help you to turn a business around by why businesses fail, how to spot the warning signs, key ways to stabilise your finances, how to devise a realistic recovery plan, and how to manage that plan into effective action.",
