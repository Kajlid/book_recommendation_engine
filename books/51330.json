  "title": "Evolution and the Need of Atonement",
  "description": "First published in 1914, as the second edition of a 1912 original, this book provides a detailed discussion of the relationship between evolution and the central Christian principle of atonement. Intended 'as a restatement of certain fundamental doctrines of Christianity from that point of view which the spirit of the age forces upon us', the text attempts to reconcile concepts such as sin and alienation from God with the biological focus of evolutionary theory. The process of reconciliation necessarily involves the belief that the biological aspect of human existence can be logically connected to atonement, and the metaphysical certainties entailed by it. This book will be of value to anyone with an interest in theology, philosophy and the history of science.",
