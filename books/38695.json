  "description": "‘There’s something wrong in Upfold that ought to be put right.’Who first cast Celia Wainwright in the role of Witch of Upfold, that little village in the Sussex Weald? And how and why did she disappear one night in 1953? What was the connection between her and young Julian Farnham, and why, on the day after she disappeared, did her husband suddenly leave their home at Mulberry Cottage never to return? What, in fact, is the mystery of Mulberry Cottage? Why did it remain empty for nearly ten years? And the rumours—those whispers of witchcraft and murder—are they all true?",
