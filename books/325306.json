  "description": "She’s sexy, fierce, and a loud-mouthed know-it-all…and she’s completely off limits. Cecilia isn’t your typical college student. Hell, she isn’t a college student at all, but that doesn’t stop her from applying for one of the biggest and prestigious enterprises in the Midwest. She wants it. She takes it. She doesn’t let anything get in her way when it comes to finding out the truth. When Bentley Leighton, soon-to-be CEO of Leighton Enterprises, meets “Ceci,” he’s instantly impressed. He doesn’t have time to train a new intern. However, when he sees her that first day, his intentions begin to change. He’s the boss. She’s the intern. Nothing can happen. It’s against the company rules. Then again, rules were made to be broken. What starts as innocent flirting becomes raveled up into so much more—secrets, lies, deceit.",
