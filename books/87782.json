  "description": "When everything seems to be off-kilter, the only medication that makes sense is Beach Rx . Beach Beautiful: For a year, Nell and Lucy committed to shed the pounds amassed in depression. They even developed a fool-proof approach to shop for bathing suits. But what they didn’t count on was an emergency need for cash. What they do at the beach to earn the money will have you laughing but cheering them on, too. Yesterday’s Sand: Tired of bad dates, Josie even tried to connect with a stuffy, scholastic type. Admitting the obvious mismatch, she swears off men (again) until a high school reunion takes her back to the sands of childhood, where her true love was left behind. Waves of Change: Jackie would rather die than to be seen without make-up. Endura is so codependent that everyone’s problems become hers. Claudia’s got so many fears and phobias that no one knows what to do with her, other than keep her drunk. And poor Lainie has become a prison wife. At the beach though, the four friends muster their courage, face their deepest fears and hurts and begin to dream again.",
