  "description": "A long-ago shipwreck off the California coast led the survivors to the haven they named Angel’s Bay. Their shared adversity brought fellowship and  joy . . . but also unsuspected secrets. Acclaimed  author Barbara Freethy returns to the town  where angels still keep watch, with a compelling  story of a young widow trying to find the truth  and bring closure for her son and herself.\nThe theft of three priceless paintings sent Derek Kane to prison and destroyed the dreams of his wife, Brianna. When Derek unexpectedly dies just weeks before his release, Brianna returns to Angel’s Bay with her young son, determined to prove her husband’s innocence and find the missing paintings. Her efforts are stymied by Jason Marlow, the police officer who sent Derek to jail— betraying his former friend. And when unexpected passion flares between Brianna and Jason, she must choose between the past and the present, the guilty and the innocent, the truth and the lies. For nothing is what it seems. . . .",
