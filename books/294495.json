  "description": "Savior  I started prospecting for the Blackwings MC to appease my grandfather. He raised me after my parents died, and I’d do anything for him. As it turns out, he was right. Joining the Blackwings MC was the best thing for me. Until it wasn’t. I had a personal obligation to uphold—a promise I made to a woman I’d never met—and my time with the MC was interfering with it. When she disappeared, I was consumed with anger and guilt. Thinking a change of scenery would help, the President sent me to the Devil Springs chapter to start over.  Avery  My life changed in the blink of an eye. Suddenly, I was a single parent with two small children. My friends, family, and community all came together to help me during the darkest time of my life. But, being reminded of what once was every single day was too much for me. I couldn’t move forward when I was surrounded by the past. So, I packed up my family and moved us to a new town. Things were going okay for us, until I discovered my past followed me.
