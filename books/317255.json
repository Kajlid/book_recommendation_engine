But, with a deadline and a list of romantic contenders from the past to reconnect with for her piece on dating, she is hoping one of her old sparks will turn into a new flame.Social Queue is a funny and heart-warming autistic story about deciphering the confusing signals of attraction and navigating a path to love.",
