  "description": "“Come shower with me Kitty Kat, I promise it will be better than catnip,” Bobby whispered huskily in Sawyer’s ear. “Just the two of us?” Sawyer raised her eyebrow at Bobby uncertainly as he shed his fishy clothes and stepped into the shower. “You afraid to tangle with me without a girl between us?” Bobby taunted, turning the hot shower on and lathering up. “I’m a lesbian Bobby, just cause I mixed it up with you for a few threesomes doesn’t mean I do guys,” Sawyer replied, leaning against the shower and trying to keep her eyes from wandering over Bobby’s hard muscled body. “Is that so?” Bobby turned around to face Sawyer with a challenge in his eyes as she licked her lips and sighed. “I might be a teeny bit bi,” she admitted in a whisper, kicking off her sandals and pulling her sundress over her head. “Just a teeny bit?” Bobby murmured, gazing at Sawyer hungrily as she shed her bra and underwear. “Just a teeny bit,” Sawyer whispered back as Bobby pulled her into the shower.
