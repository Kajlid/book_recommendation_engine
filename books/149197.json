Employing years of meticulous research into science and antiquity, author B.C.CHASE launches his provocative tour de force, the Paradeisia Trilogy, with a bombshell debut that will have readers clawing from page one through to the final breathtaking chapter.  What if Darwin got it wrong?What if the physical world is a facade?What if we have a sixth sense that science cannot yet explain? Don't miss the epic trilogy that fearlessly explores the furthest reaches of what's possible. If you are afraid of ideas that challenge your worldview, this book is not for you.",
