Lines were crossed.Skyler Ashcraft never could have guessed the line crossed when she drugged an injured lynx. What Bastian was didn’t even footnote in her zookeeper’s manual. But it did nearly overshadow what he hid.Secrets are like lines. They divide.Before and After. Truth or Lie.Life or Death.NOTE: New Adult is a diverse genre. 9th Life contains no sex, but the rest of the series does. Mild language throughout.
