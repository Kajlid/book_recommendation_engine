  "description": "Originally published in Russian in 2009 by AST (Moscow) and Astrel'-SPb (Saint Petersburg). The Northwestern University Press published the novel in English in spring 2013.The book is forbidden in Belarus behind the scenes, although there is no official approve. Victor Martinovich is a journalist, writer and art critic. Currently he teaches at European Humanities University. The author defines his genre as a reality-dystopia: \"You don't need to make up \"1984\" nowadays, just look around\", he says.This book is about the occuring feeling, when the phone rings at the middle of the night, and you pick up the phone to wake up right in the resounding silence on the other end. And the thought that the next call will be at your door scares you so much...that you go and open it. And you open it, knowing that people who remain silent on the phone should never be invited. The book is about the world, in which every breath is eavesdropped and numbered, every smile is registered and put into the list, the only walls' function is wiretapping and passers-by can never be random. And it's all about those invisible people, who remain silent on the phone and help this world to get into you.",
