  "title": "I Love Lord Buddha",
  "description": "I Love Lord Buddha is the transgressive, transcendent first novel that some are calling the future of literature, and others are calling a post--pornographic revolution. Set in late-90's Tokyo, it recounts the history of the Neo-Geisha Organization, a sex-and-death cult with an anticonsumerist, pro-hedonist, sub-Buddhist ideology. The novel takes its inspiration from the classical Japanese literature of the first millennium, the AUM Shinrikyo subway-gas cult, and the esoteric texts of Buddhism. Reading like manga, sounding like hard techno, feeling like fetish, I Love Lord Buddha paves the way for a new literature of undiluted aesthetics and ecstasy.",
