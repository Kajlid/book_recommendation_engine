  "description": "In the dead, dark hours, the shutters creak, footsteps can be heard on the stairs, a door begins to open - let the haunting begin! From deserted hovels to treasure-filled mansions, they prowl the night, those faceless horrors, those ghosts seeking vengeance for ancient wrongs, those demons who have claimed a clawhold in the human world. With them comes the unearthly chill of terror that can freeze a helpless victim to his very soul!From Stephen King's nightmare tale that will keep you from ever quite trusting your own closets again, to Robert Bloch's bloody solution to the enigma of Lizzie Borden, to William F. Nolan's frightening vision of evil hidden behind the mask of childhood innocence, here are seventeen masterful tales of the frights that lurk just around the corner or down the stairs, waiting only for the human imagination to set them free...HOUSE SHUDDERS",
