  "description": "The apprentice is one of fantasy's most often identified with characters, someone who is all too human, sometimes a source of humor, sometimes that one special person who will become the catalyst for pivotal events, sometimes a villain, sometimes a hero, perhaps most often a loyal sidekick. From the poignant tale of a young girl learning to \"paint\" the future to a young man who \"apprentices\" himself to the devil, here are unforgettable portraits of apprentices attempting to master their highly unusual talents.",
