And the news is already out.The ladies flee the scene to fight as best they can for their lost reputations. And to confront the man who tricked them.\nIf her reputation is false, is his?\nHazel is ruined. With no money, no near family, and the stagecoach to her old governess’s home vanishing into the distance, she is forced to accept the help of the one man she never wished to set eyes on again.To Hazel, the handsome and respected diplomat, Sir Joseph Sayle, is an infamous rake who took advantage of the princess she served. She hates his arrogance as much as his inexplicable effect on her senses. Under normal circumstances, she would never have dreamed of setting foot in his curricle, least of all when he was, by his own admission, “not entirely sober” after a night’s carousing.However, the journey in his relaxed company is unexpectedly fun, and when they reach their destination and are threatened by a parcel of eccentric children with a pistol, he enters the adventure with enthusiasm.It seems Sir Joe is much more than the man Hazel thought him. Amusing, kind, and passionate, he and his elegant pursuit provide exciting distractions to her woes.\nBut flirting with him is a dangerous game, and by the time they face the trickster responsible for her ruin, her heart is already lost.",
