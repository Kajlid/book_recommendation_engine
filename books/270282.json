  "title": "How They Made It in America",
  "description": "Immigrants have been coming to America since the beginning of the seventeenth century in pursuit of their dreams and a better life. Unfortunately in recent years, these very people who have been helping to shape the American Dream for centuries have become targets of abuse. Fiona Citkin, who immigrated to America from Ukraine, examines the individual experiences of eighteen immigrant women from around the world and from all walks of life who today serve as models of success. In sharing their unique and complex stories, Citkin demonstrates how these women succeeded in America under exceptionally difficult circumstances through drive, grit, intelligence, compassion, and leadership skills. Citkin also captures their collective wisdom and explores the values that drove them to action and success, and presents specific advice that will inspire other success seekers to follow in their footsteps. How They Made It in America shares the authentic stories of prominent multicultural female immigrants who overcame seemingly insurmountable odds to achieve success in the land of the free and the home of the brave.",
