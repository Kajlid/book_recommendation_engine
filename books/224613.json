  "description": "Shashtah thinks he has everything figured out. To prevent his new Dragon, the Prophetess of Tphah, from dying the way his first Dragon, the Phrophetess of Tkai had, he simply has to go through the secret ritual at the Anvil that the Dragonriders of Dumnonia call \"The Training.\" But the new Dragonlord, Kashon, has no experience in training a normal Pair let alone such an unusual one as Shashtah and Tphah. Plus Kashon's magic is not that of the Dumnonians; he wields the power of the Wizards of Corin. Designed by his god to be a conduit for magic, Shashtah quickly finds wizards and deities channeling a confusing array of power through him that his young Prophetess is unable to help him control. That suits the Dark One just fine. He lurks inside the shadows of Mount Cinnamar, waiting for the perfect time to add that one last bit of magic to the mix that will forge Shashtah into the most destructive weapon Centuria has ever The Dragon Sun.",
