  "description": "Halloween in New Orleans is usually a treat. But for Sabina Kane and the rest of Team Awesome, this year's celebration has its share of nasty tricks. When Brooks's new waitress goes missing, the Changeling asks Sabina to help him find her. The problem? The missing mage is one of Adam Lazarus's old flames, and having her show up in their lives is giving Sabina heartburn. Plus saving her may also threaten the fragile peace Sabina's achieved for the Dark Races. Luckily for Adam's ex -- but unlucky for her kidnappers -- Sabina Kane isn't easily spooked. Word ~19,300",
