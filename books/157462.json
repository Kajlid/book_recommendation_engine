A leg is shattered, a summer is ruined, and the troubled life of Billy Brahm goes from bad...to cursed!When the mysterious cat appears at his bedside, Billy is haunted by strange and prophetic dreams -- the creatures in them speak of Watchers, and Shadows, and the Enemy that Awakens. Does this impossible realm hold the key to healing the broken boy? Is the golden-eyed cat there to help him...or to make the nightmares come true? Too frightened to share the truth with his strict adoptive parents, Billy realizes that the only ones he can turn to are the local vet's daughter, the town's 'crazy cat lady'... and a mystical tiger, beckoning from his dreams. **This edition includes more than 20 ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATIONS, along with an EXCLUSIVE BOOK 2 PREVIEW.***The deluxe AUDIOBOOK will be available Feb 2016, featuring the incredible talents of DAVID KAYE (Last Week Tonight w/John Oliver) and TOBIAS TINKER (Broken Saints)",
