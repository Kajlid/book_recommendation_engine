  "description": "At the end of ninth grade, Lin Roberts had no idea of the drastic turn her life was going to take. Summoned to the magical world of Nouveau Monde with her closest friend Mike Jenkins, she never thought she would have to prevent a war and find a way back home before itâ€™s too late. Lin and Mike will travel through glittering palaces, strange villages and dark forests where trouble and danger lurk around every corner. Because in this world, lines of right and wrong are blurred, and the only thing you can trust is your own instincts.",
