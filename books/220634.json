  "description": "EmmeYou're not supposed to fall for your brother's best friend... but I did. He's everything I've never wanted: an artist, temperamental, and a bad boy who breaks hearts. To say he's not good for me is an understatement. My mind screams for me to stay away, but my heart--my heart isn't listening.JacksonShe's all wrong for me--and she's my best friend's little sister. She's off limits, taboo, untouchable--and she's gorgeous. I love her laugh, her sweetness, her touch. She's a temptation I need to resist--only, I really don't want to, I can't. We want to stop denying ourselves what we've found in each other--but what will everyone else say about our Discovered Truths.",
