  "title": "Navajo Weapon: The Navajo Code Talkers",
  "description": "The Navajo language-notoriously difficult to translate under the best circumstances-proved an ideal top-secret medium for confounding the Japanese in World War II and transmitting combat intelligence quickly and accurately. It was the only code that the Japanese were never able to crack. Using first-person accounts, correspondence and Marine Corps documents, this remarkable story tells how Navajo code talkers worked together to create a unique \"\"code-within-a-code,\"\" and serve their country in dangerous combat situations-a daring achievement that remained secret for twenty-four years.",
