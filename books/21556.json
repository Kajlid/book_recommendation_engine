  "description": "Medusa wants to be more like her two sisters and the other kids at Mount Olympus Academy -- immortal. Is that too much to ask? As one of the few mortals at MOA, it's hard not to get jealous when you're surrounded bybeautiful, powerful goddessgirl and godboy classmates. And it isn't easy making friends either, especially when you have snakes for hair and one mean reputation! When Medusa discovers an ad in her Teen Scrollizine for the IMMORTALIZER, a necklace that promises immortality, this lookslike it could be her best shot at the two things she covets 1) tobe as popular as the four most popular goddessgirls--Athena, Aphrodite,Persephone, and Artemis; and 2) to have her supercrush, Poseidon,finally notice her. But when the necklace brings about popularity in the totally wrong way, things go from bad to worse and Medusa fears thatshe'll never get the things she wants so much. Can this \"meanie\" turn it all around and prove that there's more to her that meets the eye?",
