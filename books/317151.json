  "description": "Sector General: A massive deep-space hospital station on the Galactic Rim, in the depths of outer space, where human and alien medicine meet. Its 384 levels and thousands of staff members who work there, human and alien both, have a single mission: To care for all patients, of all species. At Sector General, anything can happen, and frequently does. as staff work to meet the needs of any conceivable alien patient, though that capacity is always being strained as more (and stranger) alien races turn up to join the galactic community. Sentient viruses, interspecies romances, undreamed-of institutional catering problems...it all lands on Sector General's doorstep. And the only thing weirder than a hitherto unknown alien species is having a member of that species turn up in your Emergency Room.
