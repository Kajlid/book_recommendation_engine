  "description": "Grammy Award-winning vocalist Lani Hall Alpert brings the passion of her voice to the printed page, penning ten short works of fiction and non-fiction alike, all set against the living, breathing backdrop of Chicago. The characters crackle with energy: intelligent, modern women struggling to navigate the uncertain waters of adultery, therapy, cosmetic surgery, postpartum depression, and even their own sexuality. Each story is woven into the next via a winding personal narrative, as the author takes a refreshingly honest look back at her own life. Lani takes us from memories of her upbringing, through her teenage years amidst the heady heyday of 1960s Beatnik culture, and gives us a rare glimpse at the double-edged sword that is the life of an artist.",
