The support of his friends, family, and adoring college faculty leads Aiden to develop a cure. However, the lab rats being tested show the results hopped for with some adverse side effects. The rats become highly aggressive. Going as far as eating food given in seconds, endless hunger resorting to eating each other and euthanasia seems to be entirely ineffective.After a campus news piece shows the darker side of Aiden's project he worries college authorities will stop his work. While his friends plan to stop the interview from being released, Aiden hatches his own plan to show everyone his cure will work. The results in a human host are completely different than whatever could have been expected.New species of humans are created. Some are absent minded and primitive; only with a desire to eat, even humans. While most infected gain super human abilities and lose their sense of humanity and morals. The majority gain new animal instincts to hunt and eat the flesh of non-infected to increase their own attributes. Competition for flesh and the endless hunger leads to bloody gory conflicts as the virus spreads to the unlucky few it hasn't already taken.A small amount of people become something more. Those who are gifted with the infected's strength but the mentality of a human are at the top of the food chain. Only this small group possess the power to end the coming or lead it.
