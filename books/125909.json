  "description": "I have lied.I have cheated.I have given my body and my life to the man who destroyed my family and left me for dead.I have killed, I have sinned, and worst of all, I have enjoyed the misery of others.I have licked the salty tears of a father mourning his firstborn son, and nothing has ever tasted so sweet.I have died, and I have been resurrected, a phoenix from the ashes.I know I’m going to hell. I’ll burn in the fiery pits alongside Dornan and his sons for the things I’ve done, and for the things I’m about to do.But I don’t care. It will be worth every lick of the devils flames on my guilty flesh to destroy Dornan Ross.One down, six to go.",
