In this autobiography, Churchill recalls his childhood, his schooling, his years as a war correspondent in South Africa during the Boer War, and his first forays into politics as a member of Parliament. My Early Life not only gives readers insights into the shaping of a great leader but, as Churchill himself wrote, \"a picture of a vanished age.\"If you want to fully understand Winston Churchill, My Early Life is essential reading.",
