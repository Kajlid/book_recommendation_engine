  "description": "She's every man's girl next door. I'm the playboy your mother warns you about.I'm the party-boy extraordinaire and perpetual playboy of the Seattle Sockeyes. I thought this was the dream life, but after multiple poor choices, it's all gone too far and I'm about to lose everything. My reputation has been shot to hell, I'm on thin ice with the team, and I'm financially broke AF. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and I'm about to agree to the last thing an irresponsible dude like me should ever do.Darcy is the sweetheart of reality TV and every guy's girl-next-door fantasy, but her luster is fading, her show is on the chopping block, and she's now living in my condo. Did I forget to mention she's also my fake girlfriend and soon-to-be fake fianc√©? And not a fake girlfriend with benefits, but the hands-off, leave-me-alone except when the cameras are rolling girlfriend. I crave attention and notoriety. She craves stability and love. We both have our secrets...and chemistry. We have a lot of chemistry. Together we're explosive, but explosions have a way of hurting those closest to the blast. And this celebrity match made in heaven is about to detonate.",
