  "description": "In 1963, Professor Leonard Harris was on a field expedition to El Oriente and accidentally walked into the middle of a four hundred year old religious war between two prominent tribes in the area. The Huaorani (the forest dwellers) who worshipped the magnificent Jaguar as their most powerful deity, and the Quatuani (the river people) who worshipped the deadly piranha. One of those tribes believes that the white man just might be the next reincarnation of their most sacred god. The other tribe believes it too, and will stop at nothing to murder the Professor before he can fulfill his dark destiny. The question is...what does Leonard Harris believe? And is he really willing to die just to find out?The Face of an Unlikely God is a 10K word novelette that can also be found in the collection Gods & Monsters Vol. 1 by the same author.",
