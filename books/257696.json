Using characters and early chapters from his deleted novel Locomotives in Winter, Hartwell has created a beautiful, sexy story of guys who love. Hunter, a high school senior, finds himself with no place to go and ends up sharing a bed with the friend and classmate he once had abandoned. Brandon, who has been in love with Hunter since ninth grade, finds having Hunter in his bed every night leads to some surprises. After graduating, the two boys part. Years later Brandon receives an unexpected call from Hunter, who has been married twice and has a son. Now, he's come to realize Brandon was always the love of his life. Love Underneath is a multifaceted novel about human relationships. As Brandon meets Hunter's son, Ben; Ben's best friend, Taylor; Taylor's father, Case, and the gardener, Jorge, the novel takes twists and turns that intrigue and delight. As with all Hartwell fiction, the characterizations, narration, and depth of feeling leave an impact.",
