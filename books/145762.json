  "description": "Some men fall in love and hand their balls over to the first woman who keeps them interested—but not me. Surfing and my freedom are the only two things I’ve ever needed. Meaningless one-night stands are fun, but the drama and jealousy that follows them aren’t worth it. Until I met Natalie, I never realized there were women who thought like me. She enjoys sex with no strings, and with a body like that, there isn’t a man around who doesn’t want a piece of her—including me. But our friends and relatives all run in the same circles. And we all know friendship and sex leave a mess. Hearts always end up broken. I know it. But I still want her. Sometimes, the things we want don’t always come easily. Every choice, every action has consequences that can change you. They can change everything. And no matter how fiercely guarded, even the strongest hearts can break. **WARNING** Not recommended for younger readers due to sexual content, language and recreational use of marijuana.",
