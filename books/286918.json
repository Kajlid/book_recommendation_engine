Gareth Jones, a young Welsh journalist and Foreign Affairs adviser to Lloyd George, died in mysterious circumstances on the eve of his 30th birthday in 1935 in Inner Mongolia having been captured and held for ransom by bandits.  He flew with Hitler in February 1933 and a month later became the first journalist to expose the famine then raging across the Soviet Union. In telling the truth, instead of being feted, he was denigrated by other Moscow correspondents, blackballed by the British establishment and blacklisted by the Soviet secret police.  In this stunning biography Margaret Siriol Colley uses her uncle's letters, articles and diaries to create a picture of a man who was not afraid to tell the truth, whatever the cost.  This new and revised edition of More Than a Grain of Truth is a fascinating account of the life of a brave Welsh hero written by someone who knew him personally. It is also a searing social and political history of the early thirties  More Than a Grain of Truth is a fascinating account of one brave journalist and is a social history of the early thirties.
