  "description": "Celebrate Earth Day with Dr. Seuss and the Lorax in this classic picture book about protecting the environment!   I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees.   Dr. Seuss’s beloved story teaches kids to speak up and stand up for those who can’t. With a recycling-friendly “Go Green” message, The Lorax allows young readers to experience the beauty of the Truffula Trees and the danger of taking our earth for granted, all in a story that is timely, playful and hopeful. The book’s final pages teach us that just one small seed, or one small child, can make a difference.   This book is the perfect gift for Earth Day and for any child—or child at heart—who is interested in recycling, advocacy and the environment, or just loves nature and playing outside.   Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not.",
