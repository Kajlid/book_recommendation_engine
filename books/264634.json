  "title": "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood: The Poetry of Mister Rogers",
  "description": "For the first time ever, the songs from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood are collected here in a illustrated treasury.Mister Rogers' Neighborhood had a revolutionary impact on children's television, and on millions of children themselves. Through songs, puppets, and frank conversations, Mister Rogers instilled the values of kindness, patience, and self-esteem in his viewers, and most of all, taught children how loved they were, just by being themselves. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood reimagines the songs from the show as poetry, ranging from the iconic \"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\" to the forgotten gems. The poems deal with topics such as difficult feelings, new siblings, everyday routines, imagination, and more.",
