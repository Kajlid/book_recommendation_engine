  "title": "Albert J. Sterne: Future Bright, Past Imperfect",
  "description": "Three young boys on a collision course: Albert Sterne – isolated, driven and fiercely intellectual; Fletcher Ash – bright, dedicated and with a strong sense of justice; John Garrett – hurt, marginalised and determined to do to the world exactly what the world has done to him. The eleven short stories in this companion volume continue and expand on the lives of the characters from the same author’s outstandingly popular \"The Definitive Albert J. Sterne\", which should preferably be read first.",
