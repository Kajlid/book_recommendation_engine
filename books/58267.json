  "title": "Corpse: Nature, Forensics, and the Struggle to Pinpoint Time of Death",
  "description": "In this book, Sachs accompanies an eccentric group of entomologists, anthropologists, biochemists, and botanists - a new kind of biological \"Mod Squad\" - on some of their grisliest, most intractable cases. She takes us to the ultra-bizarre Body Farm in Knoxville, Tennessee, where scientists watch bodies decay in order to learn the secrets of decomposition and death. She also takes us into the courtroom, where \"post-O. J.\" forensic science as a whole is coming under fire and the new multidisciplinary art of forensic ecology is struggling to establish its credibility.\" In the end, Sachs reveals death to be not a single moment in time, but an elaborate dance, as insects and microbes colonize a corpse, and efficiently - even gracefully - return it to the earth. The story of the 2000-year search to pinpoint time of death. Corpse is also the terrible and beautiful story of what happens to our bodies when we die.",
