  "description": "From Wall Street Journal and USA Today Bestselling author Ryan Michele comes a brand new spicy contemporary romance series full of propositions and proposals.Stay-cation, that’s my kind of vacation. Only this year, my brother isn't having it.He has this great idea that we should all take a family vacation together. Not any vacation, no, we were embarking on a week long cruise. An all expenses paid trip for us all.A vacation that has one stipulation: bring a plus one.What do I do when I find myself minus a significant other?I lie, of course.One lie led to another, and suddenly the only answer is him.Mason, the man, the myth, the legend. Okay maybe not to everyone but he certainly has taken center stage in more than one of my fantasies.This whole thing is absurd, he works in my building. This could end so very badly for us both with the no fraternization policy. Yet, here we are sailing away.Maybe it’s the alcohol, or too much sun, either way I find myself getting lost in my simple proposition.The problem is we will soon return to shore.When the anchor drops where will things settle for us both?",
