  "description": "Contained in the pages of this small printed work are unapologetic texts both broad and specific in scope, telling in three parts the evolution of their architect. They range from very intimate and personal, to universal. The words presented here are intended to allow glimpses into the past and present of one man's human experience. Take from them what you will.\" '(un) SPOKEN' mines late night diners, diaper strewn alleys, and the headaches of hangover mornings for moments of beauty and meaning. These poems have the rough feel of music on vinyl. But ultimately, they are poems of hope, of counting up what was lost and gained, and deciding the things to plow under so that better seed might be sown.\"-Britton Shurley, Winner of the 2010 Kentucky Arts Council Emerging Artist Award",
