  "description": "Though reunited with her brother, and surrounded by Flint, Peter, and her newfound grandfather, Jax Mitchell has never felt more alone. After going to the city to get some much-needed answers from Lir, she is forced to leave him behind and return to the cabin—where enemies from her past await. But there are bigger things at stake than revenge, and she finds herself traveling with some unexpected companions toward a place she hoped to never see again.After being imprisoned—and tortured—on the orders of his uncle, Lir hasn’t seen daylight or linked to anyone in weeks, and the pain and loneliness is almost too much to bear. But Jax’s visit gives him renewed hope—and the strength to continue fighting his uncle's influence over the E'rikon, even when things look hopeless.While Jax and Lir fight separate battles, their missions have more in common than they realize. It’s a race against time to stop men driven by greed and power. But the ones they trust the most might be the very people working against them—and \"family\" doesn't mean what it used to. Will they recognize their friends from their enemies in time to save the people they love… or will they lose each other in the process?",
