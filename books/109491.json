  "description": "*New Adult Romance mixed with humor and garnished with a twist* Finding the perfect guy is like mixing the perfect drink. It's all about the taste and presentation.Faced with a pile of med school rejection letters and no plan B, I took a job tending bar in a beach town while living with two male roommates. All of that would have been fine if I'd had a clue what to do with my life or if my love life wasn't just as pathetic as my career path. But in the end I figured one of those things outâ€”and I also discovered his perfect drink.",
