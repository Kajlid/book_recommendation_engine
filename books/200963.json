  "description": "In art and in love, it s the rough edges that make things interesting.Having grown up with artistic implements always in hand, there's almost nothing Austin can't make real. Except for one thingâ€”an official relationship with his best friend, rowing teammate and occasional hookup, Vinnie.The combination of emotional and sexual frustration fuels a spark between Austin and the nude model in his drawing class. Austin isn't used to having trouble focusing; models are merely challenging subjects to be rendered on paper. But the geology TA's direct blue gaze is powerful enough to drag Austin's focus away from his physique.After a quick and very dirty post-class encounter, all the reasons that Austin has been waiting for his best friend go fuzzy in his mind. Sean is nothing like Vinnie. Sean is persistent, pays attention, and makes it clear he wants to be together.But if Austin can't get his head and his heart on the same page, he could lose his friend, or his lover. Or both.Warning: Contains rock geeks, tent sex, a dictatorial cox whose idea of a good time is drawing naked dudes, plus one naked dude who wants to be more than a good time.",
