  "description": "Bookshop assistant Aurora \"Rory\" Hawthorn thinks reality will never be as interesting as fiction. Content to spend her time escaping into a good book to escape her micromanaging boss, the very last thing she expects is to be cornered by a group of terrifying strangers hunting down a journal that belonged to her late father.  It turns out Dad was keeping a secret or twoâ€¦ most importantly, that he was a wizard, and that Rory has a hidden magical family she's never met. When her witchy relatives invite her to live with them in their enchanted library, it's literally a dream come true.  Until she stumbles upon a dead body hidden behind a bookshelf.  Juggling a new family and job would be enough of a challenge without also having to deal with a murder mystery, cranky familiars, and the attention of the local reaper -- even if he is the hottest guy in town.  It's up to Rory to embrace her new witchy powers to help catch a killer before she loses the new life she never knew she wanted.",
