  "description": "It's all fun and games until egos get hurt. \nAfter a year of a seemingly happily-ever-after, Troy Babilonia throws a curve ball that smacks Larson Blackburn right in the head. When Troy's debut novel, \"Bridge to Lonely,\" threatens to overshadow Larson's own success, inviting a past shadow into the light of their present, the two alphas must learn to adjust. \"Bridge to Lonely\" has garnered an unexpected success both in the literary world and in the film industry, forcing Larson to accept that he is not the only successful author in the building. But as Troy's old flame decides to make an appearance, the two alphas are forced to test the strength of their love. Let the battle of the egos recommence; where sarcasm is the preferred weapon, and the testosterone levels go beyond the boiling point. \nBecause Black Balled just wasn't enough...Smith & LeNoir bring you Hard Edit.\nAdult Content18+",
