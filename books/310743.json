  "description": "The only daughter of a retired wizard and human mother, Alexandra's a fiery young woman who's proud of her half-blood status. She's up to any venture, even when she's summoned by a foreign prince claiming only she can help him with an impending threat.She leaves behind her beloved homeland, taking only her bow and trusty horse, Zhan. She travels to the country of Shelkite. And though she’s met warmly by Prince Alkin, she’s met with disdain by his bitter, right-hand man—Master Sword Bryan.Through grassy foothills where her dreams seem to tell the future, through an ancient wood where the tiniest magic still lives, to the sea in search of reclusive merpeople, and to an unstable, mystical forest her company treks—learning and growing alongside each other.Alexandra may have taken on more than she prefers to handle, but among the hardships and mounting romantic troubles, she knows she has to press on. For whether she does or not, she’s the key—either for good or evil.Previously published under the author name Alicia R. Leslie.",
