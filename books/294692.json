  "title": "Beyond Good and Evil",
  "description": "One of the most remarkable and influential books of the nineteenth century—Nietzsche's attempt to sum up his philosophy.In nine parts the book is designed to give the reader a comprehensive idea of Nietzsche's thought and style:  they span \"The Prejudices of Philsophers,\" \"The Free Spirit,\" religion, morals, scholarship, \"Our Virtues,\" \"Peoples and Fatherlands,\" and \"What Is Noble,\" as well as epigrams and a concluding poem.     This translation by Walter Kaufmann has become the standard one, for accuracy and fidelity to the eccentricities and grace of the style of the original.  The translation is based on the only edition Nietzsche himself published, and all variant reading in later editions.  This volume offers an inclusive index of subjects and persons, as well as a running footnote commentary on the text.",
