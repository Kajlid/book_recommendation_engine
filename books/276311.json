The German war machine is set free. Can the Black Knights stop the Luftwaffe in the skies over Britain? The Black Knights fought the Japanese over the Philippines. They took the fight to Tokyo. They tried to defend Wake Island. Now, They're half-way around the world taking on another impossible task, the defense of Great Britain herself. Britain must stand. Without Britain the war is lost.

So, now she must lead her squadron in their greatest challenge, defending Great Britain from German jets. She must stop the Luftwaffe while defending her right to fly the best combat aircraft ever made, the F-14 Tomcat.",
