  "title": "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell",
  "description": "In the midst of the Napoleonic Wars in 1806, most people believe magic to have long since disappeared from England until the reclusive Mr. Norrell reveals his powers and becomes an overnight celebrity. Another practicing magician then emerges: the young and daring Jonathan Strange. He becomes Norrell's pupil, and the two join forces in the war against France. But Strange is increasingly drawn to the wild, most perilous forms of magic, and he soon risks sacrificing not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything else he holds dear. Susanna Clarke's brilliant first novel is an utterly compelling epic tale of nineteenth-century England and the two magicians who, first as teacher and pupil and then as rivals, emerge to change its history.The international bestseller, reissued with a striking new illustrated cover and introduction by Neil Gaiman.",
