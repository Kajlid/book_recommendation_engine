  "title": "The Duel",
  "description": "First published in 1891, this morality tale pits a zoologist scientist, a government worker, his mistress, a deacon, and a physician against one another in a verbal battle of wits and ethics that explodes into a violent contest: the duel. When Laevsky, a lazy youth who works for the government, tires of his dependent mistress, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, Von Koren, the zoologist, delivers a scathing critique of Laevsky’s egotism, forcing the young man to examine his soul. \"Of a truth, the right hand of God has planted this vine! Lord! Lord! One man vanquishes thousands and another tens of thousands. Nikolay Vassilitch,\" he said ecstatically, \"let me tell you that to-day you have conquered the greatest of man's enemies--pride.\"The Duel is a tale of human morality weakness, the possibility of forgiveness, and a man’s ultimate ability to change his ways. It is classic Anton Chekhov, revealing the multifaceted essence of human nature.",
