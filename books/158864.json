  "description": "Fox Arada needs a couple days off from the daily battle of his life. Instead? A terrified woman appeared at his hotel door followed by the men trying to kill her. Fox--a kitsune, and the best Watcher at Enoch, Kincaid, and Sage--reacts with deadly force against the men, but in doing so reveals his secret to the woman. Now, they must both face the consequences of his forbidden actions. Reluctant to kill or turn her in, he kidnaps her until he can determine why she fascinates him. Jubilee Spector wanted her brother off drugs. Ratting out the local drug dealers and busting their operation seemed like a good idea until one of them attacked her and she had to run for her life. When the most gorgeous man she's ever met cuts down the dealer with tooth and claw, she's introduced to a dark and dangerous world where demons, nephilim and humans work together to preserve the balance between heaven and hell. Neither knows that she holds a secret so dangerous it will change the world of the Watchers forever...",
