  "description": "Being a second-timer, a mature single, is something of a minefield, not for the faint of heart. Pack a guidebook. Pack this one    A brisk, practical, and occasionally very funny how-to book aimed at a fairly niche readership, the autumn rose, the mature single woman enjoying her Indian summer, the SWOFTY - single woman over fifty.   For every person who has asked if there will be a follow-up to A Second Rainbow there are ten asking about the realities of this oddly unreal life, on-line dating for the second-timer. Is there real interest in older women? What are the men like? What do you talk about? Aren’t you afraid of being scammed?  So here it is, the pitfalls, trials and tribulations of being mature and heading back into the singles game. It isn’t a sex manual, because life simply isn’t long enough to research all of the options which a couple with a combined age topping a century could discover, explore, or teach each other. It’s more a starter kit covering ways of meeting people - mainly, but not only, interesting people of the male persuasion - and a few handy signposts to avoid bad experiences. That old saying, you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you meet your prince – well, this book is mainly about the frogs.  You do need courage and sensible expectations, some common sense and, of course, GSOH. There’s a list of the commonest abbreviations, and that’s probably the commonest of them all, everyone in the dating world professes to have that good sense of humour. They’re also honest, attractive, honest, caring, honest, loving, honest and – did I mention honest?",
