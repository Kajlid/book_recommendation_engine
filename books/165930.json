  "description": "The 1964-1965 New York World's Fair was the largest international exhibition ever built in the United States.More than one hundred fifty pavilions and exhibits spread over six hundred forty-six acres helped the fair live up to its reputation as \"the Billion-Dollar Fair.\" With the cold war in full swing, the fair offered visitors a refreshingly positive view of the future, mirroring the official Peace through Understanding. Guests could travel back in time through a display of full-sized dinosaurs, or look into a future where underwater hotels and flying cars were commonplace. They could enjoy Walt Disney's popular shows, or study actual spacecraft flown in orbit. More than fifty-one million guests visited the fair before it closed forever in 1965. The 1964-1965 New York World's Fair captures the history of this event through vintage photographs, published here for the first time.",
