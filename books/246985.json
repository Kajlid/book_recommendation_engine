  "description": "While history has immortalized George Washington, it has largely forgotten those who helped to propel him to greatness--the thirty-two men who served as his aides-de-camp during the Revolutionary War. Washington relied heavily on these men--among them a young Alexander Hamilton--for help in formulating policy and strategy. George Washington's Indispensable Men details the fascinating and sometimes tragic lives of these aides, providing a new and refreshing look at the American Revolution.",
