  "description": "He arrives all dressed in black. Diamond cufflinks. A watch on his tanned wrist that cost more than we would ever see in a lifetime of work. He carries a single red rose for my mother.Months later, Tiernan Morelli lays red roses on my mother’s grave. That same day, he tells me that he is my new guardian.I should have known from the very start that he had more in common with the thorns than the rose. Now I know the truth: I’m a pawn in his dangerous game of revenge. I was too young and naive. Now it's too late to save myself from his clutches.Now I belong to him.",
