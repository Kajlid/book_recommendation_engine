Like all of her siblings, she takes her turn with every duty rotation - including saving the lives of sailors when a ship comes under distress.

Charged with a god-given duty to bring sinners to justice, his magic-imbued sword sends his victims to the next life with clean souls - and leaves the sinner’s family struck with a glamour that leaves them falling over themselves to thank their loved ones’ executioner. When his interest in piqued by a mermaid that saves his life, he is disgusted to find her affection for him intense, sudden, and blind - a result of his curse, not true attraction. He’s determined to have nothing more to do with her.

A hamadryad with a prophecy. A witch with a chip on her shoulder. The world is full of magic and mayhem and for an angel and a mermaid, it will take more than a kiss to balance... the Divine Scales.",
