  "description": "Do the events in our lives have any influence on the type of person we become? For Daniel Vesta, a self-described bully who terrorizes his classmates, they do. Daniel delights in torturing and exploiting people that he sees as being weaker than himself-even those people that he considers to be his buddies. The only person that Daniel connects with is Randy, a guy he's known all his life and a guy who is not afraid to stand up to him. When a wilderness challenge goes fatally wrong, Daniel must face the death of his best friend and come to terms with the suspicions he has that Randy's death may have been his fault.",
