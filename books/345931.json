  "title": "The Story of the Grail and the Passing of Arthur",
  "description": "Generations of children have thrilled to Howard Pyle's skillful retelling of the legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. This book is one of the best of the series — a rich chronicle that includes the stirring adventures of Sir Galahad and the pursuit of the Holy Grail as well as the last chapter in the life of King Arthur.The book begins with the exciting story of Sir Geraint — how he fought with the knights of the Sparrow-Hawk, how he set right the wrongs of the earldom, how he destroyed three giants of the highway and more. The narrative then takes up the thrilling exploits of Sir Galahad (\"the most perfect knight who ever lived\"): his initiation into knighthood, how he came to the court of King Arthur and his quest for the Holy Grail. Finally, there are the last chapters in the life of King Arthur — his attack on Sir Lancelot, his fatal battle with Sir Mordred and Arthur's final journey to Avalon.Recounted in language appropriately medieval in flavor and enhanced with 39 of Howard Pyle's richly atmospheric illustrations, these tales promise a splendid reading experience — a magical journey to a far-off time and a bygone world of knightly valor and chivalric romance.",
