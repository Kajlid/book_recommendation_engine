Twelve-year-old Marco knows he is being trained for something, but he isn't sure what. All his life he has traveled with his father in secrecy, learning many languages and the ways of a gentleman, but forbidden to speak about their country of origin, Samavia.

But now, there is hope that peace may come at last, as it has been rumored that a descendant of the lost prince may have been found.",
