  "description": "Kenna MacGregor was raised to believe that music is the language of the soul. That life is a song, pulsing with beats and rhythms, harmonizing the inner spirit with the energy of the universe. In a fated moment, she discovers the one person whose music reaches deep into her being, speaking to her in ways no one else ever could.He is the dominating, larger-than-life, in-your-face Phil Deveraux. He's the lead singer of her favorite band; her adolescent fantasy.She is just a face in the crowd. A face that Phil is destined to see, and would never forget.Lips touch, igniting an inferno-hot passion, melting two souls together in ways neither could foresee. Time stands still for these two, while life relentlessly moves forward for them both.",
