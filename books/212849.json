  "description": "Conall Víga-Feilan, direct descendent of Viking shifters, never thought that he'd meet a female strong enough to be his mate. He especially didn't think that a short, viper-tongued human would ever fit the bill.  But Miki Kendrick isn't some average human. With an IQ off the charts and a special skill with weapons of all kinds, Miki brings the big blond pooch to his knees—and keeps him there. Miki's way too smart to ever believe in love, and she knows that a guy like Conall could only want one thing from her. But with the Pack's enemies on her tail and a few days stuck alone with the one man who makes her absolutely wild, Miki is about to discover how persistent one Viking wolf can be.",
