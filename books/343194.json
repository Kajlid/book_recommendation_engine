  "title": "Pogo: We Have Met the Enemy and He is Us",
  "description": "This is one of the late Pogo books, from the early 70s, and captures all the best there is of Pogo. It has a gentle mood, but still makes its points about our wasteful society (and who to blame). It also lampoons the political figures of the day, seriously, but with a light touch that today's cartoonists can't match. Pogo is one of the best-loved comics ever, and this book shows why. Enjoy!",
