Heartsick, he escapes to Earth to mourn.Nothing gets the biological clock ticking (and elders lecturing) like almost dying in battle, so Maya, princess of the water djinns, travels to Earth for some no-strings-attached sex to fulfill her duty and produce an heir. But the beautiful and tough warrior gets more than she bargained for when she meets Shay.Their not-so-simple one-night stand is interrupted by assassins and the world, as they know it, is changed forever. As Maya and Shay pull together to survive, both are determined to have their happily-ever-after and bring peace to their worlds â€” warring families, shadow assassins, and nosy busybodies be damned.*** Fifty percent of every purchase is donated to UNICEF in memory of Mina's father***",
