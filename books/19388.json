Will Caterpillar be safe? Will he be warm? Will he stay dry? Throughout the long winter, Caterpillar reassures him that all is fine. But the day comes when Caterpillar's cocoon is empty and Bear begins worrying all over again. Until a beautiful silk moth lands on his paw. \"Don't worry, Bear,\" he says. \"I'm right here.\" Incredibly touching in its simplicity, Don't Worry Bear reveals the very heart of friendship.",
