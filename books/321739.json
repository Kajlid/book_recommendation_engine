  "description": "Sometimes befriending the enemy is the only option.After losing my family, I’ve spent the last seven years hunting the monsters who killed them. I know my purpose and what I want most in this world. At least I did until a striking vampire shows up just in time for the threats to begin.Maciah West makes me feel ways I shouldn’t and tells me things that can’t be possible. I don’t want to believe him, but as my past finds its way back into the present, I don’t really have a choice.Even as I begin to accept the new changes in my life—and my growing feelings for Maciah—I don’t let that deter me from my goals. I’m still a vampire hunter and I’ll do whatever it takes to get the vengeance I’ve been fighting for.No matter how many vampires are out for my blood.Fans of Linsey Hall, Heather Hildenbrand, and slow burn Paranormal Romance will devour this new book! If you love intrigue, strong heroines, and protective males, then you don’t want to miss Vampire Heir!***This is the third series in Heather Renee's Mystics and Mayhem universe, but it can be read on its own as there are no spoilers to prior books, only fun cameos!***",
