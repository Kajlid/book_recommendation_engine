Seeing beyond his physical attributes allowed me to understand that the man beneath all the muscles was a compassionate, kind, and understanding romantic. I wanted him so bad I could taste it. There was only one real problem.  He was an inmate in prison.  And, I was a prison guard.  TATE - Bobbi Madden was gorgeous. We talked every day for two months.

This is a HEA novel with no cliffhanger.",
