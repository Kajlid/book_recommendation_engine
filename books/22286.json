  "description": "In 1959 Newsweek reported of a young Zen monk and scholar threatening to shake Japanese Buddhism out of its lethargy by publishing the \"secret answers\" to the koan. Though he never did take that step, Akizuki Ryomin did make good on his promise to devote himself to \"breaking the formalism that constricts Zen and exposing the fake masters.\" Now, many years later, he brings his ideas on reform together into a proclamation of a \"New Mahayana.\".",
