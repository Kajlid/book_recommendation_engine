  "title": "The Murder of Aziz Khan",
  "description": "First published in London in 1967, The Murder of Aziz Khan has acquired an important place in the history of English language Pakistani literature. It presents a picture of Pakistani society in its earliest years in the persons of Aziz Khan, who represents ancient and traditional values, and the Shah brothers, who are out to exploit the resources and the people of the new country for their personal gain. The story is built around this central conflict. The Shah brothers are determined to possess Aziz Khanâ€™s land, which he refuses to sell. Intricately plotted, the story gradually unfolds, revealing the emotions of its characters; it exposes the ruthless brutality of the Shah brothers and the effects of moral corruption on them; and finally, in brilliant prose imbued with an astonishing poetic intensity, the book describes the suffering of Aziz Khan with such poignancy that it seems a symbolic vision of a wound in the heart of the new nation.",
