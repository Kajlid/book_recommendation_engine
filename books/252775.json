  "description": "It's a tiki murder mystery in the tropical heart of Trois-Rivières! When a former limbo champion is found dead in her apartment, the local police force finds no reason to suspect foul play. But amateur detective (and bookworm barmaid extraordinaire) Marie-Pomme knows there's more to this case than just too much piña colada... and she intends to prove it, even if it means risking her own life at the bowling alley! The Pineapples of Wrath is a quirky detective story as well as a loving tribute to tiki kitsch and old school exotica. Cathon's exuberant art has both the vibrant tone of a steel guitar solo and the refreshing feel of a tropical drink topped with a toothpick umbrella. So sit back, relax and enjoy this insanely funny story set in the imaginary Hawaiian neighborhood of sunny Trois-Rivières, Québec.",
