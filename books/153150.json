  "title": "Descent Unto Dark",
  "description": "The Dark has been unleashed. Impervious to mage or man, its almighty power is only matched by its hunger. Unchecked it will devour the planet . . . until even the dawn is extinguished. Human and creature alike will become twisted, beasts slaved to the Dark's will. The leash is held by the Harbinger Master, who requires a simple offering to stay the impending slaughter. Obedience Absolute. But the nations of Earth have proven their will to fight, and by revealing magic to them the Oracle has ensured they will. Now she must reunite the mage and human worldsâ€”before the Master retaliates. Facing supreme foes and the end of mankind, she needs allies. She needs an army . . .",
