  "title": "The Mystic in the Theatre: Eleonora Duse",
  "description": "While Eva Le Gallienne's approach to Eleonora Duse is reverent, it is also scholarly, stylishly written, and considering her personal debt to Duse, remarkably objective. She disposes of the hard-dying myth that the great Italian actress played simply on the inspiration of the moment. Miss Le Gallienne's thesis is that Duse's artistic triumphs resulted from her victories over herself, triumphs of character achieved through intellectual and spiritual struggle. In support of her title Miss Le Gallienne adduces evidence of Duse's long and earnest study of the writings of mystics and philosophers. This book is thoughtful, sensible, candid and literate. Miss Le Gallienne's own memories provide a fascinating glimpse into both herself and the tired, fading great actress whom she adored.",
