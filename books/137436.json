  "description": "From Library Journal:Jo Epstein (Ask the Dead), a New York performance poet and PI, is hired by her emigr√© stepfather, Nikolai, to prove him innocent of murder. The trail of evidence to clear Nikolai is almost nonexistent since he will not explain anything to Jo. Then Nikolai leaves New York as the bad guys close in, and Jo follows him to Moscow. VERDICT Intricately layered like the Russian nested doll of the title, this tale of vengeance and hatred flavored with a Russian cultural backdrop will appeal to readers who enjoy unusual mysteries with an international setting.",
