  "description": "He never wanted to be anyone’s hero…Some would call me irrevocably broken. I submerge myself in long work hours by day and debauchery at The Wicked Horse by night, using those things to numb the pain and guilt I feel over the death of my wife. What isn’t satisfied by one will surely be resolved by the other. At least that’s how I’ve survived the last few years.But things change when Hannah Madigan shows up at my door, the newest employee sent by the company that cleans my apartment. Beat down by life, not to mention a cheating husband who was unfairly awarded custody of their daughter, Hannah is determined to make a better life for herself and get her kid back, even if it means working three jobs to do so. One costly mistake puts Hannah in my debt, and I’m not about to let the chance to have this dark-haired beauty pass me by.She’s given a golden opportunity…Determined to stay the course by any means necessary, Hannah accepts my less than professional offer. I’ll give her a job. She’ll give me her body. Sounds easy, right? Until the scales tip and I find myself needing her in ways I’m not ready to admit. Until I find that saving someone else may just mean allowing myself to be saved in return.",
