  "description": "A fun and clever laugh-out-loud romantic comedy from award-winning author & Rita finalist Jennifer Archer…J.T. Drake: It’s not easy to seduce a woman who can’t see me. But if I weren’t invisible, prim and proper Rosy Peabody would probably have even less of an interest in me. At least as her science experiment, I have her undivided attention and unlimited opportunities to try to win her affection . . . or to at least make her blush that pretty shade of pink that tells me I’ve sparked her temper. So maybe I shouldn’t be in such a hurry to have my image restored . . .Rosy Peabody: It’s not easy to ignore my tingling nerve-endings whenever J.T. and I touch. I keep telling myself that they’re only the after-effects of his electrified state, but lately, just the thought of him provokes the same reaction in me. I wouldn’t give a cocky guy like J.T. a moment of my time if not for the fact that I’m partially responsible for his condition . . . and quite possibly the only person capable of reversing it. And now I can’t help wondering . . . if J.T. ever materializes, will our sizzling chemistry disappear . . . or spark a little flame?",
