  "description": "Filled with engaging stories and astonishing facts, From Underground Railroad to Rebel Refuge examines the role of Canadians in the American Civil WarDespite all we know about the Civil War, its causes, battles, characters, issues, impacts, and legacy, few books have explored Canadaâ€™s role in the bloody conflict that claimed more than 600,000 lives.A surprising 20 thousand Canadians went south to take up arms on both sides of the conflict, while thousands of enslaved people, draft dodgers, deserters, recruiters, plotters, and spies fled northward to take shelter in the attic that is Canada. Though many escaped slavery and found safety through the Underground Railroad, they were later joined by KKK members wanted for murder. Confederate President Jefferson Davis along with several of his emissaries and generals found refuge on Canadian soil, and many plantation owners moved north of the border.Award-winning journalist Brian Martin will open eyes in both Canada and the United States about how the two countries and their citizens interacted during the Civil War and the troubled times that surrounded it.",
