But when the notorious outlaw biker club, The Soul Eaters show up and reward the victor with his new cut and membership in the bloodthirsty gang she can’t believe her eyes. Everyone has said the price of membership is the killing of another human being but she would have never believed it until that night. What was even more astonishing, what rocked her to the core was when she learned the identity of the victor.  Kim thought she had it all with her new boyfriend Sheriff’s Deputy Marc Long—that was until she met Seth, the ruthlessly handsome and violent member of the Soul Eaters. But the more she gets to know Seth the more she realizes there is so much more to the man than just the hardened gun-running criminal biker.  When Kim’s long lost brother literally explodes back into her life she is forced to reexamine everything she thinks she knows about the Soul Eaters MC and the extended family they protect. Can she reconcile her brother’s betrayal and accept who he has become or will she lose what’s left of her family, her heart—her Seth?  First book in the Soul Eaters MC novel series. Content suitable for mature readers, contains violence and sexual content.",
