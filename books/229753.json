  "description": "[Siren Classic Erotic Alternative Fantasy Paranormal Romance, M/M, fae, gods, HEA] Yves is the second-born son of the late Fire Kingdom. He has lived his life battling constant restlessness and depression. He had always felt as though there was more, that there was something out there for him. His art was the only way he used to escape from his head. Norse god Apollo had been promised a mate. He just never imagined how long he'd have to wait for that promise to be fulfilled. Centuries passed but no mate showed up, more centuries passed until, finally, he felt the spark, a difference, and he knew...his mate had finally been born. From afar, he watched over his mate, saw the changes in the man and the struggles until it became more than the other man could withstand. Apollo then relocated to the Fae world to draw away his repressed emotions from his mate. He never intended to meet his mate until the coming out party, but a chance meeting changed all that, and soon they had to battle Yves doubts and insecurities before they could ever glean a bit of happiness. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
