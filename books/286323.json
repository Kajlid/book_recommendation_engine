  "description": "After enduring a severe panic attack which left the author attached to breathing machines around foreign doctors in South Korea, Panorama—the missing chapter for the memoir, Views from the The Journey of a Son, expands on the author’s experiences working and living abroad in Seoul, South Korea.After a friendship ignites and morphs into an awe-struck, curious tale of parallel souls with a Brazilian-American soldier serving in the military at the North Korean border protecting South Korea from Kim Jong-il, Panorama reflects on the author’s contemplations to return to a crumbling family life in Los Angeles or to endure his life in Seoul for an end-of-contract cash payout.In Panorama, the author broadens his stance on the importance of moments spotlighting loneliness and exposing the perks and ailments of escapism. With precise prose and a thought-provoking connected storyline that covers eating living octopus, philosophical debates about the gender of God, a surprise pregnancy, biphobia, and bisexual erasure, Panorama, stands tall as a connected yet separate, compelling story while taking aim at identity politics in America. The author reminds us again, that as daunting as the vicissitudes of life, and no matter the view from the cockpit of life, the human spirit cannot be restrained in loss, or love, and strives to be unbroken—and free.",
