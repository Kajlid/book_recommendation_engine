Never one to coast on her family's connections, her real dream is to help charities in a bigger way.

Helping her with the investigation is a no-brainer. But going up against a seedy network of money and influence isn't just a romantic opportunity or a chance to grab the headline that will take him into the big time—it's a gamble that could destroy his blog's reputation.As Liam and Alyse dig deeper, their hearts collide alongside their ambition. Will they choose love or politics? Because in Washington, everything comes at a price.70,000 words",
