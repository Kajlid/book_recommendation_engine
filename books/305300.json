They are dubbed Guardians by the humans and fae who live on the fringes of society, those who survive in neighborhoods the police don't care about. But when a Guardian is accused of murder, their reputation blackens—from vigilante heroes to underhanded criminals. Mason promised to return from France with the one weapon capable of killing the formidable witch who was reborn from the bloodstone, but no one has heard from him in months. Now Polina gathers forces, and Kyra has no backup as she tries to solve a murder and face off against new and terrifying monsters…all while caring for her growing menagerie of extraordinary critters. A new adventure in the Inbetween, where magic is the only rule of law. Hell Hounds Don’t Heel is the third book in the Valkyrie Bestiary Series.",
