  "title": "American Gaslighting: How America is Being Systematically Taught to Hate Itself",
  "description": "Holy Moses! We have been deceived!Pervasive propaganda paints America as systemically and irredeemably racist. Americans are being purposefully deceived into believing that our American Constitution is a relic of the past and must be reinterpreted with the times. They are being conditioned to \"burn it down.\" What will replace it? The answer should concern every freedom-loving American. The book explains the threats facing our nation, the tools used to divide us, a retracing of how we arrived at our current situation, an assessment of who is most culpable for our present state, and what to do to stop it. American Gaslighting exposes the psychological techniques that are particularly effective against people who don't routinely exercise critical thinking skills. American Gaslighting sets the historical record straight. It is a vital read for informing every American that receives only a steady diet of America-hating propaganda.",
