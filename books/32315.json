  "title": "The Nature of Good and Evil",
  "description": "We constantly see the \"senseless violence\" in our world, and it begs the question: \"How can an all-loving God allow this to exist?\" Indeed, many people simply reject any notion of God for this very reason. This book, the third in Sylvia Browne's Journey of the Soul series, gives you the philosohical framework to understand the nature of good and eviland the role of God in the big picture. When you see how evil originated and why it thrives in our world, you're more prepared to face it and overcome it. Sylvia points out that you need not fear \"evil spirits\" or \"curses\"which are merely stories bred from ignorance. And how would you like to serve as one of God's warriors of Light? Sylvia explains how to enlist! By combining her philosophical and theological views, Sylvia creates a spiritual umbrella that rises above traditional religion. All paths that lead to knowing God have meritSylvia simply invites you to know Him/Her in your own way, free of dogma and fear.",
