  "description": "Years ago, I lost the two most important people in my life in a tragic accident. The event left me scarred in more ways than one. Since then, I've become a recluse. If I let no one close, then I won't fail again, like I did with my family. The mountain I live on is the only solace I allow myself. But then Gwen and her mute daughter and rambunctious son came along. Stranded on the side of the road during a snowstorm, I was forced to take them in. It took only three days. No matter how gruff and withdrawn I was or how much I pushed them away, I became attached. I couldn't keep them. But when the snow melts, how can I possibly let them go when they make my cold, dead heart beat again?PLEASE This was previously published as Whispered Prayers of a Girl. It has been re-titled and re-covered. The story is the same. Please check the author's website for a list of warnings.",
