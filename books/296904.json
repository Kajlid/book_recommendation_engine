But he’s evil.And with each chart topping song and album and worldwide tour he’s raking it in while I’m left singing in a female barber shop quartet trying to make ends meet.Then the call of my life comes in.I’m booked for real studio time.I show up... and I’m supposed to sing backing vocals for Filthy Line.Which means I’m in the f*ckin studio with Reed.Mr. cocky rocky kiss my 'you know what' if he thinks he can smooth his way with me... think again.I’m not some groupie.I’m trying to make a name for myself.Yet he won’t leave me alone.Forget about the smoldering look in his eyes.Forget about what he does when he finds out what I do for a living.This rock star is on my tail and next thing I know my greatest enemy wants me between the sheets.Hey, maybe this can work out... or maybe I’ll finally get a chance to give him a taste of his own medicine...",
