  "description": "One of Soren Kierkegaard's most important writings, Works of Love is a profound examination of the human heart, in which the great philosopher conducts the reader into the inmost secrets of Love. \"Deep within every man,\" Kierkegaard writes, \"there lies the dread of being alone in the world, forgotten by God, overlooked among the household of millions upon millions.\" Love, for Kierkegaard, is one of the central aspects of existence; it saves us from isolation and unites us with one another and with God. This new edition of Works of Love features an original foreword by Kierkegaard scholar George Pattison.",
