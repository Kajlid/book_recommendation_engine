  "description": "Tranquility is like any other small town in America, except for one fundamental difference--it's the town where super-powered beings go in order to retire and raise families. From the Golden Age to the Modern Age, heroes and villains alike reside in Tranquility and it creates a unique blend of personalities and conflicts that causes the local law enforcement nothing but headaches. As a camera crew is in town to film a news segment on this unique place, the town is turned upside down by a murder...and it becomes evident that all isn't as quaint as it seems! Collecting the first six issues of the acclaimed series by Gail Simone and Neil Googe!",
