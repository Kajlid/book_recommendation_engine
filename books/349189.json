  "description": "It's not stealing if he's meant to be mine.\nLet me tell you how Holden Sykes operates.As the campus playboy and one-and-done king, he doesn’t do strings.Or repeats.Or names, for that matter.So when he tries making my best friend the next notch on his bedpost, I react poorly.Some would call it jealousy or an unrequited crush,but friends protect each other from making mistakes.The same ones I’ve already made.Which is why driving Holden away seems like my only option.Too bad he’s not giving up without a fight.Each prank leads to anotheruntil he turns this into a game far more precarious than intended.One filled with stolen moments and heated glances,drawing me into his orbit.But the undeniable attraction simmering between usleaves me caught in the crosshairs of an impossible decision.Loyalty...or love.*Caught Stealing is the second in a five book standalone college sports romance series featuring a road-tripping rubber ducky, two guys fighting for the upper hand, and enough cock-blocking shenanigans to make your cheeks flush. Not suitable for anyone under 18 years of age*",
