  "description": "Pepper O’Malley isn’t one to be toyed with. Fool her once, shame on you. Fool her twice, and they’ll have trouble finding your body. She used to dream of white picket fences and happily-ever-afters, but now she lives in the real world. As the saying goes, “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,” especially when that woman is a redheaded spitfire.Griffin Locklaine always viewed commitment as a four-letter word. He was clear about what he wanted from the start and made no apologies for it. He didn't care if he came off cold as ice. He lived for his job, his family, and his friends. He had no desire for a relationship. That was until he saw the once-young-and-scrawny Pepper all grown up.They’re like oil and water, fire and ice. A volatile combination that should never work together. Unfortunately, fate has other ideas. A spark like theirs left ignored has a tendency to burn out of control, leaving everyone to wonder who will be left standing when it finally explodes. Only one thing is certain. When they finally come together, it’s going to be epic.**Fire & Ice is Griffin and Pepper's story. It is book 1 in a spin off series for characters introduced in Love Hate Relationship. It is recommended you read Love Hate Relationship first**",
