  "description": "Earth is in turmoil. The Nian General Zalier has married the human Lucy Thompson taking the first step toward the Nian goal of finding partners for all Nians on Earth. Too bad a large portion of Earth's population thinks the union is an abomination.  Rocts is finally in a position of authority. All of his hard work has culminated in being given the newest Nian resort to run, The Desire. His first day on the job and the new accountant has stolen his focus completely.  Georgia has a five year, ten year, and pretty much an entire life plan. Love is not part of it, though. She’s dedicated to her career and now all that hard work is about to pay off. She’s landed a coveted account with the Nian resort Desire and a promotion is surely in her future. Unfortunately, life is rarely that easy.  As the Nian and Earth relationship crumbles around them, Rocts pursues Georgia with all the determination and charm he has in his arsenal. Unforeseen consequences of the Olovian virus rear their head and increasingly violent reactions from Earth's people throw even more obstacles in his way, but Georgia is having a harder and harder time resisting his magnetic pull.  Disclaimer- This story has several graphic sex scenes and some mild language.",
