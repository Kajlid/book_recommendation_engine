Despite his diminutive size, he's just been invited to try out for the high school baseball team, something almost unheard of for an 8th grader. Two girls have just asked him to the school dance.Then, within a two-week span, Tim's life changes as he finds himself in the hospital diagnosed with cancer.With two tubes attached to his body like unwanted appendages and a newly bald head thanks to chemotherapy Tim struggles with the realization that his athletic future and his budding love life may be put on hold. He also has to deal with the fact that his friends are moving on through puberty, on to high school, while he lags behind.While in the hospital, Tim meets Tess, a leukemia patient with a contagiously positive attitude. This is a blessing for Tim as he struggles to make his unorthodox transition from middle school to high school, as well as his transition from being the popular kid to the sick kid.Sean Waller, a childhood cancer survivor, has created a moving tale about persevering through unforeseen obstacles. Sean was diagnosed at age 12 with rhabdomyosarcoma. Sick Boy is a fictionally autobiographical account of his year and a half journey from diagnosis to treatment to recovery.Sean is thankful and grateful to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York City for saving his life, and hopes you never have to go there.
