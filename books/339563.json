  "description": "It's another Fourth of July in Dacus, South Carolina and the carnival fright house isn't impressing small-town lawyer Avery Andrews' seven-year-old niece Emma. That is, until the leg falls off a mannequin posed with a chainsaw. Then even Emma recognizes the human leg bone protruding from the wizened limb. The next day, Avery joins her sister Lydia and her brother-in-law at a faculty picnic up on the mountain. The festivities are interrupted when one of the faculty wives disappears off the waterfall. Avery has her work cut out for her as she follows the money and begins piecing together a very cold case and a very cold-blooded murder.",
