  "description": "An atheist journalist in San Francisco receives an invitation to tell the story of a young street artist claiming to be the Second Coming of Christ. Despite his misgivings, the reporter accepts the assignment and begins to learn more about this young man’s life. As he delves deeper into the story, the journalist slowly begins to believe in the boy’s sincerity, but the more he uncovers, the more unsettled he becomes as he starts to ask unanswerable questions – has this boy been sent from above? If so, has he come to save us from our sins or punish us for them?",
