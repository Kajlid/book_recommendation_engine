  "description": "\"TWINS. It's the kind of word that only ever happens to somebody else.\" This is the kind of dry humour that characterizes Gingers & Wry, an autobiographical account of a stay@home Dad for tenacious toddler twin boys. Join the author as he finds the humour in situations that would make the Dalai Lama scream out in anger. You'll never see the world the same once you've seen it through Dwayne's eyes.MORE...Gingers & Wry is frequently hilarious, occasionally poignant, and consistently honest—sometimes, brutally so.This book is a collection of quips and comments, originally posted online, threaded together by a narrative that describes four years in the author’s life as he moves from being laid off, and into his new role as a stay@home Dad for twin boys.It humorously documents the challenges and rewards of raising two tenacious toddlers and an opinionated teenaged daughter, all of them redheads.",
