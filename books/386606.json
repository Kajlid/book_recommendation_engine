  "description": "**If you love a lot of chocolate, a little bit of wickedness, and some cute holiday humor, this short story will be the perfect treat! Christmas is going to be hell this year. All I want for Christmas this year is to pass Step 2 of Witches Anonymous, but word’s gotten around Heaven (and Hell) that I tricked the angel Gabriel and assisted Adam (yes, the original Adam) with his second trial with temptation. Now Samson is on my doorstep looking for true love, and Delilah’s not far behind, insisting she wasn’t the one who cut off his hair. In order to get both of them out of my ice cream shop and back into each other’s arms, I have to become a relationship expert and a detective. But solving their biblical mystery means relying on Lucifer’s wicked assistance…and he’s not about to give it for free.",
