  "title": "Best Friends",
  "description": "A story of friendship, for the upper bracket of this age group, as an American girl and a French girl share a year of family and school adventure in Seattle. Suzie Green is an outspoken, energetic, normal sort of American girl, eleven years old, and living with her mother, a widow and teacher. Then the Langdons, father and French-born daughter, move into the neighborhood. Bill Langdon had lost his French wife, and brought Coco, their daughter, back to Seattle. Coco's French heritage precipitates problems with an intolerant set at school, but Suzie and Coco take to each other immediately, and profit mutually from the association. The story runs the gamut of eleven and twelve year old emotions, and the background is a very real small world of girls, with budding interest in boys. (Kirkus)",
