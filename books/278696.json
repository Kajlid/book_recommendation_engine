  "description": "Liberal vegan meets corporate carnivore. What could possibly go wrong?Thomas Stone has one sacred rule: Don't Date The Boss. Ever. So when he finds out his new employer is the man he took to bed his first night in town, he's less than happy. He doesn't need any more complications in his life, and the way Phil makes him feel definitely qualifies as a complication. Especially since he can't seem to keep his hands off the man.Philip Sorrells is thrilled to discover that the new bartender his manager hired for his restaurant, The Happy Onion, is the aggressive little blond he slept with once and can't forget. Thom is Phil's wet dream come true, from his angelic face to his fiery temper. For the first time, Phil hears the siren song of monogamy, and he's tempted to follow it.When Thom leaves The Happy Onion for a job managing an upscale nightclub, it looks like a chance for him and Phil to be together without the whole boss/employee thing hanging over them. Instead, Thom's new position brings out previously unsuspected differences in their world views. Differences with the power to destroy their fragile bond.So how will this nature-loving tree-hugger and corporate-ladder climber navigate this political minefield in the name of love? Very carefully.",
