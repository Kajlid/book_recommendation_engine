He’s everything you could want in a man; gorgeous, charming, intelligent, successful. The only problem is, he’s a vampire.Though she resists the relationship at first, Meridian finds that she’s overwhelmed by her attraction to Adam, and the thought that she knows him from the past. But how far back does the past reach? Meridian slowly begins to discover that she’s one of the Luminos, a race of people who have the ability to remember all of their past lives, who are locked in an eternal war with the vampires. And Adam has been searching for her throughout time. But the more she remembers from the lives she’s lived, the more she realizes how complicated the present really is, because Adam isn’t the only one looking for her. And now she’s playing a dangerous game, caught in the middle of a war, trying to find a way to save her long lost love … and to simply survive.",
