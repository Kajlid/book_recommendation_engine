  "title": "Angels and Demons",
  "description": "An unforgettable journey into the spirit world of good and evil. In this fact-filled book, you will come face to face with the two most opposing forces operating in our world: Angels and Demons. These are not figments of our imagination, but are alive and real at this very moment. You will discover:• Seven specific facts you need to know about angelic beings.• The form and function of seraphim and cherubim.• The work of zoa—“living creatures.”• The mission of angels today.• Biblical evidence that angels fathered the giants of the Old Testament.• The seven devious methods used by demons to gain entrance into the life of a person.• Twelve demonic “strong man” spoken of in the Bible—and how to overcome them!• The role of angels and demons in God’s end time agenda.The battle between right and wrong, moral and immoral, virtuous and vile is as old as recorded history. God placed the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden—and directed man not to eat of it, adding that death would occur if man ate of that tree. Today, the conflict still rages. In this book, the author describes his personal encounters with demons. He says, “As a minister of the Gospel, I have to battle the forces of Satan continually. They rear their ugly heads in our crusades and attempt to destroy what God is doing in hearts and lives around the world. Yet, I can tell you from first-hand experience that the Almighty has sent His angels to protect and minister to me—more times than I can count.”God will send His special angels to you!Says Benny Hinn, “I am excited that you have chosen to read this book. It is the result of more than thirty years of study on this topic and has been life-changing for me. I believe you will be transformed too. The Holy Bible is the only book ever written that gives us an insight into the heavenlies and allows us to peek into what lies beyond. There are literally hundreds of scriptures revealing all we need to know about this unseen world. We often miss the truth because we become bogged down in so many details, yet what is spoken of is tangible and real. I pray that as we delve into the amazing revelations concerning both angels and demons, your heart, soul, and mind will hear from heaven. God is waiting to unlock His treasure-trove of knowledge just for you.” ANGELS AND DEMONS will give you an understanding of what is taking place in the spirit world and help you discover who you are in Christ and the authority you have.",
