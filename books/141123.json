Now the inhabitants of a planet called \"Earth\" face destruction at the hands of the same madman who wiped out an entire race of peaceful beings... a genetically altered human known as \"The Butcher.\" A secret group of teachers called \"The Preceptors\" have protected a teenage girl whose genius will eventually be all that stands between the Butcher and his plans to destroy the Human race. But first she must elude a vicious group of killers while solving a set of mysterious clues left by her murdered mother... clues that will lead to the truth of her origins and unlock powers she could not have imagined. Follow this girl named Katy as she is suddenly thrown into a world almost as alien as the home world of the inter-dimensional invaders chasing her... the world of an American High School.
