  "description": "WILD DAWN, western historical, previously published 1992 as Cait Logan. Kidnapped, beaten, starving and freezing in a mountain cabin, high-born Lady Regina is terrified when the mountain man arrives with his baby son. MacGregor needs a woman to care for his son and he's offering marriage (he's already \"purchased her\" with 10 pelts). Regina has two choices: marry or be left to die in the harsh wilderness.But rough-tough MacGregor is in for a surprise, because this lady isn't sweet. While feminine, virginal, she's a tough survivor, haunted by her dark past, a legend she can't remember; she's determined to escape the evil man pursuing her, and build her own life--without a husband to rule her. To first survive, she's forced to take MacGregor's \"bargain on the blanket\". In return, he must help her retrieve her possessions. A man scarred by his own past and devoted to his baby, MacGregor isn't willing to be tamed to her hand; this English woman isn't the docile wife he'd planned. But this mountain man is in hot pursuit, determined to keep his wife and baby safe, and is surprisingly tender, more appealing by the minute. With another powerful man hunting her, wanting to possess her and the legendary power that is hers, Indian wars circling them, MacGregor and Regina struggle against terrifying dangers, passion, and love in a wild new dawn...",
