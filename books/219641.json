  "description": "\"The writing in Hold the Faith is top notch. The details of life in 92 AD are descriptive and bring the past to life. Susan MB Preston shows us the stress between the followers of Jesus and the Orthodox Jews. We see the pain and politics of the Roman occupation of Ephesus in Asia Minor, but just as importantly we see the daily life of ordinary people. John is old by 92 AD and we see most of this story through the eyes of his great-grandson Benjamin, and other young people. The characters are portrayed very well, bringing a new perspective to an old story. Susan MB Preston has done a great service for Christians everywhere by bringing this story to life.\"Readers' Favorite review. In the 1st century AD, the fledgeling church was squeezed on many sides. From the pagans, the Jews, the Roman overlords, attacks from within â€“ and the rise of Gnostic beliefs. Walk in the shoes of one family, and those whose lives they touch seeing life through their eyes.",
