  "description": "History has no mercy. “Don’t forget the old ways, Carlin. Teach them to your own daughter, when she comes. I’ve seen her, and she’s strong—maybe strong enough to save us all.” Reunited after almost two decades, Gretchel Bloome and Eli Stewart are just learning to be together again when secrets from their past—secrets they’ve kept from each other and secrets others have kept from them—threaten to destroy their fragile happiness. Even as Eli’s relationship with Gretchel is tested, his bond with Gretchel’s daughter grows deeper. Then the malign spirit that has haunted the women in Gretchel’s family for centuries begins to stalk Ame, and Eli discovers the key to the mysterious prophecy his mother has been obsessively researching for more than forty years… After a series of stunning revelations from Miss Poni, the family matriarch, Gretchel, Eli, and Ame are forced to reconsider everything they think they know about themselves—and each other. Will their love survive? And will Ame be tough enough to fight the curse that has plagued her family for generations?",
