When someone she loves dies because she can’t protect them, she shies away from the world, too afraid to let anyone else get close.

That makes him all the more dedicated when what seemed like a freak tornado becomes something much scarier.  When Cody realizes that his family’s powerful talisman has slips into the wrong hands, he desperately needs help. But he never imagined he’d be fall head over heels for the beautiful, if not, mysterious treasure hunter. Morgana will need to let go of being hurt again if they have any hope of saving not only each other, but also the small town that they both love from disaster.  No cliffhangers.
