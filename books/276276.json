  "title": "Bob Logan: Some Like It Hot",
  "description": "In the West there are places where evil men conduct their wicked business beyond the reach of law. Where no lawman can or wants to go, private detective Bob Logan can and does. As a Pinkerton man, his identity must be adaptable to match the ever-changing circumstances. Given a chance, a man learns from his mistakes—if he lives long enough. Men who think they’re above the law must be brought down. Sometimes a rope is the best way to do it. Sometimes it’s not. When they have to choose between heaven and hell. Some like it hot. Fans of Dan Arnold and Louis L’ Amour will love this Western which may also remind them of Robert B. Parker or Elmore Leonard, with a touch of Larry McMurtry for good measure.",
