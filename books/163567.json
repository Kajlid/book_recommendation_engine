  "description": "Adieu to Destiny, is Volume IV in the steamy hot and hilarious ongoing series of The Adventures of Anabel Axelrod, and nothing is what it seems.  From fabulous girlfriend to freaking out fiancée, Anabel's white lace fantasies have never been about weddings. When she and Luke decide to wait on their engagement, Anabel lets out a huge, secret sigh of relief. Surrounded with crazed brides and nonstop wedding activities by day, and having nightmares of those predestined babies at night, Anabel’s relief soon turns into a full-blown anxiety disorder at the thought of marriage--even to her Dream Man.  With a jealous murderess on the loose, big trouble brewing at Luke’s company, and horrifying black circles developing under her eyes, Anabel’s life is fast spiraling out of control. Matters are taken out of Anabel’s hands when Luke shockingly betrays and publically dumps her. Stunned by Luke's decision, it is just the buttercream icing on her 29 4EVER surprise birthday cake when Anabel is coerced by Police Chief Jack to still work with the coldly aloof Luke to help trap a devious killer.  Soon Anabel discovers what lengths she is willing to go in the name of love, lust, and loyalty, even as she uncovers the dark depths to which others will sink.",
