Taking off her clothes every night for the patrons of Hothouse Gentleman's Club was never part of Ava Lureau's life plan, but the sleazy strip joint was the last place her powerful ex-boyfriend would think to look for her. A life on the run kept Ava safe...but lonely. So when a ruggedly sexy stranger shows up and a lap dance becomes more than another dollar in her G-string, she takes a chance. Kade Gavin's job is simple-capture his target and deliver her to the man who hired him. Nothing but a paycheck matters in Kade's bleak existence...until the enticing stripper with soft curves and a puzzling persona climbs into his bed--and under his skin.",
