  "title": "Richard Stark's Parker: The Hunter",
  "description": "The groundbreaking Parker books are adapted for the first time as a series of graphic novels by legendary artist Darwyn Cooke introducing readers to the dangerous anti-hero's cold and calculated world of criminals, thugs, and grifters.Darwyn Cooke’s beautifully stylized artwork perfectly compliments the hard-hitting action as originally written by legendary crime author Richard Stark. Parker is arguably one of the hardest hard-boiled characters in all of crime fiction and the original novels feature stories and prose that are as uncompromising as he is. This graphic novel adaptation perfectly matches the style and tone of Stark’s noir world.The Hunter is the story of a man who hits New York head-on like a shotgun blast to the chest. Betrayed by the woman he loved and double-crossed by his partner in crime, Parker makes his way cross-country with only one thought burning in his mind — to coldly exact his revenge and reclaim what was taken from him!Winner of the 2010 Eisner Award for Best Adaptation from Another Work.",
