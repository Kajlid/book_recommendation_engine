  "description": "Scotlyn Summerline was having a bad day even before the zombies attacked. Her diet was blown, her credit cards were all maxed out, and she was working the nightshift at a sleazy miniature golf course in Las Vegas. An army of the undead rampaging through the city is just the final proof that bad things happen to nice girls. Now Scotlyn is on the run with her irresponsible boss, trying to find a way out of town. Possibly, she’s had a crush on Zeke since she first saw the incredibly gorgeous jerk. Possibly, he’s spent his life until now squandering his potential on sci-fi movies and strippers. Also, possibly, he’s a werewolf. But Zeke’s still her best shot at survival.Ezekiel Macready is not a werewolf. He’s a shape shifter. Zeke has always been different from the rest of his pack, living among the humans and studying ancient legends. Still, even he’s shocked when zombies show up on his golf course. As walking corpses take over Vegas, Zeke’s only thought is to protect Scotlyn. His beautiful, bossy secretary is the one person he can’t live without. To keep Scotlyn safe from the zombies, Zeke knows he has to reconnect to his supernatural roots. Whether he likes it or not. Now, the two of them are stuck with Zeke’s overprotective “brother,” a wiseass vampire who likes nail polish, her megalomaniacal boyfriend/ kidnapper, and a shape shifter in a trucker hat. No matter what it takes, though, Zeke’s determined to get Scotlyn to safety…. And convince her that he’s exactly the kind of shape shifter a nice girl needs at the end of the world.",
