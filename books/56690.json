  "description": "English and Spanish TextsThis book is a reprint of an archaeological report by, among others, the great Norwegian archaeologist Thor Heyerdahl, that was originally published in 1956 in American Antiquity. It deals with material, mostly potsherds, that was found during the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition to the Gal pagos Islands in 1953, and which may be correlated with the Costal Tiahuanaco (Tomaval), Chimu (La Plata), and Inca (Estero) periods of the Peruvian coastal sequence. A fascinating account of an expedition that changed the face of New World archaeology, this new edition includes Spanish translations of the principal sections of the book.",
