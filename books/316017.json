  "description": "In an instant the world changed for Lieutenant General Michael O'Neal. Having reached the end of their usefulness his beloved Corps, the last remaining ACS, are destroyed at the order of the Darhel, by their own Fleet. His staff are shot before his eyes, and he is arrested on the charge of war crimes. He faces a short, one-sided, trial, a trip to the Fleet Penal Facility and a bullet to the back of the head while trying to 'escape'. Yet all is not lost. Just as O'Neal faces certain death an entirely new and more powerful alien enemy threatens the galactic status quo, including the dominant Darhel themselves. This new threat requires that O'Neal take command of all military forces and wage war to save his enemies and humanity.",
