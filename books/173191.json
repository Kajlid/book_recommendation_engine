  "description": "As the captain of the Chicago Aces, Marc Dupuis is all business. The apartment he shares with his teammate and best friend, Duncan, is a refuge from the pressures of fame. But when the sexiest woman he's ever seen interrupts his early morning coffee wearing only a skimpy cami and matching panties, Marc can't exactly say that he minds. Their chemistry is off the charts. Unfortunately, this girl's no random puck bunny. She's Duncan's little sister, and she's moving in. Lovey Armstrong could stare at Marc's chiseled abs and listen to his French-Canadian accent all day. She just has no idea what's going on inside his head: When he's not charming her pants off, Marc makes a Zamboni machine seem warm and cuddly. Lovey knows that the team's bro code says no messing with sisters, but all these mixed messages are hard on a girl's self-esteem, especially since she's finally getting her new life together in Chicago. She decides that he's worth another shot . . . because if anyone can melt the ice around Marc's heart, it's Lovey.Contains mature themes.",
