The book also addresses all other issues such as maintaining your relationship and going back to work. There are special panels that give, not only the mother's, but also the father's, points of view on a variety of issues to help both parents understand the other's needs. In this easy-to-read guide, Miriam Stoppard gives new mothers and fathers the confidence to fashion their own brand of family life.",
