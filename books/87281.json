  "description": "This imaginative tale leads readers on a madcap adventure through the Solomon Guggenheim Museum in New York. Masterpieces of modern and contemporary art in brilliant reproduction do more than decorate the pages - they inspire the action of the story and encourage an imaginative approach to viewing art. Colorful illustrations by Sophy Naess bring to life Frank Lloyd Wright's famous spiral and create a beautiful backdrop for art historian Deborah Goodman Davis' story.",
