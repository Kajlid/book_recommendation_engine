And human women were double trouble, especially when they were lying on the road in front of a digger.”Rob has a mission. Go to the mainland. Work as a policeman. Find out as much as possible about the mainland humans. Report back to his father, the head of the Regor Clan. It should be easy.Until he has to arrest Charlie.
