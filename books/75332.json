  "description": "She's a catwalk model who has a boyfriend, a career, a loyal best friend. But a sudden motor 'accident' leaves her an 'invisible monster', so hideous that no one will acknowledge she exists. Enter Brandy Alexander, Queen Supreme, who will teach her that reinventing yourself sometimes means erasing your past and making up something better...Injected with new material and special design elements, \"Invisible Monsters Remix\" is a radically refashioned 'director's cut' of a favourite Chuck Palahniuk novel, turning a daring satire on beauty and the fashion industry into an even more wildly unique reading experience.",
