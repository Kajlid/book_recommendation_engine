  "description": "Ciaran Tamberlane was once an honored warrior—until the day he lost his faith in both church and crown, and was branded a traitor by his fellow countrymen. Excommunicated by the church and surrounded by dark rumors, he lives in self-imposed exile, responsible only for the peasants who live on his land.Amaranth de Langois was once an obedient wife—until she escaped her husband's brutality and took refuge in a small village. But his men tracked her down. And it was only through Lord Tamberlane's timely intervention that Arnie was spared. Now it's his obligation to return her to her husband, a man who would see her dead. But as long as Arnie resides within his castle, Ciaran will protect her from harm. He has nothing to lose should he defy his duty—and everything to gain should he risk his heart for her love.",
