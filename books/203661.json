Psychologist Dr. Elsa Andreas had a thriving family therapy practice, a school commission, a good life, but tragedy pushes Elsa to walk away from her life. Three years later, she's tucked herself in the backwoods of Gray's Glen. When her sister encourages her to help Nick Stafford's daughters, Elsa takes a chance. But Nick's ex-wife comes back to town, threatening the girls' newfound stability. Can Nick find the forgiveness and Else the courage to build their own \"Home on the Range\"?",
