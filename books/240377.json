  "description": "Cassie What do you do when the lumberjack next door knocks on your door?  You let him the hell in!  There he stood in only jeans and work gloves--all bulging arms and chiseled abs. I couldn't help but look, stare even. How could I not? He looked like he knew his way around the female body and I was aching to find out exactly how much he knew.  Landon- If she keeps looking at me like that I'll have her in every room, every way, all night AND all day. I'll show her my world of pleasure and dominance. I'll make her feel things she never thought possible. I'll make her scream so loud the neighbors will know my name.  Well, they already do. I was the former town playboy after all.  If you like your heroines smart and sexy and your heroes gorgeous, growly and delicious, then this is JUST for you. Halloween with the Hunk is packed full of all the kinky, smutty, dirty fun you're used to with safe BDSM themes and enough steamy, juicy, O’s to melt your panties. Of course, this is a complete story with a sweet HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhangers. And is just the first book in my new holiday series, “Holiday Studs”.",
