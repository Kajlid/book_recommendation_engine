But the next morning, he left me, without a goodbye and without my virginity, not even a smack on the butt or a good job. Over four years later, he's back; now it's my turn to run away from him. JAYI left that morning thinking it was the right thing to do, only to find out years later that I led her right into the arms of a monster. The \"Golden Couple\" may have the rest of the town fooled. But that white picket fence around their house holds secrets that she can't hide from me. Kendall has always been my girl. No amount of time, a wedding ring or last name is going to change that.",
