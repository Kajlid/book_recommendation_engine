  "title": "Think Where You're Going:  The Must-Have Book For New Graduates Seeking Success In Life",
  "description": "Give the gift of success to your new graduate! Did school really prepare your graduate for the complex world they are about to enter? In this new book, author Mike Eltgroth has distilled decades of life lessons from colleagues, employees, relatives, kids and friends who made many of the same mistakes right out of school that most of us do. Covering a wide range of topics including money, loans, relationships, values, attitudes, and jobs, this is an essential resource for any new graduate that wants to take control of their future. From millionaire entrepreneurs to managers to waiters, each of us will end up in one of three categories based on what we think about and how we act. Now is the perfect time for your graduate to learn about these categories, find out which one they are currently in and how to get into the one that they really want to be in. Each graduate has their own unique dreams, and success may or may not mean achieving wealth. Help them find their way while avoiding costly mistakes.",
