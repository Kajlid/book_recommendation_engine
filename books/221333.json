  "title": "The Peculiar Book of Thyme",
  "description": "If you discovered an extraordinary, beautifully made book in an old leather case, nestled in the darkest corner of your grandmother’s scullery; and took it out and marvelled at its beauty and elegant way it had been crafted. And ran your fingers over the scented pages that were individually bound with a delicate golden thread. Would you flick through it to reveal exotic recipes that were etched in a delicate script, innocently releasing secret after secret from each page? Words that whispered incredible stories of remote lands, heroes and heroines and that recounted poems of mythical beasts and legendary journeys. Could you then dare to cook from it just because you’re simply captivated and spellbound by its power as it took you into different From ancient Greece and the Keeper of the Winds to the Mountains of the Moon and the Land of Fire? Would you never give up and think that it was all to no avail because you simply believe, believe that this peculiar book has the capability to take a thousand dreams to a thousand places? Angel did!",
