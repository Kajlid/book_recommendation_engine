  "description": "Jam-packed with mobsters, mystery, magic and mayhem, Dale Lucas offers a new twist on the action-hero and a love letter to classic pulp fiction like no other. Harlem, 1926: The First World War is still The Great War. Jazz is new and always in the air. Booze is black market and the market is worth killing over. The Queen Bee controls the speakeasies, brothels and numbers rackets in north Harlem; Papa House controls the south. As the Queen Bee puts the final touches on her new night club, Papa House makes his move to take over all of Harlem, declaring war. But Doc Voodoo is conjuring the Loas and getting horsed to maintain peace, prosperity, and autonomy for the residents of Harlem. Navigating a minefield of gang rivalries, political corruption, and black magic, the Dread Baron lays down a new law in Harlem, dispensing two-fisted justice with a heaping helping of hot lead!",
