  "description": "First baseman Amy Perry and her Cincinnati Reds teammates have one goal for the new win the World Series. Sportswriter and best friend, Lisa Collins, is there to cover the action from spring training through the hot days of summer. But baseball isn’t the only thing on Amy’s mind. Her wife, Stacy McCrady, is trying to have a baby. The thought of becoming a mother pushes Amy to think this might be her last year—if the Reds were to win it all. While covering the Reds, Lisa gets the surprise of a lifetime. Her father, whom she has never met, contacts Lisa. Can Lisa’s partner, Frankie Dunkin, help Lisa set aside more than thirty-five years of anger? Kat Benson is the cocky second baseman for Amy’s former team, the Kansas City Bandits. The Bandits manager insists that Lisa and Amy attend a game to assess Kat’s potential for the minor leagues. Kat, however, struggles to focus on baseball while confronted with her family’s secrets. From Third to Home continues Chris Paynter’s Playing for First baseball series. Join Amy, Lisa, Kat, and the women who love them for an exciting season full of ups and downs, hopes and dreams.",
