  "title": "When Allah Made Malcolm X Smile: The Man, The Minister, The Shining Black Prince",
  "description": "It is a great honor for me to present a book on one of the worldâ€™s greatest champions of humanity. Malcolm X had principles that enable him to see the true worth of people and especially the oppressed or downtrodden because he could identify with their pain and express it more effectively. Malcolm X experienced the same atrocities and vices that befalls many black men today. From drugs, alcoholism, gambling, crime and prostitution, Malcolm X understood the problems of the black community and later dedicated his life helping black America to change them. Malcolm X may not have gotten the same notoriety as Martin Luther King Jr. when he was alive, however, the Black Panthers and Black Nationalist Movement was overwhelming inspired by his teachings, and later on, quietly, so was Dr. King.",
