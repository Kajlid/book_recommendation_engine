Jo’s excitement dims, however, when she learns her booth is directly across from an old nemesis, the conniving Linda Weeks.Linda aggravates Jo continually during the festival, eventually goading her into a public argument, which puts Jo in a very bad light after Linda drops dead – from candy unwittingly delivered by Jo.With her reputation in doubt, Jo sees sales at the Craft Corner slump badly enough to put her business in serious jeopardy. But her good friends rally around her, working out motives and means during Jo’s paper-craft classes. As paper flowers are folded and collages layered, Jo works to track the twisted trail of a killer, before another life is ripped to shreds.Includes directions for a decorated gift box and a tasty recipe!Originally published by Berkley Prime Crime",
