  "description": "We hide in shadows. Our planet is lost. We are the last humans, and we must go home.  Two thousand years ago, aliens destroyed Earth. Our fleets shattered. Billions died. The last humans fled a burning planet, heading to the stars.  Today we are still refugees. Hungry. Afraid. Our enemies hunt us everywhere.  So we hide. On distant asteroids. In rundown space stations. In deep caves on frozen worlds. And we dream.  Of green hills. Blue skies. Golden fields. We dream of Earth.  And for the first time, we have hope.  A few of us, just a handful of brave souls, form the Heirs of Earth. We are humans who stand tall. Who fight back. Aliens call us terrorists. The humans we save call us heroes. We have starships, weapons, and warriors. We can bring humanity home.  Earth is far. We have not seen her in many generations. But we have not forgotten. Earth is our heritage. Earth is our birthright. We will return! ________  In 2016, the Earthrise series became a surprise bestseller, captivating hundreds of thousands of readers around the world. Set two thousand years later, Children of Earthrise begins a new story, one for both new readers and old fans.",
