  "description": "Perry can’t decide if talking about what he wants is going to kill him or get him everything he’s ever desired. He’s leaning toward the whole situation giving him a heart attack as he tries to figure out how he feels about TC and having a Dom in general, but with the perfect Dom right in front of him all along, maybe death isn’t so inevitable?TC can’t decide if giving his brother everything he’s ever fantasized about will finally make him happy…or give him a stroke from overthinking everything. It seems like it could go either way but that doesn’t mean he’s willing to back down…not even from the biggest question yet…are they ready for their first date?Author’s Note: Story contains consensual incest, a sex sub in lingerie, a younger Dom, mild BDSM with some fun toys, and lots of dirty talk.",
