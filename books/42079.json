  "description": "The time is southeast Michigan, present day. The auto companies are sinking faster than an SUV off Luna Pier, and the job scene is the worst in America. But ever since his father hired on as an accountant at flourishing Wolverine Motors, Milo Shoemaker has felt like a winner. Then his dad drives over a cliff in the fog. Someone robs their house during the funeral. Did his father really die by accident? To find out, Milo passes up college to take a job at Wolverine, where he uncovers dangerous truths about business, heroes, and the boss's daughter. Maybe some secrets should remain... unaccounted for. (Tags: YA Mystery, Suspense, Michigan Fiction, Fiction)",
