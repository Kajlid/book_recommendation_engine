Those who read and follow Cameron's advice and prayers and listen to Tim Wheater's healing music in the audiobook will realize how to achieve harmony in their lives and embrace the notion that they are part of a larger whole that holds them in a benevolent and protective view. With Blessings , readers will understand the secrets of a life that is rich, beautiful, intricate, and valuable.",
