  "description": "\"One of the greatest writers of our time.\"—Toni Morrison\"This well-made collection of her work . . . should give momentum to the rediscovery of Hurston as 'the intellectual and spiritual foremother of a generation of black women writers.'\"— The Washington Post Book ReviewKnown for her audacity and inimitable style, Zora Neale Hurston is widely acknowledged as the forerunner for writers such as Toni Morrison and Alice Walker. This anthology draws together superb selections from her essays, short stories, journalism, folklore, and autobiography.Zora Neale Hurston (1891–1960) was a novelist, folklorist, and anthropologist whose fictional and factual accounts of black heritage remain unparalleled. Her many books include Dust Tracks on a Road ; Their Eyes Were Watching God ; Jonah's Gourd Vine ; Moses, Man of the Mountain ; Mules and Men ; and Every Tongue Got to Confess .Alice Walker changed the course of the American literary canon when she published her novel The Color Purple in 1982. As an anthologist, she lifted from obscurity the writings of Zora Neale Hurston and introduced Hurston to a new generation of readers in this FP Classic, first published in 1979.",
