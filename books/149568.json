  "description": "P.J. Reynolds has terrible judgment when it comes to men. Losers and users litter her romantic past like rice after a wedding reception. Now when she thinks she might be interested in a man, she has a tendency to run. Parker Collier can't stop staring at the pretty, funny bridesmaid in his little sister's wedding. Over an introductory cup of coffee, he tells P.J. he wants her to know when he's going to kiss her for the first time. With P.J.'s running shoes firmly laced, Parker might have his work cut out for him to convince her he's neither a loser nor a user and that she can trust her feelings when it comes to him. Add an overbearing wedding planner with a fake French accent to the mix, and the wedding weekend is shaping up to be the recipe for success ... or disaster. This short story (approximately 13,000 words) is told in different points of view (POV), alternating between the hero and the heroine. There is no cliffhanger. I believe in happily ever after.",
