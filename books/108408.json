  "description": "My life was fine until Logan Foxx showed up. I can write a five hundred page novel about how much I despise him. I can go on and on about how he corrupted me, made me want things I never thought about before I met him. I can also talk forever about how much I love him and how special he makes me feel. In a single second he can make me feel like I'm soaring through the sky being tickled by the clouds, before sending me plummeting into the dark depths of the ocean, fighting for my life as I swim against the raging currents that try desperately to consumed me. It's not his fault. I made the mistake of trusting him when he didn't give me any reasons to. From the moment I laid eyes on him, he captivated me, charmed me, until I gave in. It was fun at first, but then I fell hard and when I needed him the most, he turned his back on me. Logan put me through things a nineteen year old girl shouldn't have to go through. I couldn't deny him anything, he affected me.I was hopeless against him....And eventually, it all blew up in my face.",
