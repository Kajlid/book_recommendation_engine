  "description": "Bella wants to find out what she's good at. But she quits everything she (barely) tries because she's a desastre. Her somersaults are like jirafas rolling downhill, her piano playing like elephant feet. When she decides to learn how to bake with her abuela, her first attempt at dulce de leche frosting looks like cocodrilo skin. She must learn it's okay to try again or she won't be good at anything. #growthmindset Peppered with Spanish vocabulary and set in an intergenerational Latinx home, Bella's Recipe for Success will show all kids the value of practicing to learn a new skill, and that it's okay to make mistakes along the way.Geraldine Rodriguez  will illustrate. Publication is planned for summer 2021; Andrea Walker at Olswanger Literary represented the author,  and Lucie Luddington at the Bright Agency represented the illustrator.",
