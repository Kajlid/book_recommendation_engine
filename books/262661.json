  "description": "Can a whole town be evil? Tulla Murphy’s life has unraveled. Spurred by a loss that forces her to rethink all her plans, she retreats to the town where she grew up, even though she vowed never to go back. She soon discovers that Parnell is still the petri dish of old secrets and simmering resentments of her youth as she reconnects with her three childhood Leo, Kat, and Mikhail. Their friendship once insulated them from the enmities of the schoolyard and the treacheries of the town, but Tulla isn’t sure if it can protect them again. Then mysterious deaths start occurring ― the first at the height of one of Parnell’s most ferocious storms. As the body count mounts, Tulla is plagued by a growing suspicion that threatens loyalties and makes her question her memories. Is it possible that her friends are more dangerous than the forces swirling around her?",
