  "description": "The Virgin Succubus I’m the oldest virgin succubus in North America. Well, maybe the oldest one in Texas. But trust me, it’s better this way. If I keep to myself, I can’t hurt anyone. This has worked for the past ten years... until he came back.  Eric Andrews. The wolf shifter who first triggered my succubus dreams. The boy I used to love. Except he’s not a boy anymore.  He's back in town, and he’s all grown up. He’s coming for me.  The Wolf Shifter I never planned to come back and the longer I stayed in town, the more I fell under the spell of the Jane Guzmán, the shy, bookish innkeeper who sets my blood boiling.  I need to claim her.",
