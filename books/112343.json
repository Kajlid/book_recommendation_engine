  "description": "I am Jaevia Knightley, Jae for short, a daemon, a mutt, a mix breed, half succubus, half vampire. I once was part of a great organization, the Kindred, our only charge, to police the other supernaturals of the worlds. The Kindred and I came to a crossroads so to speak and I decided to not be one anymore, only problem? Well you really can’t stop being Kindred, it’s a lifetime thing.I’ve escaped to the human world and now hide as a proud citizen of Baltimore, Maryland, always with fear that the Kindred will send Reapers after me. So when they send their very best bringer of death you can imagine my surprise when instead of ending up rotting in the dirt I end up becoming a Grigori, a watcher, charged with being the eyes, ears and hands for the Kindred. I don’t know why I've been given this chance only that messing this up will drag myself and everyone I've ever cared for down with me. My first case, missing werewolf carriers, the Batardi the bastard children of supernaturals they carry the DNA sequence of their supernatural parent but aren't supernaturals themselves. So many have gone missing, even the Kindred want to know why. Failing to solve this case is not an option not for the missing wolf carriers or for me. *Book contains violence, graphic sexual scenes, horror, BDSM and other adult situations*",
