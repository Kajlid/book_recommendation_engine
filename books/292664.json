  "description": "Be careful not to lose your panties...All Chloe wanted was to do her laundry quietly and uninterrupted. No such luck.  There's one last available washing machine in the neighborhood laundromat, and she's not the only one who has her eye in it.  Chloe isn't one to back off easy, but neither is the handsome stranger laying claim to her machine, eventually, they realize they'll have to share if they ever want to get out of there, and when the spin cycle ends, they go their separate ways.  Only Chloe's accidentally left him a little lacy red souvenir.  Noah just got out of a relationship and he's focused on getting his footing on his new beat in Boston after transferring from Chicago, but when the feisty Chloe crosses his path in the most unexpected of ways, he can't ignore the attraction, even if she does kind of scare him.  Oh, and did I mention they're neighbors?  As their paths keep crossing and sparks fly, will Noah manage to convince Chloe to lower her guards and see that they were meant to be?  \nThis is a sweet comedic romance, low on drama and high on witty banter. It also contains explicit language and graphic sexual scenes. If you're looking for a steamy fun summer read, you've come to the right place.",
