  "title": "The Hellbringer",
  "description": "Axel Twelvetrees and his gang of ruthless cutthroats enter Jack Mahan's saloon in Sweet Home, Kansas, slices up him up with a razor, leaves him for dead, and kidnaps his woman, Carla Daws. This leaves Mahan mentally and physically wounded. But he recovers, strikes out in a frantic search for Carla, and to settle his score with the mad man, Twelvetrees. Twelvetrees is backed by hell itself, and Jack realizes this will be no easy undertaking. Twelvetrees made a crucial mistake by not killing Mahan, for Jack comes riding for him at a wild, heart-pounding pace and turns aside all the primitive, hot forces of hell to free Carla Daws, and to bring Twelvetrees to justice.",
