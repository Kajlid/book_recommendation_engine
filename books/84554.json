  "description": "Reality TV? Meet actual reality…Life as a cable reality show host could be a sweet gig, if you came by it honestly… Renovations contractor Jack Hoffman did not. When a gay-unfriendly network offered him and his brother the job of a lifetime it seemed like a real Hollywood ending was finally in sight for the hard-luck pair. Jack wasn't rocking either end of the Kinsey scale exclusively, so why not? It changed what he could do in broad daylight, but everyone knows the stars only come out at night. His fool-proof plan was working until a crush on his new client's brother made him an even bigger fool. Cassius is devout, quiet, thoughtful... everything Jack is not. But from the moment he locks eyes with the strange and beautiful man Jack knows he never wants to let him out of his sight. From the hot spots of WeHo to high in the hills, Jack finds himself caught in a romance that could only happen in the City of Angels. Now all Jack can do is brace for impact as his career and love life speed to a collision on the corner of Hollywood & Mine.",
