  "description": "Five years ago, a boyhood dream came true when the prettiest girl I ever knew kissed me on a dare and sent my world spinning. I've crushed on Shiloh Brookings for five long years, the memory of that kiss making other girls come in a distant second.Imagine my surprise when a friend drags me to a strip club in a neighboring town and the dancer on the stage is none other than Shiloh. AKA Miss Cherry Pie, the sweetest, hottest thing you ever did see.My first instinct is to grab her down off that stage and hide her away from all those eyes.My second? Figure out WTH has her up there in the first place. That's not the Shiloh I remember.Shiloh's life is crazy-complicated, though.Her present is burdened with baggage from her past, so she has no interest in letting anyone get close. And she may be a stripper by night, but I've just learned that she's teaching in my high school by day, which makes her completely off-limits.And now she's attracted the attention of a stalker, and the stakes are getting more desperate every day.Can I win her trust and break down her walls quickly enough to help her?",
