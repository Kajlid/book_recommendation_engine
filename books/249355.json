A planet with abundant resources that his planet can raid and plunder.The time is 70,000 years ago and his planet is thriving, cities built of steel, tall buildings, driving hover cars, and for fun a good concert, ball game, or movie is what he is after, and making love.Then one day they find it, a little blue planet in a distant galaxy with all the riches they need, but first they must get there. Another kingdom wants the blue planet and will do anything to get it.

Why did he come, and what is this feeling he speaks of, called love?",
