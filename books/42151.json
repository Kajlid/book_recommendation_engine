  "description": "After the five years he spent with his last lover, Cade has come to regard Valentine's Day as irrelevant â€” just another day when romantic chumps spend money they can't spare to keep the chocolate and greeting card companies happy. But his lover, Lorin, has been dead for eight months. After struggling to get past his grief, and cope with his HIV positive status, Cade is beginning to think about getting on with his life. Joel, a young co-worker, is not the person Cade would have chosen to share his battered and tainted renaissance . But Joel may be just the man to unfreeze the romantic in Cade's soul.",
