  "description": "In the beginning, everything made sense. I had a place, a purpose, and a mate who supposedly loved me.Then I did something so unspeakable, I was cast out of Heaven and thrown onto a planet I know very little about, with a curse on me that kills people on the spot whenever they stare into my eyes.The thing is? There are two sides to every story, and this one is mine. I’m not the monster the world makes me out to be. That position is reserved solely for the man threatening to destroy Earth and everyone on it if I don’t give in to his insidious demands.But I’m getting ahead of me myself. Let me start from the beginning.Because before there was light, there was…me.Lucillania, God’s favorite angel.And now, the Queen of Hell.This is a reverse harem paranormal romance with angels, demons, hellhounds, and the queen who rules over them all. It will end on a cliffhanger.",
