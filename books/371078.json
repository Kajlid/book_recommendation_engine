  "title": "Myra: Stolen Innocence",
  "description": "No one ever noticed Myra, But he had. Goldenly handsome and worldly, so much older than she was. She, willingly driven by avid teenage curiosities, and the fact she had remained so long unnoticed, and unloved, by those close to her. Drawn unwittingly into the world of total power exchange, debauchery, and excess. A world she had little comprehension of, and it's associated costs. Taken by stealth, enslaved to his will, bound to him by his use of fear, and his majesty. Myra finds herself plunged in to his tiny insular world, housed only within his four walls; far from her homeland and all she is familiar. To face life as his slave and plaything. Armed with only the solace of her quick mind, his forbidden computer, and her inner resolve to come to terms with what she has become. As she writes her prohibited internet journal, words she hopes someone may hear.",
