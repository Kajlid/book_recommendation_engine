  "title": "Roaring Drunk: An Idiots Guide on Becoming an Alcoholic",
  "description": "Many people arrive at a point in their lives and ask the question 'how did I get here, where did all the time go'. The question I asked was 'what happened to my life?' The answer stared back at me 'You pissed it up the wall'. 'Oh Yeah, so I did'. I can't remember the exact day I realized I was an alcoholic, but now, with the benefit of years of sobriety and the luxury of hindsight, I can see why. This is my story. It tells of a pattern of behaviour and a way of thinking, which, over many years led me on a path of self destruction without me realizing where I was going until it was almost too late. It is a cautionary tale of where alcohol can take you if you don't give it the respect it deserves.",
