  "description": "New York Times bestselling author Skye Jordan brings you a sexy new series of stand alone romances!After a lifetime of abandonment, Miranda Wright depends on no one but herself. She’s about to break ground on her dream of building green, affordable houses for retired veterans, and she’s not about to let anything alter her plans—especially not a sexy know-it-all architect from New York. Her strict, no-seconds rule has kept her heart safe this far, so why fix what isn’t broken?When a family crisis strikes, Jack Taylor is on the next flight to Nashville. But coming home stirs up more betrayal than answers, and he finds the perfect distraction in a feisty but guarded brunette. Only, one-night turns into a whole lot more, and Jack finds himself all-in by the time he discovers that Miranda’s secrets may very well cost him not only the family business, but his heart.",
