Amid a true Vonnegutian host of horrorsâ a double murder, a fatal dose of radioactivity, a decapitation, an annihilation of a city by a neutron bombâ Rudy Waltz, aka Deadeye Dick, takes us along on a zany search for absolution and happiness. Here is a tale of crime and punishment that makes us rethink what we believe . . . and who we say we are.",
