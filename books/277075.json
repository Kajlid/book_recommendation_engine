  "description": "Ryan Shea has sworn off men.After her last relationship imploded in front of her eyes, she decides to take a break from swimming in the dating pool … possibly forever. The brilliant computer whiz loses her brain when it comes to love, and jumping feet first burns her every time.Without a home, or much of a clue where life is headed, taking a trip back to the small town of Fawn Hill to stay with her best friend seems like the only option.Except it puts Ryan directly in the path of the one man she can’t fall for. Fletcher Nash reminds her too much of the dark past she’s always run from; his demons are the things of her nightmares. And it’s no help that, when he looks at her, she feels as if Fletcher is the one person who truly understands.Fletcher Nash vowed not to fall in lust.Five years of sobriety, and he hasn’t broken the chastity promise yet. Not that it had to keep for this long … he’s well over the normal year addicts are told not to get involved.But, aside from a busy schedule and trying to chase his dream of becoming a full-time artist, he has no intentions of committing to a woman until she is the one.Why is it, then, that sassy, city girl Ryan Shea comes dangerously close to resembling the exact woman he could break that promise for? Like sand through his fingers, there is no way she’ll stay put … but his heart just won’t listen.They pledged not to love anyone until it was the real thing.So what happens when two people terrified of falling head-over-heels, actually do?",
