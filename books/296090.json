  "description": "They think capturing me will help them win the war.But they just made the biggest mistake of their lives. As a summer fae princess and chief enforcer for the Mage Police, it’s my job to stop shifters dead in their tracks—emphasis on the dead part. And if one criminal slips through my fingers while I bag another, well, that’s not a good enough reason to demote me—in my opinion.Determined to prove myself to the mages, I go after the worst criminal out there: The Shadow. But when that mission gets blown all to hell, I find myself a captive of three shifter warlords. Being their prisoner shows me all about the darker side of the war. But the thing is… I’m not afraid of the dark. Or them.",
