  "description": "“Raucous and eloquent, You’re Better Than Me uncovers one woman’s journey from rural Canada to confronting stand-up comedy’s misogyny. Bonnie McFarlane reinforces that women actually are funny and reminds us that bad decisions should be bold. I knew her when—and she still is!”—Jill Soloway, award-winning director and creator of the Amazon original series TransparentIt took Bonnie McFarlane a lot of time, effort, and tequila to get to where she is today. In this no-holds-barred memoir, Bonnie tells it like it is, and lays bare all of the smart (and not-so-smart) decisions she made on her way to finding her friends and her comedic voice. From fighting in elementary school and writing her first jokes behind the bar of a comedy club, to riding motorcycles with guy comics on the way to the World Famous Comic Strip, and trying to become besties with Janeane Garofalo, You’re Better Than Me documents Bonnie’s path through the good, the bad, and the ugly in her life in comedy. Honest and hilarious, You’re Better Than Me is about resolving to be yourself, even if it freaks other people out.",
