But Fate and the friends own inexperience turn it into disaster.With one of them badly hurt, Ghyll Denhalf and his friends return to their castle - to find it burned by a band of monstrous firebirds and black-clad golems.Now, hunted by dark necromancers of an obscure, long-forgotten organization, they travel through the kingdom of Rhidauna on an epic journey of revenge and discovery, magic and desperate sword fights, bitter enmity and warm friendship.Note: The first three books of the series (Rhidauna, Zihaen, Ordelanden) form a trilogy. Following volumes will be brought out in a standalone form.OUT OF PRINT",
