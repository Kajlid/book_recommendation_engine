  "title": "You are not your Masks: A WAY OF LIBERATION & FINDING FULFILMENT",
  "description": "The more you are connected to the core of existence, the happier, calmer and wiser you will be. “Your inner wisdom is your blessing” In this book, Saied Shahsavari explores the basic aspects of life that have become so overly complicated in our minds and that are at the root of so many of the problems we face. He draws on ancient knowledge and complex spiritual ideas and transforms them into simple and practical solutions that we can use for ourselves to improve the quality of our everyday lives. Saied invites us to discover ourselves and the world around us in a new way; to become aware of our existence behind the masks and build a better society in which everyone can access their true potential. He explains different forms of relaxation as a means to achieve meditation as a state of realisation and awareness. His work speaks to the ineffable spiritual truth between connection and existence and shows us how to use vital energy and revive inner wisdom.",
