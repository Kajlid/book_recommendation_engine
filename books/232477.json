  "description": "Do not start this book after 8:00 PM or you will be up all night.Easter Island, surrounded by more than 1,000 kilometers of nothing but ocean, is generally a quiet place - until that quiet is shattered by the world’s largest passenger jet landing in total darkness. The plane had been hijacked on a flight from LA to Sydney and redirected here so the hijackers can get off the plane without anyone knowing they are still alive. It’s a great plan, and it would have worked, too, except for a rookie local cop named Victor. He had followed a number of leads the previous day, but found nothing concrete enough to convince his Chilean boss there was a threat to the island. So he met the plane alone…The next 18 hours are a whirlwind of chases and confrontations as Victor lays his life on the line again and again to keep the terrorists on the island and bring them to justice. He’s assisted by his surfing buddy Jorge, Jorge’s beautiful sister Javiera and a friendly street dog named Loco.#ContemplateTheNavel",
