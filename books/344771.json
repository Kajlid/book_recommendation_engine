On her second day there, she meets a two-legged wolf, Jace McKenna. Though instantly attracted to him, Jace's teasing nature has Hayley unsure whether she wants to kiss him or kick him. As things heat up between them, Hayley learns one thing for sure—there's more to Jace than meets the eye. This lighthearted bad boy is harboring a secret.Jace McKenna has found his mate. For this formerly footloose alpha werewolf the thought is a bit disconcerting, but the seductive Hayley is a temptation he can't resist.
