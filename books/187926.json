  "description": "\"Beguiling, sagacious, and thoroughly good fun\"  Clever, funny and with just the right blend of sweet and sour, here is a family drama dressed in comic clothes, masquerading as a country house murder mystery. One for daughters and their mothers, and anyone else who wants to learn the correct way to eat a scone.  On a late summer weekend at home in grand but crumbling Garton Grange, Violet has to prepare for her Home Ec assessment, but with a house full of guests and a lunatic sister playing at detectives, how will she ever get it done? And if the dog did not destroy Mother's cake, who did? Did she really see someone lurking down at the gatehouse? Which one is the bay tree, and what does nutmeg look like anyway? Should self-confessed teachers be allowed out into society? All these questions must be answered before the weekend is over, with lessons to be learned along the way about baking, loyalty and just how strong a Mother can be.",
