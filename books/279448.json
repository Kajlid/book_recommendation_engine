  "description": "Noramary came out of the parlor into the hall. Stunned by what she had just heard, she felt slightly light-headed and leaned against the closed door for a moment to steady herself. The shock of Winnie's elopement during the night had been followed by a second -- the staggering request of her foster parents that she step into her errant cousin's place as the bride of Duncan Montrose! \"So you see, my dear, why we must ask this of you?\" Aunt Betsy's voice rang in her ears. Noramary closed her eyes, bringing back the scene that had just taken place. As her aunt had explained the dilemma Winnie's irresponsibility had caused and what must now be done, Noramary had sat very still, eyes downcast, hands folded in her lap, hearing but not fully absorbing her aunt's words. Now those same words burst upon her, strong and clear: \"--marry Duncan Montrose!\" Valiant Bride is a historical romance that brings to life a young woman's choice between duty and love.",
