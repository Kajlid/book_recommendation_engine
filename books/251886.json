  "description": "Lady Clarissa’s life is a mess of embarrassing moments because she is forbidden to wear her glasses — but the handsome (if slightly blurry) Earl of Mowbray seems intrigued by her outrageous reputation… Is he the man for her?He’d been warned that Lady Clarissa Crambray was dangerous. Stomping on toes and burning piffles, the chestnut-haired beauty was clearly a force with which to be reckoned. But for Adrian Montfort, Earl of Mowbray, veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, this was just the challenge he needed. He could handle one woman and her “unfortunate past.” Could any woman handle him?Lady Clarissa Crambray wanted a husband, but maybe not as much as her stepmother wanted one for her. Really!
