  "title": "Blood to Drink",
  "description": "During Prohibition, the Mississippi flowed with contraband. Rumrunners could make fortunes in New Orleans. Some got away with murder. Wesley Farrell, half-caste son of an Irish policeman, is no stranger to violence and death, but he's deeply affected when a bright young Federal agent is gunned down right in front of him. A few years later, a new act opens and Farrell, conscious of his debt to the dead man who had saved his life just before he died, elects to play a role. His investigation not only opens up some well kept secrets, it carries his own role with his father in new directions.... Atmospheric, faithful to its period, Robert Skinnet's fourth Wesley Farrell novel after Skin Deep Blood Red, Cat-Eyed Trouble, and Daddy's Gone a-Hunting is not just a suspenseful whodunit, but an exploration of family and of loss.",
