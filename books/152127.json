We’re friends, counselors, psychiatrists, and confidantes. We laugh, cry, and commiserate TOGETHER. Jorja and Regina tell the story of us. Tomorrow is always a place of plans, dreams, and adventure.’76 Bridges chronicles their journey, from the girlish dreams of yesterday, through the realities of life today, and into the vision of their tomorrows.
