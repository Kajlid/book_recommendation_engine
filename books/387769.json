  "description": "Sixteen-year-old Jude has to get out of tiny Churchtown. She has to escape her outcast status at the Royal Duchy School and her pathetic dad, who hasn’t gotten past her mum’s death. The only bright light is drama, her way out, if only she can get into the Lab in London. It takes a lot of nerve to apply to such a prestigious program, and Jude’s not sure she can do it. Then Judes’s childhood best friend, Stella, returns. Stella, sexy and bold, and ten times cooler than Jude. With Stella by her side, Jude knows she’s capable of anything. But Stella’s influence extends well beyond the theater. She quickly creeps into every part of Jude’s life, bringing Jude the attention she’s always craved. So even when Stella’s behavior takes a dangerous turn, Jude can’t bring herself to abandon her best friend. And anyway, now that Stella’s back, there’s no stopping her. In Jude’s dark and tangled story, Joanna Nadin explores the aftermath of loss and the consequences of becoming the person you always wished you were.",
