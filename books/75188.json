  "description": "There are two realms that we have the ability to inhabit: the physical realm and the spiritual realm. In the physical realm, we find ourselves stressed by debt, unemployment, health bills, and more. These fears are real, but we don't have to find ourselves stuck there. Instead, we can enter the spiritual realm, where God has promised to make abundance and prosperity available to us all. We do not need to be worried; we do not need to be preoccupied with our current financial situation; we do not need to fear the future. We just need to have the right mindset, the right faith that the power of God can and will work with the universe to produce miracles in our lives.",
