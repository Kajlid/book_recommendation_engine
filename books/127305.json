  "title": "How to Date a Foreigner: A Proven Framework to Help You Navigate Cultural Differences in Dating",
  "description": "From one of the world’s experts in cross-cultural psychology, comes an award-winning debut, How to Date a Foreigner, that will help you navigate the rapidly growing international dating scene. When it comes to international dating, we often just hope we will figure it out, but wouldn’t it be easier if there was a “recipe”? Due to the increasing number of travelers, foreign exchange students, and over 280 million international migrants worldwide with different cultures, religions, politics, and beliefs, dating is far from universal.In How to Date a Foreigner, Sylvia Halter takes us on a fascinating journey through the different mindsets and beliefs around the world, which results in four distinctively different dating styles.Every dating style has a vastly different way of thinking and seeing the world, leading to countless misunderstandings. For example, “being official” in one culture might not even mean you are boyfriend and girlfriend in another. Or men start chasing after sex in some cultures, while they disappear for several weeks in others. Due to many of these misunderstandings, dating and relationships can often feel frustrating. You are not on the same page, but you do not even realize it. In How to Date a Foreigner, Halter takes this complex topic and breaks it down into a clear and easy-to-follow system.Whether you are looking for love abroad, dating a foreigner or have been married to one for years, read this book to:•\tLearn about the four dating styles.•\tUnderstand the differences among their dating stages.•\tDiscover your own mindsets and beliefs in comparison to other cultures.•\tAvoid unnecessary misunderstandings.With its proven framework, How to Date a Foreigner leads the way in explaining cultural differences in dating and provides a first-of-its-kind guidebook to navigating them with ease. Ultimately, international dating should be fun and enjoyable and not paved with obstacles.",
