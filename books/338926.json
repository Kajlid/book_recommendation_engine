  "description": "Dragons are a perennial favorite of most children, and this book honors the mythical creatures with words and pictures. Jackie Morris, known for the ravishing colors and sheer beauty of her art, offers young readers a gallery of dragons in every shape, size, and temperament imaginable. They range from a beast as big as a village to a tiny species with whisper-thin wings, from a snaggle-toothed monster to a sea-dragon that races dolphins on the waves. Tell Me a Dragon â€™s whimsical text and enchanting gallery show why these creatures are so popular and inspire animated discussion and dragon-based activities.",
