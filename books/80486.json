Jase is sweet, loving and incredibly down-to-earth. But their relationship will face its first big test when Jase goes on location to film a new movie with his ex-girlfriend, Chloe St. James, playing opposite him. As if being apart isn’t bad enough, new concerns arise when Chloe makes it known that she wants Jase back, and Logan is afraid she won’t stop until she gets him.Ethan Lewis is in love with his best friend, Logan Kessler, but she has nothing but platonic feelings for him. Instead of continuing to pine away after what he can’t have, he decides to see if he can focus his attention elsewhere. That’s when he meets Nora Brady, Jase Brady’s sister, who is unlike any girl he’s ever met before. But Nora knows about his feelings for Logan, so she’s hesitant to date Ethan for fear of getting hurt. Maybe they can just be friends. But as Nora and Ethan grow closer, they start to realize that they just might be right for each other, even though Ethan knows that deep down that if given the chance, he’d be with Logan in a heartbeat.With precarious relationships on the line, vengeful exes to look out for and the paparazzi lying in wait to record it all, Gravity Happens, is a story of friendship, love, betrayal and knowing who you can trust in a world where everywhere you look, there’s someone who wants to take what you have for themselves.",
