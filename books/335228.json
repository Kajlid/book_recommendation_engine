  "title": "Tom Sawyer Abroad",
  "description": "Tom Sawyer Abroad is a novel by Mark Twain published in 1894. It features Tom Sawyer & Huckleberry Finn in a parody of Jules Verne-esque adventure stories. In the story, Tom, Huck & Jim set sail to Africa in a futuristic hot air balloon, where they survive encounters with lions, robbers & fleas to see some of the world's greatest wonders, including the Pyramids & the Sphinx. Like Adventures of Huckleberry Finn & Tom Sawyer, Detective, the story is told using the 1st-person narrative voice of Huck Finn.Excerpt:So he did it. He had a little wee bit of steamboating, and some stage-coaching, but all the rest of the way was horseback, and it took him three weeks to get to Washington. He saw lots of land and lots of villages and four cities. He was gone 'most eight weeks, and there never was such a proud man in the village as he when he got back. His travels made him the greatest man in all that region, and the most talked about; and people come from as much as thirty miles back in the country, and from over in the Illinois bottoms, too, just to look at him and there they'd stand and gawk, and he'd gabble. You never see anything like it.",
