  "description": "Not all fantasies are safe, sane, and consensual. Welcome to the world of The Gallery…Milo Fierro lives for two things, dominance and music. At The Gallery, where depravity rules, he’s known for his passionate desires, but on the outside, he’s learned to hide beneath a veneer of dark-eyed professionalism. It’s too dangerous to be himself. Most women don’t understand.Alice definitely doesn’t understand. Her father was his violin teacher for years, and now that she and Milo are adults, she thinks they can be friends. The girl he knew as “Lala” draws him in with her grace and kindness, unaware of his ugly, hidden side. He can’t touch her, or even stand near her. He doesn’t dare reach out to her, no matter how much her talent and beauty inflames his lusts. She deserves better, deserves a man who’s nothing like him…If only she wasn’t so impossible to resist.",
