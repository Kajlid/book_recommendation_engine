  "description": "Daniel has spent centuries falling in love with the same girl. Life after life, crossing continents and dynasties, he and Lucy have been drawn together -- and he remembers it all. Both a gift and a curse, Daniel has the ability to recall past lives and recognize souls of those he's previously known. For all the times that he and Sophia have been drawn together throughout history, they have also been torn painfully, fatally, apart. Interwoven through Sophia and Daniel's unfolding present day relationship are glimpses of their expansive history together. From 552 Asia Minor to 1918 England and 1972 Virginia, the two souls share a long and sometimes torturous path of seeking each other time and time again. But just when young Lucy finally begins to awaken to the secret of their shared past, to understand the true reason for the strength of their attraction, the mysterious force that has always torn them apart reappears. Ultimately, they must come to understand what stands in the way of their love if they are ever to spend a lifetime together.",
