  "description": "All Cameron Roberts and Blair Powell want is a small, intimate wedding, but the paparazzi and a domestic terrorist have other plans. First Daughter Blair Powell and her lover Cameron Roberts, newly appointed deputy director of the Homeland Security Office, escape to a ski chalet in the Rockies after a harrowing attack by members of a domestic terrorism organization. Under orders from the White House, Blair reluctantly allows a member of the \"enemy camp,\" investigative reporter Dana Barnett, to join her inner circle in the hopes of limiting her media exposure. Dana isn't any happier about being pulled from her coverage of the escalating conflict in the Middle East to write a society \"fluff piece,\" although the presence of beautiful Dr. Emory Constantine does make the assignment a little more enticing.With the nation under attack, the world on the verge of war, and their personal lives the focus of intense public scrutiny, Cam and Blair come under fire both publicly and privately when an old nemesis resurfaces intent on finishing his holy missionâ€”to kill Blair Powell.",
