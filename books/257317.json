  "description": "Nathan Lancaster. Elusive billionaire. World-wide philanthropist. Monster.From the moment he was born, Nathan knew he couldn't let anyone know who, or what, he was, but that hasn't stopped him from trying to make his way in the world. And he's fine alone, seriously. Until a curvy, persistent reporter steps up and turns his whole world upside down. She's lighting up all the corners of his darkness and endangering the secrets he has always held so dear. So why can't he imagine ever letting her go? When journalist Lillian Goss discovers that the world's most eligible bachelor might be a criminal, she isn't afraid to get the scoop at all costs. Unlike the rest of the world, she isn't dazzled by Nathan's easy smile, scorching blue gaze, or notable philanthropy. She's determined to expose his dark side, until she manages to get up close and finds Nathan altogether different than she thought. He's even willing to grant an exclusive, if Lillian is willing to walk into the shadows that surround his life and heart.The more Lillian gets to know Nathan, the more complicated her feelings get for a man who's much lonelier than anyone knows. Yes, he has secrets, but he also is braver, and kinder, than she ever imagined. But as attraction burns hot between them, and an unknown stalker enters the picture, one questions arises for Lillian above all... Where does Nathan go after Midnight?Midnight is the first book in the Nightmare Dragons series. These books contain intense themes, some dramatic violence, and tortured shifter heroes who might just make some people afraid of the dark. MY BOOKS WILL NEVER CONTAIN: Cheating, unfaithful heroes, or an ending that is anything but happy.",
