The woman had disrupted the system; caused people to be fired, and generally gotten the place into a state of confusion. His carefully laid plan to murder her didn't work out, but by visiting her apartment and behaving himself in an \"unseemly\" manner, as she reported to the president, he managed to get her out of the firm and possibly into an insane asylum.",
