  "description": "For as long as I could remember Noah was my everything and when he went away, he took everything with him.  I was never meant to see him again and truth is I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to. I sat and watched as he changed before my very eyes. That place turned him into a monster.  He no longer was the man I married. I had no choice but to start over. He gave me no other choice.  Years later I fell in love with another. He was there for me, picking up the pieces after Noah broke me. Ryan became my everything, until he was nothing.  Just when I thought I had finally hit rock bottom, Noah was free and no longer restricted from the Prison that turned him into this monster he had become. He wants to keep me safe but he can’t seem to stay away.  He’s trying to break the walls that he forced me to build and I can’t seem to look past our history, to allow him back in.",
