  "title": "Every Living Being: Representations of Nonhuman Animals in the Exploration of Human Well-Being",
  "description": "Every Living Being analyses the historical integration of the role of animals in care‐giving positions, and their depiction in popular Western culture. It establishes the degree to which nonhuman animals, domesticated and wild, have contributed to the emotional lives and care of humans in contemporary Western culture. In examining the historical depiction of animals in literature and art, as well as their interpretations in contemporary mass media, the aim of my book is to provide an in‐depth analysis of the cultural interpretation of animals as they interconnect with a diverse array of human‐constructed realities principally in the area of 'wellness and suffering.' It seeks to explore the dichotomy between those species which have been utilised primarily as products for human consumption and those species of animals that have become regarded as human companions which can enhance or ameliorate the lives of human beings suffering from illnesses or disabilities on an emotional and/or physical basis.",
