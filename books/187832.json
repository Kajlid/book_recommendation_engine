  "description": "She’ll either enslave his heart… or tear it out. As an Amazon warrior, a slave is the last thing Kyme would ever willingly become. At least before the slaver Arsenius threatens her sisters. To protect them, she agrees to be his captive and plans to slit his throat the moment she gets the chance. Though she’s determined to hate Arsenius, the unexpected kindness of his touch and the growing passion between them stay her knife. He’s a man so dangerous she just might dare to trust him.  He’s endured every torture, except the one that could actually break him.For Arsenius, his mission was simple—capture and deliver one of the fiercest Amazon warriors, Kyme. In exchange, he’ll receive the location of the sister he’s spent years searching for. But Kyme’s selfless dedication to the goddess Artemis entrances him. Her pure existence is so different from his dark past and the bleak life he now leads. When Kyme becomes master and his heart the slave, nothing will stop Arsenius from failing his mission.  Sometimes, the surest path to freedom is forged in ecstasy… Possessing Kyme as his slave isn’t enough. Arsenius wants more. When the gods intervene, they’ll risk more than their duty to the past to be together… Yet never has surrender been so sweet.",
