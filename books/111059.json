  "description": "Vampires enthrall us. From horror to lover, vampires take our lives, our bodies, and our blood. The M/M erotic stories in this collection run the gamut. From historical past, present, and far into the future; science fiction, fantasy, and contemporary: it's all about the fangs.So whether you like your vampire vicious or kind, dominant or submissive, hidden or out in the open, this collection has an erotic story for you. Short enough to read on the bus, hot enough to make you sweat, and every one a new surprise. Five M/M erotic stories are waiting.Natural Adaptation: Humanity is no longer at the top of the food chain. When Vampires take over the world they must adapt to survive. Some serve, some become food, but others evolve.An Executioner's Absolution: Bound by cold iron as a King's executioner, one vampire strikes a bargain for his freedom. He claims his next victim as a Servant rather than killing him. Now they're both on the run.The Catch: Vampires prey on humanity from the shadows, reading minds and imposing their stronger wills over their food. On man stands against them, but tricking a creature than can read your thoughts requires the ultimate deception. Mile High: At 30 thousand feet there aren't many places where a vampire can get his fix without getting caught. There aren't many men who would enjoy it, either. Master Aviator: The military was supposed to be an easy place for a vampire to hide, especially at war. But when you're stuck on a boat in the middle of the pacific, things get complicated. This vampire needs someone willing to feed him again and again.",
