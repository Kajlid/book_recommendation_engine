So when he lands a temporary job as Luscious Lily's driver, he's none too pleased to find that they can't keep their hands off each other!But trudging around Cornish farms, knee deep in mud and meetings with egotistical chefs was never going to be the perfect recipe for love—was it? And Lily could never fall for a man so disinterested in food—could she?",
