After Dash gets accepted to Oxford University and Lily stays in New York to take care of her dogwalking business, the inseparable couple are struggling to make a long distance relationship work. And when Dash breaks the news that he won't be coming home to New York for Christmas, Lily makes a decision: if Dash can't come to New York, she'll go to London. But will Lily pull off the ultimate surprise--or will Christmas in London backfire?",
