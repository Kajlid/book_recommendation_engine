  "description": "They come, and she watches. They hunt, and she warns.  Nigeria’s Yankari National Park is a place of nature’s wonder. Tourists come and go, leaving with life-changing experiences and memories they will cherish for the rest of their days.  There are others, though. They come to take more than a head filled with memories. They come to take lives and—even worse—trophies.  Olisa doesn’t mind the temporary trespass of the tourists. They’re more or less harmless. The poachers are a different story. Even nature has its breaking point. And so does Olisa, who is more than an eight year old girl. She is Yankari’s voice and its weapon. When the two finally meet face to face, it’s not just her survival Olisa finds herself fighting for, but the survival of all who call Yankari home.  This is a novella length work, approximately 50 paperback book pages.",
