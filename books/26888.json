  "title": "Unwoke: How to Defeat Cultural Marxism in America",
  "description": "Our institutions have gone \"woke.\" Everybody knows that. But nobody has come up with a way to stop it. Until now.In this hard-hitting new book, Senator Ted Cruz delivers a realistic battle plan for defeating the woke assault on America.The Democratic Party is now controlled by Cultural Marxists. So are our universities and public schools, the media, Big Tech, and Big Business. Corporations push transgenderism down their customers' throats. Banks punish gun shops. Hollywood insults our religious beliefs and grooms our children. The big investment companies use our retirement savings to promote leftist causes. And the Biden administration has turned our military into an indoctrination camp, neglected transportation safety to focus on climate change, and persecuted peaceful pro-lifers while leaving prochoice arsonists at large.The son of Cuban immigrants who fled communist oppression, Cruz is uniquely equipped to fight the woke revolution. He eloquently explains how Cultural Marxism got a foothold in America, how it progressed, and how, in precise steps, we can fight back to regain our institutions, regain our countryâ€”and win the future for our children.Bold, practical, and necessary, Unwoke is the book we need to restore the America we love.",
