  "title": "Lithuania Through the Wall: Diary of a Ten-Day Visit to My Native Land",
  "description": "Author's \"Returning to Lithuania, I suppose, is decidedly different from most trips home. It is not just a matter of boarding a bus or hopping a plane to reach the place of one's birth. It is that, but it is also like climbing a forbidden wall. After you have climbed the wall, the rest of the trip is probably like most of the others - a curious rediscovery of an unforgettable world almost lost in one's memory, a nostalgic summing up of lifelong experiences, a realization of one's own past. I left my native Lithuania in 1944 when I was seventeen years old, and I returned there in 1983. I had not seen the country, its cities, its people, my relatives, or my sister Aldona for almost forty years. This picture story is an attempt to share the impressions of my trip home. While I was in Lithuania, I followed the prescribed route. Our group stayed in Vilnius, the capital of the country, for ten days. Most of the images in this book were taken there. But we were also taken on one day excursions to other cities - Kaunas, Druskininkai, Rumsiskes, Trakai, Anyksciai, and Niuronys. At the beginning of the tour we were promised that each of us would be granted permission to visit our own home town. But the permissions never came through. So this story of 'going home' has to be told without pictures of my home in Vistytis and Kybartai, the towns where I was born and went to school as a child.\"",
