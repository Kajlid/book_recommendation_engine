  "description": "This is a young adult paranormal romance. One night, nearly two years ago, Keely Kiem was attacked. With her throat slit, she was left to rot on the cold, damp floor of a vacant warehouse. Keely survived, but not without consequences. Her mother believed the move to Hunt, Ohio would offer them protection and a fresh start. Some problems, however, cannot be outrun.  Keely thought she was the victim of a serial killer, but the truth she uncovers is much more terrifying. She belongs to another world she never knew existed. One with Watchers, Guardians, and Demons—and that is just her family.  The man targeting young girls and savagely murdering them is Keely’s own brother. Her friends are not who they pretend to be. Even Keely’s parents have been keeping crucial information from her. Her dad is not her dad, her mom has a secret life, and Keely’s true father is the King of Demons.Now Keely has the protection of Nick Wallace, her heartbreakingly handsome Guardian, and his unorthodox team of defenders. Though she may have survived the first assault, is Keely strong enough to face what is coming next? Can she make the necessary decision between life and love?",
