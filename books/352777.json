  "description": "A quiet stroll through the lives of three girls on the verge of something big, drawn in a loose calligraphic style. Three tales of hiking, Russian forest witches, and Dutch people. A collection of unconnected stories about girls in ephemeral landscapes - one dreaming, one grieving, one stuck. Queen's Day explores our internal landscapes and private moments in a painterly, expressionistic drawing style. Fall 1999 Xeric Foundation Grant winner.",
