When a single mistake forces her into the grasp of a successful, powerful, and wanted man, Asiya’s life is thrust into a dark and violent world hidden behind the glittering walls of a mansion.Lila has long since given up the idea of escaping. Five years have been stolen from her, and with little to go back to, she obediently serves as a maid to the Master of the house. Lila knows she’s a shell of herself and surrounded by people she cannot trust, but with nowhere as a home for her heart, what else can she do? When the two girls’ paths converge, their worlds shatter. HOME IS A SILHOUETTE is a stunning debut by Kataru Yahya, spinning a multi-POV loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast set in Ghana, where not all fairy tales are magical.",
