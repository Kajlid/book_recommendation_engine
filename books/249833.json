  "description": "Two boys. Two forms of magic. One powerful combination.  When Elliot Rivers, a Homo Sapiens, becomes friends with Barve, a Nean (Neanderthal) on their first day at university he has no idea of the conflict and fury it will cause among the students and staff, as well as within his family. To make matters more difficult, Barveâ€™s argumentative brother, Farlden, hates Elliot.  Elliot and Farlden both possess the rare gift of magic. The discovery that it becomes stronger when they combine their abilities creates a connection between them and, against their will, it draws them closer together, slowly changing animosity to something far more dangerous.  The Nean brothers are keeping an extraordinary secret, though, one that could shatter their complex relationships with Elliot and change all their lives.  This YA magic fantasy series will appeal to fans of \"Harry Potter\", Cassandra Clare's books and Rainbow Rowell's novel, \"Carry On\".",
