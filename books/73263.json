  "description": "One definition of renaissance is renewal of life, vigor, interest, etc.; rebirth; revival.The stories gathered here are expressions of that idea. Written at different times, for different reasons, they all share the same theme. I think the idea of renewal is an important part of life. We are always looking for ways to better ourselves. Sometimes, we are not aware of it and we receive a message from an unexpected place. Sometimes, the inspiration comes from a long forgotten memory. Whatever the case, we are given an opportunity that can easily slip by in a momentary encounter or even a dream.These stories may seem bittersweet, but to me they also represent hope.The award-winning story The Forgotten Well was selected for the Florida Writerâ€™s Association annual collection. I feel particularly honored for winning as the entrants were judged by peer authors.",
