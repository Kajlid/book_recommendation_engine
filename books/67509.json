  "description": "Laney watched her life disappear in the rear view mirror. If only her memories would disappear as well… She was two hours west of town when the lights in the big two-story brick house came on. She couldn’t possibly hear the shouting and cursing, yet her insides were knotted and her stomach churned. If he caught her, he would kill her. Of that she was certain. Forever Blessed is the story of a young mother who is on the run from an abusive husband with her three children in tow. Does Laney find safety from a controlling manipulating spouse? Does Paul track her down and make her pay for her disobedience? Where does God fit into all this? For fiction, Darlene Shortridge writes real stories for real people… In Forever Blessed, Ms. Shortridge carves a gripping and heartfelt tale about spousal abuse with stark conflicts and turbulent emotions, while entwining the tale with the Lord's eye-opening truth! Forever Blessed is about faith, triumph over trauma, a veil lifted from an unspeakable subject, and learning to rely on God’s sustaining strength. I look forward to book three of The Women of Prayer series!-Kathy Goodhew, author of A Vision Beyond Abuse and The Hidden Ones fantasy series",
