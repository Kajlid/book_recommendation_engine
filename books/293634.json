  "description": "Until Alina Price finds Roman Martinez on her examination table, the only thing she cares about is her work as an emergency physician. Outwardly it appears Alina has it all, a great job and the respect of her colleagues, but she struggles to move beyond the past where she grew up in a turbulent family-run tattoo business and motor cycle club.  Everything about Roman screams for Alina to run, but the attraction between them is unmistakable and Alina finds herself drawn into Roman’s world, which is much more complicated and heart-breaking than she would have ever have guessed. Although Roman presents a tough exterior, and garnered the nickname Turtle in an underground fighting ring, Alina uncovers a secret Roman has kept hidden from everyone.  A connection from their pasts is revealed and with secrets exposed, Alina can only hope Roman will believe he’s worth her love.",
