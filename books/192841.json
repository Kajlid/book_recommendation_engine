  "description": "Laurie Crane is happily married. And she is usually able to overlook her husband’s moments of quiet sadness. If only God would give them a child …  Pierce wants a child as badly as Laurie and has spent years praying alongside her. But he has no idea that a \"yes\" from God will unearth long-buried memories and bring their marriage to the brink of catastrophe.  In The Barn Church trilogy's first novel, The Spindle Chair, Shellie Arnold explores what happens when \"happily ever after\" becomes more than one couple can handle.",
