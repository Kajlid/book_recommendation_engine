  "title": "Beyond Friendship - Book 1 Starting Out",
  "description": "Starting Out follows the lives and loves of Americans Charlotte and her aunt, Emily (weirdly as they are much the same age), and British cousins Lucy and Poppy. The stories start in 1996 as the girls set out on their chosen paths. Charlotte, studious and ambitious for a career in Interior Design; will her career be derailed by the seriously sexy Bartolommeo her Italian design professor? Emily goes all out for fun, with a serious emphasis on sexual conquests; will her uninhibited behaviour return to haunt her? Lucy meets the man of her dreams and follows in her mother's footsteps up the aisle towards the happy ever after. Poppy lands in the lap of the Gods when her meteoric and successful modeling career leads to a Hollywood offer. The novel is the first of a series of four. The stories follow the lives of these main characters and a few others whom have made minor appearances in the series The Friendship Diaries. The stories from both series are woven together so that you will meet up again with Charlotte's mother, Caitlin and Emily's mother, Ariel. Lucy's mother, Penny, and Jo, mother to Poppy and William. The boys Simon, Lucy's brother and Rebecca's two sons Ty and Ben also make appearances. The stories were inspired by the family saga genre, which has been updated into a modern format wherein friendships often take the place of the old style extended families.",
