  "description": "FOREWORD BY BRYAN CHAPELL10,000 Miles With 10,000 Reasons: A Journey into the Heart of Africa is a gripping memoir of an American couple's extraordinary journey to adopt three orphaned children from a remote African village. A single correspondence between a thirteen-year-old African girl and an American couple ignited a spark that changed their world. It is a moving and emotional story about one girl's adoption that blossomed into a quest to also rescue twin boys, and then, an entire village. This compelling, dramatic narrative relates the many, maddening obstacles the Frantzes faced. Listen in as their faith is refined through a long and thorny adoption process that spans two continents. Their mission widens powerfully when the Frantzes were driven to also save an entire village from starvation. It is a captivating human story about the power of faith, hope, and undying resolve.10,000 Miles With 10,000 Reasons is as much a story about the bond between a mother and daughter as it is about the lengths to which adoptive parents must go in their quest to bring their children home. This is a true story of a mother's love that triumphs over insurmountable odds. You will laugh and cry as you relive Nancy's riveting, emotional journey; you will also be challenged and, God-willing, you too will be called to action.",
