  "description": "The Diary of a Nobodyis so unassuming a work that even its author, George Grossmith, seemed unaware that he had produced a masterpiece. For more than a century this wonderfully comic portrayal of suburban life and values has remained in print, a source of delight to generations of readers, and a major literary influence, much imitated but never equalled.If you don't recognise yourself at some point in The Diary of a Nobody you are probably less than human. If you can read it without laughing aloud you have no sens of humour.",
