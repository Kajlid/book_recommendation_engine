  "description": "What happens when a powerful Mexican cartel teams up with an Islamic terrorist group? An alliance of evil. Before being smuggled across the U.S. border, Arab terrorists are immersed in the Mexican culture and become fluent in Spanish. Once in the U.S., they easily blend in with the more than 37 million Latinos in America. Then, they act – with surgical precision, they launch a series of suicide bombing attacks on U.S. soil in retaliation for Bin Laden’s death. In Mexico, an elite CIA team is trying to track down the head of that terrorist group. But more attacks are coming and time is quickly running out.",
