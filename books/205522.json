  "description": "A major new biography of the Black Prince: hero of the battles of Crécy and Poitiers and England's greatest medieval warrior.As a child he was given his own suit of armour; in 1346, at the age of 16, he helped defeat the French at Crécy; and in 1356 he captured the King of France at Poitiers. For the chronicler Jean Froissart, 'He was the flower of all chivalry'; for the Chandos Herald, who fought with him, he was 'the embodiment of all valour'. Edward of Woodstock, eldest son and heir of Edward III of England, better known as 'the Black Prince', was England's pre-eminent military leader during the first phase of the Hundred Years War.Michael Jones uses contemporary chronicles and documentary material, including the Prince's own letters and those of his closest followers, to tell the tale of an authentic English hero and to paint a memorable portrait of warfare and society in the tumultuous fourteenth century.",
