Along the way he is visited by a ghost, meets a transsexual nurse, and experiences a budding romance. Together these events change David's understanding of the grief he carries. This witty novel is also a touching look at what it is to be gay in today's world.Â  It's also a saga about the last 25 years of gay sex and AIDS culture. Smith's characters look at difficult safer sex, barebacking, personal responsibility, and current HIV prevention methods - it asks why gay men bareback even though HIV remains a threat among gay men. Discover why the Bay Area Reporter says #SFCPT is \"an irresistible page-turner, that is inspirational without becoming treacly.\"",
