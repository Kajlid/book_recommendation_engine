  "description": "Music brought them together,But it just might tear them apart.Leaving New York.It was the best decision I ever made.Packing up and moving to the other side of the world changed me.I turned a new page, leaving the past behind.Amsterdam felt like home--for a while.But I was still stuck.Unable to move forward.Then, Lou Rivers showed up,Instantly, I felt my life shift again.A constant reminder of the life I once had,The mistakes I left behind.He's the musician I dreamed of being...If I were stronger, bolder, braver.But I wasnâ€™t. He taught me how to love music again,And for the first time, I feel like I know what to do.But how can I?How can I become myself without giving up on us?",
