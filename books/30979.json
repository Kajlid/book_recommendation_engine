But instead, with a loving touch, this mommy shows her child ways to do things for himself, going far to encourage her childâ€™s independence. And there is still plenty of opportunity for snuggling under the stars.This warm and humorous testament to all the loving things a supportive mom does each day is every bit as heartwarming as its predecessor and is sure to become a favorite for families everywhere.",
