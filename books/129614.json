  "description": "After moving to New York City to attend a prestigious acting school, Elize suddenly finds herself in a roller coaster of her life, filled with VIP parties, theatre auditions, film projects and even more excitedly chance-meeting her irresistible crush far too often for it to be anything less than fate.  One of her friends becomes a French lingerie model and the other marries a millionaire, while Elize’s biggest success is a leading role in a young adult drama where she unfortunately has to die from an overdose in the first scene and the man she’s madly falling for seems simply unattainable. What will it take to achieve that one thing that more and more girls nowadays dream of - to become an A-list celebrity? And will Elize be able to pay the price?  While her journey to self discovery is slowly turning out to be a lot less about sex and a lot more about the city that tends to send both devastating and hilarious reality checks on a regular basis, the people she meets and the experiences she survives are bound to change Elize’s life forever, for there is nothing more self-rewarding than giving yourself at least one shot at something really BIG.  Reminder: this story is loosely based on the author’s adventures in New York City back in the day when she was trying to become an actress. While most characters and events happened in real life, no actual names and titles have been used to retell the story.",
