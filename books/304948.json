For centuries that I have waited for peace now that wait has come to an end, but I worry that it's too late. I have finally found the light to my darkness, the goodness to combat my evil, but my coarseness, my complete unruliness will tint the goodness that is my woman. Can I be that selfish?FREYAI have been fighting myself, my life, my very existence but the moment I see Dane I know we have a connection. A connection that brings purpose and meaning to my life. He says I'm his, I know I'm his, now it's just convincing him that I'm not the delicate flower that he thinks I am.",
