  "description": "Her mind continued to race around the subject of her attention. He seemed to have noticed that he was being observed and he turned to face her.“Let me guess...you think you know me from somewhere?” he said in a small voice. She was taken aback by his question and took a few seconds to answer him“Oh no. Sorry for staring at you like that” she said with a small smile. He nodded and seemed to lose interest in her for a while. Then he turned to her and said.“I'm Dennis,”She nodded. Then turned to him and said“I'm Tamara. My boyfriend just broke up with me.”",
