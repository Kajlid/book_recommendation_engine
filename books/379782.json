  "description": "The legend of the lycanthrope–a human turned feral by a blood curse and transformed into the most savage of predatory beasts–is as old as recorded history . . . and as tantalizing as it is terrifying.Internationally acclaimed artist and illustrator Richard Corben has been bringing his dark and viscerally brilliant vision to comics, graphic novels, and other art forms for more than four decades. And now, legend meets legend, as Corben turns his masterful hand and gut-wrenching signature style to this bloodcurdling collection of tales devoted to the monster that walks like a man, howls like a hellhound, and hungers for the hunt.",
