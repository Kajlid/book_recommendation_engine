  "description": "All the Kliban people--from Houdini escaping New Jersey to the famed Genghis and Sylvia Khan.“Not to put down Crumb or Koren or Booth or Rodgriguez or Trudeau or anybody else, but Kliban’s Never Eat Anything Bigger than Your Head & Other Drawings is the only book I’ve read in years that made me howl. I mean thigh-slapping, roll-on-the-ground, can’t-catch-my-breath howling. And every time I go back to it, I find some new detail to chuckle at.”—Charles M. Young, Rolling Stone .",
