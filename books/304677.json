  "description": "Katie- Reckless was my middle name. All I wanted out of this small town was a little bit of attention, and that's exactly what I got and then some. Noah was my muse. He made my heartbeat in ways I never thought it would. But I was senseless and out of control. I wasn't the girl he wanted me to be so I pushed him away. Little did I know he would keep pushing me back. He took everything I threw at him. He never gave up. Noah- I have loved her from the day I met her. Those dark coffee-colored eyes, that even with the smallest stare, could burn a hole straight through me. Her blazing feistiness that excites me and makes me want to punch a wall at the same time. But she keeps pushing me away. No matter what I do it isn't good enough. Little does she know, I'm not giving up without a fight. I'm determined to make her see that we belong together. That she is the piece that completes me.",
