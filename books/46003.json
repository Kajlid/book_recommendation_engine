  "description": "I am sorry for everything. It shouldn't matter anymore, but it does, and I can't move on until I come to terms with the things I have done. I am now two thousand, five-hundred and eight years old, and I have far too much to atone for. I have loved, I have lost, and I have killed. I have witnessed golden eras and dark plagues, nations rise and fall, and people turned to dust and forgotten while I remain constant, always waiting, always watching.I was once an Aulor, a Child of Time. My name was Lani, and you, my dear sister Dia, you were my eternally innocent counterpart. But now I am nameless and forsaken by Time herself. I am dying, a slow, mortal death, the pain of which is eclipsed only by the abyss of my remorse. I was immortal and revered. Now I am human. Now I will die forgotten, but my echoes will reverberate until far beyond the end of my world.This is my life, my confession, my requiem, my vain attempt at salvaging sanity in the sliver of life I have remaining. A few words cannot fully redress my deeds, but hopefully they will be a small step toward another new beginning. So many years, so many dreams and nightmares fulfilled and forgotten. What have I done? Oh Dia, what have I done?Mayfly Requiem is the prequel to the Echoes of Oblivion trilogy, a history of Malora as seen through the eyes of a fallen immortal.",
