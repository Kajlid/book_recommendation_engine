  "description": "Originally published in 1926, Up & Down New York is an imaginative, charming, quirky, and delightful period piece-but it is also timeless. This facsimile edition of the nostalgic classic reproduces Sarg's delightful illustrations of the dynamic and vibrant streets and famous places in New York. The surprise is in finding how much remains the same in many New York neighborhoods after 80 years, including Grand Central Station, Times Square, The American Museum of Natural History, City Hall, the Stock Exchange, the Great White Way (Broadway), the shuttle in the subway-not to mention the busyness and vibrancy that characterizes the city. The places that do not exist anymore, including the aquarium at the Battery and Washington Market, give us a glimpse of New York in its first heyday. This new edition of Tony Sarg's Up & Down New York will appeal to kids of all ages, to designers, illustrators, and book collectors, as well as anyone interested in New York or 1920s-era drawings.",
