Then take a stroll through a most unusual market in this Caldecott Honor Book created by Anita Lobel and Arnold Lobel.Here is a world of wonders, from A to Z. Inspired by seventeenth-century French trade engravings, Anita Lobel's brilliant paintings of the shopkeepers on Market Street—each composed of his or her wares—will provide blissful hours for all who join the Lobels on an unforgettable shopping spree. \"In a delightful and unusual book, a boy trots down Market Street buying presents for a friend, each one starting with a letter of the alphabet. Every letter is illustrated by a figure ingeniously composed of, for instance, apples or wigs or quilts. The notion is original, and the sum total enjoyable and unique.\"—The Horn BookA Caldecott Honor Book, a New York Times Best Illustrated book, an ALA Notable Book, and a Boston Globe/Horn Book Honor Book for IllustrationSupports the Common Core State Standards",
