  "description": "A wallet, a thief, and a brilliant plan--what could possibly go wrong? At least that's what Stella thinks--until she and Pin Pin get caught with the goods, that is, and all heaven, hell and whatever's-in-between breaks loose, forcing the best friends to hit the road. Tag along as Stella and Pin Pin runaway to midtown Manhattan, all the while battling archrival Teresa Como for the title to SOHO's Annual Food Drive, their ticket to Regis Academy--a posh high school for girls, hidden far, far away in the Catskills. Oh-la-la, for the chance to leave home--for good! Problem is... the road isn't much safer than home, especially when the runaways attract the attention of police, museum officials and--worst of all--Stella's unforgiving father. Also pitted against their extravagant dream is the threat of Pin and her family's deportation, including baby sister, Audrey, who lies at the heart of this quirky coming-of-age novel--STELLA BELLAROSA: Tales of an Aspiring Teenage Superhero, a serious MG with a funny-bone.",
