  "description": "Dane Henson is not a risk-taker. Born and bred in middle America, the most courageous thing Dane ever did was move two hours north to Minneapolis to join a graduate program straight out of college. Young, handsome, and the sort of guy everybody gets along with, Dane's exterior hides a shyness and conservative nature that keeps him well and truly out of love's way.After starting work as a salesman for a clothing wholesaler, his days and weeks are spent on the road hustling fashion accessories to make a sale. And six months into his new career, Dane has learned to use his youthful exuberance and good looks to his advantage. Both his sales results and his star, are definitely on the rise. But a big part of his success has come from a relationship forged with the flamboyant Stef Moon, buyer for the five hundred store 'Christopher and Banks' fashion chain.Returning from his regular Friday afternoon call on Stef, Dane is excited to ring the sales bell, signaling another extraordinary sales performance. But the gods seem to have other ideas. A one-hour commute quickly becomes a ten-mile carpark with no end in sight. Dane has always relied on his GPS for navigating his new town, but now he must choose whether to take a risk and forge his own path or end up sitting in traffic for hours.....CHAPTER ONEEXCUSE ME, MR Hеnsоn.
