  "description": "Marvellous Hairy -a novel in five fractals - So hair is sprouting in unspeakable places and you can no longer carry a tune, but if you're a surrealistic artiste with an addiction to Freudian mythology and guilt-free sex, turning into a monkey has its upsides. Nick Motbot may be evolving as a novelist, but his friends aren't too sure about his DNA â€” at least, not since Gargantuan Enterprises started experimenting with it. And once they figure out what's hap-pening to him, they decide to set things right. MARVELLOUS HAIRY is a satirical novel about a group of friends sticking it to the man the only way they know how, with equal parts grain alcohol and applied Chaos Theory.Literary Fiction | Fabulist Satire",
