  "title": "Inner Sanctum: Tales of Horror, Mystery and Suspense",
  "description": "The Inner Sanctum is one of the most fondly remembered mystery and horror radio shows from the 1940s—it is brought to life here with striking illustrations that re-create four chilling tales. In \"The Horla,\" a man is haunted by a mysterious, grotesque being that only he can see. At first, the being seeks to enslave the man, but in the end it turns out the being is actually out to destroy him. \"Death of a Doll\" tells the tale of a reporter who is investigating the identity and death of an unidentified female corpse. Throughout his investigation, he carries her doll with him and, instead of “mama,” the doll continually cries out “Kara Nana,” another name for the devil. \"The Undead\" follows a young woman as she discovers a 10-year-old obituary for her living husband. Terrified, she goes to his tomb to investigate. The last story in the collection, \"Alive in the Grave,\" follows a man who may have unwittingly consigned another man to being buried alive.",
