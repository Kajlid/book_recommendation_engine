  "description": "A rock star and FAITH story...Faith wants to experience the world, but her father keeps her on a tight leash.Rock star Michael jumps from one conquest to another without even remembering their names.The first time they meet, she knows he is a sin she has to avoid.Which wouldn’t be a problem if Michael wouldn’t crave to corrupt that innocent doe-eyed nurse. And if Faith would keep her eyes above his sculpted chest. And if Michael would stop pushing her boundaries to set her free from her family!She needs to have a lot of FAITH to avoid being marked by his sins…While the romance in FAITH is a stand-alone, the plot is a continuation of events that began in BACKSTAGE and PAPARAZZI (Roadies series #1 and #2). It is strongly recommended you read BACKSTAGE and PAPARAZZI prior to reading this novel. Enjoy!",
