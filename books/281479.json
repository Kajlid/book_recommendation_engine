Reluctantly, she puts her own dreams to the side to take her place in society. But Mara's marriage does not turn out to be anything like what she had been led to believe. Valentine is cold, distant, and with time she realizes that he is hiding a secret large enough to rip their lives apart, a secret even more dangerous than the countless war crimes he perpetrated during his career.

This complicated love story between a closeted man and his young wife, set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, is followed by a free ‘what if’ short story.  **Dark Erotic Romance, bittersweet HEA.
