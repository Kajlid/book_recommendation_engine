Now he's taking it back! An embittered holocaust survivor cannot speak of what he was forced to do to survive. A young girl in Texas is haunted by a memory of something she could not have lived. Together, they must unlock the gates of memory to find the hope that lies beyond despair.  * * * Alex was seventeen years-old when he was deported together with his family to Birkenau. His mother and younger sister were gassed on arrival. Alex lived on past the end of his world, his memory filled with the death of a people. Unable to speak of what he had done to survive, he was locked in the silent prison of his guilt.Yael, born and raised in Texas, has no connection with Alex or with the world he has lost. And yet her seemingly idyllic life is haunted by a dark memory of something she could not have lived. Her search for the source of the memory will lead her on a quest spanning three continents, and eventually to a new life in Israel. But her true journey will lead into memory itself, as she helps Alex to keep his promises to the dead.",
