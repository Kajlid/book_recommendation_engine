  "description": "Safety is an illusion.We’re back to where we started – two sisters living under a government we can’t trust. The rest of our friends are dead or missing. Texas should be our haven, but have we traded one prison for another?There are larger things at work; more allies and enemies to be found. They all look the same to us. The Texans want us to fall in line. The rebels want us to fight. The Americans want us to leave them alone.The colonies are more dangerous than we imagined, and we’re caught in the middle. Not all of us are meant to be soldiers, but the time for indecision has passed. What do you call someone who doesn’t trust the fight? A liability.Sides must be chosen. Bonds must be broken. And the war will begin.",
