  "description": "The author of \"Moe Howard Died For Our Sins\" is back with a new collection of short stories that again shows why reviewers have called him \"devious\" and \"a natural born storyteller.\" \"Return of the Dittos\" takes readers on another wild romp. Whether depicting a bagboy revolt or the impending end of the world, these 20 tales are sometimes weird, occasionally outrageous but always thoroughly entertaining. This collection will engage you - and your imagination - from its first page to its last.",
