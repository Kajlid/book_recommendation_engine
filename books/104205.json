  "description": "Silence followed for half a minute, although it felt a lot longer for Elana. She could hear the thumping heart in her chest as the seconds ticked by and sense the visored eyes all pointing at her.\t“You may leave, Elana Mayne,” said the guard as he handed back her ID.\tWith no further words, or hint of an explanation, the group of Community Guards marched off through the corridors of the college library.\tElana was physically and mentally shaken, yet accepting of the situation too. After all, this was normality. The decisions and actions of the Government, and its various departments, were not to be questioned. 'Know that we are always working for you. We make the decisions, so you don't have to. We make the laws, so you are always safe. Trust our judgement.'\tA future not so far away … the world changed after the virus. It spread across the globe at a cruel speed, cutting through the population with no remorse.Every aspect of life transformed; the balance of power, law, education … the very core of society itself became moulded by the new global power - they control everything; Central Government.\tSixteen year old Elana Mayne overhears a secret conversation and witnesses a terrible crime. Her world crumbles afterwards and she is lost, surrounded by lies … changed forever. Can she learn to trust again? Can she fight the regime that betrayed and so easily abandoned her? Is she capable of revenge?",
