  "description": "FROM WITCH I CAME is a novel that transcends the boundaries of the ordinary and leads you on a journey through the realm of the supernatural. It is based on the life of psychic, Emily ‘Dolly’ Tierney Deebs. This is not your everyday story. Dolly is a religious woman by day who lifts the veil of time each night. Her life is a contradiction, nurtured and played out through the devilish touch of her mother‘s fingers, a Ouija board as her mentor. FROM WITCH I CAME takes you back in time to a young girl caught up in her mother’s world of psychic phenomenon, spells, chants and card readings. She learned to dabble in the ethereal choosing to share the gift of her psychic soul. The child in her suffered mental and physical abuse at the hands of the DEVIL herself and lived to survive it all. To this day, she lives amid the shadows of her mother’s existence. It is a shadow that comes to life much too often.",
