  "description": "It has been thirteen years since the community took down Cyrus, and Harriet and Dorothy escaped. Paul and Tiffany now have a family of four children and couldn't be happier. The community is now the safest it has ever been since meeting Valerie and Aldophous. Members can live happily without worrying about another attack from the energy vampires who are almost eradicated, and children can run freely in the community without their parents' worrying. That is, until one evening at a party when they face an old threat from some old enemies, who have other ways of targeting the community without energy vampires. Will the community be able to eliminate the threat, and get things back to the way they should be?",
