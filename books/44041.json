  "description": "THIS BOOK IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE UNDER THIS NAME. ITS NEW TITLE IS THE GIRLS ON ROSE HILL AND IT IS AVAILABLE ON KINDLE.  Ellen Murphy spent her childhood in an idyllic house by the sea. A house surrounded by flower-filled gardens and a white picket fence. A house she fled at eighteen. A house full of secrets. When her mother Rose, an ex-nun, is diagnosed with terminal cancer, Ellen reluctantly returns home to care for her and uncovers a clue to the one secret that has haunted Ellen all her life: the identity of her father. But that is just one of the many secrets hidden behind the beautiful facade of the house on Prospect Road. Ellen discovers the high price both her mother and her Irish grandmother paid for the house on Prospect and she realizes that her meek mother is more of stranger to her than her absent father.",
