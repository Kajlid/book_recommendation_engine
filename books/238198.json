  "title": "The Last Fighting General: The Biography of Robert Tryon Frederick",
  "description": "This is the full story of the legendary U.S. Army officer who formed, trained, and led the unique bi-national First Special Service Force (popularly known as the Devils Brigade). Robert T. Frederick was the youngest ground forces general, the youngest division commander, and one of the most decorated American soldiers in World War II. But Frederick was not just a warrior. Highly intelligent, he was an independent thinker who was as courageous and innovative in peacetime as he was in combat. He pioneered racial integration on army training bases, devised training regimens used throughout North America, and left a record that would seem mythical if not documented. The author also reveals why Frederick ended his brilliant career prematurely.",
