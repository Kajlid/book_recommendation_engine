She’s a costume designer for a Broadway show in New York and part owner in Keenen’s Irish Pub with her brothers and sister-in-law. Everything is perfect ... or so she thinks. It’s only a matter of time before odd things start happening around her, forcing Kylah to confront her past in order to save her future. Destined to become a warrior of The Nine–a unique band of Celtic fighters chosen for their individual talents and supernatural skills, Kylah has to reconcile her lost memories when the brave band is put to the test by the leader of the Sluagh. War wages and both sides will stop at nothing to exact their vengeance, especially when they realize Kylah is at the center of it all.",
