  "description": "Anya Rosen and her family have left their home in Odessa for Shanghai, believing that China will be a safe haven from Hitler's forces. At first, Anya's life in the Jewish Quarter of Shanghai is privileged and relatively she has crushes on boys, fights with her mother, and longs to defy expectations just like her hero, Amelia Earhart.Then Anya finds a baby—a newborn abandoned on the street. Amelia Earhart goes missing. And it becomes dangerously clear that no place is safe—not for Jewish families like the Rosens, not for Shanghai's poor, not for adventurous women pilots.Based on a true story, here is a rich, transcendent novel about a little-known time in Holocaust history.",
