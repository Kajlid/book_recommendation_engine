  "description": "Secret confession – I love Dirty Talk.  A standalone romance with an HEA ending and no cliffhangers.   James Fowler and Lucas Bennett are the sexiest guys in New Summit. Vloggers, celebrities and hosts of the \nhottest, steamiest\n show on the internet. Dirty Talk.  I might be a teeny bit attracted to them.  Oh, who am I kidding? I can’t get enough of them. They’re two huge temptations and I can’t resist.  TWO. HUGE. MASSIVE. TEMPTATIONS.  And they’re in my coffee shop every day, enticing me, calling to me, \nwhispering that a little sin won’t matter…\n  But I can’t let myself give in. I can’t have a threesome. As much as I want to say yes - as much as I want to scream and moan their names - I have to say no.  Because I’m at the brink of getting everything I’ve ever wanted, and James and Lucas are just a distraction.  Right?",
