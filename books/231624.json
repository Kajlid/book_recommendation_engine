A feared enforcer, the bosses knew Tony would do whatever it took to protect their interests. The \"Little Guy\" built a criminal empire that was the envy of mobsters across the country, and his childhood pal, Frank Cullotta helped him do it. But Tony's quest for power and lack of self-control with women cost the Mob its control of Vegas, and Tony paid for it with his life.From Dennis N. \"I was a little nervous before my first meeting with former mobster Frank Cullotta. It turned out we had a pleasant conversation that ended with an agreement for me to write his book. As I drove home, I realized I had made a deal with a career thief and killer on a handshake. What was I thinking?\"\"Extraordinary insights.\"--Nick Pileggi, #1 New York Times-bestselling author and screenwriter of Casino",
