  "description": "This hilarious Southern retelling of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice tells the story of two hard-headed Civil war historians who find that first impressions can be deceiving.Shelby Roswell, a Civil War historian and professor, is on the fast track to tenure&#8212;that is, until her new book is roasted by the famous historian Ransom Fielding in a national review. With her career stalled by a man she&#8217;s never met, Shelby struggles to maintain her composure when she discovers that Fielding has taken a visiting professorship at her small Southern college. Ransom Fielding is still struggling with his role in his wife&#8217;s accidental death six years ago and is hoping that a year at Shelby&#8217;s small college near his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, will be a respite from the pressures of Ivy League academia. He never bargained for falling in love with the one woman whose career&#8212;and pride&#8212;he injured, and who would do anything to make him leave. When these two hot-headed southerners find themselves fighting over the centuries-old history of local battles and antebellum mansions, their small college is about to become a battlefield of Civil War proportions. With familiar and relatable characters and wit to spare, Pride, Prejudice and Cheese Grits shows you that love can conquer all&#8230;especially when pride, prejudice, love, and cheese grits are involved!",
