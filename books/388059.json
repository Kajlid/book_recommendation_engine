  "description": "From the 2012 John W. Campbell Award Nominee and Two Time Parsec Award Winner\"Lafferty's most memorable and exciting creation to date.\" ~Goodreads.com\"...a really fun read. I love the setting (an alien settlement on the moon becomes \"Mollywood\", the hottest cultural Mecca of the 21st century), as well as how it looked at art, media, and commerce and the sometimes messy ways that they interact.\" ~Goodreads.comHave you ever tasted a symphony? Listened to a seven course meal?An alien species brings back the old artist patronage system, and suddenly Sally Ride Lunar Base is transformed into the new artistic center of the “Mollywood.” These aliens can do amazing things with art and the senses, allowing a painting, for example, to stimulate other senses than simply sight. Marco wanted a coveted patronage, once. But then his girlfriend got one and shuttled off to Mollywood for fame and fortune, and Marco stayed home, waiting for his own patron. His career faltered. His agent dumped him. But then he gets THE call. But he’s about to find out that an artistic patronage isn’t what it was in the good old days, and that the only friend he’s made, a tiny old woman who’s the star of a blood sports reality series called The Most Dangerous Game, has secrets of her own.Nominated for the 2011 Parsec Award for Best Novella Podcast",
