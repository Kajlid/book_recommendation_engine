  "description": "The fourth novel set in L. J. McDonald’s richly imagined world of the elemental sylphs returns readers to the kingdom of Meridal, where an invisible, deadly force has descended…Former concubine Eapha now sits on the throne as the carefree—if negligent—queen of a corrupt desert empire. As the ambassador from Sylph Valley, Devon Chole travels to Meridal, aided by an air sylph named Airi—and saddled with a crippling fear of battle sylphs. Upon his arrival, Devon quickly falls for Zalia, a young virgin waitress who has recently become the object of a supremely handsome battle sylph’s unyielding lust. But there are worse dangers than battle sylphs…Unseen and insatiable, it threatens to consume all life in its path. And should it reach the heart of Meridal, even an army of battle sylphs will be helpless in the face of a creature known only as The Hunter.",
