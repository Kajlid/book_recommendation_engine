  "description": "A story that reveals what it really takes to weather life's storms.Girl with the Crooked Smile is a riveting tale of survival sprinkled with true wit-a la Erma Bombeck meets potty-mouthed Joan Rivers-intertwined with self-discovery, love, tragedy and the unbreakable will to survive it all.Darah takes readers on an intense and moving journey that begins with her diagnosis of a brain tumor. At the time pregnant with the fourth of her five children and living in Latin America, she undergoes surgery that steals the hearing in one ear and leaves her face deformed. But those concerns quickly take a backseat to dealing with the hardships that follow: a suicide, an armed robbery, a gruesome accident and a business collapse that leaves her family penniless. Zeledon confronts reality with courage as she fights to keep her sanity and, along the way, finds the strength to share her newfound insights.A portion of the proceeds from the sale of this book go to the Adam Silverman Memorial Hope Club Fund. Named for Darah's late brother, these after school programs teach teens and college students leadership, problem-solving skills and life coping tools in a relaxed, nonjudgmental environment. Thank you for your generous support.Published by Sterling Publishing Group: http://sterlingpublishinggroup.com",
