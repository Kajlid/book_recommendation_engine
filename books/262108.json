  "description": "I have always loved him.  Though that love has evolved, metamorphosed, transmuted over time (and sometimes it felt a little—maybe a lot—like hate), what hasn’t ever changed is that I love him.  But I didn’t comprehend the depth of my love, the teeth and claws and desperate prayers of my love, until six hours ago:  They say he’s missing…  The Royal Zodiac—me and my inner circle—hasn’t been complete these past two years since the attack. Every time we get close to a potential candidate to recruit into our ranks, they disappear, the most likely scenario being that Medusa and her minions got to them first.  And now she has Dalair.  I won’t rest until I get him back.  My name is Sophia Victoria St. James. I am Queen of the Pure Ones.  This is my Awakening.",
