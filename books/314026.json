  "description": "An anthology of near future science fiction from VICE's acclaimed, innovative digital speculative story destination, Terraform--in print for the first time.Terraform hones the predictive capacity of science fiction and seeks new, vivid, and visceral ways to depict the future we're hurtling toward, translating the decay and anxiety that surround us into something else, something unexpected, something that burns like a beacon and upends the conventional ideas of where we'll end up next.Section by section--Watch/Worlds/Burn--the book takes on surveillance, artificial intelligence, and climate collapse. With a potent roster of established names and rising talents--from Bruce Sterling, Ellen Ullman, Cory Doctorow, Jeff VanderMeer, and Omar El Akkad, to E. Lily Yu, Elvia Wilk, Fernando Flores, Tochi Onyebuchi, and Gus Moreno--it confronts the issues that orbit our everyday existence, and takes them to unsettling dimensions.",
