  "description": "The last thing Edward Schuett remembers was a zombie attack on his family on the Fourth of July. When he wakes up, things are different. He is different.Fifty years have passed since the so-called Zombie Uprising. Zombies roaming the countryside are an everyday - even manageable - part of life. The coasts of the United States have recovered to become thriving metropolises while the interior still struggles with the day to day zombie problem. And Edward is one of them. But Edward is hardly an everyday member of the undead. His flesh is rotten but healing quickly. He can once again think and talk, but he still carries the zombie virus in his system. While some react to him with curiosity, the rest act with hostility. It seems half the population wants a bullet in his head while the other half wants to dissect him. All Edward wants is to understand what happened to him and what became of his family.Now Edward is on the run across the country, searching for his answers with a series of unlikely allies. His journey will take him from futuristic scientific labs to the burned-out ruins of small-town America, looking for the people who can tell him why he is different. But there are those who will not stop until he is destroyed- especially when it is discovered that Edward possesses a unique ability that may just make him the most powerful biological weapon in history.",
