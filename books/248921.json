  "description": "Gordo's always been there for Lizzie-a true best friend. But when he starts secretly dating pretty Brooke Baker, everything changes. Now Gordo's making up stupid excuses to ditch Lizzie. Gordo's certainly not boyfriend material, so Brooke must be two-timing him. Lizzie advises Gordo to dump Brooke before he gets hurt. Plus, a cute neighborhood paperboy gives Lizzie her first kiss-and her first broken heart.",
