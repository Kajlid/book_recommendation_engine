  "description": "Almost Paradise (book two in the contemporary romance Aloha Series)   Angela Carson's life is not unfolding according to plan. She's twelve years behind the curve in her search for love, marriage and babies. In that order.  Survivor of an explosion that killed his buddy, former Navy Explosive Ordinance Disposal tech Billy Everrett doesn't believe he deserves a life of his own.  When a life-changing diagnosis threatens to close Angela's biological window forever, Billy's desire to help her achieve her dream might change both their plans in ways neither ever expected.   More about the contemporary romance Aloha series:  Chris Keniston's love of a good story and frustration with the end of a well known author's romance best seller, drove her to pen her own works of romance and fiction.  The popular beach read themes of small town and Hawaii beaches blended with the story of a single dad, lost love, and a surprise son have landed the first in the series, Aloha Texas, on the Kindle top military list and made the contemporary romance novel a reader's choice.  Almost Paradise is the fifth romance novel for Chris and the second book in the Aloha series. Continuing with the well loved themes of Hawaii beaches and former military heroes, Almost Paradise explores love, marriage, babies, and life after war for a wounded hero.  Currently working on the third book in the Aloha series, Chris is having fun with the next change coming to the regulars at the Big Island Dive shop.",
