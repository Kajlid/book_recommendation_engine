  "description": "Being a vampire for hundreds of years, Hammer knew all about promises when he made one to Morta Fox. The problem was, he never counted on her being the most stubborn, big-mouthed, unbelievably amazing vampire he’d ever met. He wasn’t supposed to fall in love with her, but he did. Stuck in the Red Dimension for seven years, it’s hard to hold onto hope, until Hammer runs into his Doyen. Ray Bardos has been trapped in there for more than a century, and now he claims to know a way out. Hammer would do anything at all if it means seeing Morta again, so he doesn’t ask questions. To get out, he must give away a part of himself. He’s willing and ready, but he has no idea what exactly this means until it’s too late. And when Hammer finally makes it out of the Red Dimension, Morta Fox isn’t the only vampire he needs to find.",
