  "title": "The High Calling",
  "description": "A novel from the best-selling author of \"In His Steps: What Would Jesus Do?\"The story, \"The High Calling,\" was written at two different periods, in 1909 and 1910, and was read at two different periods, chapter by chapter, to the young people in my church, on successive Sunday evenings.  The main purpose of the story is to illustrate the value of the average family training and the final victory of the spiritual ideals over material or physical attractions. The final outcome of the struggle which Helen Douglas makes between her natural inclination to follow a life of ease and luxury, and the real training which she has received at home, is the picture of what is going on in the best homes to-day.  As my own young people gave the story a beautiful reception in their listening to it, it is my earnest hope that if the book has the good fortune to find a larger audience it may reach more young people with the same message.",
