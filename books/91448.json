  "title": "Valley of Promises",
  "description": "Brought to their knees by the Great Drought of the 1930s, Will Hasper and his family give up their farm in Wisconsin to join a federal government project starting a colony of transplanted farmers in the Matanuska Valley of Alaska. However, the colonists meet resistance from earlier homesteaders in the Valley and their leader, Ray Townsend. Laurel, Will’s daughter, who put aside her own desires and dreams to follow her family to Alaska, finds herself torn between two men vying for her love—Adam, a reporter writing a story on the colony’s experiences, and Robert, a colonist who can offer Laurel the stability she needs. For the colony to survive, they must all learn to trust God’s promises.",
