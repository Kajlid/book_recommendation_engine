But when she arrives for her first day on the job, she finds herself face-to-face with some serious club member attitude. And there's an even bigger surprise waiting for the gorge senior boy she's been pining over ever since they met at a swimming competition earlier this year.Can Abby break through the rules, regs, and mean girls to be the first-ever non-club member to win the summertime lifeguarding competition and maybe even the boy of her dreams?",
