  "title": "The Red Ripper",
  "description": "The shocking true story of the Russian serial killer who brutally murdered more than fifty victims--and evaded capture for over a decade.By the time he was brought to trial in 1992, Soviet serial killer Andrei Chikatilo had killed more than fifty women and children, often sexually abusing them and leaving their bodies mutilated beyond recognition. Although he was initially arrested in 1984, the police lacked enough evidence to pin the unsolved murders on him and he was able to torture and kill dozens more before his eventual conviction. Compiling exclusive interviews and trial transcripts, journalist and editor at London's Sunday Times Peter Conradi reveals how the grandfather and former teacher carried out a horrific twelve-year killing spree right under the nose of authority.Based on extensive research into Chikatilo's past and the elements of Soviet society that allowed his crimes to go unsolved for so long, Conradi delves into the life of one of history's most prolific and disturbing serial killers. Interviews with Moscow police detectives detail the fervent hunt for the man who preyed on young children, prostitutes, and runaways--a search that turned up many dead ends and false convictions before a massive undercover surveillance effort ultimately nabbed Chikatilo.A chilling look into the deranged mind of a monster, The Red Ripper is a comprehensive and shocking true crime account--plus photos--of one of the twentieth century's deadliest killers and the manhunt to catch him.",
