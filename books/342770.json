  "description": "Wealth, privilege, and way too many pastel-tinted opinions...that’s Carly’s life. And guess what? It’s. Getting. On. Her. Nerves.Carly wants to be real, and she’s always counted on her little sister, Anna, to love her and support her—and tell her how right she is. But when Anna turns “hot” over the course of a single summer, everything goes weird. Suddenly Anna’s swimming in the deep end with the big girls—the plastic-perfect-pretty girls—while Carly watches, hurt, from the kiddie pool. And of course there are boys involved, complicating things as boys always do.With warmth, insight, and an unparalleled gift for finding humor even in stormy situations, beloved author Lauren Myracle dives into the tumultuous waters of sisterhood and shows that even very different sisters can learn to help each other stay afloat.",
