  "description": "If you lost everyone you loved, would you still fight to save the world that destroyed them? The world has been promised to the demons, once the last human is gone, but even they must adhere to the rules set down by the monarchs of heaven. True to their nature, the demons decide to speed thing up a bit. They are reanimating the mortal dead with the most evil of demon society, interfering with presidents, emperors, terrorists, and the media to create havoc on earth and ensuring Armageddon. A demon calling himself \"The Boatman\" leads the clandestine war against mankind. Manny Rapier receives a phone call that shreds her perfect life. Her sister has walked off a second floor balcony, falling to her death. Far worse, she carried her infant daughter with her. From the depths of her darkest grief, Dr. Rapier must turn inside herself, and find the hero she was born to be-the only person alive who can save humanity from the clutches of The Boatman. Many offer their allegiance to Manny, but when demons and angels all look the same, whom do you trust?",
