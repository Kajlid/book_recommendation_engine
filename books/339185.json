  "description": "Life was easy for Nichole Singleton, with a voice like an angel, a job she adores, and a church she has called home since her teens. While Jeffrey, Nichole's loving husband, has control over the life they are living, Nichole still feels blessed. . .until her gambling \"hobby\" turns into a personal cross to bear that threatens to destroy her marriage. Through her trials and tribulations, will Nichole remember to put her trust in God and reaffirm her faith in the Lord, or will she see her marriage and gambling habit as bigger than even the God she serves?",
