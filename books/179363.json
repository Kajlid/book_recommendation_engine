  "description": "Cole Doren is starting over. He's moved, started working as a food writer again, and is crushing hard on his new neighbor, Daniel Mazurek, who is a genuinely nice guy and as hot as a supernova.Too bad for Cole, Daniel's not what he seems.And too bad for Daniel, the cute boy-next-door's DNA says he's one of America's most wanted, and it's Daniel's job to confirm that and bring him down. Digging through Cole’s past, Daniel finds out about Cole’s BDSM videos and while it should set off warning bells, it only leaves Daniel damn hot for Cole. Getting closer to his subject is easy, but starting a relationship built on trust is a lot harder when everything Daniel’s ever told Cole has been a lie.",
