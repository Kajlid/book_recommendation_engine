  "description": "\"The hope of love burns at the center of this remarkable collection.” —Melissa Pritchard, award-winning author of A Solemn PleasureIn a style reminiscent of John Cheever and Alice Munro, Michael Nye's second collection of stories, Until We Have Faces, contends with transfixing marital and familial estrangement, ways of trespass, the intractable mysteries and frights of modern life, the uncertainty of knowledge and truth, the gulfs between people and the technology we use, the frailty of our economic lives. Yet hope remains amongst these struggles. With his consummate skill, penetrating wit, and unfailing emotional generosity on full display in this fine new collection, award-winning storyteller Michael Nye brings together nine indelible short stories to provide an intimate look into the flawed nature of humanity, the universal questions of modern life, and the unending persistence of love amidst it all.",
