The aliens had destroyed the research planet Delta Cygnus 4 in a cataclysmic explosion, killing thousands of humans — humans who had infected the Frinn with the deadly bio-engineered virus known as the Infinity Plague.The spacecraft Hippocrates, manned by the survivors, now pursues the Frinn to their homeworld — to annihilate them. Otherwise, they fear, Earth itself will be destroyed in a horrifying alien Armageddon. Walden alone believes peace is possible...and he may soon be an unwilling party to interstellar genocide.",
