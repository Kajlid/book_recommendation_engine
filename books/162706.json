  "description": "In an effort to compensate for her own mother's cruel abandonment, Eve Tilden has let her daughter, Audrey, indulge in childish obsessions with mythical creatures for too long. Just seventeen, Audrey refuses to step toward womanhood, preferring the world of make-believe to the real one. Carl, Eve's husband focuses on a solo photography exhibition for Daphne, Eve's mother. He is determined to treat Audrey like she is normal teenager. When preparing for the kitchen remodel, Eve uncovers a box of concert t-shirts at the back of her closet that unleash memories of the life she had before Carl. Demolition disrupts the house, upsetting Audrey in alarming ways. But as Nick, their contractor and a stunning young surfer, becomes part of the household Eve's rebel self makes a comeback. Inspired by her rock concert past, Eve finds an unconventional way to seduce Audrey out of the isolation and fantasy that hold her captive. REMODELING EVE braids a narrative of mother around daughter as the events of a kitchen remodel transform both of their worlds.",
