  "description": "17-year-old Sophie lies on her deathbed in California, awaiting the inevitable loss of her battle with cancer…17-year-old Declan stares down two armed thugs in a back alley in Galway, Ireland…18-year-old Anat attempts to traverse a booby-trapped tunnel between Israel and Egypt…   All three strangers should have died at the exact same moment, thousands of miles apart. Instead, they awaken together in an abandoned hospital—only to discover that they’re not alone. Three other teens from different places on the globe are trapped with them. Somebody or something seems to be pulling the strings. With their individual clocks ticking, they must band together if they’re to have any hope of surviving.     Soon they discover that they've been trapped in a future that isn't of their making: a deadly, desolate world at once entirely familiar and utterly strange. Each teen harbors a secret, but only one holds the key that could get them home. As the truth comes to light Sophie, Declan, Anat, and the rest must decide what to do with a second chance at life—if they can survive to claim it.",
