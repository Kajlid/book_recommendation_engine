  "description": "The West has been ravaged and dehumanized by totalitarian socialists allied with the Communist Chinese. The few remaining free men and women constituting the resistance on the coast continue to defy the dictatorship of the resentful, but know that their time is running out. Rather than have the tide take them or surrender outright, the resistance is mobilizing to mount one final stand. If any are to survive the regime's mental collectivization, they will need a miracle and plenty of gunpowder.",
