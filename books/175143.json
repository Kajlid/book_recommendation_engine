  "description": "Some who see me, see that I'm a rock star. Others see me just by my appearance...or my talent. But one woman, just one, saw past all that. Even when I dragged her through the f*cking dirt she got back up and dusted herself off. Her blue eyes pierced right through me, weakening me. Her voice soothed, calmed me. She riled me up and got me going, then slammed on the brakes.  Then I f*cked everything up...  I hate everything right now, but I really wish I could hate her. It would make things so much fucking easier if I could.  But I cant... I'm f*cking in love with her.  ~Tristan",
