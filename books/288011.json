  "description": "I’m Selena Pearce, and in the past few days I’ve been kidnapped by faeries, gifted with powerful magic, and forced by the gods to compete in a twisted game to the death.  Growing up on the magical island of Avalon should be great... but I have no magic to speak of. And my parents forbid me from leaving.  So when I sneak out to Earth for a night and meet a hottie named Julian with ice blue eyes that leave me breathless, of course I say yes to a date with him. But when Julian pulls me through a magical portal, I realize he isn’t human. He’s a half-blood faerie sent to bring me to his realm of the Otherworld. Because apparently, I’m a half-blood faerie, too. And I’ve been chosen to compete in the annual Faerie Games—a brutal, gladiator-like competition where half-bloods fight to the death.  Too bad I can’t get my new magic under control. But with all eyes on me, I only have two options: Die in the Faerie Games, or win and earn my freedom.  Now the other players—including Julian, who still captivates me even though I should hate him—better watch out. Because I’m determined to get home.  And I’ll fight anyone blocking my path to get there.  Full of magic, mythology, adventure, and romance, The Faerie Games is the first book in an addicting young adult urban fantasy series by USA Today bestselling author Michelle Madow that will keep you reading late into the night!",
