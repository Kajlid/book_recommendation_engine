  "description": "From the award-winning and renowned illustrator Thomas Locker, beautiful oil-painted illustrations pair with this wonderful retelling of the traditional Dutch folktale. Jan had never done anything more heroic than shout for the guard because he’d imagined he’d seen a sea serpent. But when Jan discovered water trickling through a desolate stretch of the dike that protected his low-lying village, he knew he had to act fast. “Visually stunning.”— Publishers Weekly\"Locker's depiction of nature overpowering humanity is especially significant to the story and to the Dutch people who have spent centuries battling the sea.\"-- School Library Journal",
