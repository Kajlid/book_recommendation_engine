  "title": "Blood of Patriots",
  "description": "What would you do if the unthinkable happened? The President of the United States, fearing impeachment, uses his executive powers to establish total control over the county â€“ no matter what the cost. But a startling public confession by a prominent U.S. Senator results in a breakdown of the President's Machiavellian scheme. Having witnessed this abuse of power first hand, retired Special Forces Colonel, Ty Denham, is compelled to act, hoping that if he reveals the truth, it will inspire his countrymen to stand up for their freedom, liberty, and the principals on which the United States of America was founded. Overreach is a gripping tale of courage, sacrifice, and patriotism.",
