  "description": "What’s the worst thing that could happen to a blushing bride?After Zoe is jilted by her fiancé Jason, she’s unable to face the pitying looks of her friends and family any longer.Fleeing to America, she is employed as a nanny by the moody, difficult, but devastatingly sexy, single dad Ryan.She quickly wins over his children, but her boss is more of a challenge. Things aren’t helped, of course, by her inadvertently displaying her knickers to his colleagues or nearly hospitalising him with a toy bow and arrow.Thank God she’s got her colourful circle of friends to keep her sane: fun-loving Trudie, hippy Amber and chilly, tight-lipped Felicity.It is only over time that Zoe and Ryan begin to understand each other and their apparently ill-fated relationship takes on a new dimension.There’s just one problem, as Zoe soon discovers: that the past isn’t always easy to escape, no matter how far away you go.",
