  "description": "'What kind of circus is only open at night?'The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. The black sign, painted in white letters that hangs upon the gates, reads:\nOpens at NightfallCloses at Dawn\nAs dusk shifts to twilight, tiny lights begin to flicker all over the tents, as though the whole of the circus is covered in fireflies. When the tents are aglow, sparkling against the night sky, the sign lights up: \nLe Cirque des RÃªvesThe Circus of Dreams.\nThe gates shudder and unlock, seemingly by their own volition. They swing outward, inviting the crowd inside.\nNow the circus is open. Now you may enter.",
