Thanks to King Caimus’ war against the reclusive Magiieri over the mountains, the kingdom is tottering on the brink of civil war. Worst, the Mages are winning battle after battle. The only people who can save the kingdom, in Prince Eluc’s opinion, are the blood thirsty pirates known as the Lion and Lioness of the Seas. After all, they saved Cairnnoth once before, when his and Caimus’ father was alive. Can the two pirates save the kingdom once more? Can they, with a prince untried in all things, a couple of assassins, and an aging cavalry sergeant, save the kingdom from certain destruction from the mages and from Caimus’ depredations? “Promises Kept” is the debut book for author, Erika Napier, as well as the debut book in the Khardas series. Follow the adventures of the Lion and Lioness of the Seas and those they encounter in these whirlwind books of magic, deceptions, and pirates.",
