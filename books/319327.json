  "description": "Charlotte Ames despises hotheads. You know the type. The growly, perma-scowling bully who blows his top at the slightest inconvenience. And her former boss, Top Chef Mitch Elliott, is the king of all hotheads.\nHow big of a jerk is he? Big enough to make her hurl a salad at the guy.\n\nThose vegetables didn’t ask to be strewn across the floor. But Mitch deserved it!\n\n\nIs he devastatingly handsome when he loses his cool? Could his stormy blue eyes, flashing with passion, melt the panties right off a gal? That would be a yes. Still, she can’t stand him. And she’d thought she’d seen the last of the culinary creep.\nShe was wrong.\n\n\nOn the cusp of eviction and with five bucks to her name, she needs a job.\n\nEnter the exclusive Nanny Match Agency and an opportunity to make some real cash.\n\nSounds great, right? Wrong again!\n\n\nThe universe has one messed-up sense of humor. When she wakes up after a margarita bender and learns she’s become the hothead’s nanny, life goes topsy-turvy! But when the nanny dust settles, she sees another side of the man. A man who might be more than a hothead. A man who gazes at her with such intensity, she can barely keep from combusting.\nDon’t fall for the hotheaded chef.\n\n\nHer head knows what to do. If only she could convince her heart.\n\n\nCould this nanny match be the match that changes everything, or will it get too hot in the kitchen for the nanny and the hothead?\n\n\nNanny Love Match Series:\n♥The Nanny and the Nerd♥The Nanny and the Hothead",
