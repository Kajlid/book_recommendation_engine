  "description": "Angel Garret knows two things for sure. The first is that she inherited some of her dad's powers. The second is that she wreaks havoc whenever she tries to use them - especially when she's trying to impress her crush, Cole. Angel's only solution is to stay as far away as possible from him until she learns how to harness this new gift. But how can you manage to avoid someone and get him to ask you to the Turkey Ball at the same time?",
