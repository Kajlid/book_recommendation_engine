  "description": "Violet Hawthorne is beyond mortified when her brother Ezra turns their parents' beautiful New England inn into a brothel. But that becomes the least of her worries when her own reputation is mysteriously sabotaged. In an effort to salvage her good name, Violet is forced to accept a hasty proposal from a dark-eyed acquaintance with a tarnished past: Vance Everstone. He is infamous for being a rake--and yet, against her will, Violet finds herself falling for this man she knows she cannot trust. As she prepares for a society wedding, Violet gradually learns that her brother isn't done with trouble. He had staked her hand in marriage in a heated poker game with the unsavory Rowen Steele, and lost. Now Rowen is determined to cash in on his IOU. With danger stalking her, a fianc√© who hides both his emotion and his past, and an old lover eager to save the day, Violet must decide who to believe--and who to leave behind.",
