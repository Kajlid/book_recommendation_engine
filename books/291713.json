  "description": "Saffron Dean’s love life isn’t worth talking about. Instead, she throws herself into the small bakery she runs, and with Christmas coming soon, she’s busier than ever.  But then two sexy as sin brothers move to town, and with the looks she’s now getting from her best friend, Daniel, she finds that things are heating up, and not just in the kitchen…  Includes one talented baker, three hot men, and a f*** tonne of frosting. (Grandma, I suggest you skip this one)  Sweet About Me is a contemporary reverse harem and is Saffron's complete story.",
