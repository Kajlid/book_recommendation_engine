  "description": "\"At the beach paper got a bit wet. When damp paper gets quite upset. So you can see why, paper lay out to dry, On a rock where it’s hot ‘til sunset. … Afar paper sees some flocks. But are they doves, bees or hawks? When scissors drew near, that they shear grew clear, and in fear papers flew off their rocks. Had papers stayed tight and steady, for the raid they might have been ready. But scissors like sharks would bite easy marks, afraid papers frayed to confetti.” Paper’s peaceful beach holiday becomes an endless rock-paper-scissors ruckus. But then Paper and Pen join forces to sketch out some crazy solutions, while developing a more positive outlook and a better view of the world and how it works. Young readers will likewise appreciate the positive message about dealing with adversity and gain better view of the world’s workings. The book also gives you access to several rock-paper-scissors computer games, allowing readers to watch the rock-paper-scissors drama unfold over time. After studying interactions in ecosystems and society, the Drs. Keane wondered how they would introduce such things to their young daughter. One of their collaborative projects addressing this challenge is this kooky picture book, which uses hilarious drawings (by artist KJ Keane) and verse (by Chris Keane) to show paper and pen learning about predator-prey eco-systems. If you like, you can continue the fun adventure with a companion science book (available through amazon), computer games, and board game about rock-paper-scissors dynamics in predator-prey systems.
