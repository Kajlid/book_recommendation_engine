  "description": "When a female loan shark named Lucky is attacked and left for dead, vampire Glory St. Clair turns her into one of the undead to save herbut eternity would have been safer without her. Vamps prefer a low profile, and that's not Lucky's style. She prefers to flaunt her sexy rock-star ex-boyfriend and great shoes. Trouble is, her flamboyant behavior is not only drawing every vampire hunter within miles it's bringing her would-be killer out of hiding, too.",
