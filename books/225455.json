Selected Memories: Five Years of Hippocampus Magazine is a celebration of where we've been and a testament to the power of telling true stories. Since we launched our journal in 2010, we ve published more than 600 pieces of creative nonfiction from more than 500 emerging and established writers. We're proud of our contributors, and we admire their bravery for sharing pieces of themselves. This collection is a representation of our first five years. It's filled with more than two dozen stories that moved us, made us laugh, made us cry, made us want to read them again.Contributors: Fred AmramStephanie AndersenMichael AndreoniCathy A.E.
