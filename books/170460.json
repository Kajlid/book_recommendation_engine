  "description": "How does a Polish chick attract sex partners? She is giving them a Pole Dance. What’s the illusion of equal rights in America? A black president in a white house. Why was the meeting between the Americans and the Russians so tensed? Because nobody knows what Vladimir Put In Barbara’s Bush! ‘Walk On By II’ contains 368 new punch lines and jokes about blonds, Danes, Jews, Jehovah Witnesses, Christians, Clinton, Obama, and faggots, as well as knock knock jokes about all the American states and more. The humor involved in this book includes also funny dialogues, witty quotations, polemics, sarcastic remarks, and therapeutic notes. Although some of the humorous wordplays could be selectively told to children with a careful consideration and a great deal of censorship, the reader should be warned and take notice: This book is for adults only!",
