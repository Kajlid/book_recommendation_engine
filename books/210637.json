  "description": "Beauty And The Beast… — Allow me to introduce myself: My name is Andrew Vari, and I'm short (very short), and not exactly handsome. Actually, that's only partly true. My real name is Darius, and if you caught a glimpse of my true form, you might just swoon. It was my arrogance about my looks and magical powers that got me into this fix. I'm living under a curse the Fates placed upon me two millennia ago. My penance is to unite a thousand pairs of soulmates—however long it takes.Here's where things get complicated: You see, I just met the most amazing woman. Her name is Ariel Summers, and she's smart, beautiful, athletic…and very mortal. I should know—I saved her life. But the whole thing happened when I was looking way easier on the eyes. I thought she'd never track me down once I was back in my Andrew Vari “disguise,” but she did, and now—like it or not—she's in my life. The problem is, I do like it—and it looks as if she's falling for me, too…warts and all. I'm so close to completing my mission—but if finding a “true love” for Ariel is my last assignment, this job may never get done",
