  "description": "Africa Has a Future. Many challenges lie ahead but there is a way forward. This book explores the problems and possible solutions facing Africa today.Development activists, intellectuals, economists and academics have expressed their different views and theories about how development should be carried out in Africa and around the world. However; there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution for this cause. There have been many diagnoses, but as yet no effective remedy for the maladies faced by Africans.As an African, I have experienced many of Africa's problems first hand, then studied and researched them academically. Africa Has a Future is my prescription for Africa, based on my own perceptions as an African.Africa Has a Future has been written both for academics and the ordinary African. It lays out my thoughts clearly in a way that is easy to understand. It is my dream for every African to understand the problems Africa faces and the repercussions of current strategies.",
