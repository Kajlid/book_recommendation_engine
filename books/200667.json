  "description": "Justin Bertolli lived as any typical 29-year-old bachelor would live his life-until he had a chance encounter with a woman unlike any other. Ambra Taylor was everything he had ever envisioned. Young and beautiful, seductive and sensual. Justin was enamored by this enchantress. But there was something puzzling about Ambra as well. The way she drifted in and out of his life, and questions that he could not answer. Why wouldn't she enjoy one day with him? Why was she so ambiguous about her career? Her life? Her past?",
