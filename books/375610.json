  "title": "Scoundrel Time",
  "description": "The third volume of memoirs from the National Book Award-winning playwright Lillian Hellman.Â In 1952, Hellman joined the ranks of intellectuals and artists called before Congress to testify about political subversion. Terrified yet defiant, Hellman refused to incriminate herself or others, and managed to avoid trial. Nonetheless the experience brought devastating controversy and loss. First published in 1972, her retelling of the time features a remarkable cast of characters, including her lover, novelist Dashiell Hammett, a slew of famous friends and colleagues, and a pack of \"scoundrels\" -- ruthless, ambitious politicians and the people who complied with their demands.",
