  "description": "Clare Macleod has lived all her life with an awareness of the Strange, tales of fairies and magic-making told to her by her mother who died years ago. No longer a child, Clare has learned to suppress the magic that haunted the corners of her life, to say the word “fairy” with the appropriate disbelief. But after years of living in America, Clare and her father are returning to Ireland, to the house Clare was born in—a house built into a hillside with an ancient tree for a wall. For Clare, the house is not only full of memories of her mother, but of the Strange and a mysterious boy with raven-dark hair and of dreamlike nights filled with stars and magic. In this place, magic—both bright and dark—will not sit quietly in a corner.",
