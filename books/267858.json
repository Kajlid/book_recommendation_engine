  "description": "I came to steal the virgin. I stayed to corrupt her.  I was tied up with a gun in my mouth. She thought she was in control. But she was dead f**king wrong.  Because I’d made a decision from the second I saw her perfect, virgin lips: This girl was going to be MINE.  She could cuff me down, rough me up, whatever she wanted to do. It wasn’t going to stop the inevitable. One way or another, I was going to break myself free… then I was going to break her in.  That’s exactly what happened. And when it did, her moans were as pleasing as I’d imagined. Watching her crumble on my fingers was pure bliss.  But some others aren’t so happy with the situation. Like the men who hired me to kill her and her father in the first place. They’ll stop at nothing to make me pay for my betrayal.  They should be careful, though. Because I have a woman to protect now. And I’ll slaughter any bastard who dares lay a finger on my angel.  \nKING OF HEARTS is a full-length, standalone, super steamy, bad boy mafia romance novel from bestselling author NICOLE FOX.  This suspenseful, action-packed mafia romance is intended for mature audiences, due to violence, strong language, dark themes and elements, and explicit intimate scenes.

This contains the following tropes: loss of virginity, dominant/submissive, and enemies to lovers.",
