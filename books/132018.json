  "description": "How did one lost drug fuelled weekend end up with 25 years in the slammer?Convicted for the brutal slaying of an ex girlfriend, JD Smith is back on the streets a bitter and broken man. Now the wrong side of fifty, this once good looking, carefree, philandering, hedonistic stray of the post punk music scene is left to reflect on how a bizarre set of circumstances led to his long incarceration without right to appeal, how despite maintaining his innocence throughout, all the evidence continues to point to his guilt.Out on life licence, Jack Smith must set about his prison made vow to find the real killer and bring them to justice. But before he can pursue the quest to clear his name, he first has to assuage the demons that reside inside his head and haunt his nightmares; rid himself of the darkness that continues to taunt, torment and test his sanity.Other distractions come in the shape of a sultry female lawyer whose practice methods aren’t always entirely ethical, and a trip to India in search of an elusive butterfly, a daughter he hasn’t seen since she was two.Mistrustful of a legal system that had already devastatingly failed him, Jack makes an almost fatal decision to take the law into his own hands, but unbeknown to him, someone else is on a mission to catch a killer...Scrapyard Blues is the gripping story of one man’s quest for redemption and reconnection with a life long lost.",
