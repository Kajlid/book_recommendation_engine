  "description": "Ilamaych had once dreamed to become a Flame, to be able to change his body to be entirely female or male as he chose, instead of stuck shamefully between from birth. But that hope died when he was captured by slavers, and sold to a rough, lusty Ventris farmer named Earen whose commanding manner is at odds with his role as a serf to the local Matron. Earen is the first person Ilamaych has ever met who actually appreciates his unique body.When Ficus—Flame to Earen's Matron—discovers that Earen has been keeping Ilamaych prisoner on his farm, they are hauled in for punishment, and some very personal reconciliation.But the world is bigger than one matron's household, and the Ventris have been feuding with the lords of Tache for over three thousand years. Just when Ilamaych and Earen are finally finding their way with Ficus, things suddenly become much, much more complicated. (M/M, M/F, Other)Novella (15,000 words)Genre(s): Fantasy, GLBT, Erotica",
