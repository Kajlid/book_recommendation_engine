  "description": "Sinister forces are at work, striking within the very heart of the city's elite with powers that seem otherwordly. Are the attacks random? Simply for profit? Or is an unknown predator hunting our masked heroes themselves? If the mysterious Ajay Shah really does have powers that rival the Red Panda, will even the Terrific Twosome of Toronto be able to resist the might of... The Mind Master? The second volume of the Tales of the Red Panda series is written in the breathless style of the classic \"Hero Pulps\" of the 1930s and 40s. The heroes from \"The Red Panda Adventures\"; a popular full-cast audio drama adventure series make the leap into pulp prose in spectacular style. This story is a self-contained adventure; you needn't have heard a single episode of Decoder Ring Theatre's long-running audio drama series to enjoy the thrills, mystery and adventure... but fans of the series will take special delight, as the story fits neatly within the series continuity. If you love classic adventure stories, mystery men, pulp fiction and golden age superheroics, you won't want to miss Tales of the Red The Mind Master!",
