  "title": "Resilience Road: Exploring Your Authentic Life Path",
  "description": "How many times have you taken a look at your life and thought these words? “Things have got to change.”Well, Beth had said them before, but when she opened her eyes in the ICU, paralyzed from the neck down and facing a tremendous fight to regain very basic functions, she knew she finally meant them. Her story is one of resilience: in the face of disease, life’s unexpected curves, and a journey that veers off the track.With total honesty and refreshing humor, Beth reflects on the checklist-style life she’d been living and conquering. Career. Husband. Kids. House in the suburbs. But then her body tells her in no uncertain terms that it’s time to slow down and take a hard look at what she has… and what she really wants. In sharing her own deeply personal experiences, Beth introduces us to the tools and philosophies she has developed along the way and now uses in her therapy practice. This is the story of a courageous comeback that is really a breakthrough to living an authentic life on your own terms.",
