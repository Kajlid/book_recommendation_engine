  "description": "Detective Swoop is back with a vengeance and determined to be victorious. Lee Azula, psychotic passion for success explodes sets off a wave of hysteria in her board room when she jumps up from the table, slams the book on the table, and flings it across the board room. \"This is my story. I own the rights.\" The Ara parrot perched on top of her right shoulder brazenly squawks and flees to his silver dome top art-deco bird cage. Being sexy, pampered and married to Reverend George Norman, Sr. proves too dull for Lee Azula who prefers to prosper in a secret world that's filled with lust, passion, power, greed, crime, high-stake business deals leads to a web of deception, and unresolved crimes. Detective Swoop is in charge. He's armed with an arsenal and determined to solve the theft of Susan Thomas' soon-to-be-released novel from Helen Washington's publishing company. Twisted Sister, a novel and sequel to They Shall Swoop, is based on true crimes and actual events in the author's life.",
