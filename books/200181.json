  "description": "Every cat owner knows that no two cats are alike. This pitch-perfect illustrated book proves this simple fact by diving whiskers first into the unique personality, charisma, and character of 50 real all-black cats. From Alfie, who \"has no tolerance for wet humans or being ignored,\" to Sashi, who \"enjoys freeze-dried chicken by candlelight and full-on body rubs,\" each cat comes to life through a lovingly hand-drawn portrait and quick-witted profile. Delightfully quirky and utterly charming, this motley crew of black cats will win over anyone with a dry sense of humor.",
