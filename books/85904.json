After a fatal car accident, sixteen-year-old Katie discovers that just like high school, the afterlife is one big popularity contest. Yet again she’s left out of the equation because everybody else has achieved some kind of “life goal” and moved on to a higher plane. But Katie hasn’t, so she’s given thirty more days to get it right. At least she’s got adorable afterlifer Martin to help her with—or distract her from—her Life List. But when an evil Irish wraith promises Katie’s parents will suffer after her death, her task of living fast and hard becomes entangled with a terrible choice: save her parents and end up as the next hot item on the alter-dimensional black market, or save her own soul. Time is running out...",
