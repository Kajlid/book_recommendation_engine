Navy had accidentally developed a capsule, which sent a three-man crew back in time, the Pentagon immediately began to research the phenomenon. The Navy had produced eight of these units, which were to be tested in hot spots around the world. The original function was to divert in-coming rockets away from a target, by using high frequency radio waves. However, once the discovery was made, the other seven capsules were quickly recalled. Seeing the importance of developing such a defensive tool, which would allow a return to the past to correct situations like Nine-Eleven, Pearl Harbor, embassy bombings and other tragedies that could have been prevented with more intelligence; the Pentagon sent a number of the country’s top government scientists a capsule to analyze. The hope was they would be able to determine what caused the one capsule to turn into a time machine. Meanwhile, the Pentagon began to send training missions to the past. The main drawback, was the capsule was not a hundred percent ready. Scientist had not yet been able to determine how to set a certain time period or a destination to be traveled. For reasons not yet determined, every capsule put on line, went to a different time period in the Nineteenth Century and only to a destinations in the New Mexico Territories. People picked to participate in the project were sent through a six-month course to familiarize themselves with the customs of the time. The number one rule for the training program was 'Leave no footprint', all that was about to change.",
