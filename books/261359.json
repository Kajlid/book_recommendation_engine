  "description": "Once a time traveller...  Joseph Bridgeman is back and dreaming of a quiet life. All he wants is to re-kindle his relationship with Alexia Finch, get to know his estranged family and catch up on the last twenty years.  Sounds simple enough.  But when a mysterious time-traveller arrives in his shop, Joe learns his first trip was only the beginning, and this time the stabilisers are coming off.  Flung back to London in the swinging sixties, Joe must save an innocent woman and her son from the clutches of a ruthless gangster. But how will he succeed when the rules of time travel have changed, his present is a confusing mess and the past is a world without internet, decent coffee or sat-nav?  Time doesn’t heal, after all. It just adds salt.    Joseph Bridgeman and the Silver Hunter is Book 2 in The Downstream Diaries; an emotionally intelligent time travel series featuring action, mystery, thrills, sadness, comedy and mind-bending twists.    Find out why readers are saying…  \"I started reading it last night and have just finished. I need more of Joseph Bridgman. I love these books!\" \"Done! Goodness... That was difficult to put down. A real page-turner, absolutely brilliant\" \"I enjoyed this one more than the first one (and that's saying something).\" \"This is the best Time Travel book I've ever read. In fact, this has got to rank up there in my top ten and, that includes books by Steven King, Tom Clancy, and Dean Koontz.\"   Note: Advice for time-travellers If you dive straight into Book 2, be sure to pop back in time and read Book 1, ‘The Unexpected Gift of Joseph Bridgeman.’ first. It’s just better that way.",
