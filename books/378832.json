  "title": "The Gunslinger",
  "description": "Written over a period of twelve years, The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger is the first cycle of stories in a remarkable epic, the strangest and most frightening work that Stephen King has ever written. It is the book of Roland, the last gunslinger, and his quest for the Dark Tower somewhere in a world in which time has no bearing.Against the weird background of a devastated and dying planet—with curious ties to our own world—the last gunslinger pursues the man in black. It is a time when man's thirst for knowledge has been lost, and the haunted, chilling land harbors strange beings: the Slow Mutants, less-than-human troglodytes dwelling in darkness; a Speaking-Demon, laired beneath a forgotten way station; and a nameless vampiric presence, held captive in an ancient circle of altar stones.Herein lies a tale of science-fantasy that is completely unlike anything best-selling author Stephen King has ever written. Indeed, it is unlike anything anyone has ever written! And it is a volume that begs for illustration. The Gunslinger is a joining of the foremost author and artist in the field of science fiction and fantasy. Complementing Stephen King in this most unusual book is artist Michael Whelan, recipient of both Howard and Hugo awards of excellence.With five full-color illustrations, illustrated endleaves, and numerous black and white devices and designs.",
