  "description": "The world has gone mad, and it has taken Sebring Campbell with it. Sebring Campbell is a reasonable man, an agent of Justice, a creature of logic, a product of nineteenth-century rational thought. But there is a monster on the lose, a criminal turned demon who is stripping Sebring's life away, one love at a time. The monster Rothers leads Sebring on a merry chase of blood and shadow, a chase that can only end in the noose or in Hell.",
