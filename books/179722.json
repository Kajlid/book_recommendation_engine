  "description": "“You’re nothing but a worthless piece of trash.” Is what Pauly Benson Jr. always believed. Life in a backend Midwest town was bad enough, but with a drunken mom, and not knowing a thing about his father, Paul makes the best of his world. As a phone operator at a collection’s agency, he’s hoping to save enough to move away from life as he’s known it.  Until the night he meets Shane Garrison, and his world changes in an instant. Shane is perfect, muscular, and fun to be around. Nothing could be better, except he’s going to be departing in three months for the military. Pauly is determined to spend every waking hour together, until that fateful day when Shane leaves.  But can their relationship survive Shane’s family’s traditional values?",
