  "description": "Thirty-Six Views of the Eiffel Tower is an eminently giftable tribute to the greatest sight in the City of Light. A gorgeous re-creation of Henri Rivi re's original 1902 volume offers a stunning view of turn-of-the-century Paris. Sometimes looming in the foreground, sometimes a tiny detail on the horizon, the tower is always piercing the sky above a teeming street scene; populated with daring construction workers far above the earth; and peacefully distant above a tranquil Seine. Published in association with the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, this enchanting collection is sure to be cherished by Francophiles the world over.",
