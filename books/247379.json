  "description": "Gage is a typical omega—submissive, domestic, eager-to-please ... horny. But he wasn’t born with all the right equipment or the right smell. Living as a beta wolf is too painful, so he’s been hiding out in the human world. Then his sister turns up on his doorstep running from an unwanted claiming, and Gage is forced into Northern Pack territory to seek asylum.  Ryker’s a typical alpha—dominant, wild, protective … horny. But living in Northern Pack territory has taught him that omegas shouldn’t be forced into traditional roles, so he’s been making do with porn and fantasy, not wanting to be that alpha. Ryker isn’t sure why Gage triggers all his protective instincts, but he knows Gage needs him, and Gage is exactly the omega he’s been looking for.  When Ryker meets Gage, the attraction is instantaneous, but it can only be temporary. Ryker was built to live in wolf territory and that’s the one thing Gage will never do. As soon as he gets his sister settled, he’ll flee the Northern Pack and the alpha he’s always dreamed of belonging to. Unless love, with a little help from science, can find another way …  Omega Revealed is a M/M shapeshifter non-MPREG alpha/omega novella.  Content warning: body dysphoria",
