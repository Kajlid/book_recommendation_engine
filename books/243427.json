  "title": "California's Deadly Women: Murder and Mayhem in the Golden State 1850â€“1950",
  "description": "There's an old saying in the news business: If it bleeds, it leads. The nightly California news and other media outlets are filled with stories of crime, killing, and sorrow. Within these pages rediscover 46 of the most notorious murders and shocking crimes committed by women in the state of California between 1850 and 1950. Examine the accounts of such notorious murderesses as the \"Black Widow,\" Louise Peete; \"Tiger Woman,\" Clara Phillips; the \"Duchess,\" Juanita Spinelli; and many more. Written in chronological sequence and enhanced by 50 photographs, each entry provides a concise overview of the crime, background information, and final dispositions. At one point these California crimes horrified the collective imaginations of the state--and nation--but many have faded away from our historical consciousness. They're back. This book is an indispensable reference tool for anyone interested in California history and crime.",
