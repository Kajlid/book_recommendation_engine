  "description": "Tammie’s life in a quiet fishing town would never be the same again. Her future wasn’t looking good (understatement!), but things quickly went from bad to WICKED with the arrival of a strange grown-up with nice eyes. And as for the business with Daniel’s lunch, or Dibs’s roof. . .  Jairus’s Girl is an entertaining and moving account of the Galilee side of the Jesus story - aimed at pre-teens, though some adults have sneakily read and enjoyed it too.",
