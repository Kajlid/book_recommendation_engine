  "description": "Being crew is walking between two worlds. One world is normal: Prom. Parties. College. Those are the concerns they worry about. In our world, we deal with other situations. Cops. Drugs. Brawling. That’s a typical day for us. But what if it wasn’t? What if there came a day when you stopped? When you considered letting your enemies win? When you didn’t fight back? When you chose a different path? First I lost my family. Then I got the Wolf Crew. I couldn't lose them too. But what happens when Cross, Zellman, and Jordan keep going…...and I don’t?",
