When the young prince Kedryn Caitin defeated Taws and his forces, the Three Kingdoms joined in proclaiming him and Wynett begin life together, all are certain that the battle is over at last. But concealed by darkness, Ashar's anger simmers-and he waits. His minion may have failed. But his diabolical cause is not forgotten...A thrilling adventure of courage and magic by a remarkable new talent in fantasy, The Books Of The Kingdoms.",
