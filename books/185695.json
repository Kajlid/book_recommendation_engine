With every whispered word and every charming smile, True finds herself sinking further under his spell.  Leif Erikson had long ago given up hope of finding a mate. As the son of the legendary explorer, he had enough on his plate just living up to his father and grandfather’s expectations. When his mate literally walks in his front door, he’s stunned and immediately captivated by the spirited woman.  But a war wages around them, one side led by a Valendran legend with thousands of years of rage and hatred festering in his spirit, the other side by a pregnant woman, and her small, but special son, who want their loved one and their people back alive.  Caught between two sides in a war they didn’t choose, and hours away from a hybrid Armageddon, True and Leif must decide if they will choose their love or their people. With Grai’s life and the lives of the hybrids resting in their hands, will one or both, become a… True Traitor?",
