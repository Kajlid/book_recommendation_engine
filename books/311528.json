What I thought would be a quick trip into their lands turns into a fight for my life. The future Sawyer and I have dreamed of together threatens to crumble. I’m torn. Do I chose love and a sure future with the man of my dreams, or do I follow my heart and save a dying people I know nothing about, no matter the cost? Either way I have to make it back to him; I can’t imagine a life in which we don’t exist together.",
