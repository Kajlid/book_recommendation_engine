Descended from a legendary Celtic tribe that guards the secrets of the ancient stone circles, the Quinn women have a great responsibility to protect their pagan rituals and way of life. As members of the formidable Circle of Nine, they celebrate the holidays of the year from Yule to Samhain, keeping the traditions alive through the centuries against insurmountable odds.  We first met these women in Circle of Nine – Beltany, and now a set of three novellas reveals more of their engaging stories. Dervla’s Destiny brings us to medieval Ireland where this beloved character learns of her gifts and fights tremendous loss and betrayal, all the while never giving up on finding the love she deserves.",
