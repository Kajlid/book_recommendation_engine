  "description": "From the New York Times & USA Today bestselling author of TAPPING THE BILLIONAIRE comes a hilarious and sexy standalone about fate, chance, and one heck of an epically awkward meet-cute. I’m Leo Landry, one of the best shutdown cornerbacks in the nation, and the New York Mavericks’ first round draft pick. If James Bond spent his days running drills and his nights shutting out quarterbacks, he’d dream about being me. But professional football is on a whole other level from college, and as the new guy, I’ve got everything to prove.No problem.All I’ve got to do is focus, right?Too bad life’s got other plans. Blond hair, long lashes, and criminal blue eyes, there’s a pint-sized bombshell that I can’t stop thinking about. I don’t even know her name, but she’s completely screwing up my game plan. It’s too late to turn back now though. I have my eye on the prize, and I won’t settle for anything less. 4th down and only one goal in my sights—this pretty little mystery girl. Good thing I’m at my best when the pressure’s on.",
