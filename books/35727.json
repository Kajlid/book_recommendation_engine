  "title": "The Goliath's Last Sacrifice",
  "description": "\"For twenty years, eight story tall monsters have ravished the world. They ripped out our electricity, our pavement, our homes. They took from us our heat and food and light. Mankind fought them, with their tanks, missiles and everything else they could think of, but nothing hurt the monsters. The Goliaths took the world from us and left mankind to fend for himself...\"A post apocalyptic story about love, fear, and progress in the face of a horrible new world filled with witches, Goliaths, Outsiders and wild animals. 17 year old Alisa wants to build skyscrapers. She wants to recreate the old world. But how can she when her crush Tyler only wants to farm? Sometimes, it takes a new set of eyes to begin the process of change. And Cauflin is willing to show her the beauty of progress and what it takes to attain it. If only she could choose Tyler or Caulfin before sheâ€™s torn apart by the Goliaths or burned at the stake for witchcraft, then maybe she could see the world for not what it is, but what it could truly become.",
