  "description": "The summer sun beat heavily on the tiny inlet off the broad river. Large trees, untouched by civilization, surrounded the inlet on three sides. The fourth side was a narrow waterway leading back to the river. Wild birds abounded, and on land, small game lived without fear of being attacked and killed by larger animals. Nor did they fear the worst predator of man. It was too early for mosquitoes. Everything was quiet and peaceful.The little cabin cruiser sat silently in the middle of the inlet, at anchor. It had arrived the previous night and would be gone when daylight started fading. This was the last day of the Rheingold's honeymoon. They had rented the cabin cruiser for two days, and Herb Rheingold had found the inlet quite by accident.At the moment, Herb, his wife Emily, and Emily's daughter by a previous marriage, Wendy, were relaxing on deck. Emily, tall, slender, with jet-black hair, had an excellent figure, and didn't mind showing it off wearing the briefest of bikinis.Her bikini was as black as her ebony hair, hiding her dark bush of pubic curls, though the hairs did stick out around the sides of the crotch band. Her tan thighs were long, slender and firm, with no stretch marks. In fact, although the woman was thirty-four, she looked at least ten years younger. Her fingernails and toenails were painted blood red, and her short, midnight hair was in an up-sweep.Cornering Herb Rheingold had been quite a feat for the divorcee. True, the man wasn't rich, but he had a good job as a real estate broker, and considering her condition when he and she had first met, she was ten times better off.",
