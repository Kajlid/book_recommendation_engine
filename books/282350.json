  "description": "To get ahead, you need to know where you're going.Positive Thoughts, Positive Outcomes Journal aims to help you plan ahead with real-world ideas and real-life choices. As the title implies, this unique journal encourages you to approach the world with a positive outlook.Inside, you'll find sections that ask you to explore your current intentions and strategize how you intend to manifest those goals with plenty of space to focus on positive affirmations, while practicing gratitude. Writing your goals, gratitude and affirmations will soon become second nature to your subconscious mind. The subconscious doesn't recognize the difference between do or don't, right or wrong and good or bad. By ensuring that you write daily positive manifestations, goals, thankfulness, affirmations and intentions, you aspire and prepare what you 'desire' to receive in your life.Studies have shown that journaling is great way to work out your problems, brainstorm new ideas, reevaluate your goals and formulate a plan to help you hit your goals. It inspires you to be grateful for all that's around you; despite any setbacks, and to devise a new plan of actions and affirmations to get you where you want to be.",
