  "description": "I LOVE accents! I HATE Caleb Conaway.It’s true, I despise him! Caleb Conaway is an unaccented pain in my ass. No matter how many times I tell the sexy boxer I’m not interested in him, he just doesn’t listen to me. People call me an Accent Hussy. That’s because I’m only attracted to men with sexy accents, dripping in butter, oozing with sex and hit me straight in the vagina. Yup, that’s EXACTLY what I'm looking for. Caleb’s voice does nothing for me; it assaults my ear drums and makes me want to gouge out my eyeballs. I finally thought I got away from him, until a foolish date with a sexy Irishman ends with me arrested . . . All I wanted was to complete my community service and go home. What I didn’t expect was to fall in love with the kids at the Youth Center, or run into the one man that I love to hate . . . Caleb Conaway.They say that every person has an Achilles’ Heel, I just wasn’t expecting mine to be Caleb Conaway.",
