  "description": "All of history is secrets and lies. The present is just a cover story. A fairy isn't a being of light. Far from it. It is a malign entity. When Sherlock Holmes' brilliant creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle encountered the Fey , they made him believe that the infamous Cottingley pictures were images of real fairies. The fairy folk used his fame to 'prove' they don't exist - and destroyed his reputation. Within their traditional haunts of hill fort and and barrow these creatures are dangerous enough, but now they are abandoning the countryside to infest our city spaces like urban foxes. They prey upon us and our unwillingness to believe in them leaves us wide open to attack. As this centuries old, covert war heats up, it falls to a shambling figure known only as 'D' to keep us safe - and ignorant of the nightmares that lurk, hidden in the every day world that we call 'reality'. A contemporary British fantasy, The Last Changeling is no fairy story. It reveals the hidden story behind present day real people, historical figures, and true events.",
