  "description": "Stephen Strange is Doctor Strange. But he is no doctor, and least not the kind that would initially come to mind. He is the Master of the Mystic Arts, a sorcerer supreme, a white knight who wields black magic against blacker villains still. Strange is mankind's only hope against the dark otherworldly forces that conspire to destroy the conscious world - forces such as Baron Mordo, the Dread Dormammu, Nightmare, Aggamon, The House of Shadows, Loki, the Mindless Ones and more. Collected here in glorious black and white is the run of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's amazing run of Strange Tales #110, 111, & 114-168 - Strange's first and greatest adventures.",
