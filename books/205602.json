  "description": "How do you fight a demon from the past...hell-bent on destroying all that you love?  Shattered by Clint’s final cold declaration — I don’t miss you. I don’t want you. I don’t love you  — Axel struggles to make it from one day to the next beneath the crushing weight of his broken heart, knowing he must move on and let the cowboy go. When an attempt to love another fails, he is forced to face the reality that he will love his cowboy to his dying day — unaware that that day may be looming much closer than he knows.  Battling his own feelings and emotions, Clint determines to do what is best, and safest for Axel; stay as far away from him as possible. With the threat of his faceless enemy pressing down on him and his ‘family’, coming at them hard and stealing away lives, the cowboy is certain he has made the right decision where Axel is concerned. Until the fateful night that has Axel staring down the barrel of a gun gripped in the fist of the one man intent on bringing down hell on Clint’s life…and his heart.  NOTES: The Cowboy Gangster is a gay romance series. Not for readers below 18.",
