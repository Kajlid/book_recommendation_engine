  "description": "Fifteen years ago, Gabriel Dern was involved in a car accident that left terrible scars covering half of his body. He retreats from society and rejects the idea of ever finding a woman who will accept him for who he is.  After her mother’s death, Morgan Wilson moves to the small town of Martinvale to begin her new life. While living in the carriage house on Gabriel’s property, she gradually begins to tear down the walls Gabe has built around him. As Gabe slowly warms up to her, Morgan must find a way to convince him she wants both his friendship and his love.",
