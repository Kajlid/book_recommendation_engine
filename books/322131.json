  "description": "Getting out from under the past is never easy in an isolated town. Especially not when your last name is 'Blackwood'—the same one that's been attached to every business deal and eviction notice for centuries. When the current heads of the family fled Southbend in the wake of a scandal—the untimely death of their youngest child—the residents breathed a sigh of relief. With the ancestral estate abandoned, they hoped to never see a Blackwood again.But when the surviving eldest daughter returns five years later, seeking the help of a local witch, the family legacy claws back to the light. Exhausted and haunted, she asks a question everyone's been avoiding: What do you know about how Ida died?",
