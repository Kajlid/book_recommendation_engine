  "description": "I’m tired.\n\nCrime scene to crime scene I go, interview upon interview I question, and it all yields nothing but more questions, more media attention, and the sound of a voice on the phone. A voice that haunts me late into the night with a yearning to taste the forbidden.\n\nSome say dreams hold hidden truths. I hope not.\n\nThe man the media calls the ‘Vigilante’ is supposed to be my prey, but instead we dance. Every possible step closer, he evades. Only his faceless taunts close the distance between us. I can barely catch my breath.Then the copycat killings begin, and I struggle to hold my grip on the truth.\n\nIn the face of temptation will I rise, or will I fall?\n\nAm I the saint? Or his angel?\nDisclaimer: Her Vigilante is a romance with taboo elements. It is not meant to convey real-life situations. This is not a police procedural. It deals with violence, death, and unprotected sex.\n\nIf you’re a lover of taboo attraction and morally ambiguous heroes, welcome and happy reading!",
