  "description": "Caught in the twisted games of Fate...\n\n\nThirty years ago, Xevius defied his orders by refusing to assassinate the woman who would birth the future mother of the Veredian Titans. Today, his government demands that he atones for that failure by ridding the world of those children before they grow even more powerful. While on that mission, he feels the pull of the Tuning - the psionic call of his true mate. To complicate matters, his woman turns out to be the military leader and protector of the Veredians!\nWith tension rising between her people and the Xelixians, the last thing Kamala needs is a Korlethean assassin hunting the Veredian children. Attempting to eliminate him first should be an easy decision, except for the fact that heâ€™s her soulmate. Swaying him to their side could be the key to solving many of their problems, but at what cost to him and his people?\n\n\nAs dire visions and prophecies multiply, Xevius is torn between his conscience, loyalty to his people, and his love for the woman who has captured his heart!",
