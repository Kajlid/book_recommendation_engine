  "description": "A body is found in the Alabama wilderness. The question is: Is it a human corpse … or is it just a piece of discarded property? Agent Samantha Rose has been exiled to a backwater assignment for the Commonwealth Bureau of Investigation, a death knell for her career. But then Sam catches a break—a murder—that could give her the boost she needs to get her life back on track. There's a snag, though: the body is a clone, and technically that means it's not a homicide. And yet, something about the body raises questions, not only for her, but for coroner Linsey Mackenzie.The more they dig, the more they realize nothing about this case is what it seems … and for Sam, nothing about Mac is what it seems, either.This case might be the way out for her, but that way could be in a bodybag.A thrilling new mystery from Liana Brooks, The Day Before will have you looking over your shoulder and questioning what it means to be human.",
