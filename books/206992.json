  "description": "What is Magic? For thousands of years, since the early days of Earth, people have wondered this very thing. Is it an all-consuming power? Is it the salvation of man? For many, it is both purpose and promise; blessing and saviour—but for one man, it is so much more. Enter Gavril, the empty shell of a man consumed by his own passionate appetite for power. What is Magic for him? Control. Desperate to consume the most powerful entity on the planet, Gavril seeks the source of all power—the essence of magic itself. For young Bliss, magic is much more than an ideal. Magic is life. She is the very last Child of Power, and since her birth magic has caused nothing but burden and danger as she is hunted far and wide for the power she holds. The days of prospering and plenty have long passed and now Bliss must take her destiny into her own hands before darkness falls over the land. Will she learn to control her magic in time? Or will the power of light and goodness crumble at the hands of Gavril’s wickedness? What Is Magic, you ask? Find out today in the latest installment of the battle between good and evil. Get swept up in the excitement when magic and power collide.",
