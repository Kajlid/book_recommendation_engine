  "description": "Bexley:Your secrets are safe with me.It’s been my number one rule since I opened my law firm in Reno, NV.No one knows the reason is because I have my own dark secrets to hide, and a past I wish I could forget.Strategically, I only accept clients who have more to lose than I do.Like the dangerous and deadly, Royal Bastards MC.Not the best company to keep, but the most lucrative.Over the years, I’ve learned to ignore their toxic masculine energy, and overt sexual advances.Especially from their VP, Khan.Just like the ancient ruler himself, he’s tall, muscular, and brutal.He’s also the sexiest man I’ve ever laid eyes on.I fell victim to a man like him once before.I’ll never make that mistake again.His relentless pursuit to get me in bed ends when he finds himself facing five years in prison, leaving me the only one standing between him and a cold, dank cell.The evidence against him is incriminating, but not damning.Not for an exceptional lawyer like me.That’s when my past comes back at the worst moment with an ultimatum…fulfill my commitment to the RBMC or keep myself alive?Khan:Bexley’s the first woman who ever stood me up to me, and hell if it doesn’t make me feel a certain way.I don’t know how to handle what she does to me, so I do what any emotionally immature man would do.I pick on her, tease her, and annoy her to no end, like it’s my favorite pastime.When I catch charges for arson and auto theft, I’m forced to play nice with my playground crush.Never thought I’d say this, but I need her brain more than her body.For now, anyway.I’m one more court date away from being a free man, when everything I thought I knew about the attractive, curvaceous lawyer is proven false.She thought the worst thing that could happen to her is her ex tracking her down, but she’s wrong.She betrayed me and my brothers, and some things are unforgivable.I don’t see hearts in my eyes when I look at her now. Instead, blood-red vengeance fills my vision.*Bexley's Biker is a dark romance with triggering elements.",
