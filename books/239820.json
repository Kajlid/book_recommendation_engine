To secure protection from assassins, the scientist-spies of the Collective and the anger of an island liege, Renbourn accepts the title of Duce of Bilan and joins the Parliament of Alma. He bonds with a female Ducei, but unhappily discovers that she is Sasperia Thorwaif, an enhanced mutant with the startling strength of ten men and an overheated metabolism that fuels her resentment against lesser-endowed humans. As a result, she begins a campaign to destroy the Renbourn tribe. Tribe Renbourn is also drawn into a brewing war against the Lunta of the New-Dome, a High Priestess wanting to force all Almans and immigrants to bow in obedience and conform to her strict religious orthodoxy. When the Prince of Alma, heir to the throne, wants to add a Renbourn wife to his long list of women forced to surrender themselves to his royal will, the foundations of their lives on Beta-Earth are shaken. Can Tribe Renbourn battle a church, a throne, and a bond-wife bent on tearing them apart?",
