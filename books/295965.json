  "description": "She'll be a flash of red in a world of grey  Kyri Dekote is just your average commoner class sixteen year old girl, except for one thing. She was born with magic, an outlawed substance punishable by death in her home kingdom of Althea. One night she sneaks out of her kingdom in search of a magical substance that might very well save her family's business only to nearly becoming prey of the vicious magical beasts of the forest herself if it hadn't been for the timely intervention of a handsome stranger. Her life spirals further into a world of glitter and secrets as her home goes up in flames and everything she thought she knew about her family turns on its head. She soon finds out that evil is not confined to the beasts that wander the forest, it's at the heart of the very kingdom itself.",
