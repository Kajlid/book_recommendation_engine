As her new landlord follows her into the bright, open living room, watching her every more, she feels so lucky she spotted the ad online.‘You’re just the tenant I’ve been looking for,’ the landlord tells her as he drops the keys into her hand. Libby smiles as she unpacks her small suitcase and thinks about the troubled life she has just walked out on.Days later, Libby is woken by the sound of her neighbours arguing through the wall. As she listens to their angry words, she swears she hears her name mentioned. Why would they be talking about her?As the weeks pass, Libby can’t help but feel that someone is watching her and when she hears that the last girl who rented her apartment before her vanished without trace, she starts to double lock her door every night. Then she finds a handwritten message in her apartment telling her she’s in danger, and her new home no longer feels like the safe haven it once was. Did someone from Libby’s past follow her here? And just how safe is she behind closed doors?If you love gripping psychological thrillers like Gone Girl and Mark Edwards’s Here to Stay, you’ll be blown away by The Houseshare. Addictive, tense and with an ending you won’t see coming, you’ll be up all night turning the pages.The Houseshare is a rework of To Let, which was previously published by the same author.",
