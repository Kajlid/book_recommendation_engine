  "description": "Hayle's a man out of second chances. Veronica's a woman in hot water. And Big Andy D. is a Mob Prince out of patience with both of them. Hayle Colson is a man out of time. He should have been born back around the time someone blew up half his family's castle in Ireland where he has resided since he was a mere child. The castle sits above a barely surviving 600-acre farm. As beautiful as it is keeping it going has become the very definition of the word insane. Along with being a farmer Hayle Colson is a part-time Air Marshal and liaison between the Irish and US factions of the MC Exiles. His eldest half brother Slider suggested he take the Air Marshal job to save on airfare. It's come in handy for more than just saving money. Like now when his buddy, and notorious mob prince, Andy Digiovanni offers to help him solve a certain female problem but he has to go to Chicago to find out what Andy has in mind. As it turns out Andy's current media issues revolve around a beautiful blonde with curves built for his big Irish hands. Hayle takes Veronica off his hands and promises to hide her out in Ireland. Unfortunately the media had other ideas. Next thing Hayle and Andy know they're merging two rivals that go back many years to their conception. MC's and the Mob have bumped into each other enough to know they prefer to run over each other. Veronica is along for the ride, that is until she finally sees where her Master lives. That's when an otherwise cooperative sub turned slave shows Hayle the true meaning of topping from the bottom. Change is in the air for an otherwise uncompromising man.",
