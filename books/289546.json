  "description": "My best friend's kid sister wants me to get her pregnant. The old fashioned way.  I've looked out for Ariel since she was in pigtails. I took her trick or treating, told off the jerk who dumped her, picked her up from Prom. When she needs my help, I'm there. Only she doesn't need a ride, a study partner, a new tattoo. Ariel wants me to get her pregnant. The old fashioned way. Three months of trying. Then we go back to our lives. It's a terrible idea. I should say no. I should convince her to wait for Mr. Right. But the geeky grad student is sure it's now or never. And I'm sure as hell not going to let her find someone else.  The Baby Bargain is a standalone romance with a brooding alpha hero, a feisty math geek heroine, and enough heat to melt your Kindle. Come see why readers say \"no one writes broken bad boys like Crystal Kaswell.\"",
