  "description": "Mother Nature Nursery Rhymes is a great way to begin teaching children about the natural wonders they will inherit. Newly revised to reflect important environmental aspects of todayâ€™s eco messages, this fully illustrated picture book will initiate an appreciation of our planet in both children and adults. The rhymes carry the sing-song cadence and whimsy that help language development for kids ages 1-5. The watercolor illustrations depict all the nursery rhyme favorites from lady bugs to elephants. At the end of the book, the authors have added a Rhyme Time Quiz, questions to ask older children, and resources of places to visit locally and online. More than ever, it is important to instill a love of nature in the minds of those who will ultimately decide her fate.",
