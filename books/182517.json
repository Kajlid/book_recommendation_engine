  "description": "“iGeneration” refers to the digital born -- people raised using digital technology. The information inundation has resulted in lots of new challenges for society to face, but it has also presented new opportunities. Cyberspace is the optimal proving ground for Situationalism, with experience increasingly delivered in an endless stream of random moments comprised of easily digestible bytes. The new paradigm is a radical departure because it acknowledges that the process of Life is also an unchanging circumstance of our existence — each one of us is constantly changing physically, emotionally, conceptually, and spiritually; and the world around us is constantly changing too. Both the world and we are perpetually being reborn. Life is continually recreating itself. We have potentially infinite selves to deal with potentially infinite situations, and it’s not random because we can choose to avail ourselves of this reality or not.",
