  "description": "Peter and Gemma have been friends since childhood. Peter has always been the one Gemma has turned to. It is his shoulder she cries on, and it is he who knows her better than anyone else. And, for as long as he can remember, Peter has seen Gemma as more than just a friend. She is the only girl he has ever loved, the only one he would be willing to sacrifice everything for. But how can he confess his feelings without ruining what they have? Perhaps the right moment is a trip to Split Rock Falls, the spectacular waterfalls not too far from town. There, surrounded by the beauty of unspoiled woods and crystal waters, Peter will finally be able to reveal what is in his heart, and Gemma will understand that the two of them are meant for each other. But Peter does not realize that Gemma’s destiny has already been written…We meet several characters from Touched in this prequel, where the threads of love, friendship and suspense intertwine in a storyline that is direct and at the same time full of twists and turns, simple yet unexpected.",
