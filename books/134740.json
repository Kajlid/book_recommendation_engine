  "title": "The Irish Girl",
  "description": "From multi-award-winning historical fiction author Ashley E. Sweeney comes a family saga about the Irish immigrant experience spanning New York, Chicago, and Colorado so compelling that, USA Today best-selling author Kelli Estes says, “I read this story in one sitting.”Thirteen-year-old Mary Agnes Coyne, forced from her home in rural Ireland in 1886 after being accused of incest, endures a treacherous voyage across the vast Atlantic alone to an unknown life in America. From the tenements of New York to the rough alleys of Chicago, Mary Agnes suffers the bitter taste of prejudice for the crime of being poor and Irish. Marriage at age sixteen takes her west to Colorado Springs, where her young husband chases a phantom cure for tuberculosis. When tragedy strikes, Mary Agnes finds herself alone again, dreams shattered. But she is determined to forge her own path, and after securing work as a chuckwagon cook at a rugged Colorado ranch, she discovers a newfound sense of purpose and identity. Torn between desire for her ranch boss—who is neither Irish nor Catholic—and propriety, Mary Agnes returns to Chicago, her future uncertain. There, resilience and resolve become her constant companions as she faces yet another her family, newly arrived from Ireland, disowns her. Digging deep within, Mary Agnes discovers strength and worth as she redefines what it means to belong while grappling with the clash of heritage, religion, and matters of the heart.",
