  "description": "How do you solve a murder no one believes happened?  After a bitter divorce and a string of bad luck, Shay Graves seizes the opportunity to pack up her daughter and move back to the enchanted island of Mystic Key to work as a cosmetologist for her family's funeral business. With a teenage daughter about to come into her witchy powers, a family of eccentric witches only a stone’s throw away, and a job where the dead always have a say in their funeral arrangements, she’s certainly got her hands full. But when the spirit of the recently deceased High Priestess appears and claims her death wasn’t an accident, things take a bizarre turn. Even worse, she’s determined to use Shay’s daughter as a pawn if it means she’ll get some answers. Proof that hell hath no fury like a vengeful spirit. And if there’s one way to ruin a fifteen-year-old girl’s birthday, it’s being possessed by the ghost of a bitter, old witch.  When local law enforcement proves to be less than helpful, it’s up to Shay to free her daughter from her new ghostly companion and, quite possibly, bring a murderer to justice. Lucky for her, she has a family of —mostly— capable witches ready to help end the murderous mayhem brewing up all over town.  \nIf you like humorous paranormal cozy mysteries full of magic, misfits, and mayhem, then journey into Mystic Key and meet the Witches of Shadow Lane.",
