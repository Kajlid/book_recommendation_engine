  "description": "Ellen can see the past with a touch of her hand. Every past but her own.  Her parents are dead and she's been exiled, raised apart from a family she barely remembers, her focus on a future of her own creation. Ellen is busy building a life, one that sets aside her past, burying it for good in the same grave everyone thinks she's in.  It's a good plan, but she isn't the only one with an eye to the future.",
