  "description": "Confucius said, \"Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.\" Vengeance is always a double-edged sword. Once you start down that dark path, there is often no turning back. Xuan Lang is a man in search of vengeance. A man dead inside ... with room for nothing else in his heart. A quiet man of about seventy years, Xuan exemplifies the kindly old Asian grandfather. He keeps to himself, running a small herb shop nestled in a peaceful Texas neighborhood. He attracted little attention. Those few who knew Xuan could have no knowledge of the sorrow, the pain, and the rage that existed just beneath the surface ... that inside the shell of this kindly old man lurked the heart of a relentless killer.",
