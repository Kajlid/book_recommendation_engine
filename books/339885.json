But when the decade-long truce is broken, history threatens to repeat itself.Effie Luciano is the throwaway daughter. To her power-hungry father, her hand in marriage is her only value.When her father gives her an unexpected opportunity, she is pitted against the one man she’s spent the last ten years avoiding: Finneas Fox.Finneas Fox is the family’s second-born son, hardened by his father’s tragic death. The gentle and kind boy Effie nearly fell in love with before the war is now a cold, ruthless and unforgiving man.For them, the line between hate and love is razor thin—and just as sharp.After a heist, a murder and countless betrayals, Effie and Finn must reconcile their pasts and learn to live with their scars or risk losing everything.Battling both themselves and each other, they discover that the deeper the darkness, the fiercer the love.",
