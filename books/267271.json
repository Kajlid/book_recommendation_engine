Want to read something that pokes fun at the whole process while also coming up with some great better ideas and solutions? Read this funny, biting satire full of the ways a fictitious (or is she?) future Commander in Chief. changes politics as we know them. Written as if she dictated her memoir AFTER she was President, the book zooms along in short, fast-paced chapters that cover everything from changing taxation to ridding the world of war - and so much more. Read, enjoy and please post a review!",
