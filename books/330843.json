  "description": "Swan: I’m barely in my twenties, but I’m dying. Bone cancer. The treatment could be worse than the cancer itself. When my mom died shortly after my diagnosis, I made a bucket list and started working on it. All was going well until a big, tattooed guy found me on the beach. Well, the kid and the huge dog found me first, but… semantics.El Segador: They call me The Reaper. I’ve lived my entire adult life in the shadows so I could be the deadliest asset El Diablo has. Together we’ve brought death to more men than I can count. But then I meet her. Swan. I may be a sucker for a woman in trouble, but I’m not stupid. There's no way her real name is Swan Lake. Except, apparently, it is. When she tells me about her bucket list, I'm in. Now, I’m thrust into the light with Swan at my side going to… romantic dinners? My only goal is to clear her bucket list before it’s too late, but what if one item on that list is to fall in love?",
