It's a new start for him, and he's already made a kinky friend online. Now all he has to do is find the nerve to get out in real life. Jeff has had nothing but bad luck in love lately. He's fluent in heartache and finally listens when friends tell him he needs to do something different. Brandon faces a delicate balancing act between being the father of a brilliant teenaged daughter and trying to find a subby guy who will accept he's a package deal. He's not just alone, but lonely, and wants more than pick-up play at Venture. When Stuart realizes he's been catfished, he's mortified. But is it a blessing in disguise? Can the three men find what they've all been looking for in each other, or will heartache continue to be their primary language?
