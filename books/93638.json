  "description": "The Ghosts of Smyrna is a historical novel which tells the story of the events leading to the great fire of Smyrna (modern-day Izmir) in 1922, through the trials and tribulations of a Levantine family caught up in the turmoil. The fire, which destroyed not only a beautiful and ancient city but also a multicultural way of life that had blossomed there over centuries, occurred at the end of the war of independence led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk against the occupying European countries. Th e story takes place in the period between World War I and the great fire.The Levantines in Turkey are a cultural minority of European ancestry mixed with local Greek, Turkish and Armenian heritage. Centuries ago, during the glory days of the Ottoman Empire, they settled in the major cities and ports of the empire. Many families had Genoese or Venetian backgrounds and were involved in commerce and trade. In Izmir (Smyrna) Levantines were polyglots who functioned with ease in Turkish, Greek, French, Italian and English and were essential to the cultural and economic fabric of the city, contributing to its distinct identity.Evocative of time and place, and beautifully told, The Ghosts of Smyrna is a novel that deals with love, war and loss, and tragedies that are universal to human existence.",
