  "title": "Pinocchio's Forgotten Land",
  "description": "What became of Pinocchio after his beloved fairy transformed him into a real boy? Was he a comfort to his father? Were his days of mischief and disobedience behind him? Hardly! Scott Mignola's marvelously insane, true-to-the-original sequel picks up where Collodi left off, taking readers on a wild ride through enchanted woods, back to the City of Simple Simons, and to places never before imagined. Follow Pinocchio as he chases after a lost fortune and searches for his fairy mother, who he fears is dying of disappointment, and all due to him! Some favorite characters return, accompanied by a slew of new ones, including a monstrous crab, a lovely enchantress, and a man with a bull’s head who perhaps sums it up best by saying, “By the Emperor’s whiskers, I swear I have never seen such a thing.”Available now at all Amazon and iTunes stores.For more information about the author, please visit the publisher website at www.dogboypro.com.",
