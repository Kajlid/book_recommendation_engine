DeMulder's personal revelations complete a touching portrait of the artist and her fearless exploration of the human experience, bare in its rawest and most tender forms. Praise\"Sierra DeMulder possesses the most important quality a young writer can have, a unique voice. That voice exploded onto the national spoken word scene, moving her rapidly up the ranks as one of the most exciting performance poets working today. Sierra uses subtlety and tension the way photographers use angle. She will eat your heart with a spoon.\" - Karen Finnyfrock\"...violently passionate and sweet, deftly moving between the two modes.\" - The Lamron, SUNY Geneseo\"...intensely personal.\"- Huffington Post",
