  "description": "Joe Keough, formerly a New York City police detective, has moved to St. Louis to get away from the mayhem of the Big Apple and start over. Transferred from the energized streets of his hometown of Brooklyn, Keough is expecting anything but the twisted trail of abductions and murders that await him. He barely has time to acclimate himself to his new home and job before two cases capture his attention, his imagination, and - in the case of a little boy - his heart.Five minutes into Detective Keough's new life, four-year-old Brady Sanders walks into his St. Louis police station, leaving behind a trail of bloody footprints. So begins a riveting tale of murder and mystery, from Brady's missing parents and their blood-soaked house, to the kidnapping of beautiful mothers and their small children.",
