  "description": "ABOUT THIS EPISODE  Broken trust. Shattered hearts. Secrets exposed--and yet still no closer to the truth. When Malcolm and Seong-Jae's relationship hits a wall, their partnership fragments as well...and they may not be able to withstand the crushing tide when protests over Tomasz Kowalczyk's death turn into deadly riots. Too many familiar faces return, and one will be leaving in a bodybag.  But for the puppetmaster guiding their every move, the chaos that descends on Baltimore is the perfect opportunity to capture his mark.  And when Sila sets his eyes on Malcolm...  Malcolm will discover that nowhere is safe. There's no one he can trust.  And no one to save him from the man who taught Seong-Jae to love through pain. Through suffering. Through hatred. Through lies.  Through betrayal, when nothing and no one are what they seem.  \nPart I of the thrilling Season One finale!",
