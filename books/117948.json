  "description": "'A masterpiece ... as mature and finished as Henry James's The Turn of the Screw' TimeSet on a Southern army base in the 1930s, Reflections in a Golden Eye tells the story of Captain Penderton, a bisexual whose life is upset by the arrival of Major Langdon, a charming womanizer who has an affair with Penderton's tempestuous and flirtatious wife, Leonora.

But Carson McCullers tells her tale with simplicity, insight, and a rare gift of phrase.\" Written during a time when McCullers's own marriage to Reeves was on the brink of collapse",
