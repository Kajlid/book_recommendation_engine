When Lord Huldbrand first meets her on a lost and haunted promontory, she seems utterly beautiful and pure. But gradually he begins to wonder just how much he really knows about his bride. He fears her murky past and her mystical powers. And worst of all, he fears that the faceless demon that stalks them through the woods and castle, cackling with laughter and howling with rage, could be coming to claim her. A love story with a horrifying mystery at its core,  Haunted Waters  tests its young hero’s commitment to a heroine who sparkles and changes like water.",
