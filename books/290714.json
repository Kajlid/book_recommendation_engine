  "description": "The Demon king Shimon spent the last five hundred years secluded in his own castle in the realm of Pandaemonium. Cursed by a witch to look like a monster even he himself can’t face in the mirror, he lost all hope of finding and claiming his eternal mate.  The Valkyrie assassin Grimhild the Reaper is trying to make the world a better place by hunting and killing the bad guys. Her world is turned upside down when she takes a mission where she must steal one certain possession of one certain Demon king.  Two worlds collide… As two immortals, who seemingly have nothing in common, meet one fateful night, both their lives will never be the same. Shimon wants to claim her body and soul. Can Grimhild surrender to the demon, whose kisses are hotter than the inferno itself, or will she resist the pull of fate?  Demon from the Shadows is a standalone steamy paranormal romance. Each book in the Descendants of Night series will feature a different couple with a complete story. It’s a world with dominant males and their sassy women. Suited for readers 18+ due to language and graphic intimate scenes.",
