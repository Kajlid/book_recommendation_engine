  "description": "She thought this was a game. She thought she could walk away. She thought wrong.  I’ve lived a cold, unforgiving life. I’ve seen things, I’ve done things, that would break a man. If they didn’t kill him first.  With my past behind me, I have nothing. No way to atone for my sins and nothing to lift me from the depths of despair I’ve come from. And no one to give me the control that I so desperately desire.  But as soon as I saw Lilly walk through the halls of Club X, something inside my cold heart flickered. With her large, blue eyes, and her seductive curves, I wanted her. Lilly, my flower. There’s a sweet innocence about her that steals the breath from my lungs. She brings my darkness to the surface, and what’s more… she craves it just as much as I do.  The danger is what lured her to me. But she didn't realize how intense this would be when she signed that contract.  She thought it was all fantasy and make-believe. But I'm not a knight in shining armor. I'm not a hero from a romance novel. I'm the villain.  And now she wants to leave?  I won’t allow it.  I own her. And I’m not letting her go.  *Owned is a full-length standalone DARK romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.",
