  "description": "Dr. Riley Blake left New York and moved to a small town in Maine after inheriting his uncle's house. Unfortunately, a disturbing part of his past follows him. The last thing Sheriff Marcus Cameron really had time for was a new relationship. As the son of the alpha of the largest werewolf pack in the area, he had a duty to his family. But Riley Blake is a gorgeous temptation, and he's always been rather fond of giving into his baser instincts.",
