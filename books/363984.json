  "description": "Lake Wobegon goes to Italy in Garrison Keillor's latestTwelve Wobegonians fly to Rome to decorate a war hero's grave, led by Marjorie Krebsbach, with radio host Gary Keillor along for the ride. The pilgrimage is inspired by a phone call from an Italian woman seeking her Lake Wobegon roots and by a memoir O Paradiso by a farm wife who found the secret of life and love in Italy. And by marjorie's longing to win back the love of her husband Carl. Far from home, sitting in the rain in the Piazza Navona, the pilgrims talks about themselves, as they never could do in the Chatterbox Caf√©.\"You're not going to write about this, I hope,\" says Irene Bunsen. \"Of course I am. I invented this town,\" says Mr. Keillor. \"Oh my, aren't you something,\" she replies.",
