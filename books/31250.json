  "title": "Self Abuse",
  "description": "A searingly honest memoir of love, loss and fatherhood At 35, despite his determination to be different from his parents, Jonathan Self found his life echoing he was a twice-divorced absent father with three young children, one in the UK and two in Australia. In this searingly frank, moving and often funny memoir, Self documents his efforts to break the family mould and become a different kind of parent. It is highly personal in its discussion of alcohol, drug and sexual abuse, filled with extraordinary characters and events, but also universal - the pain of separation from one's children, the best intentions gone awry, the sins of the parents condemning the children. Ultimately it is a story filled with love and hope.",
