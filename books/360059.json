  "description": "The battle is near! The Seven Sleepers have been sent on one last mission before the final battle with the Dark Lord. \"Alert three more groups of my people,\" instructed God. \"You must go to the Land of Ice, to the Centaurs, and to Celethorn, Land of the Magicians.\" Join the Seven Sleepers as they set out on their most dangerous mission ever. With Beorn, the mysterious dwarf, and Glori, the stunningly beautiful woman, as their guides, they trek over frozen tundra and plunge into deep, dark caverns. Yet somehow the Dark Lord seems to meet them at every move. Could one of them be a traitor? See how Josh, Sarah, and their friends hold fast to their allegiance to God in the midst of danger, fear, tragedy, and trickery. The end has come... but who will win the victory?",
