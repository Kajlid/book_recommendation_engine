  "description": "Patchwork Man is the first in the Patchwork trilogy and has been awarded an Indie B.R.A.G. Medallion. Other books in the series are Patchwork People (book 2) and Patchwork Pieces (book 3).Lawrence Juste is one. The QC with a conscience - privileged, reputable and emotionally frozen. The perfect barrister. But Lawrence hasn't always been who he is now. When he is glaringly in the public eye after his enigmatic wife is killed in an apparently random hit and run, he could do with his hidden past surfacing like a hole in the head. Unfortunately the past has a way of finding its way back to you, just like betrayal. His dead wife has helpfully left him a sinister resume of his, and events just keep adding to it... 'Gripping all the way through...' 'Compelling.'",
