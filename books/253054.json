  "description": "In 1964, American judge Potter Stewart famously said, 'I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it.' Over fifty years later, the reverberations of these words are still being felt across the world. Be it proposed porn bans, religious morality or women's rights, the assumption is that porn has a single, knowable definition. But one man's art is another woman's erotica is another person's sex tape.In this intrepid, empathetic and nuanced account of the sexual shopping cart that is the internet today, Richa Kaul Padte takes readers on an intimate tour of online sex cultures. From camgirls to fanfiction writers, homemade videos to consent violations, Cyber Sexy investigates what it means to seek out pleasure online.And as for whether or not something counts as porn? You'll know it when you see it.",
