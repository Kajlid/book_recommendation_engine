  "description": "Through a school newsletter, Shay and Frankie find out that the local football club are having trials and decide to try out for the team, but are both boys good enough? On the day of the trials, many boys turn up, all nervous and excited but happy to be there. Jamie, known as the fidgety boy, has ADHD and is only ever truly focused when playing football. Tandeep, despite being a fantastic footballer, is so shy that he struggles with communication. Like Shay and Frankie, every boy hopes to make the team. The boys are looking forward to the opportunity to train with the great Coach Joe and the chance to meet the local legend that is Coach Reece.",
