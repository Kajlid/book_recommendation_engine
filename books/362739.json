  "description": "Best friends aren't supposed to go away.And if they do, they're most definitely not meant to come back.When your best and only main friend since you were five moves away for ever and ever, leaving your life and your netball team in a state of crisis, there's only one thing to eat pistachio nuts. Lots of them. And rearrange your bookshelves. Many times. But what happens when you follow your mother's patented and thoroughly unhinged super-fast shortcut to forgetting and then the unthinkable happens - your best friend comes back again, walking casually into class like she never left? What happens when she goes and sits next to your old nemesis and invites her to join the netball team, dooming it to certain and horrible failure? Somehow, Olivia has to find a way to be friends with this new Annabel, preferably one that doesn't involve demented parental advice or books such as Journey to Your Inner You-ness.Annabel, Again is a story about pistachios and psychotic chickens; about not-quite-maniacs and the secret life of turtles. In the end, itâ€™s a story about losing friendship, about fighting to hold on to what you had, and finally getting it back again, in a surprising new shape.",
