  "description": "Emily has fallen out of love with her adoring professor husband - and headlong into a passionate affair with one of his colleagues. The affair will certainly be discovered in their narrow social circle. Emily doesn't want to hurt her husband; she doesn't love the man with whom she is having the affair; and she doesn't end it.Emily's milieu - a small, prestigious New England college - and the mixture of intellectuals, bohemians, and faculty wives who inhabit it, form the basis for this sharp, discerning novel of fraud, falsehood, love, and friendship in the groves of Academe.",
