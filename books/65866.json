  "title": "Mammy Walsh's A-Z of the Walsh Family",
  "description": "It does exactly what it says on the tin but here’s a brief word from its author, Mammy Walsh herself:‘There’s this woman I know from bridge, Mona Hopkins, a lovely woman she is, even if I must admit I’m not that keen on her myself, and she said a great thing the other day. I was expecting her to say “Two no trumps,” but instead she comes out with a saying about her children. She says, “Boys wreck your house and girls wreck your head.” Isn’t that a marvellous bit of wisdom – “Boys wreck your house and girls wreck your head!” And God knows it’s the truest thing I’ve heard in a long time. I should know. I have five girls. Five daughters. And let me tell you, my head is wrecked from them.Although, now that I think of it, so is my house . . .’It’s the perfect re-introduction to the Walsh family, featured in Marian’s bestselling novels about the Walsh sisters, Watermelon, Rachel’s Holiday, Angels, Anybody Out There and The Mystery of Mercy Close.",
