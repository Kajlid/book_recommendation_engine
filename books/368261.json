  "description": "Drew Harris is a master when it comes to the game of pool, but family is always a crap shoot and Drew rolled snake eyes. His parents want little to do with him. The only time they call him is when they need money, or when they want him to bail his gambling-addict brother, Vic, out of a jam. So when Drew's mother calls in a panic to let Drew know that Vic owes a local casino owner two-hundred and fifty grand, Drew's not exactly shocked. Not shocked, that is, until he learns that the guy Vic owes doesn't want the money: he wants Drew.Casino mogul Evan Stacie never thought he was the kind of man to resort to blackmail, but the death of his brother two years ago changed a lot of things. He needs Drew's skill with a stick to ruin the man who sent Evan's brother to an early grave, and if Evan has to fight dirty to make that happen, so be it. Nothing, not his growing attraction to Drew or the soft spot Evan feels for the guy, is going to stand in his way.",
