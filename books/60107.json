  "description": "In Dark Angels of the Cross (The Warrior Series, #4), Allison La Crosse's journey continues at full speed. With barely enough time to process her heartbreak, she learns danger has followed her from the Underwater Realm, and with it, she sees firsthand how potent the fury of a scorned woman can be. When Sheza orders Crux, the latest Dark Fallen Angel, to hunt and kill Allison, the fight for her life begins anew.Making the adventure all the more interesting and dangerous, Allison learns that promises, pledges, blood bonds, and commitments made in the heat of the moment cannot be ignored or denied...no matter how much she would like to do just that. Allison's most-recent Disciple, Hestia, is Crux's soul mate. For her sake, Allison, Brody, Clark, Daryl, and Neptune join forces and journey into Demesne's Inferno, a land comparable to Hell. It's the only place where Crux's soul can be rescued from the darkest angel of all.",
