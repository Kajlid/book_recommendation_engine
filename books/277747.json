  "description": "Durdane is in the grip of the devilish Roguskhoi. Raping and pillaging in their lethal thrust to their heartland, they annihilate all who cross their path. With spirits sapped by years of silent tyranny, the men of Durdane stand impotent, their faceless leader a prisoner in his own palace. One man alone can save Durdane - the musician Gastel Etzwane. But even he is unaware that worming through the land is a corruption more deadly than anything the Roguskhoi can inflict.",
