  "description": "Will Jared's dark desires scare the inexperienced Alana away?Alana has no choice but to accept the seasonal job as an elf in the local mall, not unless she wants to lose her apartment. She didn't expect the man under the Santa costume, a volunteer named Jared, to be such a hunk, either. But just as the sparks between them fly, Jared tangles with a thief and is escorted out of the mall for violating the manager's 'hands off' policy.Jared can't believe he was fired from a volunteer job just because he single handedly apprehended a thief in the mall. Worse yet, he won't get to wish Alana a Merry Christmas and ask her out on a date. What he doesn't expect is for her to show up on his doorstep in the middle of a snowstorm . . .",
