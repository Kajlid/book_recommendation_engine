  "description": "This critically acclaimed modern American novel is analyzed and summarized, and Alice Walker's distinct writing style is discussed. Titles in this growing series for middle school and high school students analyze novels and plays that are included in most schools' English Lit. curricula. Literature Made Easy books are more than plot summaries. They analyze characters, explain themes, and point out details that make each author's writing style unique. Each book also features \"Mind Maps\"Â—diagrams that summarize the work's most important details and serve as stimuli to help students focus their ideas for exams and term papers.",
