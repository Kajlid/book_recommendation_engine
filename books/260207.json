  "description": "This vintage book contains Rabindranath Tagore's 1912 play, 'The Post Office'. The play revolves around Amal, a child confined to his adopted uncle's house by an incurable disease who, inspired by the construction of a local post office, fantasizes about receiving a letter from the king or being a postman. The play was translated into English by W. B. Yeats, and was performed in English for the first time in 1912, by the 'Irish Theatre Company' in London with Tagore in attendance. The Bengali original was staged in Calcutta in 1917. Rabindranath Tagore (1861 - 1941) was a Bengali polymath who reformed Bengali literature and music in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We are republishing this antiquarian volume now complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author.",
