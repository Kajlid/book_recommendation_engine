  "description": "“I loved you then,I love you now,and I’ve loved you every single day in between.” Jameson Taylor is a nomad. A drifter. A memory collector.Or, at least, that’s what’s become of her life ever since she was forced to leave pieces of her fractured heart behind. “This is the fault in our fate, our one undoing:All he’s ever wanted is my happiness,even when it costs him his own.” Holden Eastwood is resentful. Angry. But most of all, hurt.Torn to pieces by the girl who left him, he struggles to find forgiveness in the organ she once broke. When a tragedy forces them to face the aftermath, Jamie seeks acceptance, while Holden searches for answers.What they find, instead, are remnants of their love.Fragments of forever.And parts of a puzzle that will lead them to the truth…A truth that might shatter them to pieces.",
