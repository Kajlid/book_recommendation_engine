  "title": "The 13 Crimes of Science Fiction",
  "description": "A private investigator hunts a killer & uncovers a fantastic & horrifying secret. An important man is murdered & there are numerous suspects--each from a different planet. A computer helps a young man solve a puzzle & assumes the personality of a long-dead gangster. Isaac Asimov has conspired with collaborators Martin Harry Greenberg & Charles G. Waugh to mastermind this diabolically clever anthology in which each of the classic categories of crime fiction is represented by a science fiction tale. Here are such science fiction greats as Philip K. Dick, Larry Niven, Clifford Simak, Jack Vance & the illustrious Dr. Asimov himself writing cosmic variations on the whodunit, how-done-it, why-done-it, the hard-boiled detective, the police procedural & even a brand-new category--the psychic detective story.9 • The Universe of Science Fiction • essay by Isaac Asimov13 • The Detweiler Boy • (1977) • Tom Reamy49 • The Ipswich Phial • [Lord Darcy] • (1976) • Randall Garrett97 • Second Game • (1958) • Katherine MacLean and Charles V.
