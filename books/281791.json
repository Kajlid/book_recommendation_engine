  "description": "They never had anything in common and tolerated each other for their best friends’ sake. Thrown together due to circumstances beyond their control, Cupid strikes.   Aditi is a modern girl working in Delhi brought up in a sheltered atmosphere with high traditional family values.  Rahul is a free thinker with no regard or patience for archaic social norms.  Will Rahul be able to break the barrier of Aditi’s social conditioning? Will he go to any length to convince her of his philosophy?  Can Aditi hope to make Rahul believe in happily-ever-after? Will she risk losing her independence for a person who cannot give her any emotional security?",
