  "title": "Justin Time: Autobiographical Stories from an American Spiritual Master",
  "description": "A truly unique presentation from an even more unique individual. With humor and perspective, Gold recounts stories from his life that underlie his metamorphosis from ordinary American kid to enlightened spiritual master. His point of view is so high and wild that it transforms many of the experiences we have in common into a remarkable odyssey that spans five continents and close to 70 years. If you let this book take you beneath the surface of things, exciting new discoveries will ensue – like the first qualification for a spiritual friend or Guru, “One who can pass the salt to you and mail a letter for you,” and “The only pride that causes no separation between us is the pride of being a human being.”",
