Namely, welcome to the tribe, human.My exciting vacation gets a little too exciting when my ship blows up, and my escape pod lands on an alien planet filled with a predator species. They’re barely civilized, not a translator chip in sight, and there’s no mistaking the way they drool when they stalk me.I gravitate toward the one that seems to want to keep me safe. Impossibly huge, black hair, pale eyes.But tribal law decrees I’m the prize in a series of deadly games. To claim me, he must win. If he loses, I’m toast.*** From the author of the Horde and the Beasts, comes a new exciting series with an authentic Alpha alien male voice, humor, and heart.They're primal.They're Vikings in space.They can shift and will hook you for life.",
