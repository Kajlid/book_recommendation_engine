If that were the case, then mine started when I was nine years old. They say that nothing good ever comes out of love triangles. Nice to know. Too bad my triangle is a quadrilateral. They say never fall in love with your best friend. Too late, because I fell in love with two of them. I may seem spoiled. I may seem selfish. But you’ve never met Jayson, Ryder, Julien, or Fallon. You know what they also say? Choices have consequences, and some consequences are deadly. Elizabeth I have to make a choice. A choice about the woman I want to be… And the man I want to be with. My choice changed everything. But what if I made a mistake? I thought I knew how my love story would end. I couldn’t have been more wrong. 2) Paper Stars Rewritten, Book 2 I used to be a selfish girl. I used to want everything without having to give up anything. Funny how Fate stepped in and in one horrific night, altered my destiny and the lives of my best friends, Jayson, Ryder, and Julien, in ways we could never imagine. It’s been over a year since I saw my guys. A year after everything was taken from me. But I’m not the same girl I was before. I’m not the same girl Jayson, Ryder, and Julien remember. I’m something new. Tragedy remade me into someone stronger, fiercer. I just wish the Fates would stop messing with me. But you know what they say? Be careful what you wish for. If life offered you a second chance at love, how hard would you fight to claim it? Everyone’s story can be rewritten. Ryder One horrific night changed everything, and Elizabeth was gone. Taken from us. Taken from me. It’s been over a year since Jayson, Julien, and I last saw her. Every day has been a struggle without her, and all we want, all we wish for, is to have her back. But the woman who returns to us is not the Elizabeth we once knew. Perhaps this new Elizabeth can be mine. 3) Broken Butterfly, Book 3 One man will claim her. One man will own her heart. One man will save her. And one man will break her. Fallon Elizabeth has always been my obsession. My fascination. She was the light to my dark.
