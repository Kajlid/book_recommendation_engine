  "description": "Anton:It’d be an understatement to say that I jumped at the chance to find out who orchestrated the hit on Mariana Petran. To threaten the queen of the clans is an attack against all of us and being tasked with tracking down the son-of-a-bitch is nothing short of an honor.But when I found him I also found something unexpected, a sweet, sweet cherry on top of the sundae.But there’s an unexpected tie between the two…I mean, there I was, delivering a bloody and violent end to the scum that betrayed us, when in walks a feisty redhead by the name of Natasha.Natasha:I never expected to find my uncle bloodied and bruised after coming home from a wild night out with the girls. Sobering as that was, the gun held to the back of his head, and the man holding it, was even moreso.It’s not everyday that you walk in on your boyfriend preparing to kill your uncle.He never told me that he was in the Romanian Mob, but, to be fair, I never told him that I was the niece of a head clan member…Or about my father.Then, in a chaotic twist that would change my life forever, my uncle was killed and I was swept off by the man who I’d foolishly allowed myself to fall for. Now Anton has me; they have me.But they don’t know whose daughter they’ve taken.They’re clueless.",
