  "description": "Picture this: You wake up in the middle of the night, swamped in your star wars covers and completely and utterly groggy to the extent that you look like something from the Monsters Inc. movie. You hear a sound, so you sit up and turn your lamp on, and thatâ€™s when you see it. Your new neighbour, clambering halfway through your windowsill (Still managing to look like some sort of a Greek god, may I add) holding your MICKEY MOUSE BRA. What do you do?Well, you scream obviously. Then what?Why, you get revenge of course.",
