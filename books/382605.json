  "title": "The Highly Sensitive Person: How to Thrive When the World Overwhelms You",
  "description": "Do you have a keen imagination and vivid dreams? Is time alone each day as essential to you as food and water? Are you \"too shy\" or \"too sensitive\" according to others? Do noise and confusion quickly overwhelm you? If your answers are yes, you may be a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP).Most of us feel overstimulated every once in a while, but for the HSP, it's a way of life. In this groundbreaking book, Dr. Elaine Aron, a clinical psychologist, workshop leader, and an HSP herself, shows you how to identify this trait in yourself and make the most of it in everyday situations. Drawing on her many years of research and hundreds of interviews, she shows how you can better understand yourself and your trait to create a fuller, richer life.",
