  "description": "Beware! This isn't your average fairytale ... Take one troubled teen, add some magic, a touch of romance, a few evil witches, and an elfin-sized sidekick named Duane, and you have NOT SO SNOW WHITE. \"My name is Winter Snow and I have a secret.\" Winter Snow is having a bad year ... her dad mysteriously disappears, she has a serious identity crisis with an immerging case of supernatural ability invading her behavior, and a pack of bullies to make her feel like the biggest freak in school. To add to her confusion, she meets and falls for a boy who seems to have some secrets of his own. When a twisted fairytale book about Snow White falls into her hands, events seem to take a course of their own as she solves the mystery of her true identity and struggles to find her dad. Of course, Winter has a little help from her friends and a tiny magical muse she calls Duane. And as she predicts, life couldn't become more exciting ... or could it? NOT SO SNOW WHITE is part of a series of modern fairytales that includes CINDERELLA GEEK.",
