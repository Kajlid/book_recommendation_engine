  "title": "Not Quite Nirvana: A Skeptic's Journey to Mindfulness",
  "description": "A funny and incisive memoir of how a skeptical, fast-talking New Yorker became the personal editor for Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh and  slowly and reluctantly started to absorb mindfulness practice. Scenes with Zen teachers and the author's two vividly exuberant older parents, illustrate how the author adapts mindfulness techniques for the busyness of her life, without losing her edge. With honest and vivid stories about dealing with difficult relationships with family members, death, illness, vanity, exhaustion, and creating a safety net of joy, the author explores and offers guidance for how to find inspiration and nourishment amid the juggle and rush of daily life.This book is designed for adults who are new to mindfulness practice, curious skeptics and critics,  new and experienced parents, and and anyone interested in finding greater joy, nourishment, and a larger community in their lives.",
