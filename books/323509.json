  "description": "“ This steamy tale explores ED, the age-old lust vs. love response , and one of the best discussions of interracial affairs and erotic encounters before the public today. D H Chewins is proving to be a remarkably fine author on a mission to titillate while sharing a very positive nod to understanding racial concepts. Recommended reading for not only the Chick Lit devotees but to men as well. ” — Grady Harp , HALL OF FAME TOP 100 REVIEWER ★ ★★★★ Now that the Devilish joke is over and Katheryn , our sex goddess, has returned home to Atlanta, Georgia from filming intense and torrid porn with Massai Mobuku in Atlantic City, what happens next? The experience has changed the voluptuous Southern belle. How is she coping with the aftermath? She’s still young and voracious at her sexual peak at 39. Torn between lust and love, will she stay married? Or… This book explores and exposes her thrills of the forbidden . It is a continuation of Katheryn’s explicit interracial sex saga, unintentionally involving her parents Kacey and Howard . It’s a standalone story, though it references events in the author’s previous #1 Best Seller, An Immoral Erotic Parable of American Eve & African Adam. Wouldn’t you like to follow Katheryn ? To see what naughty but erotic mischiefs she’s drummed up? To give the blonde beauty and her loved ones hope or pause?",
