  "description": "Bill Durmer is in over his head. In Midlife Mouse, the debut novel from filmmaker Wayne Franklin, Durmer, an underachieving genius, runs away to Walt Disney World in the mother of all midlife crises. Led by a series of bizarre encounters, a hyper-caffeinated delusion and a mysterious prophecy, Bill goes to the Magic Kingdom seeking his destiny. But a group of Disney haters will do almost anything to stop him. Pirates and princesses, morticians, moms and man-beasts, spacemen and psychos all have a stake in Bill's future ... and those are the good guys. This is not how he planned to spend his summer vacation. A genre mash-up of contemporary fantasy, Southern lit and mystery, Midlife Mouse builds upon real Disney history to create a fictional mythology for the Most Magical Place on Earth. Oh, and there's a mouse in there, too.",
