  "description": "Jordan O'Malley has everything she ever a job she loves, a beautiful home, and a dependable boyfriend. When her life unravels after a breast cancer scare, Jordan decides to join her wildest childhood friend in San Francisco and track down her drifter brother, Cam, who harbors secrets of his own. When Cam suddenly flees the country, Jordan follows, determined to bring him home. Her journey takes her to the farthest reaches of majestic Nepal, where she encounters tests—and truths—about love and family that she never could have imagined. Funny, heartbreaking, and suspenseful, Sleeping Tigers reminds us all that sometimes it's better to follow your heart instead of a plan. \"Sleeping Tigers is the kind of book you wish didn’t have to end.  Fast-moving and funny, loaded with sex, adventure, and characters who feel like your oldest friends, it takes the reader through fabulous, keenly-observed settings as it follows one woman on a brave journey of self-discovery.  Robinson’s prose crackles with wit and humanity – it brims with all the energy that’s released when life and love are unleashed and allowed to roam.  With wisdom to spare, Robinson shows how being honest and brave today can bring healing to the past and a new shape to the future.  You won’t be able to read this book without imagining all your favorite actors in the roles.\" Elisabeth Brink, author of Save Your Own",
