  "description": "“I know Balor is evil and all, and I know his death would mean that so many other people would get to live, but I hate that I have to be the one to kill him. Taking his life will mean that I’m no better than he is.” Ian stopped walking and took one of my hands in his. “You want to know the biggest difference between what Balor is doing and what you’re planning to do? You question it. You ask yourself it it’s morally correct. You have a powerful internal struggle that I know keeps you up at night. Balor never asks those questions. Balor doesn’t struggle with what he does.” Eighteen-year-old Maggie O’Neill is a high school dropout. If her parents knew, they’d probably kill her, but that’s the least of her worries. Balor—the evil faery from hell—is still stalking her, someone is still betraying her, and the mean girl at school is still mean. The worst part of her life, however, is figuring out how to live it without Simon. Will Maggie discover a way to defeat Balor? Will she ever be able to out-snark the mean girl? Will she find Simon? Tune in next week—uh, read the book—to find out.",
