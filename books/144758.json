  "description": "\"Puma Perl is a remarkable poet and an exciting performer. Retrograde is a true contemporary masterpiece.\" - John Sinclair, poet, jazz and blues historian, former manager of the MC5, radio host, and political activist  With \"Retrograde \" , Puma Perl goes back in time in order to move forward­­-and what a trip this proves to be. This is a journey of life and survival among the ghosts and dreams of a past captured with full honesty and sharp humor (sometimes self-deprecating, other times pinning the tail on absurdity). Funny, smart, dirty yet tender, Puma Perl brings the descriptive eye of Lou Reed to her apocalyptic rock and roll vision of the world. Cover photo by Bill DesJardins. Author photo by Len DeLessio.",
