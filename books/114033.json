  "description": "*MIDWEST BOOK AWARDS FINALIST*DOWN DOG DIARY: One man has died for it. Now it's Maya Skye's job to protect it. Can a yoga teacher hunt a killer and still find inner peace? In yoga, the Downward Facing Dog Pose turns your world upside down, and that is exactly what the Down Dog Diary does to yoga teacher Maya Skye. First, her mentor, a former Hell's Angel turned shaman, is killed for the book of secrets. Now Maya has it, and trouble is stalking her. When the mystical journal is stolen, Maya learns just how elusive inner peace can be at the point of a gun. Down Dog Diary is set in small Gabriel's Garden, Minnesota, not far from the Twin Cities. It's a mystery told with humor and drama, but it is also an exploration of the battle for inner peace that rages inside all of us. We may try to follow the path, but life isn't all Minnesota nice.",
