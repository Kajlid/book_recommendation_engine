  "description": "In this theological, supernatural thriller, 19-year-old Kallie Hunt's everyday moments begin feeling all too familiar. She has a sense that she'd lived them before. But that was crazy, right? Deja vu. That was kid's stuff, right? Been there, done that, impossible. You got one shot at this life thing. One shot. You lived. You died. End of story. But if that was true, then why would the government be interested in her? Why would priests literally be stalking her? How could a small town girl possibly have anything to do with saving humanity from terrorists and demons? And pray-tell, what does any of it have to do with her first love? For Kallie Hunt, there would be no simple answers. Besides, nothing in life was ever really simple. Not good. Not evil. Not even love...Combining elements of religions as varied as Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Wicca, Rememberers, takes urban fantasy to new levels.",
