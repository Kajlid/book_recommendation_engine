They have been best friends forever but this is their first taste of each other..They were both straight guys or so they thought they were!!And after this wonderful episode will they mark it as a once in a lifetime thing or will they confess their undying love for each other and face the reality of their love.They look so adorable together!!Photo Description: On a beige couch two dark-haired, shirtless men kiss, mouths open, eyes closed. The man above arches back and supports himself on braced arms, so their hairless chests are held a whisper apart. The man below grips his lover's bicep, and with the other hand curves tentative fingers over his jeans-clad ass.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Hot Summer Days\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.Read the story here or find it in Don't Read in the Closet, Volume 1.__________Genre: contemporaryTags: gay m/m, gay for you, virgins, friends to lovers, copsWord Count: 7,055",
