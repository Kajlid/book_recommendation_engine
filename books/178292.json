  "description": "Never judge a dragon by her human cover...\nSixteen-year-old Kitty Lung has everyone convinced she's a normal teen--not a secret government operative, not the one charged with protecting the president's son, and certainly not a were-dragon. The only one she trusts with the truth is her best friend--and secret crush--the Ã¼ber-hot Bulisani Mathe.Then a junior operative breaks Rule Number One by changing into his dragon form in public--on Kitty's watch--and suddenly, the world knows. About dragons. About the Draconic Intelligence Command (DIC) Kitty works for. About Kitty herself.Now the government is hunting down and incarcerating dragons to stop a public panic, and a new shape-shifting enemy has kidnapped the president's son. Kitty and Bulisani are the last free dragons, wanted by both their allies and their enemies. If they can't rescue the president's son and liberate their fellow dragons before getting caught themselves, dragons might never live free again.",
