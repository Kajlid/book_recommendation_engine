To what extent will I have to push myself to do my duty? But most of all, why is a part of me so excited about what is going to happen?Photo Description: A black and white image of a bearded man, naked, bound and blindfolded.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love’s Landscapes\" event.
