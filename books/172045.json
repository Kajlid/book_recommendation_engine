  "title": "Real You Incorporated: 8 Essentials for Women Entrepreneurs",
  "description": "Real You Incorporated empowers women entrepreneurs. The book provides insights for women on how to discover and love their personal brand, and how to bring it into the market as a real business―unique and different. In the first section of the book, Find It Within You, readers will learn how to express internal personality, passions and essence to define the internal brand. In the second section, The Competitive Advantage, readers learn how to extend the internal message into the world―to their partners, employees and ultimately their customers. Part branding―the author is a nationally known marketing expert―and part business inspiration, Real You Incorporated includes case studies of real women entrepreneurs from a variety of manufacturing, retail, restaurants, real estate, publishing and many more. Their stories bring the book to life, adding inspiration and role models. The book also includes a visualization tool in the form of a chart that women entrepreneurs can complete and keep with them, to remind them of their Real You, no matter what phase their business is in.",
