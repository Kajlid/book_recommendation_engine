  "title": "Mr. Cogito",
  "description": "This is the long-awaited translation of the volume Pan Cogito (Warsaw, 1974), now published in English translation as a full sequence of 40 poems for the first time. Writing of earlier volumes, the New Yorker said that `Herbert is one of the finest and most original writers of this century...a stubbornly idiosyncratic poet of isolation, disinheritance, and grief.' Mr Cogito acts as the award-winning poet's alibi, alias, persona, or as Seamus Heaney has said, `as a representative of the most courageous, well-disposed and unremittingly intelligent members of the species. This book is intended for admirers of Zbigniew Herbert; readers of poetry; libraries; universities.",
