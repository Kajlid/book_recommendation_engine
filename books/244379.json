  "description": "Get ready for the Morelli family like you've never seen them beforeâ€”through the eyes of Mateo Morelli.  For four days, I kept her to myself.  For four days, she was mine.  Then, at the first opportunity, she left me.  To the world it may seem I've let her go, but she'll never be beyond my reach.  No matter where she is, no matter how she feels about me, Mia will always be mine.  And I will always be hers.  **Entrapment is a short Morelli family novel (60k words) from the oft-requested POV of Mateo. It takes place during Accidental Witness, BUT it is intended to be read at the end of the series, after all the puzzle pieces have clicked into place. In addition to the Entrapment story, this collection includes deleted scenes from each of the seven books in the Morelli family series. ** WARNING: trigger warnings apply. This is a dark romance/mafia story with dark themes. Violence and WTF-ery abounds.",
