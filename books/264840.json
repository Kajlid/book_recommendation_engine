Nobody can prevent the Washingtons and their daughter from moving to the home of their dreams, even in an all-white neighborhood like the Crowley's. Not legally. But the Crowleys are a vengeful brood with ties to very evil men....For TJ Crowley, it's been a bummer of a summer. With his father away from home and his brother gone off to fight in Vietnam, TJ and his mom are all alone in their house on the hill just one street away from the racial dividing line. When the nightly curfew kicks-in, their doors are locked tight. While his fearful mom drinks her worries away, TJ watches from the living room window as firebombs light the sky....Despite everything, TJ is excited about going to Brooks Junior High where he plans to be a sports star. But he's worried about the 7thGrade because, with forced integration, black students will be bused over the dividing line to join him. He's also worried about his dorky best friend, Eric, who wears tie-dye and let his hair grow past his collar like a dang hippie.At thirteen, TJ thinks he knows all there is to know, until the doorbell rings one day and The Real Education of TJ Crowley truly begins....",
