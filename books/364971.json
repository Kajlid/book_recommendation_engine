  "description": "Article purportedly by Jules Verne, but probably by his son. According to the editor's note at the beginning: \"In the Year 2889_ was first published in the _Forum_, February, 1889; p. 262. It was published in France the next year. Although published under the name of Jules Verne, it is now believed to be chiefly if not entirely the work of Jules' son, Michel Verne. In any event, many of the topics in the article echo Verne's ideas.\"",
