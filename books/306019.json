  "description": "Maya has been part of the group ever since the day Candace asked her if she wanted to \"do lunch\" in the cafeteria. Yet when Candace suddenly deems her unworthy, Maya's so-called friends just blow her off. While Maya just wants the girls back like they used to be, she knows that can never happen-because whatever Candace wants, Candace gets, no matter who gets hurt. Maya isn't sure exactly where things went wrong for her, but she knows she has to find out who her real friends are, and who among the girls she can trust.\"[A] suspenseful and realistic portrayal of a popular middle school clique . . . . Readers will identify with and remember these characters.\" ( Publishers Weekly , starred review)",
