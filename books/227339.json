  "description": "Hannah Malone grew up in an extremely conservative, faith-based household. Everything she wore and did was dictated for her. Though she was the perfect obedient child, inside she wanted more, with a hunger for life that had yet to be satisfied.  Daniel Shepard drank too much, smoked, slept around, swore like it’s a language all on its own, and fought whenever the feeling struck him.  Despite their vastly different lives, the two find each other and share a connection they both try to ignore. Until the day comes that they can’t fight it anymore…  Summer Nights is a forbidden love story about a girl who has never been allowed what she wants, until she makes a bold move and takes it; but with every decision, there are repercussions. Is Hannah willing to make the sacrifice? Some answers aren’t that simple; some answers have you choosing between the man you love and the family who will never allow the life you see with him.",
