  "description": "A virtuoso performance by the New York Times bestselling author of Still Alice, Lisa Genova brings her signature “gut-wrenching and memorable” (Library Journal, starred review on Inside the O’Briens) prose to this stunning novel about finding harmony amidst the most tragic of situations.Richard, an accomplished concert pianist, has already suffered many losses in his life: the acrimonious divorce from his ex-wife, Karina; the estrangement of his daughter, Grace; and now, a devastating diagnosis: ALS, a degenerative neurological disorder also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.The relentlessly progressive paralysis of ALS begins in the cruelest way possible—in his hands. As Richard becomes more and more locked inside his body and can no longer play piano or live on his own, Karina steps in as his reluctant caregiver. Paralyzed in a different way, Karina is trapped within a prison of excuses and blame, stuck in an unfulfilling life as an after-school piano teacher, afraid to pursue the path she abandoned as a young woman. As Richard’s muscles, voice, and breath fade, the two struggle to reconcile their past before it’s too late.Poignant, powerful, and with the staggering insight of Jojo Moyes’s Me Before You, Lisa Genova does for ALS “what Still Alice did for Alzheimer’s” (Huffington Post) and delivers a masterful exploration of what it means to find yourself within the most shattering of circumstances.",
