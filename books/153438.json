  "description": "In the tradition of Brotherhood of the Wolf, comes a terrifying werewolf tale in the final days of Czarist Russia.As winter looms, a wolf of unusual size and intelligence descends upon the rural nineteenth-century Russian village of Obrechen. Forgoing local livestock, the beast preys upon human victims, confounding the local constabulary and hunters, whose efforts to kill the beast meet with disaster.The village priest blames the wolf's deprivations on the presence of Galina Sekova, mistress of the Countess of Kalinin, secreted away in a cottage outside of Obrechen. Aided by a young village girl in her employ and an outcast boy orphaned by the pogroms of Kalinin, Galina seeks to unravel the wolf's secret before they become its next victims.This is the first of an incredible forthcoming duology.",
