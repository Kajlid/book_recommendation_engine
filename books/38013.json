  "title": "Broken Treaty",
  "description": "After his estranged wife took their 6-year-old son to southern Mexico to visit her family on a routine holiday trip--then suddenly announced they weren't coming back, Steve Fenton pursued an international accord called the Hague Convention Treaty to return his son. A year later, although adamantly assured by both Mexico and the U.S. State Department that his son would be returned to the U.S., Fenton saw that his only hope would be to leave diplomats to their own devices and begin quietly engineering a complex plan to locate and privately bring his son back home to California. BROKEN TREATY chronicles the surreal drama of a rescue plagued by inconceivable variables realizing success only by an odd alignment of luck. However, the elation of Fenton s long-shot plan was short lived, having triggered a frivolous manhunt, revealed moments after the single-engine Cherokee drops onto a runway in Brownsville, Texas. Overzealous FBI Special Agents become aggressive, indicating intent to return the young boy in response to fictitious allegations spawned by outrage from offended officials in Mexico City. What ensued hours after the recovery became more dramatic than the rescue itself. Mexico was intent on the return of Fenton s young son and having Fenton prosecuted. The story offers a vivid portal of how the poor decision of a mother changed forever the lives of a once ordinary family; and the struggle to pursue a normal life for a recovered child from the turbulence of international child abduction.",
