  "description": "A contaminated flu vaccine brings the zombies to life in the United States of America. José “Axe” is afraid of the zombies. Now the zombies are everywhere. A group of José’s enemies from the prison in Leavenworth, Kansas are now after him. Left for dead, now José takes on the persona of a friend to survive. His enemies think that they killed José in the funeral home, but he has other plans. José puts on a wrestling mask while he gets the courage to kill the zombies with an ax. A twist of fate leads to more trouble. Now his enemies think that they are taking John “Ax Murderer” the famous killer from Black Friday at Wal-Mart to the King’s R. V. Camp Park and their hideout. José does not know much about being in a war zone so he must now invent a new personality to fool his enemies. His new persona consists of doing the most outlandish things, singing out of tune, and saying the craziest things to try to fool his enemies. His made up persona rides a motorcycle and uses a gas powered chainsaw to eliminate the zombie threat.Inside of the camp he meets a cast of interesting characters. Stealing from homes and breaking into stores is part of his duties. A flip of the coin is all that he needs to decide whether he must help out those that are in trouble or let them fight for survival. While he hunts for supplies for the camp, he meets Mario Jr. who also has a secret. Mario Jr. is also pretending to be someone that he is not. José finally decides that it is time to go down to Mexico after helping out Mario Jr. into the safety of the government run shelter. Before José can leave the country, more problems arrive while he meets a child character Pepe “Judas Thaddaeus” whose story does not add up.",
