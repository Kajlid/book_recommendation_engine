Overall, To Chekhov's Memory is a beautiful and heartfelt tribute to one of the greatest writers of all time, and a must-read for anyone interested in Russian literature or literary criticism.\"\"Write, write as much as possible\"\"--he would say to young novelists. \"\"It does not matter if it does not come off. Later on it will come off. The chief thing is, do not waste your youth and elasticity. It's now the time for working. See, you write superbly, but your vocabulary is small. You must acquire words and turns of speech, and for this you must write every day.\"\"This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations. Because we believe this work is culturally important, we have made it available as part of our commitment for protecting, preserving, and promoting the world's literature in affordable, high quality, modern editions, that are true to their original work.",
