But now that I’m here, I’m never going back down. I will out-work, out-train, outdo every other guy on the Knights if that’s what it takes. Not even a shark attack will get in my way… but the sexy surfer chick who rescues me just might.Tawny:Losing my soulmate taught me that life is short. And I’m going to spend the rest of mine becoming one of the top surfers in the world. I refuse to be distracted by some hotshot hockey player who is my polar opposite.
