  "title": "Graciela, No One's Child",
  "description": "Graciela, No One's Child is a candid, powerful, and evocative account of the author's life beginning with her abduction to Mexico as an infant. The story vividly recounts her amazing struggles to free herself from Matilde's strong and oppressive grip and to rise above her desperate situation. Grace vividly describes the extremes she experienced from time spent with Nobel Prize laureate, Gabriela Mistral, to years of virtual slavery in the Mexican hill country of Jalapa. She brings to life harrowing, narrow escapes as she constantly pursues her quest to return to the country of her birth and find her family. The reader will be richly rewarded by the inspiration found in Grace's numerous examples of strong faith, hope, courage, and determination as she repeatedly encounters seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Until now, her life story has remained largely hidden from even her husband and children. Throughout her life she carried the burden of hiding the painful truth of her unfortunate childhood circumstances. Instead, she made excuses for fear of the effects exposure could have on her family and herself. Now, convinced by her son, husband and others about the merits of the story, she has decided to publish Graciela, No One's Child.",
