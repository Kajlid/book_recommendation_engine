But when it comes to the professor, this student is the highest of achievers. I always make the grade.WARNING: This book is HOT. Steamy. Deliciously wrong. Don't feel even a little bit guilty if it turns you on... that's the whole point, beautiful. Treat yourself to a sexy little escape. I promise not to tell.",
