  "title": "Tower Bridge",
  "description": "It's 1992, and, after three years of struggling, Stan Alton and his bandmates have hit it big with the single \"Tower Bridge.\" Although he keeps himself tightly reined in throughout this rise to success, attempting to maintain as much control over his emotions as he does his career, Stan soon encounters someone intriguing and real, a person who is not afraid of him and, as a result, has broken through to the insecure young man underneath all the guarded layers. This brief relationship changes his life more than anything he has experienced before or since. Significant events follow in close the loss of his closest friend, struggles with addiction, and the disintegration of his marriage to Anna, a woman who considers herself sensible and independent, except, regrettably, when it comes to him.",
