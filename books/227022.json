  "description": "In this revolutionary book, Kayla Buckner shares her compelling journey of struggles, hurt, addiction, surrender, redemption, intimacy, and being captured by Love.  Kayla reveals her heart through vulnerability and the real and rawness of life that we often are uncomfortable sharing. As you walk through reading Rescued Royal you will see the journey Kayla walked through and understand the reality of healing that took place in her life. The change that shifting perspective can cause is a vital piece of what Rescued Royal is about.  “I know what it feels like to have to look your past in the face and be reminded of failure and fear. I know what it feels like to believe you are nothing, worthless, and unlovable but I also know what freedom feels like and I will stop at nothing to see others set free! It is what I was created for.” Kayla says. “It is in understanding who we are, who we were created to be, and in Who we were created for that we begin to heal from past hurts and fully walk out our God given destiny.”  In her vulnerable and raw writing, Kayla takes you through a journey of beautiful and brutal honesty, revealing the heart of God and His desire for you.",
