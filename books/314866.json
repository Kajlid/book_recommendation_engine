  "description": "What do you do when you encounter the famous footballer voted “Sexiest Athlete Alive” three years running on a soccer field in Germany? If you’re Saylor Scott, you challenge him to a shoot-out. And win. Saylor’s goals have always involved the literal kind constructed from posts and netting. Her single-minded focus has cost her a lot, but it’s also earned her recognition as the top female college player in the US. She doesn’t get attached, she never gets distracted, and she could care less what anyone thinks of her. Meeting Adler Beck, the notorious player celebrated worldwide and coveted by women everywhere, challenges her indifference. But Saylor perfected the art of appearing unbothered a long time ago, and her scoring percentage is even higher off the pitch. Might as well add a gorgeous German to the tally. Because only a fool would fall for a superstar known for breaking hearts alongside records. And no one has ever accused Saylor Scott of being a fool.",
