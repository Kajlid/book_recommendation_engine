  "description": "An ex-cop protects a beautiful mystery author from a killer fan in this romantic suspense novel by the New York Times–bestselling author of Remember Me. As an heiress to a broadcasting fortune, successful mystery author Caitlin Bennett is used to people saying she bought her way into fame. But the taunts become terrifying when she starts receiving menacing letters from a deranged fan. Meanwhile, the news that a woman has been found murdered—her body lightly covered by the New York snowfall—only adds to the chill Caitlin feels in her elegant Manhattan apartment. Though she’s not thrilled by the idea, Caitlin agrees to hire her good friend’s stepbrother, ex-cop Connor “Mac” McKee, for protection. When two more women bearing a striking resemblance to Caitlin show up dead under the snow, Mac realizes the stalker is making his way to her, his final victim. Now Caitlin and Mac will have to get very close if Caitlin wants to stay alive.",
