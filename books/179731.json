  "description": "I knew he was trouble.  You’d think the words 'Playboy billionaire’ would have been my first warning, but I went and fell hard for Asher Young. He said he believed in me and my lingerie design business, but it turns out, it was all just a game to him.  I never want to see his irritatingly-handsome face again. But how am I supposed to move on when he’s still my #1 investor?  I can’t decide if I want to slap him, or kiss him senseless.  Or both.",
