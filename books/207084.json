Not only are the city streets perilous, and people donâ€™t behave at all how she expected them to, her secret house is losing its light.But as long as she keeps her magic under control, a hooded cloak should be enough to blend in. It has to be. Because the Hunter and his clockwork men are coming for her, and soon she will have nowhere left to hide.",
