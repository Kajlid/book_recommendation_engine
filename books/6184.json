  "description": "Tom Hanks introduces the \"remarkable\" (Publishers Weekly) story of two inseparable friends and soldiers portrayed in the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers. William \"Wild Bill\" Guarnere and Edward \"Babe\" Heffron were among the first paratroopers of the U.S. Army members of an elite unit of the 101st Airborne Division called Easy Company. The crack unit was called upon for every high-risk operation of the war, including D-Day, Operation Market Garden in Holland, the Battle of the Bulge, and the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest in Berchtesgaden. Both men fought side by side& until Guarnere lost his leg in the Battle of the Bulge and was sent home. Heffron went on to liberate concentration camps and take Hitler's Eagle's Nest hideout. United by their experience, they reconnected at the war's end and have been best friends ever since. Their story is a tribute to the lasting bond forged between comrades in arms and to all those who fought for freedom.",
