  "description": "Knox MontgomeryMy obsession with Emily Campbell started when she was fifteen years old. Her age made her completely off-limits to me. The fact that she was my stepsister only made it socially frowned upon.What complicates matters further is that my mother stole seventy million dollars from me, and her father was complicit in the crime. When the time comes for them to repay that debt, her father offers Emily up on a silver platter. I turned him down because I’m a lot of things but certainly not a cliché.Instead, I gave him an additional three years to get his affairs in order. He didn’t know it at the time, but that was more for me than for him.Not enough drama? Good because I’ve got another obsession.His name is Kieran O’Rourke.It started the day the Irishman introduced himself to me, although I’ve never admitted that to anyone. Certainly not him. Nor did I give in right away because that would’ve been too easy.Complications are compounded when Emily believes I betrayed her and her family by taking back what was rightfully mine, which only delays my plans. Being one of the richest men in the world, I have an endless supply of resources, a long list of things to keep me busy, and an abundance of patience.No matter what, I will introduce Emily and Kieran to one another, and when I do, life as we know it will be irrevocably changed.This is my story of obsession, betrayal, and surrender. Some might say I have my work cut out for me.Good thing I enjoy a challenge.*This is a standalone romance novel.",
