  "description": "Join New York Times bestselling author, K.N. Lee on a journey through Rune, where magic and mystery collide. Elemental. Fairy. Prisoner. I was born in a world where magic is outlawed. After the mages of my ancestors destroyed the barrier between the living and the dead, the humans were justified in their war against my people. Then, the executions began, and when my parents were taken from me, my life was fated to be forever changed. The future is a cold, bleak, wasteland and I am prepared to die. The White Tower is my home and my prison, but when the queen of the fairy nation arrives to take me away, I know I am destined for greater things. We've won the war, but the world needs us to banish the evil that haunts us all. That's where the other elementals come in. Me, three princes, one destiny that binds us as one. Fire, water, earth, and wind. Together, we can restore the balance. Their love for me is unmistakable, and I must make a choice. But, the choice isn't mine. It belongs to the creature who stole my soul.
