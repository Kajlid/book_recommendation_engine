  "description": "This e-book corresponds to Chapter 5 of the printed book entitled \"Galloping with Light - Einstein, Relativity, and Folklore\", and is the number 5 of the e-Series entitled \"Relativity free of Folklore\".Because you deserve more than just folklore, in this e-book you will find the surprising answers to the following intriguing questions:1) What's the difference between matter and radiation?2) Why does a bullet not need a propagating medium while sound and airplanes do?3) Is light a wave as sound is? Does light need a propagating medium as sound does?4) Why despite our everyday experience and intuition to the contrary, the speed of a bullet cannot be indefinitely increased?5) Is motion of a wave as relative as the motion of a bullet?6) How in the world the speed of light does not depend upon the speed of its source?The fact that the reader may not have a scientific education does not mean that s/he does not have the intelligence to understand profound concepts -- as long as they are presented with semantic and epistemological clarity. After all, Einstein said that Science is simply the refinement of our intuition and everyday experiences.",
