  "description": "What started out as just another day for Oliver Philip quickly turned stranger than any fiction he’d ever read. Arriving at Horsfall Ranch to conduct an audit on their safety program, Oliver can’t keep his eyes off owner Bayard Stoddard. A long cool drink of water if he’s ever seen one. Just when it seems Bayard might be returning his attraction -- as unprofessional as it might be right now -- the tall, powerful man receives the news his twin, Marshall, is missing.Imagine Oliver’s surprise when the abused Shire horse he finds chained up on a neighboring ranch shapeshifts into a man that looks surprisingly familiar… it seems he’s found Bayard’s missing twin.",
