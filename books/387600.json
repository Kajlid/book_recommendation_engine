  "description": "From Book 1: Praise for Stupid Fast \"A rare mix of raw honesty and hilarity. Stupid Fast is Stupid Good!\" -Peter Bognanni, author of The House of TomorrowI AM NOT STUPID FUNNY.I AM STUPID FAST.My name is Felton Reinstein, which is not a fast name. But last November, my voice finally dropped and I grew all this hair and then I got stupid fast. Fast like a donkey. Zing!Now they want me, the guy they used to call Squirrel Nut, to try out for the football team. With the jocks. But will that fix my mom? Make my brother stop dressing like a pirate? Most important, will it get me girls-especially Aleah? So I train. And I run. And I sneak off to Aleah's house in the night. But deep down I know I can't run forever. And I wonder what will happen when I finally have to stop.",
