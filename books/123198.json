  "description": "Books have power. Words carry us to unknown worlds. Books teach us about the past, help us understand the present, and give us hope for the future. What Book does this better than the Bible? The Scriptures Preserved and Translated is not a storybook. Yet in its pages you will meet great men of the past and see how they impacted the history of the English Bible. Learn to know men like Erasmus, Wycliffe, and Gutenberg. Follow William Tyndale as he heads to Germany to finish his translation of the New Testament. Listen as Miles Smith describes his and his fellow translators’ goals in making their new translation—the King James Version. Look at the many full-color illustrations of God’s Word moving from scrolls to glosses to books. Trace the timelines to gain a feel of God’s work across history. As you read, you will realize afresh that Bible translation is not an easy task. But through the ages, men have toiled tirelessly alongside of God to preserve and translate His Word. This is that story",
