We’re all holed up in this amazing house upstate and tonight I’m going to sneak into his room and finally Make. Something. Happen.So I go for it. I climb into Luke’s bed and the kissing is so much better than I imagined. Why did we wait so long to feel this? I moan his name and Bam! He jumps out of bed. WTF? It isn’t Luke. It’s his twin, Noah. I don’t even like Noah. And he certainly doesn’t like me.This will NEVER happen again... until the next day against the barn door. Why can’t I stop seeing him? It will never work. We're complete opposites. Enemies with benefits is a thing, right? But what happens when I start to want more?",
