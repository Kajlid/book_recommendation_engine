  "description": "A fairy tale with bite—vampire-style. “Don’t hold your breath waiting for Disney to film this very adult and erotic version of Beauty and the Beast .” — Winnipeg Free Press“ Will you give me your blood to drink, though you die of it? ” In an unexpected twist on a fairy tale, an artist goes into the wilderness to fulfill his father’s debt and finds himself the prisoner of a dangerously beautiful inhuman monster.“ A Terrible Beauty is modern Canadian Gothic . . . Nancy Baker shows her mastery of the form—the mysterious letter, the journey into the wilderness, the shadows that hide from the flickering firelight—and her real affection for a good ol’ fashioned vampire yarn.” — The Telegraph Journal (Saint John)“Baker’s narrative is seductive and compelling. Like Rice, she transcends the horror genre.” — Province Showcase (Vancouver)“A polished and enchanting tale . . . It is, in a word, breathtaking.” — Ottawa Citizen“Baker’s prose is lush and sensual . . . she has a real gift for making the fantastic seem plausible and investing the mundane with eerie significance.” — Toronto Sun“A very interesting and unique take on Beauty and the Beast .” —SFFP Romance",
