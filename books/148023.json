  "description": "Ruined by her now ex-husband, a sociopathic con man and predator, Catherine (Kate) has been left penniless and homeless. Her natural strength and capability shines through as she rescues herself and forges a new life with the support of two lifelong friends. Not searching for love, she meets Dominique, an enigmatic and powerful man who recognises her intelligence and ability when she saves a project of his through fast and decisive action. Invited into his world, and welcomed into his private island paradise of Alegria, she finds herself in the company of a most unusual group of people. A chance encounter sets off an unexpected chain of events, taking Catherine on a challenging and life-changing journey of personal and erotic self-discovery. This is Catherine's story of courage, exploration and transformation, her song. \"I can see every part of it. * \"Wherever Alegria is, I want to go!\"* \"The most intensely erotic and surprising feel-good read of the year. When is the next book due for release?\"* \"A great story, told with integrity, compassion, humour and honesty.\"",
