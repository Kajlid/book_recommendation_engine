  "description": "The Gavagan's Bar stories fall into the genre of barroom tall tales, though in this instance most of the tall tales turn out to be true, or at least possibly true. The authors patterned them after Lord Dunsany's \"Jorkens\" stories. The Gavagan's stories are widely considered classics.Contents:· Preface · pr · Elephas Frumenti [Gavagan’s Bar] · ss F&SF Win/Spr ’50 · The Ancestral Amethyst [Gavagan’s Bar] · ss F&SF Aug ’52 · Here, Putzi!
