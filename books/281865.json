  "description": "It’s like the start of a bad joke: a Master of Tomes, his apprentice, and ninety world-saving records get lost at sea.  Mei Li really wishes the joke wasn’t her life. For two years she’s been stranded in a remote village with no knowledge of where her master is or what’s going on in the world. What she does know is one: she refuses to be sacrificed to the “god” the villagers think live on the mountain, two: she fully plans on negotiating with said “god” (who, luckily for her, turns out to be a dragon more than happy to rescue her).  Her relief over being rescued is short lived when she learns that her master is still lost, along with the tomes detailing how to reseal and fix all the upcoming problems for the next decade. And at least four world disasters are due to be prevented in the next two months. To make matters worse, the Tomes Masters are the only people in the world who carry the knowledge of how to reseal the pesky problems like five-thousand-year-old sleeping demons and disintegrating harbor walls.  With her master gone, everyone is looking to Mei Li for answers she doesn’t have, but still has to procure. Her options are to solve the disasters—with high potential for the world ending—or somehow find Master and the missing tomes.  Right now, Mei Li wants to go back in time and punch her six-year-old self for being an idiot. Being able to read books all day is not worth the stress of dealing with ancient, evil things on a regular basis.",
