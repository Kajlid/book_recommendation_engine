  "description": "No little girl could have been safer. Emily Christie grew up surrounded by relatives whose job it was to protect her. Her father was a hard-working policeman, her grandad was a respected paramedic; they were the perfect family. Or so it seemed. Evil lurked beneath the surface. When she was just five years old, Emily’s beloved grandad started grooming her, calling her his ‘special little girl’. In the years that followed she was subjected to countless unforgivable acts of sexual abuse at his hands, that escalated in severity and threatened to tear her life apart. Knowing her grandad was considered to be a pillar of the community, Emily was too scared to tell the truth. But one day she found the courage to stop the abuse and the strength to start rebuilding her life. No Safe Place is the inspirational story of a little girl’s journey from helpless victim to triumphant survivor.",
