  "title": "Yakov and the Seven Thieves",
  "description": "This book was inspired by the Baal Shem Tov, a great teacher who lived in the Ukraine in the 18th century. It is a story about how all of us have the ability to unlock the gates of heaven--no matter how unworthy we think we are. For when we go against out selfish natures, we make miracles happen, in our lives and in the lives of others. We must never forget that hidden behind a large amount of darkness is a large amount of light. --Madonna",
