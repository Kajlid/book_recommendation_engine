  "description": "The hardest part of being ringmistress? Juggling my feelings for three men.  Connor, my stubborn protector always battling his demons. Hunter, the dashing wolf shifter who sends my heart into overdrive. And Razvan, the dragon I wish I could stop thinking about. What was supposed to be a fun, lighthearted date turns into a shocking discovery about myself. I wasn’t ready for this, and I’m not sure I’m up for the responsibility this discovery brings me. I’m so consumed by the shifter visions in my head, I don’t realize how much Connor is hurting. He’s walking down a dark path and this time, I’m not sure if even I can save him. Step right up and take a front row seat to my heart breaking. Smoke and Mirrors is the third volume in the Harem of Freaks series, which should be read in order.",
