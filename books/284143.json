  "description": "Over the years, readers of Golf magazine have come to know and love Major General (Ret.) Sir Richard Gussett, the raucous imaginary uncle featured in David Feherty's column \"Sidespin.\" In this first volume of his misadventures, Gussett sets his sights on the most prestigious prize in golf, the petrified middle finger of St. Andrew, patron saint of Scotland. Presiding over the world's most cantankerous golf club, Gussett must motivate his members through battles with incontinence, single malt Scotch, and a litany of other unmentionable afflictions in a \"friendly\" competition with their ancient rivals, the notorious McGregor clan. Anyone who loves the game or knows someone who does will be unable to resist Feherty's hilarious storytelling and golfing gravitas.",
