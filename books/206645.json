Before he can devise a plan to escape, a motley crew bursts into the cell, and he is rescued by a fiery hellion who is as beautiful as she is fierce . . .They call her Stormâ€”an avenging angel to the wrongly imprisoned, an outlaw wanted by the Scottish government. Everything and everyone she'd ever loved has been taken from her, and now she's determined to never let that happen again. She does not have time for tenderness or love . . . until she meets Burke. Rugged and courageous, his kisses promise nights of fevered passion, while his eyes challenge her to dream of a future together. Dare she let this man storm past her defenses and convince her to trust her heart again?",
