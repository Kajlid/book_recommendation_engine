  "title": "Phase 4",
  "description": "Pampered, spoiled, self-centered, Greg Marlowe swaggered out of the Pleasure Dome one evening in late September only to find himself suddenly propelled into what he took to be an alternate reality.  With his self-confidence beginning to dwindle, he became repeatedly visited by robotic-like beings who seemed determined to subject him to pain â€“ both physical and emotional.  Could he ever find his way back to the world he had always known, or was he destined to remain locked in a literal battle of minds against a force that no human being had ever encountered before?",
