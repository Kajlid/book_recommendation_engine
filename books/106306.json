  "description": "Middle Grade FantasyFor centuries, children have been disappearing. Ten year old Abigail wonders about the poem that has to do with a creepy, ancient tree. Granted, birds or squirrels are never seen near the tree, the tree never grows leaves, and nothing grows around the base of the tree, but are the protruding knobs really the heads of children that the tree has devoured? Abigail has never fit in at school and if she proves how brave she is by tying a ribbon on the tree, surely she'll gain respect from her classmates. But what Abigail doesn't know is that the tree has been waiting for HER.",
