  "description": "Stella and Moonface, a dynamic duo, take a closer look at Stella's less than elegant bodily functions. While Moonface forever questions, Stella faces the fact that however embarrassing or loathsome a moment may be, there are always more embarrassing and loathsome moments to be had. So why dwell? Stella and Moonface is an illustrated work intended for adults learning, questioning and reexamining topics deserving of a second opinion.",
