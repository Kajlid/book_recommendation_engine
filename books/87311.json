  "title": "Eroscapes: Erotic Fiction from the Mind of TammyJo Eckhart",
  "description": "Erotic Fiction from the Mind of TammyJo Eckhart is a clever collection of eight short erotic BDSM stories that incorporate the author's firm yet loving dominant point of view. Based around tales of submissive men and dominant women TammyJo skillfully weaves fantasies that takes the reader back to by-gone eras then compels us forward into richly imagined futures. Among the stories are tales of a genie whose new mistress must re-program him to enjoy the pleasures of pain, a pair of sexual outlaws who are fleeing a society that won't tolerate their coupling, a fantasy world in which men happily serve the women who rule the land, and a tale of blood lust that seems never to be quenched. Through out them all TammyJo exhibits an understanding of those who are drawn to BDSM relationships but are fearful to take that final step. She beautifully imagines different ways of helping the submissive make the last step through that threshold and then takes them on journeys they won't soon forget.",
