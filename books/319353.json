  "title": "Let us Lie Down For The Night",
  "description": "A memoir of adolescence, this coming-of-age book takes you on the journey of a young woman, where she grapples with a range of emotions from romanticism to existentialism, identity, dissociation, and everything in between. As a reader, you are momentarily held within the clutching intensity of the poems as you feel her sentiments through the writings; their impression lingers long after.",
