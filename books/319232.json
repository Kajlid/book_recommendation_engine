I can’t stay away.Nothing can keep me from claiming the new waitress at the diner.Except for her other mate, the scent match I didn't know existed.He's a stranger to me and our pack, but now we must work together.Two mates for our female.Our mate is human, untouched. She doesn't know about our kind.We must convince her to accept not one, but two mates.Two cowboys in her bed. Two dominant wolves to protect her.And my scent match's wolf is turning feral with need.We touch our mate. We can’t get enough.We need to claim her and mark her as ours before his wolf goes mad.She’s a virgin, so we have to be careful--shifters can be rough.And we're not the only ones who want her--she's being hunted by another male.But I will protect her if it’s the last thing I do.Even if it means keeping her from her other mate.",
