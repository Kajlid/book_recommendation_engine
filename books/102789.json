  "description": "The Naked Way is the debut novel from author Chris Henry, available now from Blues Power Books and Amazon Kindle Direct.The Naked Way is a dark, visionary story of love and loss in a Generation X world of sex, drugs and rock and roll. It follows a group of bright, talented, damaged young people from different backgrounds as they come of age in the underground rock music scene of the early 1990s. The Naked Way breathes new life into classic themes of youth rebellion and counter-culture for the next generation of readers. The story is driven by a cast of unforgettably vivid characters with big dreams. The Naked Way is full of sex and passion, but also deals with other intense issues: addiction, abusive relationships, rape, repressed memories, war, protest and suicide. From the backstreet underworld of a decaying American city to the mystical cathedrals of Italy, The Naked Way takes readers on an exhilarating journey of sensuality and emotion, creation and destruction, pain and redemption.",
