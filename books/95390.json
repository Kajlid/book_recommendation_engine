Will has to ask Lawrence for a lift to the vets, and endure the man's scolding all the way there. Even worse, Will discovers Lawrence is a dog trainer!Bob ends up in a cast and is forced to wear the cone of shame. Of course, Lawrence thinks all Bob and Will need are dog training classes, except Bob hasn't met a trainer yet he couldn't break. Is Lawrence man enough for the job?",
