  "description": "Only the strong will survive when civilization collapses.  The nearest star in the solar system went supernova four years ago. When the resultant EMP strikes Earth, the world is sent back to the Stone Age. Yet it soon grows evident there are worse things hidden in the dark matter hurricane. Unbearable headaches strike without warning. Human aggression goes off the charts. Small disagreements become bloodbaths.  Josh Standing took an oath to serve and protect those of their North Carolina community. That didn’t change when he left the police force to become a probation officer. If only his wife understood his drive to rescue tomorrow’s troubled youth. But Maxine’s greatest concern is to ensure their son survives the cancer that has ravaged his body. As their marriage circles the drain, she takes the once promising athlete to face the final pronouncement of the Boston specialists—alone.  But the fractured family has never needed each other more.  In the immediate aftermath of the EMP chaos, the separated Standings decide to make their way toward the family farm in Iowa. However, getting to Maxine’s prepper parents is no small task in a world that’s swiftly turning into kill or be killed.  And when events threaten to separate them further, Josh is faced with an unthinkable choice in this thrilling post-apocalyptic series.",
