  "description": "This Christmas, holiday getaway has an entirely new meaning...Take Eloise. First she's kidnapped by Santa, and now she's camping out in an abandoned lighthouse with the most infuriatingly intoxicating cop she's ever met. Is she sleeping with the enemy…or the man destined to make her Mrs. Claus in Anne Stuart's \"Claus and Effect.\"Meanwhile Jean is abducted to a remote ranch, stuck teaching a handsome Texas Ranger how to enjoy a little sensual Christmas cheer in Tina Leonard's \"Caught at Christmas.\" And Molly? Her nuptials are shot up and her fiancé's a no-show, but when she arrives at a supposedly private Australian hideaway to recoup, she's not alone… and the heat is enough to melt the mere memory of a white Christmas in Marion Lennox's \"Candy Canes and Crossfire.\"Three women, connected by friendship and fate, are taking cover…with men sexy enough to unwrap!",
