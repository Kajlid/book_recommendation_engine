  "description": "From the international best selling author of 'Spoilt' …...It may be a bit of a cliché to say that all firemen are hot, but Captain Jared Montgomery is in an intensely smoldering class of his own, which makes him somewhat explosive to handle.When he first met Charlotte at the vet's where she worked, he immediately judged her to be breathtakingly beautiful, flirtatious, superficial and shallow. He didn't like her but he couldn't get her out of his mind. She thought he was aggressive and rude, but she couldn't get him out of her mind either.Then mutual friends and family forced them together at a wedding and suddenly they had a runaway fire going between them nobody was going to put out until the day Jared discovered Charlotte locking lips with Dr Shaw, the local vet and her boss.She, of course, said it wasn't like that at all, but she would, wouldn't she?And it might all have ended there if Charlotte hadn't nearly died in a fire and if Jared hadn't been the one to save her …..If you like your Romance as straight as your firemen, this is the one for you.",
