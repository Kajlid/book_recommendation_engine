  "title": "In Papua New Guinea",
  "description": "Christina Dodwell, a young British explorer, sets out for unexplored jungles of New Guinea with little preparation --no map, no plan, no knowledge of the language or customs. This insouciant attitude often lands her in trouble.She forgets her jungle boots (not for the last time) and has to hike barefoot through knee-deep mud, thorns and leeches. The charm of this attitude is that it allows her to experience her adventures with childlike freshness, a naive imperturbability which she shares with the Stone Age people she finds along the way.",
