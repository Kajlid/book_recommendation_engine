  "title": "Suppression, Deception, Snobbery, and Bias: Why the Press Gets So Much Wrongâ€”And Just Doesn't Care",
  "description": "Media consultant and former Bush Administration Press Secretary Ari Fleischer accuses American journalism of becoming the domain of the woke young urban elite--a class which has no respect or tolerance for dissenting views.According to Ari Fleischer, there is a new elite in America--the Journalist Class. Today's mainstream media is dominated by younger, urban college grads who write stories for younger, urban college grads. These journalists haven't just slanted the media. They've pulled the whole Democrat party over to their own worldview, he contends.This is the true source of anger in the country and the growing sense that media elites look down on everyone else. Because they do. If you're older or not urban or not a college grad, the Journalist Class doesn't think you're worth impressing. But there's a problem for progressives--the Journalist Class's point of view does not persuade enough people to win elections. Before 2016, they tried to appeal to those citizens living in what they call \"flyover country,\" but after 2016 they began writing only for each other.The way this narrow worldview has constricted news and cultural language is intellectually impoverishing for a country as diverse and varied as the United States. In Snobs and Deceivers Fleischer argues that the new media elite is shutting down the very conversations which we must have to bring the country back together.",
