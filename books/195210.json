  "description": "(This is an alternate cover edition of ASIN B017UUVEOS.) Is it wrong to be this Ravenous?When Jennifer Finn was good, she was very very good, and when she was bad…she got arrested for assault and indecent exposure. Now Jen’s back in school and determined to find her balance. But one man seems just as determined to destroy her equilibrium, and he knows all the right buttons to push.What began as a favor for an old friend became something more the instant Trick Dunham laid eyes on Jen. Now he can’t resist inserting himself into her life, despite warnings from her family. Little Finn might be struggling to find her path but Trick knows exactly where she belongs. What she needs. He just has to get her and their third to agree.Professor Declan Kelley has a weakness for his old lover, Trick. The bad boy ex-con has become a wickedly sensual man who comes whenever he pleases, but never stays. When he shows up again it’s to offer Declan one of his darkest desires to date—Jennifer Finn and Trick together on a three-way platter. But that would threaten the safe, uncomplicated life he’s built for himself, and Declan’s not doing that for anything.Unless it’s forever…Warning:  This book is a Jenga tower of sin. Explicit, graphic, shocking, teetering-on-the-edge-of-unbalanced, unapologetic sin. M/m, m/f, f watching m/m together and liking it so much that m grabs f and makes her a part of the dirtiest m/m/f ménage in history. That’s right, I said it. Role play—the hot-for-teacher kind, the sexy-thief-in-the-night kind AND…well sometimes you just have to ignore the warnings and dive right in.",
