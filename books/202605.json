  "description": "Welcome to one of the most disturbing minds of Japanese manga! Hideshi Hino has long been considered a master of the horror manga genre since his coming out in the late '70s. And the four stories in Lullabies From Hell will show you how demented the man can be. The self-titled first tome introduces you to the author himself, a horror quasi-biography of sorts. The second story tells of Hino's having willed his pregnant wife into birthing a horrible, planet-devastating reptile baby that eats puppies and children! And you can imagine how the stories progress from there.",
