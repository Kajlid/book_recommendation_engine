  "description": "Life is Perfect is a coming-of-age novel revolving around a young woman, Mitali Jaitia, who appears to have it all – youth, intelligence, money, even beauty. But things aren't as perfect as they seem. Jaitia House, nestled in the lush, green avenues of Lutyens’ Delhi, is in gloom over the tragic death of a young girl. As Mitali struggles to come to terms with her loss, the break-up of her parents’ marriage and her father’s many betrayals place her within a cycle of sin and redemption that the Jaitia family is crippled by. Poised on the threshold of adulthood, Mitali tries to find depth and meaning in the world around her. The fissures in her family lead her to question everything – love, friendship, faith, joy – and a neat solution seems impossible. But Mitali is determined to find her way through the chaos. Life is Perfect is the story of a journey described in simple, evocative prose. Peopled with a cast of unforgettable characters and winding through colleges, cafes, parties and family dinners with great wit and sensitivity, it is a stunning portrait of modern life in Delhi today.",
