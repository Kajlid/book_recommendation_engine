  "title": "Gipsy Moth Circles the World",
  "description": "This work tells the story of Frances Chichester, who aged 65, set out alone from Plymouth in his 53-foot ketch \"Gypsy Moth VI\" in August 1966 and sailed eastward around the world through the wild Southern Ocean, stopping only once - the first to accomplish this - in Sydney. Only nine yachts had previously circumnavigated by way of Cape Horn, and of them six had been capsized or somersaulted at least once. This 28,000-mile voyage, completed in May 1967, established new records for speed and endurance, captured the imagination of the world, and earned a knighthood for Chichester upon his return.",
