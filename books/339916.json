At the heart of these controversies is Jesus. With a unique perspective only Sylvia Browne could bring, The Mystical Life of Jesus is filled with the details of Jesus’ inspiring life.  Including his birth, childhood, travels, ministry, miracles, crucifixion, death, and resurrection, she addresses all of the major controversies: • Was there a virgin birth? • Was there a Star of Bethlehem?  • What did he do for the first thirty years of his life?  • Was he married?  • Was he divine?  • Was it a miracle at Cana (and who was getting married)?  • Is there a Jesus lineage?   Using her unique relationship with her spirit guide and her years studying the controversial Gnostic texts, Sylvia answers all of these questions with a confidence and authority only someone who has visited the afterlife can have.",
