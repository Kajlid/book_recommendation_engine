  "description": "Princess Lizzie and the Time Travelling Magic Cloak continues the series starring the clever, courageous royal who finds herself in some very puzzling situations. This time, her friend Sir Hippo is in big trouble, and Princess Lizzie must time travel in order to help him. There’s only one problem: time travel is forbidden by the Royal court! Will Princess Lizzie defy the kingdom to lend Sir Hippo a hand? With her chatty assistant, Monkey, and sensible friend Giraffe, they figure out what it takes to help a friend in need. Along the way, they meet some new and interesting characters—are they friends or foes? “There are a lot of important lessons in Dr. Van’s books, which build on each other in their complexity and age appropriateness. [Book 3] is a uniquely educational series that definitely steps outside the box. It is an unapologetic juxtaposition of advanced concepts and language delivered in a package for children, which may be a refreshing change…” --Foreword Clarion Review",
