  "title": "Gabby and Gator",
  "description": "Gator has just never seemed to fit in with the other neighborhood pets...probably because he has a nasty habit of eating the other neighborhood pets. Flushed down the toilet as just a little snapper, Gator spends his days alone in the sewers... On the streets above, little Gabby has never seemed to fit in with the other kids in town. She'd rather collect bottles and practice her tuba than gossip with the girls down at the pool, but it does get lonely being the only vegetarian on the block... When Gabby and Gator meet, their fun and adventures prove that the best friends are those who accept you as you are, teeth and all!",
