  "title": "Behind Time: The Facts In The Fiction Of Watch City: Waltham Watch",
  "description": "This book was written to share some of the historic references as pertains to my novel, “Watch Waltham Watch.” It is by no means meant to be a detailed history tome, or a comprehensive collection of all the research I dedicated myself to when creating my imaginary world. I wrote it in the hopes that sharing it would arouse curiosity into further historic investigation, and to express my absolute delight in learning for myself.",
