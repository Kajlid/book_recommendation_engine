  "title": "Secrets Never Lie: The Death of Sara Tokars--A Southern Tragedy of Money, Murder, and Innocence Betrayed",
  "description": "She Was The Perfect Wife and MotherPretty, blonde former cheerleader Sara Tokars seemed to have it all: six sisters who considered her the center of their loving family; a home in an affluent Atlanta suburb; an ambitious husband who was a lawyer and part-time judge and well-connected politically; two beautiful sons who adored her.She Wouldn't Be the Perfect VictimBut Sara's life was built on an illusion. For Fred Tokars was an adulterer and a neglectful father whose real business was turning illegal drug fortunes into-all American dollars using star-studded Atlanta nightclubs and off-shore accounts. No one but Sara knew the ugly truth. But before she could expose him, Fred had Sara gruesomely murdered. Fred thought it would be the prefect crime. But Sara had taken precautions. She'd already made sure all of Fred's secrets would follow him like an avenging angel.Secrets Never Lie is the story of one woman's struggle to escape her husbands malice; of her sisters' persistent cries for justice; of a city's well-hidden but no less seamy underbelly; of a lawyer whose lifetime of lies and cruelty finally catch up to him. Stretching from that fateful day Sara first came under Fred Tokars' spell to the titanic courtroom battle among the legal giants of the South over whether justice would be served and whether Fred would live or be condemned to die, Secrets Never Lie is the heart-stopping true story of the case that kept Atlanta riveted for years and that will keep every reader mesmerized until the last page turns.",
