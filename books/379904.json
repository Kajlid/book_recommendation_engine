  "description": "She's changed her style, but her roots are showing...It's not just that Brooklyn bar owner Billy Nolan is wickedly handsome; it's also that any woman he dates and dumps--and he dumps them all--immediately goes on to marry the next person she meets. But Kate Jameson is immune to his charms. She left Brooklyn for upward mobility in Manhattan at the first chance she got. Now working as a psychologist at a swanky private school, she's not about to fall for some cad from the old neighborhood.Then Kate's best friend Bina's engagement is broken off, and a plan is born. All Kate has to do is get Billy to date and dump Bina...and then wait for Bina's wayward fianc√© to come back to his bride. With a little help from friends Barbie, Bev, and Bunny--who, along with Bina and Kate dub themselves the \"Bitches of Bushwick\"--nothing could be simpler.There are just a couple of hitches. Kate hasn't counted on how Billy feels about the whole scheme--and how she begins to feel about Billy.",
