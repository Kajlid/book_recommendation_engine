  "description": "My name is Peyton, and I have a charmed life. I live in a beautiful mansion on top of a hill and want for nothing. My father’s successful, and my mother’s devoted to seeing me and my siblings succeed… Oh, wait…that’s not my life at all. That’s my half-sister’s life.  Until recently, I had no family, aside from my mom and dad. My life consisted of secrets, escape, two best friends, and most importantly, dance. But when my mom drops a bombshell on me, that we’re moving to her hometown hours away, all the secrets come out, including the fact that the man who I’ve called dad my whole life, is really my uncle.  So now it’s a new school, new life, new town. And let me tell you, this town hates me. My life has never been a bed of roses, to begin with, but being here? It’s hell. My best friends are far away, my dance career is on hold, and the family drama is movie-worthy. The only thing that’s worth getting up for in the morning is my new friends, a group of guys who have made it their mission to put me under their wing. They bring me into their circle, determined to protect me and help me on my new path.  But sometimes, we get in our own way. Sometimes, you can’t walk alone. Sometimes, the only way to live your life is to lean on the ones who love you.  ***Peyton’s Path is a Contemporary Reverse Harem.
