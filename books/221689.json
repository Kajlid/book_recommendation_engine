  "description": "Before Joe Sacco crafted his two major works of 'cartoon journalism', \"Palestine\" and \"Safe Area Gorazde\", he created a number of shorter pieces, ranging from one-page gags to thirty-page 'graphic novelettes'. This book finally collects the entirety of Sacco's earlier journalistic and autobiographical work, plus a sizeable serving of his satirical strips, many of them never before collected in book form. The centrepieces in \"Notes from a Defeatist\" are a triptych of war \"When Good Bombs Happen to Bad People\", a history of aerial bombing that specifically targets civilian populations; \"More Women, More Children, More Quickly\", in which Sacco relates his mother's harrowing experiences during World War II in Malta; and, most personally (and closest to Sacco's later work), \"How I Loved the War\", Sacco's impassioned but sardonic reflection on the GulfWar, the surrounding propaganda and media circus, and his own ambivalent feelings as both a spectator and commentator. \"Notes from a Defeatist\" also includes a roadie's-eye view of an American punk band's eventful European tour, a reminiscence of an awful season spent in his native Malta, and much more.",
