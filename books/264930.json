  "description": "In the near future, humanity has used technology to unravel almost all of life's mysteries. The only boundary we have left is the that of death. When Anne Westfeld is shot in the streets of New Chicago, her loved ones experience that boundary of death first hand. Then something strange happens. Six months later, Anne returns from the grave. She walks right back into her life, just like she was before. Now Anne's closest friends must work together to figure out exactly how she came back, and if she's really the same person they lost. The reality of the situation is deeper than they know, and will take all of them to their physical and emotional limits.",
