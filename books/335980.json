  "title": "Broadway Butchery",
  "description": "The Cold Case Squad of the NYPD is overworked, understaffed, but receiving great press due to star detective, Everett Larkin. His uncanny memory and Holmesian-like skills of deduction have already led to the capture of one serial killer. Now he’s identified a second predator and brought an end to their twenty-plus year reign of terror. Routine construction at a Broadway souvenir shop leads to the discovery of a mummified woman in the wall. And when Larkin receives a mysterious VHS tape that same night, he knows it’s no coincidence. Expecting a Victorian mourning artifact in this new mystery, Larkin wastes no time turning to former historian and current boyfriend, Ira Doyle of the Forensic Artists Unit for help. A web of nameless victims, countless suspects, and endless lies drag Larkin and Doyle deep into the gritty past of Times Square, reopening painful wounds and testing the fortitude of their relationship. And all the while, someone is watching, biding their time until they can make Everett Larkin nothing… but a memory.",
