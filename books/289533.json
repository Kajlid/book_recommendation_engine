  "description": "Bobcat is good at managing the workin’ girls in Chattanooga. When the Birmingham chapter is decimated during battle, they put out a call for help, and Bobcat is sent to manage their strip club. It turns out, the dancers are divas and the waitresses are angry, and managing a titty bar is nothing like managing the RTMC Motor Hotel back home.Tess McKnight is a highly-successful, tough-as-nails criminal attorney. She doesn’t have time for fools or idiots, but the RTMC is one of her biggest legal clients, so she has to spend time with the new manager of Blaze to make sure he doesn’t screw everything up. She’s a mongoose and he’s a cat. These kinds of sparks aren’t supposed to fly between them.",
