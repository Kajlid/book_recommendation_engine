All of the shifter males, including Rushe, have been banned from laying even a single paw on the human female. This is difficult for Ruche considering his wolf has decided that she is it's mate. To make matters worse, it is something akin to torture when he is put on her security detail, having to shadow her every move. Every sashay of her feminine hips, every bounce and sway of her very lush curves. So drool worthy he might just have to howl to the moon before the week is out.  After one failed relationship after another, Becky has decided to have a little fun. Since vampires are out...one big, bad wolf might be just what she needs. Once Rushe catches her eye, she struggles to get him out of her mind, especially since he has told her in teeny-tiny, extra-dirty-detail exactly what he would like to do to her. Forbidden from pursuing that avenue of fun…she just might have to break the rules and take things into her own hands in order to get what she needs.  'His First' is Part 1 of a 3 part serial and is around 20,000 words/80 pages The story contains strong sexual themes/language and is not intended for readers under the age of 18.",
