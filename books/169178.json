  "description": "Fairy tales don't always have happy endings. The hero doesn't always get his girl. True love's kiss doesn't always wake the sleeping princess. Finding the rabbit hole you fell through seems impossible when you've given up all hope of returning to the reality you once knew.The first time Jack Martin laid eyes on Cassidy Taylor, his world stopped turning. Having saved her from a near-football accident on her first day in a new school, she looked at him like he was her knight in shining armor.She was everything he never knew he was looking for: beautiful, smart, funny, ambitious, and just a little bit impulsive. He fell for her fast, loving everything about her, including her flaws.Cassie wasn't perfect. She knew that and accepted it. Her past was colorful, but Jack loved her regardless of her struggles. And she loved him even more for his complete acceptance of everything she was.Their relationship bloomed, but it wasn't without its problems. Together, they worked through whatever life threw their way, making whatever compromises and sacrifices they had to and embracing the moments they shared.Until it all became too much.Even though it seems impossible at times, Jack does whatever he can to put the pieces of his shattered life back together. Truths are revealed, opening old wounds that took years to heal, and making it difficult for him to understand the situation entirely.When his entire world comes crashing down around him, will Jack continue to fight for something that's been lost to him for years, or will the love he has for his only child help him accept the truth?",
