While Lucas investigates reported miracles, his young wife Angela dreams of escaping to a place where schools and theatres are still open, and women are free to work outside the home. A bundle of secret letters from a poet involved in the revolution that ruined England, a visit to a desperate woman, a misguided challenge to the Head of Security at the Ministryâ€¦ A series of minor catastrophes of their own making mean Lucas and Angela have no choice but to try to flee the chaos of London, with disastrous results. The Miracle Inspector will break your heart. You will catch yourself thinking about the characters long after you have finished reading the last page.",
