  "description": "The final volume of Bill Wright's journal, from the Bestselling series 'Surviving The Evacuation', (78,000 words) Billions died. Civilisation collapsed. Zombies rule the Earth. But there is safety, so Bill and Kim are told, in a small village on the Irish coast. If they can just cross hundreds of miles of undead wasteland, to a rendezvous on a Welsh beach, there is a boat willing to take them there. But first they must travel back into London to rescue Annette and Daisy. If they can find and rescue the children, and get them somewhere safe, even then Bill’s journey will not be over. It can’t be, not until he’s confronted his past and chosen between his old family and his new one. Please Note: This final volume of Bill's journey features characters who first appeared in the short story Zombies vs The Living Dead.",
