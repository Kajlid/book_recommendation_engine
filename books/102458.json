  "description": "There’s something a little off about Landan’s parents. He noticed it almost immediately after his mom and dad returned home from a night out to celebrate their anniversary. Not only did they look different somehow, but they were also acting very strange. All of a sudden, they both quit their jobs. They started sleeping during the day and only going out at night. Landan has his suspicions that something unthinkable and even unbelievable has happened to them. Even though life is anything but normal at home, Landan’s parents try their best to go on as if nothing has changed. What happens to a boy and his little sister who believe their parents have been turned into vampires? How do two people balance the love they feel for their children, their desire to retain their humanity, and their thirst for blood?(Available in paperback, as well as digital format on Nook and Kindle)",
