  "description": "“Baby, come to me.”We are together; his voice intoxicates me, it’s as potent as whiskey. I hold on tightly, but he still departs; leaving me behind. I am Dorothy Kennedy-Denham, heir to Kennedy Electronics. I’ve outlived friends, my children and my love, Nicky. This small house evaporates, and I return to where it began. The lure to remain is powerful, but I have unfinished business.My family calls this an absence of presence. Their concern begins the process, and they descend on me, it’s decided I should move into a nursing home. Packing my life into boxes, it’s not long before my home is bare. Forgotten photos open the door to a past they never imagined. I won’t apologize; not about the burlesque club or the mobsters I’ve known and loved. They might think my life is unimaginable; my connection with Nicky is unbelievable. But, in the end, I hope they find it inspirational.",
