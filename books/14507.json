  "description": "Sierra Kastian has been raised by her mother in Silver Dust, Nevada. She was told from birth that she has no other living relatives. Her childhood memories consist of hours spent in casino lobbies, while her mother invested every dime she had into psychic gambling. Though her mother's talents often supplied her the jackpots she sought, she'd always put the majority of the money right back into the machines. While Sierra doesn't hesitate to confirm her mother's magical feats, she's always kept her own abilities to herself.She longs for a normal life, without the confusion her extra-sensory powers cause. Today, on the verge of turning thirty and co-owning a coffee shop with her best friend, a hot stranger walks into the cafe and hands her an envelope that will change her life forever. In it, there is a letter from an estranged woman claiming to be her dying aunt and a tarot card entitled, The Fool.
