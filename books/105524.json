  "description": "Ganth, the Minotaur Empire, stretching across the continent of Ice Wall within the realm of Algoron, is a place where Honor is the foremost trait among its citizens. Here strength defines law; a law that has left Pah'min in disgrace. His life in Ganth forfeit, his childhood love denied; he is snubbed by all. But there is one House that will accept him. The secret house is despised as an honor-lacking abode of spies. It is from this dark place that Pah'min must begin the long and painful trek to restore his honor. He must begin again in the land of his enemies, and feign loyalty to a king he loathes. There will be many foes on all sides, but his greatest battles are within as the gods themselves try to sway him toward their own mysterious end. Ultimately, he must escape, sacrificing those he holds dear, all to pay the price...The Price of Honor.",
