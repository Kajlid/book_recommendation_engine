Terrified and alone, she fights for survival as each step takes her further away from everything she has ever known. For nearly a decade Jessica calls the mountain home until tragedy strikes once again. Forced to reenter a world that is controlled by men, Jessica transforms into Jesse for her own protection. Posing as a man, she ventures off the mountain for the first time in years, and soon finds herself at the mercy of emotions beyond her control when she attracts the attention of a local singer. Will Jesse be able to maintain the ruse she has created or will she let down her guard and confess her true identity to an unlikely new love? And, what happens when she comes face to face with the demons from her past? Will she get the justice she desires?",
