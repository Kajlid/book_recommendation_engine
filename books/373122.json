  "description": "Representing a path-breaking effort to look at multinational corporations in the round, this book emphasizes their scope, history and development, cultural and social implications, and governance problems. Starting with a primer on MNCs, eight chapters are devoted to a variety of aspects, including global elites. Their approach makes readers recognize that MNCs are not merely economic entities, but are part of a complex interplay of factors. In turn, studying MNCs will lead to reexamination of the globalization process.",
