  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Dean Keyes has found an interesting companion in his best friend Iris G. Fowler. Iris is an abstract thinker who sees the world through a different lens. What she wants most in life is to “find what there is to find,” an enigmatic idea that Dean cannot understand. When Iris suddenly dies, Dean feels that it is his responsibility to undertake what she wanted most, and sets off on a journey to discover his friend’s “dying wish.” Plagued by guilt and remorse at Iris’ passing, Dean soon finds himself in a forgotten town called Edengrove. There he meets a cast of characters who help him to unravel the mistakes of his past and overcome the tragedy of losing a friend. My Dying Wish is a story of friendship, love and the choices that can change one’s entire world in an instant. On his journey, Dean searches for the answer to a question that affects us all: in a world full of sadness, can there be hope for a brighter tomorrow?",
