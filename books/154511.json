  "description": "Ghastly Graham Ingels meets Jim Steranko! Get ready for a mind-bending walk on the weird side with the very best of Tom Sutton's 1970s horror tales for Charlton Comics! Sutton was at his most expressionistic and experimental with the scores of stories he drew for Charlton's \"ghost\" line, whose titles said it all: Creepy Things, Ghostly Tales, The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves, and more. Showcased in Tom Sutton's Creepy Things are a full frightful sixteen of Sutton's spooky stories. Unpublished art and more than a dozen of his creepy-crawly covers and many comic pages are faithfully reproduced from rare original artwork! Edited by Michael Ambrose, editor of the insightful Charlton Spotlight magazine, who provides a fascinating behind-the-scenes introduction profusely illustrated with rare art and photos. Dementedly designed by Donnie \"Lum and Abner\" Pitchford. Tom Sutton (1937-2002) wrote and drew for almost every comics publisher in his long career, but is best known for his work in Warren magazines (Vampirella, Creepy, Eerie), Marvel Comics (Dr. Strange, Ghost Rider, Planet of the Apes), DC Comics (Star Trek), and First Comics (Grimjack, Squalor). Tom Sutton's Creepy Things collects the best of Sutton's brilliant Charlton horror stories for the first time anywhere!",
