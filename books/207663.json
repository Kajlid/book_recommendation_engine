This is the backdrop for the haunting The Island of Dr. Moreau. In this novel, Wells's dark vision serves as a reminder of the horrors that reckless experimentation with nature can produce.The Invisible Man is a dazzling display of imagination and psychological insight. It is the classic tale of a young scientist who, by experimenting on himself, becomes both invisible and criminally insane. Considered by many to be Wells's masterwork, the novel powerfully depicts the horror of a man trapped within a terror of his own creation.War of the Worlds is a compelling and horrifying novel that describes the invasion of Earth by Martians. Using fiery rays and crushing strength, these heartless aliens have the capacity to conquer the world. Will they succeed? Is this the end of mankind?",
