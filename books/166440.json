  "description": "A compendium of pictures and verses form the sinews of this book. Pictures speak and words portray what comes out of the delicate balance between fantasy and reality. No emotion finds partiality in this collection, every emotion gets its own chance in its brilliant intensity. If you are in love with a single or mild emotion, this book might not be for you.",
