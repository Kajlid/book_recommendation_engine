  "description": "Can a trail of tears be the ticket out of a cruelty-filled world?  What if every tear you cried was the key to your salvation?  Can a vial of tears be the beginning of freedom?  What if every tear you shed could someday set you free?  Tangi was born with a handicap that gave her a limp, brought her pain, and left her feeling like an outsider around everyone except her father. Papa has always loved her for who she is and tried to make her see that she was born special—because she was.  On the morning of his death, Papa gives Tangi three bottles in exchange for her promise to cherish them, but before Tangi can ask what they are for, he is gone. Heartbroken and alone for the first time in her life, Tangi finds herself lost in a world of abuse and cruelty.  On the eve of her thirteenth birthday, she is shocked to discover the bottles are no longer empty, but magically filled with every teardrop she’s cried since her father's death. They are enchanted tears and they hold a secret, one that will free her from her life of abuse, pain, and the cruel world she knows.  The kingdom of Rosevine is a place where nothing is impossible, a perfect paradise on the outside. But Tangi will soon find perfect isn’t always what it seems. As much as she needed to escape to Rosevine, Rosevine and its people need her, too. Only she has the power to break the curse that has hovered over the kingdom, but breaking it is easier said than done, and time is running out.",
