With no thoughts of love, sex or romance in his life, you would think life would be simpler right? Wrong.Unfortunately for Mitch he seems to have started a trend in which other nice guys are also giving up their Libidos. Not to mention the age old saying of “What you can’t have. You want”. Will Mitch be able to survive this new minefield? And how will the rest of society cope with this new non-sexual movement? Especially since he’s the poster boy for this new battle in the war of the sexes!",
