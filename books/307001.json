  "description": "Retired doctor Lilian Templeton has a dead body in her garden and there is nothing she can do to stop the gas men digging it up. DI Ronnie Twist and her sergeant, Luke Carter, are not fooled by Lilian’s apparent innocence, and a game of cat and mouse ensues as Lilian seeks to hide her murderous past and avoid detection. What led Lilian to kill? How many murders has she committed? And will she get away with it? Set in the market town of Beverley, East Yorkshire, this is the first ‘Twist in the Tale’ mystery.",
