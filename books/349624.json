  "description": "Fuuko Kameyama was a cheerful, ordinary girl, who was about to embark on the time of her life - entering high school. However, one day, a truck pulls up to her low-rise appartment. Emerging from the truck were two handsome boys that were her age. One was the fun-loving Daiya, the other was the cold and sly looking Ichi. Apparently these cousins were moving into the appartment above her's and they will be attending the same high school in the same grade!",
