  "description": "Darwyn Cooke's first two Parker books, The Hunter and The Outfit, are collected in a tremendous, special, oversized hardcover edition - with an additional 65-pages of Darwyn Cooke content and a brand-new story - encased in a beautiful slipcase! Richard Stark's Parker: The Hunter graphic novel debuted in July 2008 to instantaneous popular and critical acclaim. It made the New York Times bestseller list and won coveted Eisner and Harvey awards. The second graphic novel, The Outfit, was released last year and was met with similar response, and is currently under consideration for nominations in this year's awards season. The Hunter and The Outfit tell the story of Parker, Richard Stark's classic anti-hero, as he returns to New York to settle the score with his wife and partner in crime after they betray him in a heist gone terribly wrong. After evening the field and reclaiming his prize, the Outfit decide to do some score settling of their own... and learn much too late that when you push a man like Parker, it had better be all the way to the grave.",
