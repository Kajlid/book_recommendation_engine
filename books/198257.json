  "description": "The Action-Packed Conclusion to the Undead World Series!The people of the Estes Valley have found their peace destroyed as they are attacked by the single greatest army left in the world. Not only do they have to contend with an army of men equipped with the latest hi-tech military gear, they also have to battle a horde of undead half a million strong.But, perhaps worse than all of this, they have to deal with a seven year old girl--Jillybean. Cruelly coerced into helping her enemies, Jillybean bends her mind to the destruction of the valley, the death of kings and the loss of her own soul, and when Jillybean puts her mind to something there's no saving it, ever.Against this overwhelming force is pitted the iron in Grey's muscles, the quickness of Sadie's feet, the determination in Deanna's steel blue eyes and...and small and weak Neil Martin whose greatest gift is seeing the good in people and ruthlessly killing them if he has to.The Apocalypse War is upon them and survival is all that matters.",
