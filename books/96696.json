While Mum and Dad go to the hospital, Madison reluctantly stays with her grandparents, with the baby's soft pink gift in tow. In Grandma's garden and at the beach, Madison gets thinking about birds and bees and brand new babies, and asks 'Did God make me as well?' Join Madison as she discovers that we are all fearfully and wonderfully made by a loving God, and a blessing to our families.",
