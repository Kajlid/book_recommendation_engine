  "description": "SHE WAS LOSING FAITH…UNTIL HE BELIEVED IN HER  For four generations, Bretton’s on the Boardwalk, a store dedicated to Christmas, has greeted tourists who come to Port Provident, but after Hurricane Hope tears through town, Jessica Bretton is left with a pile of bills to pay and no tourists visiting her store. She doesn’t want to fail her family by closing the doors to the store, but she can’t hold on much longer.  As Director of the Park Board of Port Provident, Bradley Thorpe is responsible for getting tourists to Provident Island. It’s been almost three months since Hurricane Hope tore through the island, and while there’s much work to be done, people are ready to get back to normal. The local economy is strained and it looks like the Christmas season is going to be an unhappy holiday.  When Jessica suggests reviving a Christmas celebration from Port Provident’s history books, Bradley is unconvinced. His role is to drive the local economy, not plan parties. Could a woman who celebrates Christmas all year long change the heart of a man who’s more interested in the bottom line than a season of hope? And could a little Christmas cheer be just what Port Provident needs to rebuild?  HURRICANE HOPE: ONE STORM CHANGES PORT PROVIDENT FOREVER…AND FOR GOOD.",
