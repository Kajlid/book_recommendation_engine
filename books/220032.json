  "description": "How far will you go to save a stranger?\n\nA night out.\n \nAn exclusive club.\n \nA complete stranger.\nWhen I walked into his club, I thought it would be fun—exciting even. Troubled times had invaded my marriage and a night out with my best friend sounded like bliss.I’m still young after all, just twenty-five years old, although lately it feels more like fifty.It’s was time for something new, dare I say, something—thrilling? And yet, I never imagined what waited for me down that darkened alleyway, behind that steel door. Had I known, I probably would have run the other way.But as I stepped over the threshold into that mysterious establishment, fate had plans of her own.\nSolve the mystery today.",
