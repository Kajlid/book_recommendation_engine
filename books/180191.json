  "description": "I’m not a difficult guy. Really. I’m not needy either. It’s just that… I’m tired of being single. I want to find my soul mate, like everyone else. Especially since I’m supposed to have found her for a while now. Just look at my friend, Emma. She found Tyler and then BOOM, her chest started glowing.I want to glow also. Maybe with Suzie. She looks cute, she’s kind and she stops my mental rambling without any effort. Doesn’t she sound like THE soul mate any guy would want?Of course, it’s not going to be so easy. Oh no. It seems that fate has another destiny for me, because it puts Logan Brown in my path… and a mountain load of problems. I’m not kidding. It’s freaking MOUNTAIN load of problems. Nothing is going the way I want it to go, but I'm not going to give up.",
