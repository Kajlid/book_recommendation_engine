  "title": "America 1900: The Turning Point",
  "description": "America 1900 is a sweeping narrative that follows an eclectic group of men and women over the course of one pivotal year. As it happened, the issues they were dealing with are surprisingly similar to those their grandchildren and great-grandchildren face in the year 2000. Change had come so fast that there was an almost magical belief in the powers of science and technology. The country had never been more prosperous, but the gap between rich and poor had never been greater. And the soaring sense of optimism most Americans felt was severely tested by wars abroad and dissension at home.",
