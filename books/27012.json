  "description": "Jenna McCarthy is the limerent, wide-eyed daughter of two successful, over-bearing parents. She lives alongside her younger brother Matt, in their giant, empty house amidst the great, looming buildings in the city of Boston. Jenna has everything she could ever need, and lives a quiet, predictable life. Where everything's the same, and nothing really changes. And she likes it that way. But when her best (and only) friend Quin ditches Jenna for his new Bonne Belle wearing, platinum haired girlfriend - Jenna is convinced that things couldn't get any worse. Until, of course, she discovers that she's failing algebra. The only mercy comes from Brandon Taccone - Jenna's attractive, golden-eyed, guitar playing math teacher. Fresh out of graduate school, and frustrated with the lack of respect he receives from his students, he decides that he'd be willing to help Jenna salvage a grade, providing she abide by a simple ultimatum: show up for after school tutoring. Yet neither are prepared for what will ensue when a simple act of forgetfulness leads Jenna to seek Mr. Taccone out in a place she should never have stepped into. They're thrown into each others worlds of passion, pain, and forbidden emotions. Will they keep their distance and abide by the line that separates them, or reach out to grasp the untouchable? Hush, is a boundary-stretching story about love, self-examination, and the irrational feelings that come with falling for the ones we shouldn't, but simply can't deny. Recommended for readers 17+ due to sexual situations, language, and a mature-dramatic scene.",
