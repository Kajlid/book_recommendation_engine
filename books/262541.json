  "title": "Embrace the Beauty",
  "description": "What does it mean to be a woman? How does life look through the innocent eyes of a girl versus the mature spectacles of a woman who has lived through it all? How do they see life and love differently?Embrace the Beauty is a poignant collection of poetry, flash fiction, and short stories about putting the pieces of the puzzle of our lives together, stepping back, and finding the beauty through the pain and mystery of life.The poetry in this collection revolves around one woman's changing perspective and resolve to find beauty through the seasons of life, to weather the storms, to recognize the silver lining around the clouds, and to come through it all with grace and strength.The second half of the book includes short fiction, all centered around the \"what ifs\" in life, the joy, the pain, the uncertainty, the regret, and the hope. Selections include \"Balloons for Bee,\" a haunting story about a woman confused about her sister's birthday, \"The Motherhood Club,\" about a woman who can't understand why women seem to lose themselves in motherhood, \"Beware the Mergoddess,\" a unique retelling of the mermaid myth, and \"Job Hazards,\" in which a short-order cook thinks he has the safest job in the world but finds out differently.156 pages.",
