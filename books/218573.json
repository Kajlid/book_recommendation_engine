  "description": "Naomi Lorraine, who used to be or still known as Nerdy Naomi, looks forward in her thick rimmed glasses to a life without the fear of being bullied. She no longer has to take up the laughs, insults, and bruises high school once gave her, at least she hopes not as much. With her bullies finally realizing there's no point to dedicating their lives to make one person miserable, Naomi thinks she can live out the rest of her life normally. That is until her childhood friend, Dominic, crashes back into her life, throwing out that hope of having a normal life - Not like she had one in the beginning.That is because she has the Three Musketeers - Bennett Frazier, Jordan Wallace, and Declan Lynch - by her side. Together, they faced the adventures life threw at them and would have never thought that anything, or anyone, could break them. Oh, but don't worry. Really, you're overthinking things here, this is nothing to stress over about. It's still quite simple really.She's still their good girl.And they're still her bad boys.Right?",
