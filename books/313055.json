  "description": "What if the father you never knew, left behind a heartbreaking secret? June Westwood is devastated by the news the father she never met has died. Now the truth about why Jasper abandoned her as a child will be buried forever. Escaping to the secluded beach house she's inherited, June hopes to spend time bonding with her two little daughters, away from her hectic job and failing marriage. On the wild shores of the Pacific Northwest, her father's hideaway leaves June breathless. But it's his oil paintings decorating every wall that surprise her most. How could someone paint other people so beautifully, but reject those closest to him? And why is every drawer in her father's workshop locked? June hopes her new neighbor--her father's apprentice Caleb--will provide the answers. But Caleb won't talk about the past. Then, hidden in her father's workshop, June discovers a box of newspaper clippings that reveal the shocking reason why her father left years ago--and uncovers Caleb's own devastating secret . . . When her old life comes calling, June has an impossible decision to make. Will digging deeper into her father's dark past heal or destroy her precious family?",
