  "title": "The Indigo Blade",
  "description": "Penelope Seton had heard the stories of the Indigo Blade, so when an ex-suitor asked her to help betray and capture the infamous rogue, she had to admit that she was moved --- more by the thought of meeting the dashing revolutionary than by any devotion to King George III. Her new husband, Maximillian Broderick, was handsome and rich, but the man whose blue-gray eyes and passionate embrace had once made her blood race had become an apathetic popinjay after the wedding. Still, something lurked behind Max's languid smile, and she swore she saw glimpses of the passionate husband he seemed to be. Soon Penelope was involved in a game that threatened to claim her husband, her head, and her heart. But she found herself wondering, if her love was to be the prize, who would win it --- her husband or...the Indigo Blade.",
