  "description": "In Redemption French feminist writer Chantal Chawaf explores the dark paths of madness and sadism, where sexuality evokes cannibalism and vampirism. The language of the body and the body of language are stripped naked in Chawaf's violently beautiful prose as she mounts this terrorist attack on the age-old theme of redemption through love.",
