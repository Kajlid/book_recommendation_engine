  "description": "Heaven's Darkest Hour tells the tale of Lucifer's journey from beloved son of God to the ruthless embodiment of evil known as Satan. The Prince of Light's path to darkness travels from the Garden of Eden to the fabled lands of Nod and Atlantis to the halls of heaven. His bold but ill-fated quest bathes the earth in the blood of its first wars and casts a shroud of conspiracy over the kingdom of heaven. The seeds sown by Lucifer's subtle words reap great devastation, causing angels to fall from grace and men to slip into damnation. Finally, he shakes the pillars of heaven, waging a great battle before the very throne of God. He was destined to rebel and destined to lose, but that does not make his fall any less tragic.",
