  "description": "TO SOME, ARKAS IS A TERRORIST. TO OTHERS, HE’S THEIR SAVIOUR.  TO THE CREW OF THE SOLITUDE, HE’S THEIR NEXT PAYDAY.  Following a devastating campaign of sabotage on a vital agricultural colony, the figure known only as Arkas makes his final threat: if the Federation fails to meet his demands within five days, he will permanently cripple the star system’s food supply.  Bounty hunters Dom Souza and Eddie Gould have the contract on Arkas’ head. But as they race to find Arkas before the deadline expires, Dom begins to doubt everything she was told about this so-called terrorist.  As the fires of rebellion spark across the colony, Dom will have to unravel the truth behind Arkas. Because if she can’t, her bounty will turn to dust. And the colony with it.",
