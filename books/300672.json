  "description": "Nora Baxter, in one single night discovered that her husband was having an affair with another woman, and also lost her unborn child. She promptly walked away from her life in Detroit, traveled to Cincinnati, and set about to start a new one. At first Nora intended to ask Blake for a divorce. However, as the months passed her hatred intensified, and she could not bear the thought of being in the same room with him. In addition, a divorce would free him to marry his lover, and Nora had no intention of making it that easy for him. Almost two years later, by a quirk of fate, Blake Baxter arrived in Cincinnati on business, and came face to face with his wife on a dance. Who could have suspected that he would go into a rage, kidnap her, and hold her prisoner in a primitive cabin in southern Kentucky, where anger flared, and unbridled passion exploded.",
