  "description": "They're weak, he thought bitterly. I hate the weak. I'm not weak. I'll show them â€“ I'll show them all!A white-faced boy tromped begrudgingly down a hillside stomping snowdrops into the frozen ground. In the nearby woods, black mist swirled mysteriously at the base of a large fir tree, as two figures vanished as quietly as they had come. Before the roses, before the dusk came a time of innocence and laughter.Nestled quietly in Washington State, the town of Wenatchee is where Lucas Bevan moved when he was four. Living with his mother and a stepfather who inflicts misery, Lucas has the most depressing existence a teen could have - apart from his Becky.Then along comes Marcus - streetwise and guarded. He gives Lucas just the hope he needs. But Marcus has a secret with unimaginable consequences.",
