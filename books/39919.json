  "description": "Dragon Fate, the first novel in J.D. Hallowell's War of the Blades, is a heroic fantasy adventure in the classic tradition of the genre. Delno Okonan is a young former soldier eager to put the swords and strife of war behind him, when a chance encounter leaves him inextricably entwined in a tangled web of dragons, magic, and intrigue, as he struggles to find his place among dragons and men, and stave off a plot by renegade dragon riders that threatens all he now holds dear. New Orleans Books calls it one of the top 5 independent and small-press titles more people should be reading. \"Excellent...really well-written and compelling.\" ~ Geoffrey Kabaservice, author of \"Rule and Ruin\" \"If you are a fan of Fantasy and dragon-lore, it would be hard to go wrong with Dragon Fate....Action, adventure, and, of course, dragons. You will not be sorry for downloading this.\" ~ Adam Byrn Tritt, author of \"Ezekiel's Wheel\"",
