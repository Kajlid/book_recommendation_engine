  "description": "Horses, love, and the tang of thyme and honey...In Classical Greece, apprentice sculptor Philon has chosen the ideal horse to model for his masterpiece. Sadly, the rider falls well short of the ideal of beauty, but scarred and tattered Hilarion, with his brilliant, imperfect smile, draws Philon in a way that mere perfection cannot.After years of living among the free and easy tribes of the north, Hilarion has no patience with Athenian formality. He knows what he wantsâ€”and what he wants is Philon. Society, friends and family threaten their growing relationship, but perhaps a scarred soldier and a lover of beauty are more alike than they appear.",
