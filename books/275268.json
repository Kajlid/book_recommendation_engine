  "title": "Auggie Wren's Christmas Story",
  "description": "A timeless, utterly charming Christmas fable, beautifully illustrated and destined to become a classic. When Paul Auster was asked by The New York Times to write a Christmas story for the Op-Ed page, the result, \"Auggie Wren's Christmas Story,\" led to Auster's collaboration on a film adaptation, Smoke. Now the story has found yet another life in this enchanting illustrated edition.It begins with a writer's dilemma: he's been asked by The New York Times to write a story that will appear in the paper on Christmas morning. The writer agrees, but he has a problem: How to write an unsentimental Christmas story? He unburdens himself to his friend at his local cigar shop, a colorful character named Auggie Wren. \"A Christmas story? Is that all?\" Auggie counters. \"If you buy me lunch, my friend, I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. And I guarantee every word of it is true.\"And an unconventional story it is, involving a lost wallet, a blind woman, and a Christmas dinner. Everything gets turned upside down. What's stealing? What's giving? What's a lie? What's the truth? It's vintage Auster, and pure pleasure: a truly unsentimental but completely affecting tale.",
