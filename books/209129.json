  "description": "It all started out as a game.Just a way to have fun. We figured as long as we had rules, it wouldn't be a problem.RULE #1: Only break into one another's houses.RULE #2: Only take stuff that can be replaced.It worked for a while. Whoever's turn it was to break in got a rush, and the rest of us laughed over the trophies they brought back. But then someone went too far. Lives got ruined. Someone is dead.And I might be next.",
