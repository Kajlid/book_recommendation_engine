  "description": "NoahI thought I knew what love was. I’ve had relationships, but those were nothing like what I have with Elle. She’s taken over my thoughts, taken control of my days—she owns my nights. But something doesn’t sit right. Her family, her past—it’s like they don’t exist. I don’t want to dig. I don’t want to confirm anything that might prove me right. I’ve had enough to deal with over the past few years. It’s time to move on with the girl of my dreams by my side.But then I do a little digging.And I before I know it I’m standing in a grave.ElleI didn’t come from money. I didn’t come from anything. When you spend your childhood invisible, you begin to believe that actions don’t matter—consequences don’t exist—and your past will never come back to haunt you. Then I met Noah. He saw me. He made me feel important, special, and most of all real.But Noah and I are a house of cards.The wind is picking up.The ground is shaking.It’s time for me to go.I could run, but deep down I could never quit Noah.They say love is stronger than death. For Noah and Elle to survive, it had better be.",
