Behind the fa√ßade of oak-paneled boardrooms, fancy personal jets, and lavish mansions, Vik is masterminding a grand scheme of market manipulation, smuggling, money laundering, and extortion through an international network of banks, brokerage houses and dummy corporations. He is a megalomaniac who will stop at nothing to grow his corporate empire, even murder.As the clock winds down to Suri's deadly triumph, no one suspects his hidden agenda - except Tom Carter, an investment banker working on the deal. Torn between his job and his conscience, and locked in the crosshairs of the SEC, Tom enlists the help of Amanda Fleming, a beautiful and intrepid New York Times reporter eager to \"break\" a big story. Together, they must not only outsmart the brilliant Vik, but desperately try to stay alive!",
