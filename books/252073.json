  "description": "Meet Amy Flowers, a seventh grader who marches to her own beat: Being the new girl at exclusive Allington Academy doesn't break her stride! Meet the League: They rule the school, and their queen is oh-so-mean Fiona, who doesn't exactly appreciate Amy's individuality. This time, Amy is helping League lieutenant Jenelle with a charity fashion show. When Amy gets photographed in an original outfit (of her own creation, of course), she's no longer a fashion faux pas, and Fiona is furious! Will all the attention keep Amy from practicing for the upcoming Academic Challenge?",
