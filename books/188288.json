  "description": "A beautiful child is born into a family that idolizes him from the cradle. Adoration is fed to him from a silver spoon and nothing is too much for the golden (wash belly) boy. Nurtured by manifestly counter-productive adulation Marcus morphs into a monster child. He becomes manipulative and controlling - everything must go his way - or no way.The monster child matures into an unruly and un-containable teen rogue, who gives no heed to morals, principles or laws, pushing already unstintingly liberal boundaries ever wider into indisputably rebellious territory and acquires the moniker \"Rebel Seed\".Like any decent self-destructive rebel, Marcus is drawn to the streets for he craves excitement - a fast life that quickly subsumes him into a parallel world where hustlers and villains are adored as superstars. And soon he too walks in the shoes of a gangster, reveling in the shadowy existence - blinded and consumed by fleshly lusts he commits the most villainous acts, gaining fruitless gratification from the dubious respect of his peers. But is Marcus' gangster's paradise really a glimpse of hell?This story delves into the complex subject matters of un-forgiveness and forgiveness, and effectively demonstrates the power of redeeming love.This novel deals with the sensitive subject matter of drug abuse and addiction to Cocaine (AKA Charlie), crack and marijuana.",
