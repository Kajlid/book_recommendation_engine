  "title": "Murder In Room 117: Solving The Cold Case That Led To America's Longest War",
  "description": "A nonfiction investigative thriller revealing the truth behind one of the Cold War's darkest crimes: the murder in 1979 of the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, Spike Dubs. Washington's official version was that the investigation of the murder was inconclusive. In reality, the State Department's investigator delivered a report laying blame squarely on Soviet KGB spies and Afghanistan's Communist regime of the time.The aftershocks of the crime helped ignite more than 40 years of war, with lasting consequences for the United States and the world. Now Murder In Room 117 advocates a new chapter in the story: the reopening of this cold case for a complete forensic re-examination, aided by twenty-first century science.",
