  "title": "Swimming Against the Current: Fighting for Common Sense in a World That’s Lost its Mind",
  "description": "America’s most sought-after voice in the fight to save female sports from woke destruction shares her unbelievable story and inspires readers to embrace common sense and truth in discussions about women's rights. Riley Gaines has been called many Collegiate athlete. All-American. Olympic hopeful. But in 2022, everything changed. The narrative shifted. Now, critics smeared her Transphobic. Narrow-minded. Evil. What changed? Riley gave the truth a voice. She stood up, spoke out, and dared to ask questions -- not just for herself, but for all female athletes who refuse to accept an ideology where \"inclusivity\" for transgender athletes now means treating women unfairly.  Riley Gaines is changing minds in the process, and this highly anticipated, fearless, pro-woman book takes on controversial, uncomfortable, but critical questions we must confront about women (and sports) in America. Can't we embrace policies that give everyone the chance to compete but still protect women and ensure they have a fair shot at success? In this book, Riley scrutinizes the perspectives of athletes on the opposing side of this debate, deconstructing their arguments with science, facts, and logic. She also asks what has happened to free speech and dissent in this country, where it now seems nearly impossible to have a well-reasoned debate. And in telling her story, Riley reveals what’s at stake if the truth-seekers remain silent about the injustices women face from radical agendas.",
