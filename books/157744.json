  "title": "Life of a Counterfeiter",
  "description": "A master forger lives in obscurity and disappointment, oppressed by the shadow of the artist whose work he copies. Unglamorous, unadorned lives such as this form the focus of Yasushi Inoue's tenderly observed, elegantly distilled short stories - two of which are appearing in English for the first time. With a haunting emotional intensity, they offer glimpses of love lost and lives wasted. These three luminous, compassionate tales showcase the mastery and exquisite talent of one of Japan's most beloved writers.",
