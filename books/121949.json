  "description": "VOLUME TWO OF TWOA genre-defining-and redefining-collection of fiction's boldest, most rebellious, and most prescient genre, featuring a smorgasbord of stories from all over the globe\"The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.\" Almost forty years ago, William Gibson wrote the line that began Neuromancer and, more importantly, cyberpunk - a movement that would change the face of science fiction.Award-winning anthologist Jared Shurin brings together over a hundred stories from more than twenty-five different countries that both establish and subvert the classic cyberpunk tropes and aesthetic-from gritty, near-future noir to pulse-pounding action. Urban rebels undermine monolithic corporate overlords. Daring heists are conducted through back alleys and the darkest parts of the online world. There's dangerous new technology, cybernetic enhancements, scheming AIs, corporate mercenaries, improbable weapons, and roguish hackers. These tales examine the near-now, extrapolating the most provocative trends into fascinating and plausible futures.We live in an increasingly cyberpunk world-packed with complex technologies and globalized social trends. A world so bizarre than even the futurists couldn't explain it-though many authors in this book have come closer than most. As both an introduction to the genre and the perfect compendium for the lifelong fan, The Big Book of Cyberpunk offers a hundred ways to understand where we are, and where we're going-or simply venture down some dazzling, neon-slicked streets.",
