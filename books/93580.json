  "description": "Can one bet change everything?Kalli Perkins doesn’t think so. She’s a nineteen-year-old college student, sometimes mother to her little twin brothers when theirs is indisposed, sex-addict (she’d never admit this) and live-for-the-moment go-getter.At such a short age she’s witnessed the ugly that this world hides—hides in girls like her.So what does one kiss with her close friend, Nate, matter? What does it matter if she drops to her knees between his legs and bets him she can blow his mind?But there’s something she didn’t count on—someone. Nate. He has a dark past of his own and he could be that that good guy a bad girl like her never sees coming.",
