  "title": "His Boy Next Door: Season Three",
  "description": "Channon never thought life could be like this. A career he enjoys, an apartment overlooking the Santa Rita harbor, and Jack, the man who made it all possible. The man who loves him. The man who taught him the ecstasy of submission.  Still, life with Jack isn't predictable, and Channon can't help wondering how long this can last. What does Jack want from him in the end? Can Channon be everything Jack wants? Is his best is good enough for the man he calls Sir?  What does Jack want? Can this fragile thing they have last? And what does it mean when the boundaries of a relationship are non-traditional, when Jack's desires push Channon to places he never imagined he could go?  This collection includes the complete Season Three (episodes 25 to 30) of an ongoing series.",
