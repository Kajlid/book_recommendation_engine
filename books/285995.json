  "description": "Veronica Cunningham was as shallow as they came—until new depths dragged her under at just seventeen. Now—aside from her art—she prefers all things surface-level, at best. Maverick Morrison needs a new roommate—and as a loyal man in a long-term relationship with his best friend, that’s all he needs. But when he meets Veronica, he finds himself slowly pulled into her past—and her sorrow, which threatens to swallow them both. To her, Maverick is annoying—with a stubbornness that rivals even her own—but safe. Though his ocean-eyes remind her of all that she’s lost. To him, she’s captivating. A beautiful mystery. Until he discovers that her guarded heart is a riptide—and that his has been in the wrong hands all along… What happens when a love-destructive girl accidentally falls for a boy who’s vowed to never again accept a love that doesn’t mend?",
