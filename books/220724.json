  "description": "The first Canadian colonies offer a challenging future for three women in this historical novel by the author of Promised to the Crown. In 1677, an invisible wall separates settlers in New France from their Huron neighbors. Yet whether in the fledgling city of Quebec or within one of the native tribes, every woman's fate depends on the man she chooses—or is obligated—to marry. Although Claudine Deschamps and Gabrielle Giroux both live within the settlement, their prospects are very different. French-born Claudine has followed her older sister across the Atlantic hoping to attract a wealthy husband through her beauty and connections. Gabrielle, orphan daughter of the town drunkard, is forced into a loveless union by a cruel law that requires her to marry by her sixteenth birthday. And Manon Lefebvre, born in the Huron village and later adopted by settlers, has faced the prejudices of both societies and is convinced she can no longer be accepted in either. Drawn into unexpected friendship through their loves, losses, and dreams of home and family, all three women will have to call on their bravery and resilience to succeed in this new world . . .Praise for Duty to the Crown “The reader is treated to a picture of what it must have been like to reach maturity in such a world. It is a novel of both love and loss, and we come away in admiration for the women striving despite mistreatment and abandonment. I found myself sorry when I reached the end of the book, since Manon, Claudine, and Gabrielle had become like good friends of mine.” —Historical Novel Society",
