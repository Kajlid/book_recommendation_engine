  "description": "Twenty-six-year-old Kyla is admittedly a late bloomer. She prefers to remain within the comfort zone of her supportive family, her loyal sweetheart, and her close-knit group of friends. When she returns to the local university for her eighth year as a part-time student, she is surprised by a physical attraction and emotional bond that she forms with Steph, another female classmate. Uncertain and fearful, Kyla must decide whether to continue the now lopsided relationship with her trusting boyfriend of four years, or submit to unfamiliar passions felt toward another woman.Brace yourself for this passionate journey for an answer to the common question, \"Who am I?\" You'll relate to the comical questions Kyla shares with her friends, connect with her thoughts as she silently questions life's everyday activities, and empathize with her as she struggles with the unknown. Hold on tight, and get ready for the ride of your life.",
