  "title": "The Lady's Will",
  "description": "When wealthy and eccentric Victoria Lancaster passes away, she leaves her niece Adele in charge of her Welsh estate. Demure Adele is suddenly thrust into a world she never imagined existed – one of opulence and servants. As she slowly discovers her aunt’s secret life, Adele finds her feminine power awakening and the men around her falling at her feet – all except the one she truly desires.Will Adele tame the man she desires? What other secrets was Victoria hiding? Experience the decidedly kinky twists as Adele journeys from shy librarian to mistress of the house when she abides by the Lady’s will. What readers are “If you liked 50 Shades of Grey you’ll like this book. If you didn’t like 50 Shades, you’ll love it. The characters are well-drawn and believable, the women are strong and empowered, and the main character’s transformation is a joy to behold. I’d love to see this one turned into a movie!”“So good to read a book that has kink, character, and doesn’t demean women, but celebrates them. A welcome departure from the genre (I’m looking at you, 50 Shades, Bared to You…)” “Smartly written, The Lady’s Will really transports you to a different world. It felt like I was there, in Wales, alongside the characters. Adele’s self-discovery is like watching a flower bloom, and Victoria’s charismatic and theatrical personality leaps off the page. A solid effort from this writer.”From The Lady’s “For the sixth and final stroke, I decided to really let it fly. I swung hard. The cane cut through the air and bit into his flesh . . . My head swooned. I knew right then that I could never go back to dinner dates and conversations and polite sex. I had tasted power, and I liked its heady draught.”",
