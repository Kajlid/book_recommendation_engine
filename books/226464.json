  "description": "Filled with updated research and findings, the ninth edition of Schultz and Schultz's THEORIES OF PERSONALITY gives you a clear and cogent introduction to this dynamic field. Organized by theory, this popular text discusses major theorists who represent psychoanalytic, neopsychoanalytic, lifespan, trait, humanistic, cognitive, behavioral, and social-learning approaches, while demonstrating the influence of events in theorists' personal and professional lives on the development of these theories. The book also explores the ways in which race, gender, and cultural issues play a part in the study of personality and in personality assessment, and includes numerous examples, tables, and figures that further enhance your understanding of the content. The final chapter, \"Personality in Perspective,\" integrates topics explored in previous chapters and suggests conclusions that can be drawn from the many theorists' work.",
