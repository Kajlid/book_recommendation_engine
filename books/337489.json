  "description": "Samhain was the biggest festival of the year. It was the time that the veil between our world and the otherworld thinned, meaning any manner of spirits could come through and wreak havoc. Not that I had anything to worry about with a dragon at my side. This year the festival would be the perfect excuse to snuggle up with my partner and enjoy Fall in full swing. Or at least it would have been, if I could find him.This is a short story set in the Mead Mishaps series featuring Cinnamon and Fallon and is not a stand alone. It should be read after That Time I Got Drunk And Yeeted A Love Potion At A Werewolf.",
