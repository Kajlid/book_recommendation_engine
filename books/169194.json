  "description": "This isn’t a coming out story. Nor is it the tale of a lonely heart seeking companionship. This is about how I learned to fight.My name is Nathaniel Courtney and I’m a survivor. I didn’t let the cruelty of others wear me down, and I’ve weathered the more subtle hardships of the heart. Love is a Trojan horse, slipping past your guard and leaving you ransacked and vulnerable. I emerged from that war not unscathed but as a new man. The only mistake I ever made was letting the right guy get away. Now I’ve got one more chance. This is the final battle, because if I fail now… I won’t. You’ll see. Just listen to my story, Kelly Phillips, and when I’m done, please don’t walk away. Take this weary soldier into your arms so we can find peace together.Something Like Thunder is the sixth book in the ongoing Something Like… series, shedding light on past events while leading the reader toward an exciting new future.The Something Like... series:Book 1: Something Like SummerBook 2: Something Like WinterBook 3: Something Like AutumnBook 4: Something Like SpringBook 5: Something Like LightningBook 6: Something Like Thunder",
