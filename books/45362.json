  "description": "Andy's life is going nowhere, fast. He left art school with his career all worked out ahead of time, but ...to say  it didn't work out is the understatement of the century. Unemployed and living with his overbearing parents, Andy  struggles to keep sight of the lofty goals that once drove him. But it's hard, even when he reconnects with his old art school crush, Yumi. Things look better, briefly, with Yumi back in the picture and an actual job offer on the table. But then Andy takes the job offer--to work at a zoo--and finds himself in an alternate dimension. The zoo? It's run by aliens. The exhibit? It's him.  Derek Kirk Kim is back with an offbeat, poignant new project. The first volume of a series, Tune is a science fiction comedy, but it's also a smart and affectionate examination of human nature.",
