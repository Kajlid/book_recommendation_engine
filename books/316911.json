  "description": "All it took was a blizzard and a pair of sky-blue eyes to break me. I had one rule when I decided to rent out the ground level of my house – keep it professional. So I have no idea why I told the hospital to call my new tenant, Logan Hawkins, when I ended up unconscious in the snow. It was impossible to keep my distance from the brooding single dad after he came to my rescue. My past is tragic with a capital T so I decide to keep it to myself for as long as I can. That way maybe Logan won’t run, like everyone else. I want his touch… his love. Not his sympathy. But he’s been keeping secrets of his own. The more time we spend together the more I want to confess, and I want to know what has been turning those sky-blue eyes stormy when he thinks I’m not looking. They say the truth will set you free, but in this case, it might shatter what’s left of my fragile heart. The Winter We Collided, book 2 in the Ocean Pines series, is a sexy, single dad romance featuring a brooding, buff paramedic and the shy, secretive new girl in town.",
