  "description": "--- Be careful what you wish for. ---Annie is trapped in a life of slavery as a scullery maid. Her world gets turned on its head when she becomes the groom of Coal, the most devilishly handsome man she’s ever seen. She couldn’t help but fall for his charm even though he never spoke a word, and was kept at the mansion as a human horse. She was there for him when he was upset, she was there for him when he wanted to play, and she was even there for him when his stud libido needed taming. Now, Coal is leaving, after a year in service as a stallion, and Annie’s heart is breaking. If he is to go, she wants one last chance at truly connecting with Coal. What she doesn’t expect though is that after a night of passion, Coal comes back for her, and as Dante, buys her from her former master. She’d always imagined the life Coal led as a comfortable existence, but it is when she becomes Dante’s mare that she realizes there is much more to being a pony than she thought. With Dante being Annie’s new master, she is thrust into a debauched world she never imagined existed, but she isn’t sure anymore if being his mare is what she truly wants. All she knows is that she wants her beloved stallion Coal back.
