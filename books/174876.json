In this contemporary love story, loosely inspired by \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" the woodsman and the wolf are cousins, and Little Red is the girl with whom they both fall in love. Beautiful Ginger McHuid, daughter of Kentucky's premiere horse breeder, grows up on her family farm, best friends with Cain Wolfram, the son of her father's Stallion Manager, and Cain's cousin, Josiah Woodman, son of a local banker. Throughout their happy childhood, the three are inseparable friends, but as they mature into adults, complicated feelings threaten to destroy their long history of friendship and love. **Due to profanity and very strong sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.**All novels in the ~a modern fairytale~ collection are written as fundraisers.",
