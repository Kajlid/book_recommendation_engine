  "description": "A massive flood threatens as the Christmas season dawns in the Houston Galveston area. People living there donâ€™t expect a white Christmas but they hope for a dry Christmas. It is hot, humid and floodwaters everywhere have trapped people in inconvenient and dangerous situations. At a small specialty store in a high income community, a dozen or so people are trapped for 3 days and 2 nights. On the surface most appear to be strangers caught at random. Then there is a murder and it turns out the only real stranger among them is a detective whose presence is hardly coincidental. Set in 1982, this a traditional murder mystery and the first in a series featuring a 1980s detective who is the great grandson a famous Texas lawman from the 1900s. The free and easy 80s are a sharp contrast to the world his ancestor lived in, but Lt. Sinclair Plate finds murder is just as common.",
