  "description": "A “page-turner of a survival story,” –School Library Journal Big things are about to happen at Maple's house. Mama's going to have a baby, which means now there will be four Rittle sisters instead of just three. But when baby Lily is born too early and can't come home from the hospital, Maple knows it's up to her to save her sister. So she and Dawn, armed with a map and some leftover dinner, head off down a river and up a mountain to find the Wise Woman who can grant miracles. Now it's not only Lily's survival that they have to worry about, but also their own. The dangers that Maple and Dawn encounter on their journey makes them realize a thing or two about miracles-and about each other.Praise for FLUTTER:   “Moulton is an author to watch, and her debut novel will appeal to girls Maple's age who prefer action to character realism.” –Booklist   “Moulton's charming debut explores the challenges and rewards of sisterhood….[in] a heartfelt tale of familial love, with just a touch of magic.” –Publishers Weekly",
