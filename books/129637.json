Poetry that takes us on an exceptional language travel: herein Afghan literature hypnotizes the readers in Farsi language.”Steadily on the water at the horizon a river atwain, an Amu atwain rises, someone or a talism on sand fluid ways on the hillside of words every moment they pass, they arrive for an arrangement or, they never arrive a wet inkwell, stirred into glass and mirrored to imbue the self, an exhalation, on the rim of a glass tea, kept in suspense in the sense of five senses, spread dimensions bends and returns in an excitation, lips closed stiff, and on one of its ways carrying its cancer. an exhalation steamed up a glass of tea; some views lost in threads, sorrows cut on edges one of our shreds has already left for Tibet, the rash tone of a mare to morph to a butterfly.” 96 pages, 6″ x 9″, perfect binding, cream interior paper (60# weight), black and white interior ink, white exterior paper (100# weight), full-color exterior ink",
