  "description": "He's the godfather of the U.S. Navy SEALs -- the founder of the boldest, brightest, baddest bunch of commandos on the face of the planet. Now Roy Boehm tells how he mastered survival as a warrior -- and changed the course of twentieth-century warfare. Roy Boehm was fated for heroism from the moment he shipped out with the U.S. Navy, eight months before Pearl Harbor. His brilliant fighting career would lead him from the sea battles of the South Pacific to the killing fields of Vietnam. As World War II came to a close and the Cold War began, Boehm saw the need for an unconventional warrior. Drawing on his expertise as a diver and member of the Navy's Underwater Demolition Teams, he created a force capable of attack from sea, air, or land. This unique dedicated and ruthless unit would become the legendary Navy SEALs. With the impact of a depth charge, First Seal delivers a no-holds-barred look at what it takes to be one of that rare breed of men who live for war...or die for their country.",
