[Ethan Canin is] a writer of enormous talent and charm.”– The Washington Post“Character is destiny,” wrote Heraclitus–and in this collection of four unforgettable stories, we meet people struggling to understand themselves and the unexpected turns their lives have taken.

In “City of Broken Hearts,” a divorced father tries to fathom the patterns of modern relationships. And in “The Palace Thief,” a history teacher at an exclusive boarding school reflects on the vicissitudes of a lifetime connection with a student scoundrel. A remarkable achievement by one of America’s finest writers, this brilliant volume reveals the moments of insight that illuminate everyday lives.“Captivating . . . a heartening tribute to the form . . . an exquisite performance.”– The Boston Sunday Globe“A model of wit, wisdom, and empathy.
