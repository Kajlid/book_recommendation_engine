  "description": "Everyone is mystified by the strange Verity-Ann. She keeps herself to herself, and not even Mary-Lou, who's a new girl too, can understand her. Luckily for everyone involved, the solution to the problem turns up in the end! Verity-Ann Carey does not want to go to school. She has always had her lessons at home and, besides, she doesn't like girls! Verity-Ann, a child who has spent all her time with elderly grown-ups, doesn't approve of modern schoolgirls and is determined not to alter her prim old-maid ways. But Clem Barras can hardly wait to give up her wild travelling life and join in the boisterous fun of her classmates. When the three meet - there's trouble ahead!",
