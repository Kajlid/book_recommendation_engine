  "title": "One Too Many",
  "description": "A filthy proposition. Too much money to say no. One dirty night in a stranger's bed. While my husband watches. It should've been a dream. A new life on the coast, running a beautiful country hotel with my husband. It should have been everything I'd ever wanted. Worth every scrap of investment. A hotel business we'd sunken every single penny we owned into, only to find out there was a big chain rival opening just a stone's throw away. Slowly, day by day, the dream became a nightmare. Bills. So many bills. Sleepless nights, tossing and turning. No way out in sight. Until there was him. The man at the bar. The man with a proposition we should never have considered in a thousand years . . . Me. Him. One long night where I'm subject to his every fantasy. While my husband watches. Contains mature themes.",
