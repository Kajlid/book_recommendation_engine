  "description": "Nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry.I hate and--love. The sleepless body hammering a nail nails itself, hanging crucified.--from \"Catullus: Excrucior\" In Frank Bidart's collection of poems, the encounter with desire is the encounter with destiny. The first half contains some of Bidart's most luminous and intimate work-poems about the art of writing, Eros, and the desolations and mirror of history (in a spectacular narrative based on Tacitus). The second half of the book exts the overt lyricism of the opening section into even more ambitious territory-\"The Second Hour of the Night\" may be Bidart's most profound and complex meditation on the illusion of will, his most seductive dramatic poem to date.Desire is a 1997 National Book Award Finalist for Poetry.",
