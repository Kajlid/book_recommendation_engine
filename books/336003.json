  "title": "Operation Yes",
  "description": "No one in her sixth-grade class knows quite what to make of Ms. Loupe, with her short hair, her taped square \"stage\" on the floor, and the interest in improvisational theatre. After all, their school is on an Air Force base--a place that values discipline more than improv. But her students soon come to love her fresh approach; and when her dear brother goes missing in Afghanistan, and Ms. Loupe herself breaks down, they band together to support their teacher. What starts as a class fundraiser expands into a nationwide effort for all injured troops, and an amazing vision of community and hope.",
