  "description": "𝐓𝐰𝐞𝐥𝐯𝐞 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 𝐚𝐠𝐨, 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐟𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐚 𝐤𝐢𝐬𝐬.We are all, for better or worse, doomed to love each other until death do us part. My heart belongs to Proserpina and St. Sebastian—even if he no longer wants it. Even if she has left it behind to follow him.Delphine’s fled back home, and Becket’s holy calling is in peril.And now only Rebecca and I remain at Thornchapel to face the unknown.The door is open. The door that shouldn’t exist; the door that people have died to close. I don’t feel like the lord of the manor...I don’t feel like a king or a wild god. I am a friend and a boyfriend and a brother—and a failure at being all of these things. But the door doesn’t care about my guilt. It only cares about the sacrifice I’ll make to close it.As the bruising dark of Samhain approaches, so does the fate of our circle, of Thornchapel and the village and the valley beyond it. And I must don the crown, because one thing is still true, even if I must face it alone.𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐭 𝐓𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐥, 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐦𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐝𝐢𝐞.",
