Grief stricken once he’s out of prison and rehab, Jared plans to relocate with longtime girlfriend, Tina DeHaven, to wash himself of the drug-riddled town. But Dex has other plans when he meets Jared. Lucrative plans. Plans that keep Jared pushing pills, hunting down dealers he blames for Lacey’s death and on the verge of relapse.",
