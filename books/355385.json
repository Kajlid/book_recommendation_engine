  "description": "Motherhood sometimes seems as though it's not all it's cracked up to be. Sleepless nights, baby fat, encrusted bits of spit up clinging to my clothes and hair...not exactly what I'd pictured it as being. Sometimes I wonder where the real Virginia went - the person I used to be before I was just someone's wife or mother. Now I find out that a hot young girl is after my husband. Perfect. This is the life of a mother. It's real, and it's definitely nothing like a baby ad.",
