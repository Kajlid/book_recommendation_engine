  "description": "Do Made Men have morals?Once upon a time, Flavio Falcone would have bet his life that the answer was no. In this world of falsehood that he’d been born into, there was no place for something resembling honor. Man of honor was a fucking joke. He’d been taught that at the ripe age of 7. His sister's blood and piercing screams still haunt his nights.Yet, they haven’t shattered him like they would anybody else. Deep down, Flavio had always known he was different. When other kids, his siblings included, used to play freely, enjoy the little childhood allowed to them, he’d needed to fight to learn to quiet his incessant, unyielding mind.That's where she came in. Anastasia Costello bound to a cruel destiny and saved by those she would never put her money on. Fighting her own demons that unexpectedly mixed with Flavio's. The monsters of their pasts were there, lurking in the shadows of what was lost and could never be regained.But someone was playing mind games on the Famiglia, bringing him back to the dark place. A sadistic murderer who’d left a long trail of innocent young girls in his wake. So the only option for Flavio was to surrender to his thoughts once more. The clues were there, he knew they had to be, and all he needed was to find them.So maybe no morals was a bit of a stretch after all.*Trigger warning: this book contains sexual assault, child abuse, graphic violence, blood, and foul language.
