  "description": "A looming war. A pirate's revenge. A young noble caught in the middle...  Dradin Sharlain is the youngest son of the most feared family in Malseenia. Scorned by his father and tormented by Vax, his sadistic brother, Dradin is seen as weak and vulnerable, despite his talents in diplomacy. When his carriage breaks down in a remote area known to harbor pirates, he soon falls prey to Captain Rastay, the merciless commander of the pirate ship Siren. Captain Rastay kidnaps him, intending to ransom Dradin for the crewmen Vax is holding captive. Trapped on the high seas, Dradin learns the pirate captain is everything he is notâ€”powerful, fearless, and experienced in the ways of the world. But soon Dradin must make a bargain that may cost him his freedom and his innocence. Only he's no longer certain Rastay is as evil as the rumors claim...  Captain Rastay is desperate to rescue his men from the brutality of Vax Sharlain. So when the chance arises to capture the youngest of the family, he quickly takes the innocent young noble hostage. Rastay is driven by a wildness that shadows him, a craving for action, for revenge, and a growing desire for Dradin. After betrayals and subterfuge, both men are launched on a course toward a perilous battle on the high seas. Yet neither war nor treachery will stop Rastay from getting what he wants. But does he still want revenge...or does he want the hauntingly beautiful Dradin Sharlain in his arms?  Reader Note: Contains intense emotional elements",
