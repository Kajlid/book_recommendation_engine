  "description": "It’s a common enough occurrence for a sailor to become romantically involved with a responsive vessel — though seldom so intimately. And many a mariner, becalmed, might have dreamt of a lover who could raise the wind — but few find such creatures in the local pub. With both in the same port, however…it’s just a matter of time before his sailboat invites his new girlfriend over for tea and a chat regarding polygamous marriage customs.  When charting a coastline that’s still a squalling infant is the family business, where you go from here is always the tricky part.",
