In this collection of 41 tales of horror, paranoia, and paranormal, you’ll find zombies shambling across the pages, vampires lurking within, and you will also get to meet some “humans” who, for all practical purposes, are monsters without the benefit of the supernatural. Not suitable for children. This book contains explicit language and events.",
