  "description": "WARNING- This is the fifth book in the Lost and Found series and as always, there are ups and downs. Readers need to be aware that I deal with PTSD issues, suicide, and miscarriage. But, as always, there is a happy ending!!!  Duncan Wilde has avoided long-term relationships very well since his fiancée left him wounded in the hospital years ago. That one harsh lesson—that he needed to guard his heart—has stuck with him for years. Besides, he's a beat up old Marine well past his time for love. The fiery young doctor from Kansas City seems to think otherwise, though. Too bad she's so damn young. Alex Hartfield grew up as a military brat, but she sees something in Duncan that makes her think of permanence and starting a family. She wants someone to come home to every night and love, and he's the first man that makes her guarded heart race with hope and excitement.  Now… as they try to understand the dangerous incidents going on around them, they fight to find common ground. But it seems as if fate has some tricks up her sleeve.   I urge you to read the books of the Lost and Found series in order! Each can be read as a standalone, but you get a much better experience by taking them all in.",
