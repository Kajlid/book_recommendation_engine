  "title": "The Weight of Dusk",
  "description": "A hard sci-fi anthology with existentialist themes:These stories are designed to make you think.They contain people and places and actions, but they are about ideas. These are stories about the universe and what it means to be alive in it. This is a book of Speculative Fiction, which is to say it is a collection of stories about the future. But the futures it imagines are not about space battles or zombie apocalypses but are of conscious planets, virtual minds, or messages hidden in DNA. They are written to be fantastical and existential and maybe even a little absurd.They are meant to make you wonder.",
