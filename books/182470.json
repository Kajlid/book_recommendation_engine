  "description": "**MATURE AUDIENCES--Rough sex. Dirty talk. Criminal activity. Cursing. Fisticuffs. Closed course. Professional driver. Do not try this at home.** Theresa Drazen wants to know one thing. Is there something wrong with her? Because from what she can see, she has money, brains, a body that does the job. Yet, she keeps getting shelved. Most recently, by her fianc√© who happens to be the DA. And she'll get over it, really. No problem. She'll just have a nice, short encounter with a mysterious Italian named Antonio who may or may not be involved with some kind of alleged criminal activity...blah blah... Let's call a spade a spade. He's a mobster. Let's face a few more facts. He's hot. He's smart. And if anyone breathes on her the wrong way, he's got no problem beating their head against a Porsche until they're willing to lick up their own vomit to make it stop. Just about everything about that turns her on. Yeah. There's something wrong with her.",
