  "description": "The many and mighty deities of Egypt must be given their due. All commerce is conducted under the watchful eyes of the functionaries of the great Queen Maatkare Hatshepsut. Death faces any and all who could rob the royal hose of Kemet of its rightful share. Lieutenant Bak, commander of the Medjay police, willingly accepts his assignment to search all Nile River traffic for contraband -- for rumors are rife of valuable elephant tusks passing unlawfully from the south to the north. But greed has spawned death, hideous and unexpected, and someone who would become rich illegally is dealing in far more than precious ivory. Whoever threatens to expose a lethal cache of secrets will not live to see a new dawn -- and loyal Bak could be the next, as he heads relentlessly toward a grim confrontation, a shocking revelation, and very possible doom in the realm of the dead.",
