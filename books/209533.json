But at least our partners for these detestable evenings were more or less… human!Now Kim Harrison, Lynsay Sands, Kelley Armstrong, and Lori Handeland—four of the very best writers currently exploring the dangerous seduction of the supernatural—offer up dating disasters (and unexpected delights) of a completely different sort: dark, wicked, paranormally sensual assignations with werewolves, demon lovers, and the romantically challenged undead.
