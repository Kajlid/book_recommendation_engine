  "description": "Lieutenant Clancy of New York City's 52nd Precinct faces one of the toughest assignments of his career: Johnny Rossi, gangster and racketeer, has welched on the rest of his West COast mob and is to testify before the State Crime Commission. It is Lieutenant Clancy's job to see that he stays alive to do it. It may not sound too difficult when you have two loyal detectives like Sergeants Kaproski and Stanton to help you keep a round-the-clock watch on the hoodlum, but it proves almost beyond them.Part of the \"NFT/BFI Film Classics\" series, this novel was made into a film starring Steve McQueen, featuring one of the most memorable car chase scenes in film, through the streets of San Francisco.",
