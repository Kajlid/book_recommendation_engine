  "description": "I want her. She wants me. If only she didn't care what everyone else thought about our love... Claire and Allison were old friends who hadn't spoken in five years. They drifted apart in high school, and Claire coming out of the closet and scandalizing their small town didn't help.Then the night happened. The two former friends came together at a beach party the summer before shipping off to college for one incredible forbidden encounter. It was a night that fulfilled one of Claire's deepest secret fantasies even as it terrified Allison as she was forced to confront scary questions about her sexuality. Needless to say, the night didn't end well. Fast forward five years. Claire is happy, out, and living it up in the city. Allison is stuck in a passionless relationship with a guy who annoys her more than he excites her. And it's time for their five year reunion. A reunion where they'll see each other for the first time since that fateful night on the beach when everything fell apart. They'll be forced to confront the ghosts of their shared past as Claire comes to terms with her lingering resentment even as Allison tries to answer lingering questions about her sexuality and discover who she truly is. The past and present are on a collision course as two old friends turned one-time lovers come together in a whirlwind weekend to discover whether or not there truly are second chances in life and love!",
