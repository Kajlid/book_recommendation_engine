  "description": "Evil is found when evil is sought.For when those in authority neglect to reprove sin, then very often the good are punished with the wicked.” - Heinrick Kramer, 1486, The Malleus MaleficarumFor yielding to the proud tears of an accused witch, The Watchman’s soul may have been blackened by evil. To prove himself unmarked, his body free of the witch’s branding, he must stand naked before all and submit to the governor’s thorough and shameful examination.Though Giles Scott would resist the governor’s practiced and patient touch, only complete abandon might prove his innocence. And since the witch cannot feel, only Giles’ arousal can spare his neck from the noose. And so, he surrenders.Yet screams from another chamber – perhaps pained, perhaps pleasured – awaken memories from Giles’ dark, torturous past, and the governor’s touch no longer teases but but stings...much like the punishing bite of a whip against the flesh of THE WATCHMAN",
