  "description": "Alternate cover edition - ISBN 1484058577, ISBN13 9781484058572.The Earth Girl and Queen Eliza is about the first generation of adults, now in their twenties, who grew up on humanity’s first space colony. Adeena Frias is the 19 year-old “Earth Girl” who meets and befriends a group of them, and then the characters act out the answer to this question: how would the residents of a space colony react to the sudden death of their Mother Earth? Fundamentalist religions gain power; there is panic and denial amidst strangely ordinary days, and the characters form loyal, desperate bonds.This is also a story with moments of lightness and humor. Soon a gentle alien queen offers to share her planet with the human refugees, a decision that causes adventure, mayhem, and disaster. In the end, Adeena gains great insight into her life and her place in the natural world.The Earth Girl and Queen Eliza is an odd but entertaining combination of science fiction, dystopia, women’s literature, new adult, and comedy.",
