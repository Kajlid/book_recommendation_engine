  "title": "The Prince Who Never Smiled",
  "description": "What could a humble peasant offer a lofty, but dour, crown prince? Many years ago, in a kingdom far away, there lived a young prince. This prince was very handsome, and everybody in the kingdom loved him. His father, the king, doted on the young man, and did everything he could to make the boy happy. His mother, the queen, adored her prince, and devised new and special gifts for him every day. The subjects of the kingdom brought offerings to the prince, and served at his pleasure, without a single complaint. The prince, being a good man, responded in kind and treated everybody fairly and with respect. But, much to his father's confusion and his motherâ€™s disappointment, there was one thing the prince never did... He never smiled. Finally, unable to tolerate his son's dour expression any longer, the king sent out a decree. He dispatched messengers to every corner of his country, and runners to all the neighboring kingdoms. The first person to make his hard-faced child smile would earn the right to marry him. Unfortunately for the king, things did not go as planned...  Gay / Fantasy / Fairy Tale",
