  "description": "Life has taught me that I can't trust anyone. Not friends, not family. In the worst, darkest moments, no one can be counted on to have your back. Even a billion miles away from Earth, on a remote icy planet, I still feel alone. The only consolation? I haven't resonated. It's not that I don't want love or children. I just can't trust anyone, even myself.But then one day, my khui resonates, and it's to the last guy I ever expected. In fact, I resonate so hard that my chest is singing its mating song before his does. That never happens.So what does a calm, rational, grown woman do when life turns upside down?She runs for the hills, of course.I should have known he'd follow me.",
