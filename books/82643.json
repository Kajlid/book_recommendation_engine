Not only is this corruption seen in Jack’s art, but also in his life and love. Seducing Abby made Jack a prime target. It isn’t enough to ruin Jack’s career—these activists want to end his life. Everything hinges on Abby and she’ll do anything to protect the man she loves.~Please read the first novel SCANDALOUS before reading this book.~",
