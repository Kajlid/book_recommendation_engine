  "description": "When, in the morning, daybreak awakens us from a dream, we close our eyes and remain still, trying to recreate and continue the scene. But the day's light has destroyed everything: words are without sound, gestures without meaning. It is like a vanishing rainbow: some hues survive for an instant, disappear, seem to return: there is nothing left.Commentary is a narrative--hovering between the genres of memoir, theory, and fiction--about a female artist whose abandonment by a lover precipitates a refiguration of her ideas on life, love and art. Sauvageot died of tuberculosis, after many stints in sanatoriums, at the age of 34. Commentaire was highly praised in its time by Paul Claudel, Paul Valery, Andre Gide, Charles Du Bos, Rene Crevel and Clara Malraux.This edition is co-translated by Christine Schwartz Hartley (African Psycho) and Anna Moschovakis (The Jokers, The Possession).",
