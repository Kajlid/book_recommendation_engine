  "title": "The Ghastling: Book Fifteen",
  "description": "The eight writers featured in this fifteenth issue of The Ghastling each find strangeness in the familiar, uncovering the macabre in the usually-ordinary territories of home, work, family and community. And, as some of these stories show, even the very intimate space of our own body can betray us. Includes stories from Barry Charman, Pamela Koehne-Drube, Laura Lee Lucas, Elin Olausson, Steven Sheil, David Towsey, Astrid Vallet and Maud Woolf.",
