His first audiobook, 'Confession' was described as 'the highlight of its box set', 'Twilight-zone-ish' in tone and 'neatly twisted'.The follow up, 'Behind Closed Doors' was described as 'easily the strongest tale of its set... a really unsettling piece to listen to... a story that deserves the time devoted to it and needs to be heard.'He's also written audiobooks for Doctor Who. A Small Semblance of Home is \"sublime. Everything about it oozes a must-listen feel. The script from Paul Phipps is beautiful, a true love letter to the early days of the show. His handle on the characters is excellent, he paints a truly vivid picture with his use of words.\"Paul lives in London with his husband, two cats and far too much Lego. The Breath of Ages is his first novel, but not his last.",
