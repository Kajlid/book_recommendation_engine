Shabanu and hersister are to marry brothers as soon as they all come of age. But she willeventually lose her betrothed and be promised to a wealthy landowner to settlea feud. The richness and tragedy of a whole culture are reflected in the fateof this girl's family. Through an involving plot Staples has given readersinsight into lives totally different from their own, but into emotionsresoundingly familiar.--(starred) Bulletin, Center for Children's Books.",
