  "title": "Tasha Tudor's Dollhouse : A Lifetime in Miniature",
  "description": "In 1996 Tasha Tudor's magnificent dollhouse collection came to the attention of the curators at Colonial Williamsburg. Awed by Tasha's craftsmanship, they offered to build her a new, larger dollhouse. In Tasha Tudor's Dollhouse, this extraordinary house, complete with goat barn and greenhouse, is presented in full detail. It is a one-quarter-human-scale version of Tasha's own early-nineteenth-century-style Vermont home, Corgi Cottage, in which she exhibits astonishing works of miniaturist art, from musical instruments and Shaker boxes to tiny printed books and cakes and cookies that look good enough to eat. There is antique, museum-quality furniture, a gilded birdcage, and even a working stove. Captain Thaddeus Crane and his wife, Emma Birdwhistle, Tasha's handmade dolls, guide us on a tour that culminates in a joyous Christmas celebration in candlelit rooms and with a decorated tree.",
