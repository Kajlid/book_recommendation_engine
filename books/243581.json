  "title": "The Quadrants",
  "description": "When sixteen-year-old Rohan Fraser realizes he's becoming unnaturally strong, he tries to hide what's happening to him. He's soon told of a magical underworld of people called the Quadrants—a world Rohan was born to but never knew. Believing Rohan to be the lost boy from the stories—one in possession of great power— the Quadrants have come for him. Is it mistaken identity, or does he really possess powers the entire underworld would kill for? Through portals and remote wilderness, and the breathtaking cities of the Quadrants, Rohan and his friends attempt to outsmart their pursuers to stay alive. Rohan wants nothing more than to return home, but until he can prove he is not the one they seek, home remains a long way off.",
