  "description": "[Alternate cover edition for ASIN: B01CV11842]Jocelyn Belle is a shy and reclusive - yet very kinky - introvert whose only outlets for exploring her wild taboos are through her successful writing career, and the online kink community, where her anonymity gives her the confidence to be her kinky self. Yet, in the real world, people turn her into a bumbling, stuttering hot mess. Jocelyn has a very difficult time speaking face to face - especially with guys she’s interested in - so she satisfies her naughty physical urges via clandestine cyber trysts, chatting online with interesting men she’ll never meet in the flesh, from all across the globe.Suffering from severe social anxiety and depression, Jocelyn gets fed up with her situation and makes a life altering decision, courageously hopping way outside of her comfort zone, and the sheltering confines of her self-imposed prison - her home - to take a part time job, dancing on stage, at Hardwood's Burlesque.Jocelyn’s amazing journey places her straight in the path of the burlesque’s marvelously meddlesome owner, Mimi, who introduces her to Ryan Mastersen. Ryan is the financial backer for the burlesque, a fan of her writing, and - bar none - the most magically delicious man she's ever set eyes upon. Their chemistry is instantaneous and undeniable.Will Jizzie finally get to explore her deepest fantasies in the flesh?",
