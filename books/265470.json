  "description": "The First Biographical Portrait Ever of This Key Political FigureWritten by a leading journalist and filled with more than 100 color photographs, this authoritative and up-to-the-moment new biography provides much-needed perspective on one of the most important figures on the national political stage.An lively overview of Obama’s life, this timely book begins with his difficult childhood as the son of a Kansas-born college student and a black Kenyan who abandoned the family, moving through his election to president of the Harvard Law Review (the first black student ever), his early political career (including his loss of a congressional race in 2000), his own family life with wife Michelle and two daughters, his 2004 election to U.S. Senator, and his emergence as a symbol of hope for America. Including his own words and comments from both his critics and supporters, Hopes and Dreams is essential reading for all those interested in the man who is being talked about as a candidate for our highest office.No political figure in recent memory has generated the interest that Obama has, and many compare his appeal to that of a rock star. Only forty-five years old, Barack Obama is certain to play an important role in America’s future. Here is his inspiring story to date, in words and revealing images.",
