  "description": "Mallory McGill has no idea how she got to Coney Island Creek. The last thing she remembers is traveling to the hospital to deliver her baby. Now her baby is missing, and she is being accused of committing an unspeakable crime.For Teri Cardello, a tough detective who has no tolerance for anyone involved in crimes against children, McGill is guilty, and there's no doubt in her mind. But her partner Sam Rothman, who once let an innocent man go to his death, refuses to be so easily convinced. \"Either that girl is the worst liar in the world, or everyone else is lying and she's telling the truth,\" he says.Mallory knows she prepared a room for her baby, but the room is empty now. She knows she saw the doctor, but he says she never showed up for her appointment. She knows a car picked her up, but her car was found at the creek, with only her fingerprints on it. And there was blood all over her hands.Why can't she remember that fateful night? Could she have killed her baby, or is someone trying to frame her? What other mysteries lurk on the seedier side of Coney Island?Someone knows the answers to these questions, and will stop at nothing -- including murder -- to prevent Mallory from learning the truth.",
