Divested of hope, she’s all but given up when a handsome stranger arrives in town. Desperate for the marshal to ride on out of Pendleton, Marnie fears he’ll rekindle the embers of her broken dreams into a roaring flame before he leaves.Married to his career, US Marshal Lars Thorsen avoids relationships of any kind. Spending his days transporting prisoners, guarding political figures, and chasing down fugitives, he doesn’t have room in his life for feelings or emotions. Especially not the tender, protective feelings stirred by the woman who wants him or the two orphans who need him.",
