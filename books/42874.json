  "description": "On a chill October night, a girl goes missing and sets the small town of Oakridge on edge. Five years later, James is trying to settle himself in a new house and reacquaint himself with a town he’d thought he’d left behind. When girls around town start to go missing again and James begins to suspect his friend might be behind the disappearances, he not only has a difficult decision to make, but he quickly finds himself facing the wrong side of the law as the town fingers him as the most likely suspect. James must dig for the truth before it’s too late.",
