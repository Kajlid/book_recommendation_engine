  "description": "In 1950s London, a career girl decides it’s high time she snared herself a husband, in Margery Sharp’s high-spirited New York Times–bestselling novel Professional dog photographer Louisa Datchett is indiscriminately fond of men. And men take shocking advantage of her good nature when they need their problems listened to, their socks washed, their prescriptions filled, and employment found. But by the age of thirty, Louisa is tired of constantly being dispatched to the scene of some masculine disaster. It’s all well and good to be an independent woman—and certainly better than being a “timid Victorian wife”)—but the time has come for her to marry, and marry well. With admirable discipline and the dedication she displays in any endeavor involving men, Louisa sets out on her romantic quest.   This vastly entertaining chronicle of the life of a single woman who is both of her time and ahead of it is Margery Sharp at her witty, satirical best.",
