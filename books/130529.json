  "description": "Starr Destined​ Does running away ever really solve anything? Well, it's the best solution Seraphina Jones can come up with, to erase Liam Starr from her life, and deal with her shattered heart after his betrayal. But will Liam let her go that easily? Initially caught off guard when his murky past comes back to haunt him, Liam fights to take back control of his life. Trying to regain Seraphina's trust becomes increasingly complicated when someone with a score to settle keeps raising the stakes, and winning back Seraphina turns out to be the least of Liam’s problems. Starr Destined can be read alone, but recommended that STARR Fated is read first. Suitable for readers 18+ due to language and sexual content.",
