  "title": "Atheism is False: Richard Dawkins And The Improbability Of God Delusion",
  "description": "David Reuben Stone presents a modern defense of the existence of God. Two new arguments are The Argument From The Laws Of Physics, and the Fine-Tuning Argument. The atheism of Richard Dawkins is refuted in great detail, as well as writings of the following atheistic Quentin Smith, Michael Martin, William Rowe, Victor Stenger, Theodore Drange, J.L. Schellenberg, Nicholas Everitt, Michael Ikeda, Bill Jefferys, Theodore Schick Jr., Wesley C. Salmon, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, Victor Cosculluela, Thomas Metcalf, and Bruce and Frances Martin. The defenses of atheism by these leading thinkers now stand thoroughly critiqued and in need of substantial revision. A must read for anyone interested in the existence of God. The defense of Hugh Rossâ€™s fine-tuning arguments against objections raised by Ikeda and Jefferys is, alone, worth the price of this book! David Reuben Stone is president and founder of Atheism Is False www.atheismisfalse.com",
