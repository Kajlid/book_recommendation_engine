  "description": "Sterling Golden—Cocky football star. Rich Playboy with a secret. Guy I’d most like to throat-punch. The cherry on top? I’m stuck pretending to be this d-bag’s girl for the next few months.When I spotted him sneaking out the Dean’s window—a woman whose reputation precedes her—I could’ve minded my business. But it’s not every day you catch your nemesis in such a compromising position, so I did what any self-respecting person would’ve done.I added fuel to the scandal that ignited, then laughed while the cops hauled him off in nothing but handcuffs and his boxers.Of course, the arrogant prick found a way to rope me into the lie that got him out of trouble. Which means the only way I come out of this unscathed is to go along with it, pretend we’re a thing.Most girls would kill to be on the arm of a Golden triplet, but I’m counting down the days until it’s over. In public, we give the city the show they crave—a chance to witness their local bad boy falling in love. But when we’re alone, the gloves come off and we give each other hell.Only, who knew exchanging insults and cruelty could feel a bit like… foreplay?There’s an expiration date on this arrangement, but as we turn up the heat to convince our city this “relationship” is the real deal, Sterling and I sometimes forget that it isn’t. He might think his recent fall from grace was a disaster, but if he makes me regret this, I swear I’ll make his life a living hell.Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice… your belongings might mysteriously catch fire.Consider this your final warning, Mr. Silver, because it’s the only one you’ll get.",
