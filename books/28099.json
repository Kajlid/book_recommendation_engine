What starts out sounding like a bad joke turns into a nightmare when Jo Champlain finds herself quarantined in a bar with three sexy strangers just days before her sixth full moon as a were-cougar. On the run from the man who infected her, she never imagined she would end up stuck in the small town of Jericho Falls with nothing to fill her time except being seduced by three younger men. She tries to keep the truth about how she ended up there from the men but with the full moon upon them, Jo soon realizes that she isn't the only one who's been keeping secrets.",
