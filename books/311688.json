  "description": "Preeti Patel only has room in her life for family, friends, and her career as a doctor. So when her ex-boyfriend -- and man she never forgot -- turns up as her new roommate, she's determined to go about her life as if he's not even there. But he's impossible to avoid in the one-bedroom apartment, and the proximity has Preeti remembering all the ways she and Daniel were a perfect fit. But her family doesn't approve of him, and for a woman who's always done what her family has asked, choosing love -- again -- will be the hardest choice she ever has to make.",
