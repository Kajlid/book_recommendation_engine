  "description": "Photographer Joshlyn Davis moves through her life drawing as little attention as possible. She longs for the simple life with few complications and the less people know her the better. The long buried secrets have taken a toll, but everything is just how she wants it, or so she thought. Graphic/Software designer Kellen Reynolds lives her days substantiating her work from home business and her nights burning up the pavement at the local amateur race track. There really hadnâ€™t been much thought of a private life until a chance meeting with Joshlyn Davis. Almost immediately Kellen and Joshlyn find a connection and begin to slowly explore a relationship. Will the relationship have time to develop or will something dark and sinister put an end to it?",
