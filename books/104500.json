  "description": "America was in the throes of a malignancy. Unemployment made up a quarter of the population, and a merciless group of private businessmen, called corporatists, had a death grip over the American government. Programs to help the poor and unemployed were consolidated into a single program, designed to end social services for those who needed them the most. The American dream of a steady job, house, good schools, and few worries, was replaced by the dream of getting rich.Such was the situation for the Piper family; a family consumed with the need to be rich and successful. Redd Piper would be the one to really make it; and make it he did. Steered forward with an insatiable desire to succeed, he created a business model based on the old concept of cooperatives. Promised by a job for life, with unlimited earnings, the poor, the hungry, the vagrants around the country, and the unemployed made a pilgrimage to Redd Piperâ€™s cooperatives, equipped only with their broken dreams. So successful were they that they shook the very foundation of the corporatist society that helped him thrive.Now, those same corporatists turned on Redd Piper with a vengeance. They wanted him dead and his idea of cooperative enterprises, destroyed. A titanic struggle ensued, and its outcome would determine the future of America itself.",
