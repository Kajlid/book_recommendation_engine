  "description": "Sophie Shah thinks dating an American movie star is a terrible idea. For a start, she’s got her hands full with her baby son, volunteering at the local LGBTQ youth center and her new business venture. And she’s just not that interested in red carpets, fancy parties and private jets. Anyway, there’s no way the man recently voted the “sexiest man alive” would be interested in a single mom who lives with her parents… right?Publicly humiliated, movie star Chris Trent has fled to London to film a period drama. Focused on redeeming his reputation and improving his (questionable) British accent, a new relationship is the last thing on his mind. And Chris doesn’t pack light—he brings all his baggage with him.Sophie’s and Chris’s worlds couldn’t be more different, but as their relationship unfolds they begin to think that maybe, just maybe, they could have a future together. But some baggage is hard to offload.",
