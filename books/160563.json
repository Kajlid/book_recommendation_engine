  "description": "EXECUTIVE TOY (#1) is an erotic BDSM menage romance of 18,000 words. Contains multiple partners and BDSM elements in office settings.  To stay alive, Lindsay has always relied on her looks and her wits. It’s not always enough, and underneath her carefully polished exterior is a desperate woman who will do anything to survive.  When she’s called to account for her misuse of the company credit card, she hopes to flirt her way out of trouble. Instead she finds herself faced with a gorgeous stranger who is immune to her manipulation, and she’s shocked by the punishment he deals out. No one in the office can tell her who the stranger is, and when she encounters him again weeks later, things take another unexpected turn… times three. Three handsome, rich businessmen. In their arms, she almost feels safe. But she knows the truth: safe is an illusion, and staying alive is all that matters.  This BDSM romance contains explicit sexual content and graphic language that may be objectionable to some readers. Includes sexual dominance and submission, spanking, multiple partner, menage, and many other delights. For adults only.",
