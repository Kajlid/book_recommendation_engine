  "description": "Leprechauns don't exist. At least that's what Hugh and Oliver believe. On their most recent geocaching excursion, Hugh insists they chase after the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, not believing that they will find anything. They cannot believe what they find. Not only do they find the pot of gold, but they meet Aine, who is on a quest to prove herself worthy of the leprechaun name. Hugh and Oliver are in for the ride of their lives. Steeped in myths and legends that they didn't even believe could be true.",
