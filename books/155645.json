  "description": "Megan James had never met anyone quite like Officer Brice O'Reilly. He was gorgeous, nice, and a hero to her son, Jacob, but she knew that she wasn't the right woman for him--or was she? He was single, never married or in a long term relationship, and she was a mother of one fatherless boy, and lost the love of her life to the war in Afghanistan. Could one field trip to the local Police station bring these two unlikely people together? OR will it take a special wish to Santa this Christmas to make their happily ever after finally come true?",
