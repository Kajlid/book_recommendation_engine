  "description": "Bitchy drama queens, hot boys, strict teachers, social outcasts… the normal high school experience.  Or it would be, if my classmates weren’t werewolves.  Everyone attending Lupine Hollow Academy, one of the most prestigious private schools in Connecticut, is a werewolf. Everyone, that is, except for me. I’m human—pathetically, weakly, ordinarily human.  After my mother’s death, the Alpha of Lupine Hollow welcomes me into his pack in order to keep me safe. However, safety isn’t the first thing on the minds of the students—or teachers—who make up the pack. They’re far more worried about how I would taste or how I’d look smeared across a wall.  Despite the drama, the hazing, the ridiculously hard classes, and the pain, I have to make my mark here—I will make my mother proud, no matter the cost. If I manage not to become the next meal, that is.  With the Flower Moon Rising, I’ll be faced with challenges I never could have imagined as my fantasy world is brought to life. Will its glow be my demise, or a chance at a future more incredible than I ever could have dreamed?   ***This novel is a full-length paranormal reverse harem/poly-amorous/mature high school romance novel. This book contains foul language and sexual scenarios.  *This is a full-length novel, expanded from the previous anthology piece included in Magic and Mayhem anthology.",
