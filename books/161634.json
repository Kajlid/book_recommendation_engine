He started Apple Computer in his parents’ garage and eventually became the tastemaker of a generation, creating products we can’t live without. Through it all, he was an overbearing and demanding perfectionist, both impossible and inspiring. Capturing his unparalleled brilliance, as well as his many demons, Jessie Hartland’s engaging biography illuminates the meteoric successes, devastating setbacks, and myriad contradictions that make up the extraordinary life and legacy of the insanely great Steve Jobs.Here's the perfect book for any teen interested in STEM topics, especially tech. A School Library Journal Best Book of the Year“If a picture is worth a thousand words, then this comic tale can hang with the sprawling biographies.” —Macworld.com “An accessible take . . . undoubtedly valuable for kids who are growing up using Apple’s products but knowing little about the man who created them.” —GeekDad.com",
