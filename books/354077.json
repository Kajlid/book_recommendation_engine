  "description": "Society darling Emma Cartwright never forgot the steamy college days she spent with Jason Roberts, a hunk from the wrong side of the tracks who never fit in with her crowd. It didn’t work out between them then, but when Emma sees now-big time chef Jason at their college reunion, she can’t help but stir up a little trouble.The last time Jason saw Emma Holden, she crushed his heart. As college students, they were opposites in every way except for their thrilling, unpredictable passion. But deep down Emma was very proper, and in their senior year she blindsided Jason by dumping him for a wealthy jock and a dull, safe life. Now it's ten years later, and if living well is the best revenge, Jason has done so in spades—he's a hunky celebrity chef with a hit TV show and all the women he wants. But he's interested in only one woman—Emma. And at their college reunion, he cooks up a wicked payback for her teasing her with desperate desire, taunting her with the best sex of her life, just to see her fall. Yet Emma has an agenda of her own, and teasing and temptation are just what she's hungry for. The \"good girl\" is now a daring, sensual woman eager to raise the sexual stakes, and she's hot for the most wildly erotic adventures he can dish out. Now who's turning the tables on whom?",
