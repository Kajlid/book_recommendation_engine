  "title": "Justice for All: Earl Warren and the Nation He Made",
  "description": "In Justice for All, Jim Newton, an award-winning journalist for the Los Angeles Times, brings readers the first truly comprehensive consideration of Earl Warren, the politician-turned- Chief Justice who refashioned the place of the Supreme Court in American life through cases whose names have entered the common parlance-Brown v. Board of Education, Griswold v. Connecticut, Miranda v. Arizona. Drawing on unmatched access to government, academic, and private documents pertaining to Warren's life and career, Newton illuminates both the public and the private Warren. The result is a monumental biography of a complicated and principled figure that will become a seminal work of twentieth-century American history.",
