  "description": "Anna doesn’t know how to go on. Anna Goodman’s mother is dead, her father has given up on life, and her brother, Brent, is missing in action in World War II. Even though she has a full-time war job, she feels she must keep the family farm going so that Brent will have something to come home to. She won’t let herself think that he might never return. Any dreams Anna has for her future are held captive by the responsibilities the war and life have thrust upon her. If only Anna didn’t have to rely on help from German prisonersor from Specialist Sid Chance, the cocky know-it-all who oversees the prisoners’ work. In her heart, she knows she can’t do everything demanded of her, but whom can she trust to carry the burden with her?",
