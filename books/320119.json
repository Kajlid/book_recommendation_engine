  "description": "Slinging coffee is never boring. When a new customer catches my eye, I do what comes natural and flirt with him. To my delight, Martin flirts back. He soon becomes the perfect distraction from my gaming group pressuring me into DMing our next D&D campaign. Then I overhear Martin designing his dream dungeon, and I just know he’s everything I’m looking for in a man. What could be better than a hot summer fling with my very own personal DM? There’s just one problem, I should maybe have checked which type of Dungeon Master Martin meant when I asked him to take me on an adventure. Dungeon Master is a kinky M/M romance with some BDSM elements including: sounding, impact play, and roleplay. It’s a spinoff from Table Topped, but it stands alone. Tags: Low angst, fluff, Bob wants a protector, Bob can rescue himself, flirty barista, meeting at the coffee shop, What type of dungeon master are you? This is what kind of club? Going on an adventure, Martin is full of surprises.",
