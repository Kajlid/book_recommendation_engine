  "description": "How many people close to you have to die before you realize something is just not right?Sammiroh is facing this very predicament with the mysterious death of his sister, Sally. But unlike the death of his parents before, Sally's death brings with it a darkness that follows him like a shadow. Sammiroh knows he's marked for death but by what or whom? All he can say for sure is that his pursuer deals heavily in magic and witchcraft, a thing he had been taught belonged in myth and storybooks. Sammiroh's turmoil seems to spill over into the community of Hargreave Hollow as the Sun blackens, and his friends are pulled into the chaos, including his best friend's girlfriend with whom he shares a curious, but forbidden bond. An enthralling journey ensues as Sam and his friends are pushed deeper and deeper down a path of no returnâ€” ever closer to a fantastic truth.",
