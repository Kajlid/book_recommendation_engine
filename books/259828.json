  "description": "In this dramatic debut novel by Christine Gordon love isn't always the answer.   Scarlett lives her life the same way she climbs. Alone and untethered. In the climbing world, she’s known as a free solo climber. In her world, she’s a climber who never falls. Until she falls in love...Scarlett St James has just graduated from college and is ready to head off to the mountains for a summer of rock climbing with her best friend, Libby. But things don’t turn out as planned and Scarlett soon finds herself pursuing more than the perfect rock face. On a dare, Scarlett meets Jack and begins a journey much more dangerous than climbing free solo.  Free Solo is a full-length new adult romance novel, can be read as a stand-alone, and is the first book by Christine Gordon. Recommended for 18+ due to hot and steamy scenes.",
