Unaware that he is being watched as he throws what he is convinced is her lifeless body into Rainbow Lake, he contents himself with the knowledge that she is no longer a threat to him. His interest turns to locating his children -- one to groom as an heir, one to eliminate as an embarrassment. The three who witnessed Sterlingâ€™s murderous rage have different plans. Two of the three, trained navy SEALS, rescue Andi then will stop at nothing to help her achieve all that she set out to accomplish.",
