  "description": "I didn’t suddenly wake up one morning and realize that I was an alcoholic, that’s not the way it works. Slowly, through the fog of denial and the overwhelming craving to drink, it dawned on my muddled mind that something was not right. Alcohol doesn’t care who it gets, and when it’s got you, it wants to kill you. I very nearly became just another statistic, another bloated, yellow corpse in the morgue. Along the way through this horrific journey, something happened to me that completely changed my life. I had an encounter that, in an instant, completely removed all my cravings and set me on a path of sobriety and freedom. It gave me a joy in living that I had never known before. If you have a problem with alcohol or drugs, take a little time to read this. It just might change your life too.",
