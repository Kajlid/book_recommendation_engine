  "description": "Four mythical treasures with unimaginable power. One woman with the ability to use them. Two groups locked in an ancient battle to secure them. A love that cannot be denied. Avery Conner goes to Ireland seeking answers from her dying mother, but destiny has other plans. With an ancient prophecy hanging in the balance, she is plunged into a battle between the Faerie Court and the New World Foundation for Celtic Studies for control of the Four Treasures— the Stone of Destiny, the Sword, the Spear, and the Caldron. Kalen, a Faerie Prince, must deliver Avery Conner to the Faerie Court at any cost. Haunted by past mistakes, Avery is a complication he doesn’t need — but after sharing one forbidden kiss, he can’t deny their otherworldly connection. Torn between the known and unknown, Avery must decide whom to trust: the Foundation, or Kalen, who is as jaded as he is irresistible.",
