  "description": "A worldwide earthquake. A planet in chaos. Reality's fabric - space, time, matter - unraveling. Into this, a man without a past awakens. A catastrophic earthquake has struck the entire world. As the survivors stagger toward an impossible recovery, they discover matters are worse than they realized. It appears the fabric of reality is fraying at the seams. The laws of space, time, and matter are breaking down. Some people adapt; some don't. Some fall prey to newly existent fates worse than death. Whether or not the world can survive such flux is anyone's guess. A man loses his memory. A father loses his boy. A woman loses everything and is on the verge of losing her mind. As civilization spirals out of control, three strangers find themselves transforming as drastically as their environment. When their paths intersect, they discover answers to their respective mysteries that could only exist in the world as it is becoming. A work of metaphysical fiction, Free Will Flux is an epic saga and a spiritual parable. A legal psychedelic. A love story. And it's a glimpse of where we might be headed...if we aren't already there.",
