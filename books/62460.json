  "title": "Last Suppers: Famous Final Meals from Death Row",
  "description": "A murderer from Texas ordered twenty-four tacos for his last meal---and that was just the appetizer! A Maryland man wanted nothing but a cup of coffee prior to his lethal injection, while a killer from Oklahoma requested SpaghettiOs and was enraged when he didn't get them! Does a condemned man's last meal somehow shed light on his inner psyche? Like a mystic reading tea leaves, do we hope to discover the reasoning behind a mad killer's crimes by examining the gravy smears on his plate? Regardless of the reasons, the last meals of executed criminals have long provided food for thought, and Last Famous Final Meals from Death Row adds an unusual---and sometimes comical---twist to the controversial capital punishment debate.",
