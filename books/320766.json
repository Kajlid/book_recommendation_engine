  "description": "After nearly dying at the vengeful hands of a Constabulary agent, Marcus Brenner was rescued and cared for by a rogue agent; a teen fugitive; and Lee Vaughn, the woman Marcus has loved for a decade. Still together, these four are now refugees in a newly established nation that has pledged freedom to all citizens, including former resistance fighters like Marcus.His one desire to live in peace and privacy, Marcus works to secure a home for himself and Lee. Meanwhile Lee offers her nursing and cooking skills to those in need even as she struggles with her new faith, with believing she can belong in the church. But all these things are threatened by the news the Constabulary has sent agents into the country undercover. Legal jurisdiction or not, they won't relinquish their worst offenders. And Marcus isn't the only assigned target.Stopping the Constabulary hunters, keeping himself and others safe, might require sacrificing the peace Marcus longs for. He's not sure he has anything more to give. But one thing Marcus and Lee have learned in recent months: they never see coming the ways God chooses to use them.",
