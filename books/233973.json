  "description": "In a long forgotten time a terrible war raged, entire countries were razed and even magic itself was decimated. According to myth the only survivors were Immortals, powerful sorcerers who achieved life everlasting. With the fall of the old world they scattered to the wild frontiers, or so the tale goes. Time marches on however and with magic barely an echo of its former self, technology presses on. The rising nation of The Syndicate is at the forefront making breakthrough after breakthrough in a handful of years. Establishing bases in the far flung frontier regions they have started a new endeavour of research into the ancient world, heedless of cost or consequence. As The Syndicate pushes deeper into the wilderness spurred on by ambition, mysterious deaths follow. Is this just the dangers of the wild, the resistance of the local tribes, or something else awoken by this intrusion?",
