  "description": "WHERE LOYALTIES LIE Justina Wheelock The ride of his life... Stable owner Dr. Grant Gravier had no idea when Cassandra \"Casey\" Barrow came to Gravier Farms how much his life would change. On the first night Grant met Casey, he knew his self-imposed vow of celibacy was in deep trouble. Grant found in Casey all the things he wanted in a life partner... plus. The plus included her spontaneity which he could not schedule into his ever present BlackBerry. Brakes on.... The very tall, extremely handsome and deliciously dark Grant Gravier liked to play a little too close to the fire for Casey Barrow's comfort. The choice to remain celibate was his, and not hers. Grant was a skilled lover and he pushed Casey to the edge with his unintentional teasing. He kept his hand on the proverbial brake and the pads of her patience had worn thin. Moving toward a new level... Johnathan Gravier, Casey's boss, discovered that her attention was captured by Grant. Seeing Casey and Grant together forced feelings Johnathan carried to surface; however, she wanted nothing more than their platonic friendship. Johnathan could not accept Casey's involvement with any man, especially his childhood rival. He forced Casey to decide where her loyalties would lie.",
