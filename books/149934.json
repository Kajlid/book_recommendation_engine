  "title": "The Adventures of Erasmus Twiddle: Grmkville's Famous & Talented Not-Detective",
  "description": "Erasmus Twiddle knows that anyone can be a detective if they send four bottle caps, three proof-of-purchase seals from their favorite cereal, two AA batteries, and one rattlesnake skin to P.O. Box 12345. But being a not-detective is far more complex. Just ask Erasmus Twiddle. When things are not only missing but also, well, very out of sorts, it's time for Grmkville's famous and talented not-detective to spring into action. Whether it's investigating a rubber chicken factory, unpuzzling a puzzled baboon, or figuring out how a lonely rabbit-hippo can make a few friends, it's most assuredly the not-detective who solves the mystery. Or the not-mystery, for that matter. So if you think your hojie or oogoo has been stolen, or a furious elf marches into town and kicks you in the shin, then this book is for you. And that's why our hero is Grmkville's famous and talented not-detective...and why all the un-famous and un-talented detectives live somewhere else.",
