  "title": "9/11 Was An Inside Job",
  "description": "Our Government and the Media have presented us with a wholly fictional story of the events of 9/11. In this book the main points have been looked at and presented in a bite-size way. If you're new to the idea that forces within the US could have planned and carried out the attacks, or even if you don't believe it and consider these ideas \"conspiracy theories\" then prepare to have your eyes opened to the truth. No airplane hit the Pentagon, no airplane crashed in Shanksville, and the Twin Towers were brought down in a controlled demolition. 9/11 was certainly a terrorist attack, but one committed by unsavoury characters within our own Government.",
