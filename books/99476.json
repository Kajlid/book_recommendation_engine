  "description": "If the meek can become deadly, the strongest can be weak. For Ethan Holloway, his mission to find a missing werewolf should be simple. Crack a few heads, bust a few chops and the solution always reveals itself. Always. Not this time. Ethan's reputation precedes him, and because it does, someone is ready. Waiting. Unbeknownst to Ethan, he's about to go down. Hard. Against a foe he never suspected and in a world he never imagined could be real. What awaits Ethan is a fight not only for his reputation, but also his pack, his female, and his life. If he survives, damage control will become priority number one. If he survives. Because even Ethan's not sure he's strong enough to take on an entire race all by himself. Especially one hell bent on exposing who and what he is in the name of sport.",
