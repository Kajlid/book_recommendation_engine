But the warlord is after a ransom, something to change the fate of his people. Ixiana is simply a means to an end--an annoying captive whose weakness frustrates him. When he starts teaching her to fight, it's painful for both of them--until their mutual anger and frustration ignites a new kind of fire. This adult romance has mild-to-medium heat and spice, with dark themes. TW: Doubtful consent (kissing, touching) and sexual threat, violence, mention of ra-pe, captor-captive romance, monsters, racial/social injustice and oppression.",
