  "description": "The harrowing first-person account of one child's ordeals inside the isolated commune of an ultra-fundamentalist religious cult.It is 1973. Sila Caprin's mother is recruited into \"Sam Fife's Move of God\"; within the year, Sila and her older siblings, Leis and Jeremy, along with all of the family’s belongings, are packed into the back of a U-Haul, leaving California for their new home in Massachusetts. Eventually they will be taken deep into the harsh Alaskan tundra, to live on a compound surrounded by miles of woods and monitored by armed men. With every detail of their lives minutely controlled by Sam Fife's violent teachings, Sila endures physical, mental and sexual abuse as she fights to maintain just a glimmer of her own humanity. Creative, intuitive and smart, young Sila vies for individuality in a culture where she is insignificant and unprotected — until the day her sister becomes a victim of an act so dreadful that its sadness becomes their savior.  Poignant, gripping and ultimately triumphant, Vennie Kocsis \"Cult Child\" will leave you inspired by the pure strength of will that children use to cope themselves through trauma.",
