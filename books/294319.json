  "description": "It's been a week without power. No phones. No computers. Nothing. Whatever shred of humanity is left in people is slowly dwindling away. Gangs are forming, people are starving, and the whole country is in a free-for-all. Accompanied by his neighbor, Nelson, Mike leaves Pittsburgh and heads to his family's cabin in Ohio. For Mike the only thing worse than not making it to the cabin is the fear of his family not being there when he does.",
