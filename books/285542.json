Tattooed. Sexy. A man currently at the center of a huge scandal.The goal? To convince him to stay in the States.But what’s wrong with a little fun in the meantime? No strings. No sweet nothings. Just a way to pass the time while we’re both struggling to prove our true selves to the world.If someone found out our relationship was anything more than professional, it would only serve to prove all our critics right.***I never should have agreed to take the fall.But I did and I’m a man of my word.Even if it means risking everything I’ve worked for.The only bright side is Lennox Kincade.Gorgeous. Defiant. Rumor-tainted. Totally off-limits.Sharing a house with the gorgeous sports agent should have been a fun distraction from the turmoil. Someone to help pass the time while the tensions back home die down.But what started as nothing, ends up as something I never saw coming.",
