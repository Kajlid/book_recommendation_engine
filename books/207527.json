  "title": "I Am Your Brother",
  "description": "Publication of I AM YOUR BROTHER is the literary event of the year for Weird fiction. A legendary lost novel, it has until now been virtually unavailable. Originally published in 1935, I AM YOUR BROTHER uses the façade of the traditional horror novel to take a deep dive into the human psyche. It is a monster novel, a locked attic novel, and a mad scientist novel, but it is propelled by a string of scenes that read more like a collection of Marx Brothers outtakes. Juggling humor, horror and dread, the plot gallops along at a delirious pace. At the heart of this fairy tale are a mother and her two sons. They are very poor and live together in London. It is the London between wars. One son is a musician and composer. His whole world revolves around the theater. He has written many unpublished songs, including a symphony called “Dream of London.” Self-absorbed and tormented, Julian has no inkling that he has a brother. He’s lived his entire life thinking himself an only child. This delusion is prolonged because his mother, a rather distant and distracted figure in his life, keeps his brother locked in the attic. The Brother can never see the light of day because he is strikingly hideous, inhuman—a guilty secret the mother must keep hidden from the world. As discombobulated as the plot is, as crazy as the characters are, I AM YOUR BROTHER is an enchanting read. It’s magical and mysterious and is rich in haunting imagery that just knocks you to the floor when you encounter it. It’s after one of these poetic jolts that you who is this Marlowe? Introduction by Jonathan Eeds. Newly edited and fully illustrated to enhance the reading experience.",
