  "description": "The bedroom door flew open with a powerful crash. “What the...?” Mary exclaimed. Mike nodded. “Yeah, well see, that’s the problem,” he said with a sigh. “You brought someone home with you tonight.” “What?” “And it looks like she’s not real happy about your relationship with Bradley,” he said. “I have a jealous ghost in my house?” Mary asked, astonished. Mike shook his head apologetically. “No, sweetheart,” he said. “You have a jealous poltergeist in your home.” As if on cue, the drawers in Mary’s dresser opened, and her clothing started flying across the room. Mary turned back to Mike. “Really?” she asked. “Like I need this now?” She walked into the center of her bedroom and immediately was hit in the face by a pair of her own underwear. And this time she was sure of it. She heard a giggle, and then suddenly the entire room was filling with swirling clothing. Bradley came running into the room and the ruckus ended. “What happened?” he asked. “I think I just met one of your former girlfriends,” Mary said, pulling a pair of underwear from out of her neckline. “And I don’t think she was very happy to meet me.”",
