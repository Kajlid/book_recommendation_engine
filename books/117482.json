  "description": "K-Rho: The Sweet Taste of Sisterhood chronicles the strength of sorority life for three Copper Road University sophomores. Track star Kiara Michaels didn't expect to find two lifelong friends at her sorority membership interview. But life had other plans, leading her to meet Donna-a Bible quoting straight talker-and Gloria-a loquacious high achiever. In the semesters following membership induction, Kiara confesses a festering secret, Donna steers a bumpy course with her unfaithful boyfriend, and Gloria can't find a love match. When a lustful encounter and brutal assault turn Kiara's collegiate experience upside down, the two friends are her saving grace. Fast-forward ten years later and Kiara can't balance life's increasing responsibilities, Donna has departed a broken marriage, and Gloria can't reconcile feelings of attraction for a close friend. Join Kiara, Donna, and Gloria on a dark, clear night at Copper Road to discover how these friends find happiness through sorority redemption, relationship forgiveness, and best friend intervention as you savor the sweet taste of sisterhood.",
