Soon their wild tryst spins through campus Bonnie and Clyde-style, leaving a tornado of casualties in its wake.When the sorority gets shut down as a result of Mackenzie’s thoughtless actions, Corey shoulders the blame, branding him as Public Enemy #1 on campus. To save him from expulsion, Mackenzie must find a way to resurrect Rho Sigma, earn the forgiveness of her friends, and restore Corey's reputation. All while trying not to fall for him.",
