  "description": "Kieran Appleby can't wait until graduation to escape his life in the Keys. His only friend is the school janitor, his father doesn’t talk to him, and Kieran doesn’t know how to mention he’s gay. No wonder he daydreams about college anywhere but Florida. High school baseball star Drew Anderson has only one wish in to be able to care for those he loves. With an absent father, an agoraphobic mother, and a closet he's not ready to come out of, he can barely stand under the pressure. No one knows how alone he feels. When Drew finally notices Kieran's long-time crush, it jumpstarts a relationship that introduces them to sex, intimacy, and love. Neither has ever been this happy. But lasting happiness is evasive, and Kieran’s desperation to get out of Florida and Drew’s desire to stay and care for his family cannot be reconciled.",
