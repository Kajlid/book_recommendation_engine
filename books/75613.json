  "description": "We’re jumping from black and white to classic color — as Mickey Mouse makes his Sunday strip debut! Bright hues highlight our hero as he races through action-packed epics... taking him from Uncle Mortimer’s Inferno Gulch ranch to the icy peak of frigid Mount Fishflake! Back home in Mouseton, Mickey welcomes a famous co-star — Donald Duck — and nearly lives to regret it!Floyd Gottfredson, artist of the Sunday Mickey Mouse from 1932-38, created the most famous Mickey tales ever told in print. These long-form color strips, many never before reprinted in the USA, also feature the work of later Donald Duck master Al Taliaferro. Collectively, they form a group that fans have been seeking for a lifetime!Highlights include \"Mickey’s Nephews,\" introducing Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse, and \"Dr. Oofgay’s Secret Serum,\" which turns Horace Horsecollar into a brainwashed wild mustang! Classic gag stories round out the book, offering manic Mouse mischief at a fever pitch.Restored from Disney’s line art sources and enhanced with an eye-popping recreation of the strips' original color, Call of the Wild also brings you more than 40 pages of chromatic supplementary features! You'll enjoy rare Gottfredson drawings, vintage publicity material, and fascinating commentary by a prismatic pack of Disney scholars, including an appreciation of Gottfredson by celebrated alternative cartoonist Kevin Huizenga.NOTE: Mickey Mouse Color Sundays: Call of the Wild contains cartoon violence and historically dated content presented in context.",
