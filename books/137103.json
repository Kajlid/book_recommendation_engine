  "title": "April's Revolution: A Modern Perspective of American Medical Care of Civil War Soldiers and African Slaves",
  "description": "The American Civil War is often studied because of its battles, but people tend to ignore how it helped revolutionize the medical field. Bloodshed on the battlefield and the spread of disease led to advances in medical decision making and clinical knowledge. The war also triggered the birth of the nursing profession, the organization of the American health system, and the clinical usage of diagnostic equipment in approaches to disease management.Author Paulette Snoby, a registered nurse and award-winning research nurse, examines primary and secondary sources to show how medical treatments advanced during wartime, focusing on the explosion of innovation during the Civil War. By examining case histories, soldier and surgeon diaries, cemetery records, and other sources, she highlights important medical advances and also explores how African slaves in the South were cared for differently from the general population.A thorough scholarly study, \"April's Revolution\" offers information on slave infirmaries, early herbal remedies used by the slave population, and a better understanding of how our nation's past wars affect the history of medicine.",
