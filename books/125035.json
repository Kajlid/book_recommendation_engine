  "description": "Cira's just out with her friends, chilling at the mall on a normal weekend, when she locks eyes with a gorgeous man across the food court. Her heart is set aflame and the world around them burns to ash. They've been experimenting with human genetics since we first came into being; the Infernals are denizens of a Hellish parallel world, and they've come to claim Earth as their own. There's no better place to create their ideal being, a creature with all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses.Refusing to kneel, Cira is taken in by a new master, the very same man she saw in the food court before the world ended. A halfbreed with eyes full of hellfire and the patience of a saint, Baxa awakens Cira's urge to dominate, and an unfamiliar yearning to obey.His disinterest in the Infernal breeding program puts her at ease, and sets her nerves on fire. Can Cira resist this caramel skinned temptation, or will she be consumed by the inferno of desire?",
