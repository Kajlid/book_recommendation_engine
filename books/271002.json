  "description": "Ryker only had one goal in his life right now:  Turn a certain adventuring guild into a flaming wreck while dancing merrily through the smoldering ruins. All for the chance to get back at a handful of people.  It didn’t work out that way though.  At all.  He’d become the Count of Dungeon, made a hostage, married off to the false queen’s daughter against his will, and had his county made ground zero for a religious war.  To top all that off, the Dark Lord of the North wants to see Ryker personally.  The smoldering ruins of Dungeon have been cleared, the patterns reset, and Ryker has a task that is more than likely too much for him.  Hold Dungeon, and give Lauren, the rightful queen, some breathing room.  Warning and minor spoiler: This novel contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/harem, unconventional opinions/beliefs, and a hero who is as tactful as a dog at a cat show. Read at your own risk.",
