  "description": "In Flutter, Volume 2: Don’t Let Me Die Nervous, Lily learns that even a 15 year-old shape-shifter can’t run away from her problems. With her loved ones in danger, she returns to St. Charles to live as Jesse and protect them. But knowing what she’s capable of, can Lily be content as a popular high school varsity quarterback?Comments about Flutter, Volume 2 from the Virginia Library Association Diversity Award Judges: \"An original concept to frame the superhero genrearound a LGBTQ story with elements of the spy genre. Flutterhas enough components to warrant discussion of the characters and storytellingelements.\"\"Overall this is an exciting story with lots ofpotential. Although it reveals itself to be a superhero origin story, it alsomanages to embody a spy thriller, a high school romance, and a noir crime storywithout losing itself. It also takes the time to meditate on the nature ofgender and sexuality and the influence of society in how we shape ourperceptions of self and others, and inspires us to consider what we could be ifwe defined ourselves.\"\"This graphic novel tackled sexuality and gender in acreative manner (using science fiction), but the issues were real for manyyoung people and they were handled thoughtfully and respectfully.\"",
