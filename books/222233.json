After being viscously betrayed, he's been single for so long that he doubts he'll ever find someone who wants a real relationship, rather than just the accolade of having him on her arm.  The more he gets to know Sophie, the more he realises just how real and endearing she is. It's coming up to Christmas, his favourite time of year, and he's planning on making his move. Can Sophie mend his broken heart and teach him to trust her after his last betrayal? Can she trust him with the heartbreak she's been hiding?Can Marcus help her to embrace the season, and teach her to fall in love with Christmas all over again?",
