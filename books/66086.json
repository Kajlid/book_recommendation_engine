  "description": "Photographer Dominic Ramsey is having a bad year. His car won’t start, the rent is weeks overdue, his girlfriend dumped him, and photography jobs have been few and far between. Moonlighting as a paparazzo to scrape up some extra cash isn’t exactly going well; there’s only so much money to be made in photos of tacky celebrity outfits. Avery O’Dea has led her life in front of the cameras since shooting to stardom in her first romantic film. When her on-screen romance becomes something more she and her Hollywood beau are, at least the way the magazines tell it, a match made in heaven. So what if Avery’s had to convert to Ryan’s vegan lifestyle publicly in order to solidify the relationship to the public eye? So what if she’s had to make a few sacrifices in order to achieve the Hollywood dream?When a daring photographer catches her in a lie and exposes the truth of Avery and Ryan’s relationship to the world, Avery realizes just how tired she is of being ‘America’s Sweetheart’, and the elaborate cover-up becomes a burden that she no longer wishes to bear. As she locks eyes with the photographer that set her world on fire with a single photo, she begins to long for more from life; passion, love, and the freedom to live her life as she pleases.",
