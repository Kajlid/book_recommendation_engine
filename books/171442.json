  "description": "Are you growing tired of royal balls and boring banquets with visiting kings and princes? Do you long to escape the confines of the palace and find yourself in a completely new place, surrounded by other princesses your own age? Camp Princess is the perfect place for any princess to find a summer of magical fun! And this year, for a princess named Alicia, Camp Princess will become something more -- a place of mystery and adventure. Her turret seems to be haunted, and the golden bird that she captured for the songbird contest refuses to sing a note! It's all utterly frustrating -- until one shadowy night, when Alicia feels a ghostly presence in her room and begins to discover a destiny far more exciting than anything she could have imagined.",
