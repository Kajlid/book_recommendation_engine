  "description": "Secret passages. Elaborate riddles. Billions at stake. Avery Grambs has a plan for a better future: survive high school, win a scholarship, and get out. But her fluck changes in an instant when billionaire Tobias Hawthorne dies and leaves Avery virtually his entire fortune. The only catch? Avery must move into sprawling mansion, full of secret passages, riddles, and codes. Unfortunately for Avery, Hawthorne House is also occupied by the family that just disinherited. This includes the four Hawthorne grandsons: dangerous, magnetic, brilliant boys who grew up with every expectation that one day, they would inherit billions. Heir apparent Grayson Hawthorne is convinced that Avery is a con woman, and he's determined to take her down. His brother, Jameson, views her as their grandfather's last hurrah: a twisted riddle, a puzzle to be solved. Caught in a world of wealth and privilege, with danger around every turn, Avery will have to play the game herself just to survive.",
