  "description": "\"Vanquishes once and for all the notion that the prose poem is somehow inherently 'not a real poem.' Exhibits a sustained level of innate lyricism and imagism rarely seen even in conventional lyric free verse. Unfailingly, the little prose jewels in 'The Floating Bridge' exhibit the most fundamental property of fine poems: each whole is many times greater than the sum of its parts.\" --Cider Press Review \"Shumate's collection consists of over 50 gems...each one loaded with the living essence that hovers just beyond rationality's gate. [He] is a master of this forthright form. His book is a key to the room where dreams are stored.\" --Nuvo \"I was deeply taken by David Shumate's The Floating Bridge. There is none better working now at this very difficult genre, the prose poem.\" --Jim Harrison",
