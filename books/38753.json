  "description": "A fascinating enigma of godly grace and captivating charm,A contrasting medley of motherly tenderness and ruthless acumen,A danseuse with the elegance and poise of divine Apsaras,And yet, just a humble girl brimming with dreams, hopes and desires was…Amrapali - the Nagarvadhu of Vaishali!Aryavrat (around 500 B.C.) was a land of many prosperous kingdoms and among the most prominent of them was the Vajji Confederacy – one of the first democratic republics known to mankind. Vaishali, the capital of the Confederacy and that of the illustrious Lichchavis was not only a center of commerce and political activity but also the blessed motherland of Amrapali.The Legend of Amrapali is the story of mayhem and turmoil brought about by the obstinate desires of one man – a man blinded by the intoxication of power. It is a story of sinister plots and political wizardry, of chaste love and unbridled passion, of naked ambitions and dogged loyalties that lead to the transformation of an innocent young girl into one of the most revered, even worshipped, and occasionally feared personalities of her times. A gripping cocktail of fantasy, fiction, fable and history that retains its charismatic appeal through the centuries gone by!",
