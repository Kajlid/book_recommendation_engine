  "description": "During the European summer of 1916, the horror of war spreads its tentacles to grip a working-class family in Balmain, New South Wales. The war has ended, and Clarence Miller carries wounds that cannot be seen. He returns home to a loving wife and infant son, but his life will never be the same again.Together they seek a fresh start in the country, but memories of his trauma near the Northern French village of Fromelles still imprison him. Tragedy strikes and casts a heavy shadow over ensuing generations of the Miller family. A voice from the past and a resolute young woman may be the family's only chance of finding peace.",
