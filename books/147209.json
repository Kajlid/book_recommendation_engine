With a world gone crazy and women only a commodity, she believes they are her best chance at survival, but can she trust them? Wade Cresswell and Stanton York don't really know each other very well, but agree to share Lyssa to ensure her freedom and to keep her by their side. Stanton's lived in the city with few skills relevant to a harsher way of life. Wade was a rancher, working with his hands all his life. Together they provide the safety and security Lyssa needs as they look for a home. Finding a community that will accept them seems impossible with so much ground to cover, but their lives and their hard won freedom depends on it. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
