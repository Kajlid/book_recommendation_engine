  "description": "Abbey wasn't always a wicked stepmother. Once upon a time, she was just an average, overweight single mother, whose life revolved around her two daughters. Then the handsome and charming Bradley Mauer came into her life and swept her off her feet. Abbey was ready to live \"happily-ever-after\" - until reality set in, bringing with it an incorrigible stepdaughter, newfound telekinetic powers and betrayal by friends and family. Not even the support of her stepmothers' group was enough to belay her life from meeting the same fate as the fairy tale villainess. So with few options left to her, Abbey decides to embrace her role as a wicked stepmother and make her own happy ending.",
