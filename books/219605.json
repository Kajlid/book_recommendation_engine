  "description": "A Murder Mystery set in Ireland during World War Two. War is raging in Europe. Ireland is struggling with the consequences – the blockade of vital resources, the rationing of food and fuel, the influx of refugees, the shortage of jobs are causing unrest. Eamon Foley is in a crowded pub. The music is loud. The singing is louder. His brother-in-law Joe McCarthy is shot dead. In the chaos Foley sees a big man rushing through the door. A face from his past? Is this a message? Have they caught up with him at last? Or is it as the local Gardaí suspect – Joe was killed by a jealous husband, given his reputation as a notorious womaniser? They dismiss Foley’s concerns. With dreadful results. The next day Foley’s sister Mary is found dead in the town park. And his son is taken away by a nun in a car.",
