Plucked from the streets of Manhattan and frightened half to death by a freaking Olympian god.And now I'm trapped in the Underworld, being forced to compete in a series of deadly trials for the position of Queen of the Underworld.

Who the hell wants a husband at all, let alone one made of smoke and riddled with death?I have to get back home, to New York and my brother.

But then what? And why, why, why am I so desperate to see under Hades smoky exterior and find out what he's hiding from me?If I win the trials, I have to marry the devil himself. But losing might mean losing my life.This is the complete Hades Trials, including The Power of Hades, the Passion of Hades and The Promise of Hades.
