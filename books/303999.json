Now I live with one.To further complicate things, my past as a supernatural bounty hunter doesn’t exactly make me popular in these new circles I’m running in.Shocker, I know.Someone wants me dead.Unfortunately for them, I’m pretty good at keeping myself alive. Not that it stops Ronan from being an alphahole.He wants me to stay in Nathalie’s apartment and be safe while he handles the threat, all while holding Bree’s future over my head.Not gonna happen.To say I’m fucked is an understatement. But I’ve been in worse spots before.Lucifer may be gone, but the corruption of magic isn’t. I have enemies everywhere.And this time, they’re going to know what it means to burn.Some things are worse than the devil.To save Bree, I’ll become one of them.",
