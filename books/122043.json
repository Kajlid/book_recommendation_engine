  "description": "I was four when my parents gave me my first pair of skates. By six, I was hooked on hockey and couldn’t get enough. At twelve, I had made a name for myself on the ice. And when I was fifteen, colleges were starting to take notice. Life was great—until it wasn’t. Because when I was seventeen, my best friend died in my arms. And nothing made sense after that. Drinking turned to smoking. And smoking turned to pills. But no matter how high I got, I couldn’t erase that night. Or the guilt I felt. Because that night had been my fault. And my friend was dead … because of me. As my best friend’s baby sister, an actual angel sent from above, Haley Thompson is forbidden fruit, and I should stay away from her. Because everything I touch turns to crap. But like all things I’m not supposed to do, chasing her is another temptation I’m not strong enough to avoid. But when I spiral down, hitting my lowest point, I know I can’t take her with me. Because innocent, sweet souls like her, they don’t belong at the bottom. The trouble is, she refuses to let go of me. Even if it will ruin her. Even if I will ruin her.",
