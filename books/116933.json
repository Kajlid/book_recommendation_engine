  "description": "Obviously, popularity isn’t all that it’s cracked to be, but then again, maybe their friendship isn’t either.Two months until high school graduation, and class Salutatorian (AND die-hard geek) Tab Holmes has decided that she wants to be popular, sexy, and irresistible to boys. EVEN if it means failing that last semester. EVEN if her longtime (and equally awkward) pen pal/ kind-of boyfriend is finally coming to Golden Rock High as an exchange student.Enter Camille. She cheats, she lies, she dates college men…….and she’s Tab’s new edgy alter ego.Epic NO-NO for a devout Nerd Circle geek! They don’t: a) talk to boys, b) ‘do’ their hair, or c) socialize with anyone even remotely popular. They also definitely don’t start skipping classes, sneaking out with grown men at night, or lose the second-most coveted position in the graduating class…Since true nerds stick together, her BFFs realize that they have to snap some sense into her.….that is, until Kaitlyn realizes that it’s a perfect time to steal Geek-Boy from under Tab’s nose, and Olivia begins to hide the fact that Kaitlyn’s gorgeous brother suddenly has a thing for her.",
