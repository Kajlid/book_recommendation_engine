  "description": "Cupid has had enough of Valentine's day and this year is proving to be more than she can handle when she bumps into sexy, surly Wolf who blames her for all of his romantic failures. When the meeting between them has proven to have left them thinking about the other, both too stubborn to open their hearts and to the feelings that are right in front of them. Wolf’s dislike for Cupid will push him into denial, and as for Cupid, she will do anything in her power to get Wolf out of her head. The only thing Wolf is sure of is that no good can come from all of this. He vows not to let Cupid near him with her bow, there's only one problem. Can he avoid falling for Cupid himself? And will Cupid be able to get her work done when she gets Wolf’s name on her list, or will she succumb to her growing feelings for him?",
