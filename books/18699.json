  "description": "For Sir Baldwin Furnshill, Keeper of the King's Peace, and Bailiff Simon Puttock, the Christmas of 1321 promises to be one of great festivity. They are to receive the prestigious Gloves of Honor in a ceremony led by the specially elected Boy-Bishop of Exeter. But they soon learn that Ralph, the glovemaker, has been stabbed to death. Then Peter, a Secondary at the cathedral, collapses from poisoning. Sir Baldwin and his colleague must waste no time in solving the riddles surrounding the deaths, but as they dig for the truth, they find that many of Exeter's leading citizens are not what—or whom—they seem to be. The Boy-Bishop's Glovemaker is the tenth novel in this superbly plotted medieval mystery series.",
