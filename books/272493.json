  "description": "I met Keegan when I was on the beach in Florida.He literally crashed into my world. I wasn’t looking for romance, but his two-dimpled charm made my heart go haywire.We both had one thing in common: we were here to escape our realities. One week. Just the two of us. Not a care in the world. I didn’t know it at the time, but that week would forever change my life.Four years later, and as fate would have it, Keegan and I are brought together again. It’s as if the universe is telling us this is our second chance. The more I get to know him, the harder I fall.Falling hopelessly in love is inevitable with a man like him. Only the joke’s on me, because the guy I’m falling for isn’t the man I thought he was. You know how the saying goes: Fool me once...I’ll be damned if I’m fooled again.",
