  "description": "With a beautiful new bride and a baby on the way, life seems to finally be falling into place for Vincenzo Saletti. The family he’s always wanted is now a reality he’s determined to hold onto, by all means necessary…  Engaging a full-fledged war against the man who tried destroying his future with the bombing of his Mercedes, he utilizes the expertise of the hostile firing squad known as the Ferocious Four, who work their way through the ranks of the Lombardo family with only one agenda on their mind. Vengeance for the Capo di tutti Capi.  But revenge doesn’t come without a price. His war with Rocco instigating the involvement of the Adano family, Vincenzo must now contend with the Don of Perugia and the son who broke the twenty year old treaty between their families. And while the threat of a secondary war lingers in the air, so do tensions between him and his ambitious Uncle Lucio, who wants nothing more than to seize the business opportunities that will arise with Rocco’s fall.  Now a happily married woman who’s about to become the mother she longs to be, Novella can’t imagine anything more devastating than realizing the husband who started a family with her, has also started a war. His atrocious murders making headlines across the nation, the rising body count leaves her fearing the worst for everyone involved.  Will Vincenzo finish what he started before it’s too late, or will they all become casualties of war?",
