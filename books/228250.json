  "description": "Honorable Mention as The Historical Romance Club's Favorite Historical Romance of the Year for 2003A fiery angel, a coldhearted devil, and a marriage hotter than hell! Linnet MacDonnell was the youngest of seven sisters, and not the family beauty. With her flame-bright red hair, sharp tongue, and strange gift of second-sight, no man wanted her. But the devil would take her. Bartered as a bride to her father's long-sworn enemy, the nobly born Highlander Duncan MacKenzie of Kintail, she had no choice but to enter a marriage with a man rumored to have murdered his first wife and said to possess neither heart nor soul. Forbidding and proud, Duncan MacKenzie wanted only one thing from his new bride—to use her special gift to determine if young Robbie was truly his son. He never expected the MacDonnell lass to stubbornly follow her heart, chase away the darkness in his castle with light and laughter, and ignite a raging fire in his blood. How dare she defy him, and tempt a devil like him to feel what he feared most of all—love! From an exciting new voice in romantic fiction comes a story as tempestuous, colorful, and passionate as medieval Scotland itself...Devil in a Kilt.",
