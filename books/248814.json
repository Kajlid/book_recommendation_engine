  "description": "Jack Dashing returns! The Planetary Romantic travels to a world not entirely unlike our own. A curious twist of fate strands him in a nightmarish version of New York City...or perhaps that should be a more nightmarish version of New York City. Pursued by wild beasts and sinister agents, Jack once again finds himself in a race to find the one man that can send him to his own version of home. But once Jack finds him, the brilliant Dr. Abduraxus reveals that the multi-verse doesn't work quite the way anyone thought. And can this Jack even recognize his one true love, let alone win her heart? Find out in \"Adventure Rising\", the sequel to 2017's tale of an alternate-earth, \"Adventure Constant\".",
