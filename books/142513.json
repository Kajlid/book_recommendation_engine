Example Poem from this AnthologyA CastawayDark clouds of despair rolling above,Obscures the peak of mount melancholy.Surrounded by a rough sea of sadness,Waves of woe crashing all over me.Where is this place i have landed?A castaway in a far off land.Beaches of gloom and misery,Great sorrow in each grain of sand.I really need to escape here,Build a raft from my dreams and hopes.Leave unhappiness there on the shoreline,And break free of these heavy heart ropes.Depression is no laughing matter,Dejection is not a great show.But no blast of darkness can block out the light,Just one match can make a room glow.",
