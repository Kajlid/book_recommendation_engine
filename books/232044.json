  "description": "Being mated to an alpha was never part of Leigh’s plans. As much as the man who’s claimed her as his heats up her bed and sets her body on fire, she’s not ready to give up everything for an alpha she hardly knows. Especially not after all the lies and deceit he’s spun to keep his real identity hidden from her. But when her alpha’s scheming enemies learn of her existence, there’s no one but him left to save her. Will he sacrifice everything he is to rescue the one he calls his mate? And if he does… can Leigh surrender her heart to save them both?  Mated is the third and final book in Nora Ash’s dirty, suspense-filled Omegaverse serial. Want your alphas dominating and your romance scorching? This is the story for you.",
