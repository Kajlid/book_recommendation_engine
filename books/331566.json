  "description": "The young and beautiful widow, Meriall Sentlow, was intrigued by Sir Grey Neville's offer of freedom, solitude, and a home of her own—in exchange for a mock betrothal. All she had left to bargain with was herself, especially if her late husband's trading vessel, The Green Rose, did not return to port.While Sir Grey's motive for the deception was to hold off a blackmailer's hand, he soon found Meriall's quick-witted spirit and tender grace irresistible. As feigned affection blossomed into genuine love, the two discovered that The Green Rose held more than just the prospect of riches—it carried with it the promise of their passion.",
