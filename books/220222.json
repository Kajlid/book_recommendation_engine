  "title": "This Kind of Woman",
  "description": "This Kind of Woman represents a unique collection of stories by ten of the finest modern Japanese women writers. Rich in psychological detail, these distinguished stories chronicle the profound changes that altered the fact of postwar Japanese society, as suddenly women were freed from their traditional roles and achieved new rights—with a baffling new set of contradictory demands. Here in the works of such talented authors as Enchi Fumiko, Kōno Taeko, Kurahashi Yumiko, and others—many of whom are translated into English for the first time—we find stories about Japanese women as single mothers, as disillusioned and doubting lovers, as women questioning their marriages and their lives. This Kind of Woman not only breaks new literary ground, but provides a crystal-clear window on the transformations that have altered modern Japanese society.",
