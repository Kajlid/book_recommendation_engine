  "description": "If you are looking for a clear and honest guide to finding your best self, this is it. Dr. Harry D. Cohen, psychologist and long-time executive coach, has distilled his best advice into one bite-size package - simple wisdom bound to evoke aha! moments. Cohen translates the heliotropic effect, the tendency of living organisms to turn toward the sun, into human terms. Are you like the sun on leaves of a plant, providing nourishment, encouraging growth and drawing people toward you? Or are you like salt on a plant's roots, causing others to wither, becoming less than they could be? Perhaps a bit of both? Be the Sun, Not the Salt, will help you identify your behavior while providing common sense suggestions to improve your everyday relationships and encounters. You'll want to keep this book on your desk or by your bedside as a simple reminder to be your best self.",
