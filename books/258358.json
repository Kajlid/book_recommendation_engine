  "description": "GeorgiaI’m surrounded by love, yet have no one to call my own.But then Chase, my new roommate, is suddenly there.He could be the perfect guy for me, if he wasn’t nursing a broken heart.The more time I waste looking for love, the more I realize that what I want has been right in front of me all along.Falling for Chase is the easiest thing I’ve ever done, but fighting for him is the hardest.Because his past isn’t finished with him— not even close.ChaseLove finds you when you least expect it.I was only looking for a place to crash after having my heart ripped out, instead I found someone who turned my world upside down.A girl like Georgia was looking for happily ever after, and so far my life had been anything but a fairytale.I can walk into a burning building without thinking twice, but the spark I feel with her scares the hell out of me.I can’t keep watching her look for someone else—not when I’m falling for her.Just when everything starts to fall into place, I'm reminded just how messy and imperfect life can be.When the smoke clears, it’s Georgia by my side. Life might not be perfect— but our love could be.",
