Legendary comic book artist Dame Darcy delves deep into the cauldron of romantic horror with five haunting fables, each certain to entice you with enchanting damsels, charming lads and cads, and other beguiling characters. Each skillfully crafted tale is adorned with the Dame’s elaborate trademark illustrations, drawn in Victorian fashion, making this collection seem authentically from another—more poisonous—era. Detailed with alluring beauty, elegant imagination, and wicked humor, FRIGHTFUL FAIRYTALES unleashes ghastly mortals from the dark closet into your subconscious. But don’t worry, it’s all happily ever after in the end, just like a fairytale should be—you just might want to sleep with the light on. Dame Darcy’s comic book, Meat Cake, has a fan base of over 10,000 loyal devotees.",
