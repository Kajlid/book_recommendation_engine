  "title": "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: The Complete Muprhy Anderson Dailies: 1947-1949 and 1958-1959",
  "description": "Murphy Anderson, long heralded as one of the giants of the Silver Age began some of his first mature work in the business on the Buck Rogers newspaper strip. Anderson has long credited the strip as a major influence on his art and his runs on the feature have long been sought by collectors but never comprehensively collected together. Now for the first time Hermes Press has collected Anderson’s complete work on the dailies beginning in 1947 running until 1949. Anderson returned to the strip in 1958 working on it until 1959. This extra large volume collects Anderson’s complete work on the dailies and is supplemented by essays including a comprehensive essay by Roy Thomas, original artwork, and tons of extras that makes this book the ultimate archival collection of Anderson’s work on science-fiction’s most important comic strip.",
