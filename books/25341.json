She has everything to lose.\nDespite the dishonorable circumstances of his own birth, Adam Faulkner has never begrudged his half-brother Sebastian's legitimate position as the Viscount Willowthorpe.

Adam knows, as the stable manager at Hooke Manor, he shouldn’t hope to wed a well-born miss.

When a spark first kindled during a chance meeting between Eliza and Adam grows stronger, she doesn’t dare tell her father how she feels. He will disown her entirely if she fails to do his will, and the cost of following her heart has never seemed higher.Can two people from such different walks of life find a way to be together?",
