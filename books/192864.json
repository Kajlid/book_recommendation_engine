  "description": "Sequel to The WanderersShifters are unknown to the human world, with the exception of a secret organization―the EOS, referred to as “hunters.” Hunters capture and kill. Some shifters are taken to labs for testing―a place they will never leave―others are deemed useless, a danger to society, and are killed. Shifters travel in packs, constantly moving, and keep themselves hidden to avoid discovery.Horse shifter Flo now travels in a wild pack with what remains of the shape-shifter circus she once performed in. She, bear shifter Jett, and the others seek a new home―somewhere they can feel safe and protected―and a fresh start. As they grow closer to this goal, someone who betrayed them in the past returns to ruin their best hope of finding a secure future.With no memory of life before the circus, Flo, an orphan like the others, is unsure how to live in this new world. But then she’s presented with news: one of her relatives is alive. The discovery comes at a cost, but Flo and her friends will do anything to rescue family, even if it means facing the hunters again.",
