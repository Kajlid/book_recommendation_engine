  "description": "\"Riverwalkers\" is a journey through a young poet's life as he finds himself floating down the rivers he grew up near in Middle Tennessee. Wright flirts with theology and philosophy, using the river as a device to define his relationships with friends and family members and to form his place in the world as a young adult. \"Riverwalkers\" shows off Dave Wright's strength in both lyric and southern storytelling.",
