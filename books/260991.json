  "description": "The Manwhore Versus The Maneater  Finn McManus thrives on his reputation as a player's player – a term that has nothing to do with his years as a professional athlete. A notorious flirt and ladies man, the handsome, charming retired football player rarely dates a woman more than a few times, and shies away from relationships like they were a contagious disease. And despite his parents' decades long, blissfully happy marriage, Finn just can't see himself ever being in the same situation.  Delilah Ferris has acquired her own reputation over the years as something of a maneater. She makes no bones about the fact that she expects to call the shots in the relationship, and that she'll never be any man's fool. And when she meets her new neighbor Finn for the first time, she automatically puts him in the same category as her handsome, playboy father – the same father who not only broke her heart too many times to count but broke their family as well. Delilah has always vowed to steer clear of heartbreakers like Finn McManus, unwilling to ever fall victim to his charms.  But when the gorgeous, tempting Delilah quickly becomes the only woman Finn has eyes for, he pulls out all the stops to convince her to go out with him. And if Delilah weakens her resolve and agrees, will she regret her decision sooner than later? Or will the coach finally manage to whip this player into shape?",
