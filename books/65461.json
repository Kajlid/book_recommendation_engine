  "description": "The Dawn of Nahee plunges into the world between Earth and Heaven and the endless possibilities that await for those who dare to dream, to act, and to believe that the impossible is possible.  It begins with two families that come to know each other for the most unfortunate reason; a gruesome double murder. They also come to know to each other through the power of dreams, which slowly paint a truth so vivid that the dreams themselves must be followed. Both families realize that if either one is going to come out alive they must get along. In doing so, amazingly they learn the deepest truths about life, love, dreams, and faith.  This book was written for those who like a good suspense tale and the paranormal. It is excellent for book groups, having a study guide in the back of the novel that members can use with the readings.  Nahee is ruled by Eric Cadeyrn a benevolent king who is haunted by six evil brothers who are determined that Eric shall never wed nor have a family of his own. Eric falls for a strong Dream Navigator, Vera Parker and suddenly he finds himself challenged in ways he thought were not possible.  Boozhoo!",
