  "description": "James Phelge lived with Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones for over a year, from when they were just getting their start until their first taste of success at the top of the British charts. He slept in the same room with them and hung out with them constantly; the Stones even gave him writing credit on many of their early songs, though he had nothing to do music. While Phelge may have been disgusting, he's also a clear-sighted raconteur, and his detailed account of the Stones' salad days is fresh, revealing, and uproarious.",
