  "description": "Alexia and Jaxson's roller coaster of a story continues. There will be dives, loops, corkscrews, spins, airtime, G's and derailments. Climb aboard—buckle up—go!  Layer Series  Layers More Layers Beneath Layers Beyond Layers Sam's story  To avoid major confusion, hair pulling and or Kindle throwing—books should be read in order.  Life is funny. I’m not referring to the “ha, ha, ha” kind of funny. I’m referring to the “who would have guessed?” or the “no freakin' way” kind of funny. No way would I have ever believed that I would get a second chance at love. And no friggin' way would I have ever guessed it would begin in Vegas. I mean, come on girlfriend!  Vegas is the place where you lose your mind, your inhibitions, and your next month’s rent. Vegas isn’t where you go to learn truths, rethink your choices, and reconnect.  But then again, this is me we are talking about. So welcome to Vegas or…as they say—Viva Las Vegas, baby.  Alexia",
