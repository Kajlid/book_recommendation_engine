  "description": "One, two, three. It’s a killing spree.With two team members in the hospital and another traumatized by their last near-fatal case, Special Agent Emma Last and her partner are the only ones left standing—and the only ones available to tackle a gruesome murder in Boston.If Emma can survive the drive through Salem.Her increasing encounters with the Other and the terrifying dreams that haunt her are nothing compared to the disturbing pull of her childhood home. But making peace with the Other will have to wait. The husband of a local politician has been found murdered, his naked body—minus a certain appendage—thrown from the rooftop of a high-class hotel, the Roman numeral one carved in his chest. The case seems cut and dried. The victim’s wife is running for mayor, and with all but one of her opponents suspiciously forced out of the race, his murder reeks of a warning message. Until the prime suspect turns up dead.With leads piling up as fast as the bodies, the countdown is on. Because if two follows one, then the killer has his sights on victim three. Unless Emma can stop him first.Last Vote, the tenth book in the Emma Last series by bestselling author Mary Stone, gives new meaning to taking a pound of flesh.",
