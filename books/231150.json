  "description": "A re-imagining of the classic fairy tale Cinderella.  Astrid was marrying the Prince - but that didnâ€™t stop her going to the ball disguised as a Contessa.  Lady Astrid Rothshire had been betrothed to Prince Roman since she was an infant and now they were finally to be married. The trouble was that her imposing fiancee showed nothing but disdain for his future wife, which left Astrid no choice but to take drastic action.  Unfortunately, her brilliant solution had proven to be flawed. Now with just days to go before her wedding, Astrid found herself in the unlikely position of being her own love rival. With time running out Astrid must put an end to her charade and make Roman fall in love with her but can she do that without the Prince finding out that she has been deceiving him all along?  Enchanting Tales is a series of fairy tale re-tellings with a Regency setting. The stories are all set in the same world but each book can be read as a stand-alone. So, if you enjoy your fairy tales with a twist on the originals, a dash of humour thrown in but without any naughty bits then download Enchanting Tales today and lose yourself in a world of sweet romance.",
