  "title": "When Courage Was Stronger Than Fear: Remarkable Stories of Christians and Muslims Who Saved Jews from the Holocaust",
  "description": "When Courage Was Stronger Than Fear is a pioneering Holocaust chronicle. Journalist Peter Hellman's gripping portraits of five heroic Christians who risked their lives to save Jews from the Nazis now returns in an expanded third edition. A new sixth extraordinary story describes Muslim Dervis Korkut, who saved a young Jewish woman named Mira Bakovic in Nazi-occupied Sarajevo, and the remarkable bonds that have kept their families close for generations. Also new to this edition is a Reader's Guide. Hellman's compelling depictions of high drama, heartbreak, and hope-\"rays of light in the otherwise total darkness of the Holocaust\"-constitute a significant contribution to the literature of the Holocaust and merit a permanent place on bookstore and readers' shelves. Photographs are included.",
