It does not help that her imposing and manipulative father, is keen to control her and use her life to fulfill his own goals. As her dedication to the life her father has planned for her wanes, she grows full of discontent and disappointment.Leiana begins to grab hold of the reins.

Her need to consider her own fate, and make her own choices drives her to become bolder in her actions.Rebecca Amira Ohaeri illustrates how a young woman struggling to own and sculpt her life, while balancing duty and expectation can ultimately rise to the occasion. At this crossroads, heroine Leiana must navigate the rough waters of familial obligation, noble duties, and a few very interesting young men.
