  "description": "My sixty days begin here.The beautiful monster holds my body and soul in his brutal fingers.I’m his to use. His to dominate. His to command like a puppet on a stage for dirty eyes across the dark web.I shouldn’t want this.Shouldn’t want him.Shouldn’t want to take every dark instruction from his lips and give him my everything.But I do.It should be about the money. About saving my sister from certain doom and bailing us both out of financial misery. It should be about forging a new life, a new world for the pair of us once my sixty days are served.But it’s not.Not anymore.It’s about him.Part 2 of the Sixty Days series",
