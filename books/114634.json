  "description": "A vibrant account of the people who shaped Britain's early history, The Birth of Britain is the first of Churchill's popular and accessible four-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples. Here, Churchill guides the reader through the establishment of the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, and the people who played lead roles in creating democracy in England.Based on the research of modern historians as well as a wealth of primary source material, this history was respected by scholars as well as the public in its day-a testament both to its integrity as a work of historical nonfiction and its accessibility to laypeople. Churchill used primary sources to masterful effect in this work-quoting directly from ancient and medieval documents to provide valuable insights into the characters of many ancient and medieval figures who played a lead role in early British history.",
