  "description": "I just want my Grace back. I want the girl I found sending me dirty tweets on Saint Thomas. I want the girl who reluctantly gave in to my charms and let me boss her around. I want the girl who sent me to my knees and made me imagine what her fairy tale would look like with me in it.I just want to move on.I want to plan the future and think about kids and preschools and college funds. I want everything she ever wanted, and I want us to make it happen together. But the media needs more from us. More dirt. More pain. More payment for past transgressions.You can’t change the past. And even though Grace is ready to put her demons to bed, mine are just starting to get restless. Because when you’ve silenced as many enemies as I have over the years, you know that secret won’t stay buried forever.",
