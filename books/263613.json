  "description": "\"In action, a writer looks pretty much like a clerk.\" So Joe Haldeman writes in the introduction to this collection. But Haldeman, like Einstein, proves that clerks can have enough vision to rock the cosmos. This book includes 11 stories and four story poems, ranging in length from two pages to just over 100. Together they have earned two Nebula, two Hugo and one World Fantasy awards. Each one showcases the author's grasp of what it means to be alive and human (or inhuman), written with a powerful clarity and a subtle imagination. Publishers Weekly called this one \"a stunner.\"Contents:Feedback (1993)Passages (1990)Job Security (1992)The Hemingway Hoax (1990)Images (1991)Beachhead (1991)The Monster (1986)If I Had the Wings of an Angel (1991)The Cure (1994)Graves (1992)None So Blind (1994)The Homecoming (1990) poemFire, Ice (1994) poemTime Lapse (1989) poemDX (1987) poem",
