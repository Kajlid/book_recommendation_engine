  "description": "As a vampire slayer, there's only two types of guys interested in me. The boring mortal guys that want to kiss me...and the bloodthirsty vampires that want to kill me.Sounds simple, right? Try not to let the normal guys bore me to death, and don't let the vampires kill anyone.Well, things have changed.The slayers have ordered me to capture the vampire overlord Rurik, but he has other plans. And the more I learn about him, the less certain I am that he’s the monster we’ve made him out to be. It probably doesn’t help that I'm falling for him.Now I don’t know who to trust, and as forces greater than either of us struggle for power, I may never get the chance to find out. See, here’s the thing...Baiting the enemy can be satisfying...until you’re the one who gets caught.",
