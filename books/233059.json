  "title": "Written In Darkness",
  "description": "These nine tales are apocalyptic in the truest sense—they lift the veil and uncover what is hidden. Europe decays, but the Bloody Baron’s spirit will not rest. A lone yachtsman is becalmed at sea, and confronts madness, or something greater than madness. A condemned office building is besieged by the forces of transcendent decay. In the city of exiles, an unguessable secret awaits. These and other strange encounters, intrusions and transformations are to be found within the pages of this volume, Written in Darkness.",
