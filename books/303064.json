I’d heard that damn phrase my entire life.Most of the time, it was when a woman was mid-orgasm—or, when I was about to take someone’s life.You see, we all have our demons.Apparently, my name was mine. Though it didn’t help me get my answers any faster.I nodded when I was supposed to.I smirked when I needed to.I complimented when the timing was right.Then… I’d send them to hell after giving them nothing but heaven.I should’ve felt guilt.I didn’t.Because I was good at what I did.Making people believe what I wanted them to was an art I perfected. In a world where nothing mattered but staying at the top, I made sure no one slipped through my fingers.Except for her. She was gorgeous.One might say she was the female version of me.I lost her once.I wouldn’t lose twice. Now was the time… To let the games begin.
