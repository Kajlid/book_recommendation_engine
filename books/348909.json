  "description": "Andrew Caruso has been a second-hand-book dealer in Rome for thirty years when a collection of old photographs changes his life forever. He finds the photos among the possessions of his ex-lover, Michel; the images - possibly from police archives - are fascinating, but when Andrew and his art-critic friend Daniela decide to launch an exhibition, the shop is raided the day before the opening and the display seized with surprising violence. In his quest to understand the significance of the pictures, Andrew crosses paths with Alessandro, a journalist who knows more about their history than Andrew can imagine. But Alessandro offers hope, as well as information: hope, in a world where kidnap, subterfuge and even murder are the norm; a world of criminal intrigue in which no one is safe, or above suspicion. Meanwhile, in a cellar, a kidnapped girl hopes desperately for rescue. Part thriller, part love story, Charles Lambert's second novel is both gripping and exhilarating; brilliant and hard-edged, it clearly marks Lambert as a name to note. 'Charles Lambert writes as if his life depends on it. He takes risks at every turn' - Hannah Tinti.",
