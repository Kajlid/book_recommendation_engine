The opportunity to live away from home and work for a Fortune 500 company is a great one, and she’s pretty excited about it. The only downside is that she’s exchanged emails with her assigned roommate, Ashlee, and Ashlee... didn’t have the best reaction to the fact that Dana is trans.With Ashlee oblivious and slightly ignorant and Dana prone to judging others before they judge her, both girls start off on the wrong foot. Over time their miscommunication and distrust turn into friendship, but when they start noticing things about each other that they like and admire, it turns into something more.",
