  "description": "Serena Mitchell, very unlike her free-spirited sister played by the rules.  Poised, polite and polished, she observed the world behind square frames and a guarded heart.  But then she met Landon West and she learned some rules were highly overrated.  Fast forward three months:  Serena Mitchell has changed.  She was in love.  With her boss. With her father’s best friend.  A father who is dangerously close to finding out their secret.  This wasn’t supposed to happen. She wasn’t prepared to lose anything at the end of the school year except mind numbing orgasms.  Not her father. Not the love of her life. And certainly not her heart.  Second Semester can be read as a stand-alone and the second in the Campus Tales Series.",
