  "description": "Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837-1909) was a 19th century British Victorian poet. The reoccurring themes of sadomasochism, death-wish, lesbianism and irreligion appear in his work and made his work quite controversial. Swinburne went against Victorian morals and wrote of sensual love and the pain of love lost. Swinburne was greatly criticized in his time for his views on politics, religion morality and decorum. Atalanta in Calydon is a drama in classical Greek form, with choruses that reveal Swinburne's mastery of melodious verse. His poems speak of love in all its aspects",
