  "description": "I know that better than most. Since rejoining the Pride, I've made big decisions and even bigger the kind paid for with innocent lives. As the first and only female enforcer, I have plenty to prove to my father, the Pride and myself. And with murdered toms turning up in our territory, I'm working harder than ever, though I always find the energy for a little after-hours recreation with Marc, my partner both on and off duty.But not all my mistakes are behind me. We're beginning to suspect that the dead are connected to a rash of missing human women and that they can all be laid at my feet-two or four, take your pick. And one horrible indiscretion may yet cost me more than I can bear....",
