  "title": "The Solomon Twist",
  "description": "Twin sons of different fathers? Sure, the chances are slim and none. But to Mazel McDonald, it sounds like a good idea at the time. Kirkus Reviews hailed Dan Hammond Jr.'s debut novel DELBERT JUDD as, \"lighthearted and funny...explor(ing) substantial issues, which gives it poignancy and weight.\" His latest effort, THE SOLOMON TWIST, is similar in tone yet carries a unique picaresque glory that leaves readers laughing out loud one minute and with a lump in their throat the next. In the west Texas town of Solomon in 1965, Mazel doesn't have many options being unwed, pregnant, and unemployed--due to being unwed and pregnant. When she finds herself in early labor with two men laying claim to the title of father, an unexpected situation arises. Mazel discovers she is having twins. Jump to 1991 when Mazel's husband, known as Daddy Two, is found dead in their living room. Who shot Daddy Two? That question acts as a loose backdrop throughout the novel as suspects come to the forefront. But deeper questions of identity, reunion, and recovery gain traction, transforming the story into one of self-realization and redemption. Combining humor, exuberance, and an incisive poignancy, THE SOLOMON TWIST is packed with characters who are insightful, clueless, sensitive, and cynical. With two mysteries unsolved until the final pages, Hammond masterfully weaves a tale that leaves readers both satisfied and not wanting to leave the people of Solomon, Texas. Who killed Daddy Two? The more important question becomes: who's your Daddy?",
