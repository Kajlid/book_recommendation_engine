  "description": "When Nick wants to go on an adventure and Sally wants to go swimming, the Cat in the Hat knows where they can do both—alongside Salmon Sam on her incredible journey up the Swirly Whirly River! Shrunk to the size of salmon and swimming in scuba gear, the Cat and kids join Sam as she swims against the current, jumps up waterfalls, and avoids being eaten by a grizzly bear in her quest to return to the pool of water where she was born to lay her eggs. This Little Golden Book is fine fishy fun for reading on a summer day, and at only $3.99—it's almost as incredible as Sam's journey!",
