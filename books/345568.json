Moving means leaving her best friend, Ivy, and her pet rabbit, Nutmeg. Worst of all, it means leaving Dad, now that her parents are divorced. Julie tries to make the best of her new situation by joining the school's basketball team, but the coach won't allow girls to play. She learns that it's up to her to make positive changes in her new school - and her new life. The \"Looking Back\" section discusses the women's movement, divorce, and other issues of the turbulent 1970s.This book is the first in a series of six historical books filled with inspiring lessons of compassion, courage, and friendship. Julie's entire book set includes: Meet Julie; Julie Tells Her Story; Happy New Year, Julie; Julie and the Eagles; Julie's Journey; and Changes for Julie.",
