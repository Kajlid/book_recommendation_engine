  "description": "A chilling high-concept geo-political thriller about a declining United States versus a resurgent China.The year is 2025. A giant oil field has been discovered off the Tanzanian coast. Tanzania's a Chinese ally, and the UnitedStates desperately needs this oil to prop up an economy crippled by the collapse of the fracking bubble. A newly-elected US president orders regime change, but the Chinese have plans of their own. The explosion that follows shatters a decades-old balance of global power, brings both nations to the brink of nuclear war, and triggers a crisis back in America that the United States may not survive...Part military-political thriller, part stark warning of an uncomfortably likely future, TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING promises to be one of the year's most controversial novels.",
