  "description": "Experience the essence of folktale, where time goes strange, sensory details are lush, and people are less and more than they seem. Flieger is the tale-teller supreme, the rhythm and language of fables and folklore her special forte. Four strangers meet seemingly by accident at the deserted inn of Corbies' Caww, ignorant of who they really are and why they are there. In the weeks that follow, an uneasy friendship develops among the four as cross-currents of desire and fear and memory entangle them in a web of emotions, forcing them to act out a long-forgotten pattern of fate. Flieger's iridescent prose is like being inside the mythic dimension itself as Story takes shape. THE INN AT CORBIES' CAWW will stretch your imagination, inviting you to step inside the folktale and experience it from the inside out.",
