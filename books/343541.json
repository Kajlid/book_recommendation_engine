  "description": "\"Sometimes even the King needs help... and little friends may prove to be great friends.\"In award-winning artist Jerry Pinkney's stunningly rendered wordless adaptation of one of Aesop's most beloved fables, an unlikely pair learn that no act of kindness is ever wasted.After a ferocious lion spares a cowering mouse that he'd planned to eat, the mouse later comes to his rescue, freeing him from a poacher's trap. With vivid depictions of the landscape of the African Serengeti and expressively-drawn characters, Pinkney makes this a truly special retelling, and his stunning pictures speak volumes.As a testament to this unique rendition, this work was the winner of the 2010 Caldecott Medal, and is certain to become a bedtime classic for years to come.",
