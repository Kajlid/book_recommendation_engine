With two warnings to stay away from Lilly on his record, his addiction swings wildly out of control and he can no longer bury the past.

The more she fights for both of them, the closer she comes to finding out what is keeping Ink from claiming her.

He's living a beautiful war full of addictions, rules, and heartbreak, and the only one who can save him is Lilly.—Each Bantorus MC novel features a new couple with their own happily ever after—",
