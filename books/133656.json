  "description": "Someone wanted Sundance dead, and they wanted it bad enough to pay eight hard cases to trail him into the hell-hot Texas desert and risk their lives for one yellow scalp. There was only one way for Sundance to save himself—and that was kill them all ... and that’s what he did.But plenty more bodies would litter Sundance’s trail before he could discover the identities of the men behind the mysterious ‘S & S Concern’. Then there came a final reckoning, with the fate of the entire Indian Nation depending on the outcome!",
