  "description": "Belle doesn’t date. Not after her painful breakup with her longtime cheating boyfriend, Mike. When she visits a quaint resort in Punta Cana on a travel writing assignment, she only expects a relaxing work trip. But when she meets Ricky, his impossibly handsome looks and irresistible charm gets the best of her. She’s always felt like an average girl, not a size 0 supermodel, so she doesn’t get how someone as perfect as him could possibly be interested in her. But he craves and needs her, and won’t take no for an answer. They agree to just enjoy each other on their getaway with no expectations. But she can’t stop wondering what he is hiding. Will she discover his secrets? Or will they learn to live in the moment? Belle tells you from her point of view about their unforgettable, hot getaway.",
