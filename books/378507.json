  "description": "Is the world ready to embrace social robots? Robots so clever that they can understand your emotions, cook your favorite dinner, keep you safe at home, but most importantly keep you company when you feel lonely? Botboy, my Botboy tells the story of a widow who is bequeathed a very special & thoughtful gift--- a robot named ``Botboy\"---by her late husband. She and her Botboy experience remarkable adventures in a world that is half ready yet half terrified to accept the insertion of robots into society.",
