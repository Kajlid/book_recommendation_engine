  "description": "Jim Toomey is \"a breath of fresh water.\" -- Washington PostLauded for sparking dialogue on topics relating to marine life, Sherman's Lagoon appears in 250 newspapers in 30 countries in 6 languages.Collecting more than 42 weeks of Jim Toomey's Sherman's Lagoon , this collection transports readers to an imaginary lagoon near the South Pacific island of Kapupu, where a cast of coral reef critters live a charmed aquatic lifestyle.Commenting on such timely issues as rising sea levels, degrading water quality, and environmental pollution, inhabitants of Toomey's nautical neighborhood include Sherman, an always-hungry, but otherwise typical kind of great white shark, and his witty pearl-wearing wife Megan, along with friendly Fillmore the turtle, geeky fish Ernest, macho hermit crab Hawthorne, and salty old Captain Quigley, who remains vengeful after loosing his leg to Sherman.This is the 13th Sherman's Lagoon cartoon collection, in addition to two treasuries.",
