  "title": "Willow's Baby",
  "description": "On a beautiful Colorado morning that seems absolutely perfect—the air fresh and crisp with a hint of the smooth fragrance of wood-burning fires—heavily pregnant Willow Brooks, dressed in a billowy white lace gown, rides her mare bareback hard and fast into the foothills of the great Rocky Mountains. She seems to ride as if her life depends on it. Judging from the three-foot-long wickedly sharp sword skewering Willow’s body, it probably does. Jeffrey Sterling and his mounted search-and-rescue team find Willow and rush her to the hospital but, minutes after surgery, Willow and her baby disappear without a trace. Willow has been hidden away by Agent Alex Hunter, who is determined to protect her at all costs. He knows Willow and her baby hold the key to dozens of murders around the state of Colorado as well as the early-morning massacre of her own family. Plus, Willow is only six years old; her baby was born of a virgin birth; and someone badly wants both of them back.",
