  "description": "John and Sarah Twait are finally back to the Caribbean to relax and recuperate after their harrowing return to Hillsville, Nebraska where they came to the aid of their good friend Chief Mike Yeager, now the Twaits are ready to retire on the beach and bake in the sun. Johnâ€™s eyes took their fill of Sarah's beautiful figure as she sun baked on the beach. There was nothing more than a couple little strings and a few triangles of material covering her golden skin. He knew she would be warm and soft if he were to touch her, but since she looked so peaceful with her eyes closed, he had not. He wanted to enjoy this moment, just watching the rise and fall of her chest, and the way that her blonde hair shimmered in the sunlight. The scent of coconut oil drifted over him, and John closed his eyes to inhale and finally enjoy his retirement.",
