  "description": "Rage. It’s toxic.It poisons you. Corrupts you. Smothers your heart until it no longer beats.You can’t run from it. There’s no escape. Once it seizes control, it won’t stop until revenge bleeds the tears of justice.The day he took her, he destroyed my humanity, turning me into a bloodthirsty savage. Now, I’m driven by my hunger to see the snake bleed. To hear his screams and relish his cries.He should have known she wasn’t his to take. By touching her, he dared the beast, sealing his fate to breathe his last breath while looking me in the eye.The devil will suffer by my hand until the day of reckoning.In the end, he will drown in my madness.",
