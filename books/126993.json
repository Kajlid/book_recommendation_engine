  "description": "Just when everything proves to be perfect, old grudges come to rest in the lives of Kace and Arena. Though Kace has never seemed like the type to make enemies, some things are often beyond one’s control. His secretive past comes to light, and Arena struggles to adjust with some of the things she learns. Arena finds she has enemies of her own - some she foolishly chose to overlook. Though many love her, more find her to be an appealing choice they are willing to use force in order to take. In the dark, unforgiving world they live in, it’s a struggle just to stay free. With the viewer gone, nothing stands in the way of years of festering grudges. With war breaking out like a dark plague, the walls of the Shaylan call to those without protection. Just as they become a safe harbor, Arena learns of her mother’s accidental capture, sending her and the other warriors on a mission to bring her home. Burning resentments from years of feeling inferior to the Shaylan teems in so many outside the walls, and Arena learns her life has been far more sheltered than she could have ever imagined as they travel into a new, awakening reality. Foes become friends, ghosts become enemies, and dark soldiers loom around every twisted corner they turn. With time not showing them any favors, Arena and Kace rush to save Meredith from the hands of the depraved while facing struggles of their own - both physically and emotionally. Get your questions answered, and follow Kace and Arena’s journey.",
