  "title": "Black Angel",
  "description": "A serial killer is on the loose in San Francisco. Only when Lieutenant Larry Foggia is assigned to the case does the true horror of the killer's motive come to light. A ritual killer - nicknamed 'Satan' - stalks the city, killing in terrible ways with no apparent motive. Enter Lieutenant Foggia who, assisted by a spiritualist medium, must discover the reason for the slayings. But the truth he unearths is beyond anything he's encountered in the real world - for the killings are paving the way for a force so powerful that the lives of a few innocents will appear unimportant in comparison... Featuring several of Masterton's favourite themes, such as spiritualism and demonology, Black Angel moves at a fast pace from the stomach-churning opening to the exciting final confrontation between man and demon.",
