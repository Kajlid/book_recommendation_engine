  "title": "My Mind's Abyss (Suicide Edition)",
  "description": "\"That addiction wheel still goes round and round, decade after decade, ad nauseum…at times very reminiscent of the works of The Beats but embodied into a new generation's kinder and gentler Holden Caulfield. Great Kamikazi writing.\" - W. Lawendowski  \"Each chapter told a different story with regard to what point the character was in his life. It told of his rises and falls… but throughout all of this the character was able to provide his own analytical insight and grow from these occurrences. There is also love on a deep level that when something goes wrong, you almost ache inside because of the connection the character describes. The book is very deep and a must read...\" - H. Poole  \"Not only do you get to delve into another personality, but you also get a glimpse at another life from a different perspective not many of us know.\"  \"A magic carpet ride that ascends to the sky just to let you come crashing down.\"  \"He shares his life and feelings in a way that makes you feel like you know him… It is well written in a way that draws you in and lets you feel his pain.\"",
