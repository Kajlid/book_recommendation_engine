  "title": "The All of It",
  "description": "Jeannette Haien’s award-winning first novel relates the seemingly simple tale of a parishioner confiding in her priest, but the tangled confession brings secrets to light that provoke a moral quandary for not only the clergyman, but the reader as well. Set in a small town in Ireland, Haien’s intimate novel of conversations and dilemmas—perfect for readers of Paul Harding’s Tinkers , Marilynne Robinson’s Gilead , and Flannery O’Connor’s Wise Blood —is “an elegantly written, compact and often subtle tale of morality and passion that gives voice to an age-old concern in a fresh way” ( New York Times Book Review ).Harper Perennial breathes new life into this 1986 classic in a new edition with an introduction by Ann Patchett.",
