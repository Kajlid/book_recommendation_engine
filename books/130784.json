  "description": "Scorio has won his vengeance. His foes lie vanquished, his skeptics silenced. Yet, as the powers of hell watch eagerly, Scorio and Naomi spurn those who would recruit them, and venture into the untold depths of hell in search of the enigmatic Herdsmen. Amidst landscapes of haunting beauty and terror, they will face terrible fiends, forge friendships with wondrous new allies, and encounter societies of Great Souls to put the worst of hell to shame. All will seek to manipulate Scorio. To use him. To bend him to their will. And all will suffer the consequences for trying. The LastRock audiobook by Nick Podehl is slated for a June '24 release.",
