  "description": "Jody’s a bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks. He’s going to get the towing company he wants, no matter who he has to con to get it. Too bad he never saw Passion coming. Because Passion isn’t what she seems. She’s not the easy mark he thought she was. And she’s not going to let him rip her off and walk away. Jody’s not about to change his ways… but he might not have a choice. Passion isn’t your average big beautiful woman. She has a plan, a diabolical plan to not take Jody’s conning sitting down. Because Jody’s not the con man here; Passion’s the mastermind. With a single spell she can strip him of everything. And she just might if he can’t step up his game and pay what he owes her. The best way to force him to pay her back? Make him marry her; then he can’t just disappear into the wind. Jody’s going to marry her. Even if she has to take out a million dollar life insurance policy to lure him in.",
