  "description": "In public, Rain appears to be your average teenage girl. She enjoys shopping and dressing pretty and whatnot, but the fact is that she's hardly average. Some would debate she's even a girl! In truth, Rain is a male-to-female transsexual. Join Rain as she attempts to survive her senior year in high school passing solely as a woman in this slice-of-life comedy. Volume 1 includes the first six chapters of the story as they are seen online at DeviantArt, SmackJeeves and Comic Fury. Also included are the many \"\"Rain Delay\"\" gag segments and an exclusive bonus chapter that won't be seen online.",
