  "description": "At WorldCon and in email, a lot of folks have asked recently about the status of the next Jon & Lobo book. That's more than fair, because in my ideal world the book would have appeared earlier this summer. It did not, however, for a very simple reason: I'm not done with it yet. I'm working on it, but I don't know when I'll finish. I've told this to folks, but otherwise I've stayed mum on the book. That practice is, unsurprisingly, more than a little frustrating to many people. I've explained before why I try to avoid talking about works in progress, but I also don't mean to be annoying by doing so.After much thought, I've decided to leak one little tidbit about the next book: its title. Though I don't know when I will complete the novel, I do know its name:All the Worlds Against UsNo, I did not miss an apostrophe; I really mean all the worlds of my future. I will also say that the title is rather more true than Jon & Lobo would like.",
