  "description": "Chichester Court should be a safe place, a refuge for lone mothers and their children. But for five women and their offspring it becomes a house of terror. Strange and disturbing dreams; voices urging unspeakable acts and bizarre and alarming events affect them all.  The strange happenings at the Georgian mansion are not confined solely to the young women. The children are also at the mercy of the forces in the house - watched over by a woman in grey who is not one of the residents.  There is an atmosphere of old evil in Chichester Court and it is not a safe place to be. Not safe at all.",
