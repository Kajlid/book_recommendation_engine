  "description": "`When I was twelve years old God spoke to my father for the first time. God didn`t say much. He told my father to be a painter and left it at that... ` So begins Niall Williams` magical tale about love and destiny. Nicholas Coughlan and Isabel Gore were made for each other -- but fate doesn`t always take the easiest or the most obvious route to true love. For a start, Nicholas and Isabel have never met and nor are they likely to, without some kind of divine intervention. But as God, ghosts, a series of coincidences and seemingly chance events and encounters conspire to bring the couple together, other -- often more human -- forces attempt to keep them apart. `What will be, will be,` of course, but that doesn`t guarantee a happy-ever-after ending, nor answer the question `Will they, won`t they?` Written in a lyrical, lilting tone, Four Letters of Love is a glorious, uplifting story about faith, about seizing the moment, believing in your instincts and acting on impulse -- and about following your heart, no matter where it may lead.",
