  "description": "International Jewel Thief Gregg Hadyn is a genius, and…he's un-catchable. In the 12 years of his career, the infamous thief has stolen more than 100 million dollars in diamonds alone. When Gregg \"accidentally\" kidnaps Carly Macklin, a covert espionage operative under the cover of the FBI, he is thrown into the beginning of an adventure that will bring him to the threshold of life-changing circumstance.As Gregg wrestles with his attraction for Carly, Denny Garret, the former FBI agent who chased Gregg unsuccessfully for 12 years—and who is now Carly's supervisor in the covert Strategic Intelligence Unit—has a renewed commitment to apprehend the notorious thief. Now, however, it’s for an entirely different reason.Caught in the crosshairs of Denny's pursuit, Gregg chooses to match wits with his nemesis in a real-life chess game. The winner will decide Gregg's destiny: remaining free to continue his unstoppable thieving career or having that career take an unplanned detour if Garret succeeds in exploiting his knowledge of Gregg's Achilles heel.If you like books, tv shows, and movies (such as \"Leverage,\" \"White Collar,\" It Takes a Thief,\" \"To Catch a Thief,\" \"Catch Me if you Can,\" \"The Italian Job,\" and \"Oceans 11, 12, & 13\") that portray thieves/non-violent criminals as the heroes, you'll love the REQUISITION FOR: A THIEF series. Book 2 (of the 3-book pilot) - A Diamond in the Making- is also now available. Look for Book 3 in February of 2013.WARNING: It looks like you have unsaved changes that could be lost.
