But the Skulls, a dangerous gang, and their leader the Mime King have other plans for him.They stalk him day and night, asking the same terrifying question: \"Who?\"Desperate to escape, the priest soon realizes he needs the help of an old friend who he hasn't spoken to in years, Abraham Pérez, the chief of police. The problem is that Ismael and Abe share more than a broken friendship. A dark secret lies between them, a secret that can get everyone they care about killed.
