  "title": "Taste: Acquiring What Money Can't Buy",
  "description": "\"'Good taste' is synonymous with success in all fields of life. It's not a question of money, but of a trained eye.\" Taste is proportion. Taste is civility. Taste is the mot juste. Taste is in play wherever educated people gather. Taste treats men and women, friends and strangers considerately. Taste cannot be bought, but only learned and practiced. In our modern times, the elegance and taste that characterized and defined such contemporary figures as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis has been overshadowed by gaudy wealth. But Tish Baldrige reminds us of the hallmarks of taste and its continued importance today. Taste is a book that, today, has its perfect author and proponent in Letitia \"Tish\" Baldrige, a Taste and Manners Icon for at least 50 years. Her appearances on TV talk shows have steadily increased, most recently (in August) on \"Good Morning, America.\"",
