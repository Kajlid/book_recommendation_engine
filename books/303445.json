  "title": "RSS, School Texts and the Murder of Mahatma Gandhi: The Hindu Communal Project",
  "description": "RSS, School Texts and the Murder of Mahatma Gandhi undertakes the novel experiment of juxtaposing three apparently quite different issues, the nature of the RSS school textbooks, the murder of the Mahatma and the basic ideology of Savarkar and Golwalkar. While deeply delving into all three aspects, it brings out the deep connection between them. The book, which brings out the basic ideological underpinnings of the Hindu Communal Project, is divided into three parts. Part I discusses how this ideology is propagated among young impressionable minds through school textbooks. Part II studies the role of the Sangh combine in the murder of Mahatma Gandhi and Part III analyses the basic elements of the Hindu communal ideology, as propounded by some of its founders like Savarkar and Golwalkar.The book brings home to us in a dramatic manner the great threat communalism poses to our society, thus making it a must-read for the general educated reader, including politicians, political workers, social activists and journalists.",
