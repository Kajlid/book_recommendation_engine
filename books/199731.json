  "description": "Librarian's Note: Alternate-cover edition for ASIN: B010BJKO2SRescue the girl and sail off into the sunset was a fairly easy checklist as far as Tenset and Connor were concerned. It wasn’t as if they hadn’t done it before. The problem was, this time the ‘baddy’ knew they were coming, and it was more than possible that Chesara might just want to stay with a member of her own species rather than them. They also hadn’t considered the amount of trouble one feisty little red-haired girl could cause with a single kick to the wrong groin.Can Chesara’s fledgling mating group set aside their differences and fight together to save Silk’s life on the tropical paradise of Teora, or will they fly apart?Contains graphic M/F, M/F/M, and a brief F/F scene, plus violence. It is intended for a mature audience only.Word count: 64,000 plus 10% excerpt from Hybrid 5: SilkashThis book was formerly published as the second part of Cat Clan Hybrid 2: Fight or Flight.",
