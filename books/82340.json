  "description": "A boy named Seth drowns, desperate and alone in his final moments, losing his life as the pounding sea claims him. But then he wakes. He is naked, thirsty, starving. But alive.

Seth begins to search for answers, hoping desperately that there must be more to this life, or perhaps this afterlife...",
