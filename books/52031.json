  "description": "• Slug it out with the God of Thunder, Thor! • Rescue a princess from a ravening sea serpent! • Fight alongside six-foot-tall chainsaw-wielding rabbits! • Get torn to pieces and devoured by a pack of manticore! It's all in a day's work for Crimson—the warrior woman fated to be reborn forever into the bodies of those who no longer deserve to live. Crimson's ongoing adventures prove that “immortality” isn't all it's cracked up to be. Yet, time and again, she risks everything to save innocent lives ... and, sometimes, the world itself. Now, you can own all of Crimson's tales in The Crimson The Complete Short Stories 2000–2011. Each story is presented uncut and in order of original publication. The book also features one rare story, “Time War” (previously available only in the Stalking the Wild Hare anthology), and one new story, “Crimson the Barbarian”—presented here for the first time anywhere! • Forever Crimson • The Gates of Paradise • Crash of the Titans • Crimson & Dragons • Time War • Thor Loser • Crimson the Barbarian Find out what fantasy fans everywhere are talking about! Strap on your sword and save the multiverse alongside the Warrior Woman with Attitude in The Crimson Collection! “Crimson kicks ass—and nobody is needed to save her own (rather sweet) one but the redheaded renegade herself. Sullivan channels an engaging and authentic voice for these tantalizing tales.” —Paul McComas, author of Unforgettable and Planet of the Dates “Sulivan's red-tressed hero is red-hot . . . miss her not!” —Jean Rabe, USA Today bestselling author",
