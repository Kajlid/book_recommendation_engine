  "description": "Do you dare to believe that dreams can come true? Dream Factory raises provocative questions about the meaning of success and the nature of faith. During the golden age of Hollywood, actresses Vivian Vogel and Constance Montgomery, actor Luke Sanders, and producer Jack Morgan each pursue their own dreams of success. They work in movie studios known as “dream factories” for producing films that shape the dreams of audiences worldwide. When they struggle to see some of their dreams become reality, they find themselves in a different kind of dream factory – one in which God and his angels challenge them to transform their dreams. Vivian, Constance, and Luke all dream of stardom. As Christians, they dream of bringing hope and joy to audiences, yet they also struggle with less pure dreams of fame and fortune. Jack is in the business of helping others make their dreams come true, but at a cost. When he becomes obsessed with one of his own dreams and tries to force it into reality, he pays the ultimate price for it. Will the novel’s characters cling to their own dreams, even when doing so puts them in danger? Or will they risk losing what they’d thought they had wanted so they can seek God and his dreams for them? God sends angels into their lives as he shows them that his dreams for them are much greater than what they've been dreaming for themselves. Dreams that come from God really do come true!",
