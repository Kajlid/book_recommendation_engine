  "description": "For Gabriel, Tanner Rose is just a superficial starlet, addicted to Hollywood. For Tanner, Gabriel is just a boring, kung fu-loving, Christian boy, who's living a lackluster life in the middle of no-where. So, what happens when she's forced to live in his world? It doesn't take long before Tanner Rose craves a taste of her old life, even if it means upsetting a few people along the way. She thrives in the spotlight, after-all! Will Gabriel's faith encourage Tanner to change her partying ways or will her wild undertakings and addicting vices tempt him to do things he'd never, ever considered before?  \"There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.\" (1 Corinthians 10:13)  Freeing Tanner Rose is the first of four books in the Faith & Kung Fu series.",
