  "title": "The Permyriads: A young heroine’s battle to save humanity from a dystopian future of genocide and wealth inequality.",
  "description": "Climate change, extreme wealth inequality, machine intelligence, and robots overturn human civilization in the twenty-first century. Still, utopia for all was possible if not for the most essential rule of robotics; the golden whoever owns the robots makes the rules.More powerful than the one percent or even the one-tenth of one percent, the handful of the wealthiest elites—the Permyriads—acquire all the world’s wealth and automation into their greedy hands. Robot police crowd the rest of humanity into a caged existence of extreme austerity.One heroic young woman’s dream to escape the underclass turns into a nightmare when she is betrayed by the corrupt system. Waging war against oppression, annihilation, and an omniscient world-controlling artificial intelligence, can Myfanwy triumph against impossible odds with only the help of misfits and outcasts? The stakes for humanity’s teeming billions couldn’t be higher.",
