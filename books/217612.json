  "description": "Cassie had good reason to resist Nick Seymour's rakish good looks and matching charm. But that was easier said than done when it seemed that the only way to calm a family crisis at Christmas was for Cassie and Nick to pretend to be engaged!Well, Nick decided it was, and Cassie knew she must go along with him, for the sake of their two little nieces. If she didn't, Alice and Emily might have their Christmas ruined.If only Nick wasn't insisting that his mistletoe make-believe with Cassie look as convincing as possible, complete with kisses and a ring. Pretty soon she found herself wishing it was for real after all!",
