  "description": "Claire Treemont is a small-town coroner with a small-town social life--as in, nonexistent. When a yummy body enters her life one night at the county morgue, Claire is astonished to find she's pretty sad he's dead. I mean, honestly, how often does someone like her get to gaze upon a body like that? Zachariah Kowalski's got an affliction that has him waking up in places that are, to say the least, inconvenient. He also has a life mate who escapes him from century to century just as they're about to seal the vampire deal. Kinda frustrating, huh? Add in a best friend, Jarrod, who's ever so helpful, and an ex who'd rather see him dead than with another woman, and you get... trouble. Oh, and a wild, passionate ride against time... Desdemona Smitrovitch is a bad, bad girl. But Jarrod lusts after, er, likes Desi anyway--at least when she's not trying to kill his best friend's woman. Jarrod thinks he can help Desi on the road to becoming a good girl. Do good girls like floggers? This collection contains the previously released novellas It's a Vampire Thing and Doing Desi.",
