  "title": "Pretty Girl Problems",
  "description": "My goal in writing this book is to debunk some of the myths and shed light on a few of the pretty girl problems I and others like me have faced. Will this book end world hunger, secure peace in the middle east or reduce the carbon footprint to end global warming? Absolutely, not! But, perhaps it will help you evaluate relationships a little differently and judge a pretty girl a little less harshly.",
