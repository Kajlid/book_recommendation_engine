  "description": "FINDING STONE   Molly Madden has always been looking for something more. Growing up in a small town, she never quite fit in. She didn’t fit the preacher's daughter mold. Now at twenty-four, she has graduated from nursing school and has found a job far away from her small town. Chicago. Something was leading her there. Her excitement turns to lust, the to fear, and the shock of her life. This wasn’t a part of her plan. She never planned on Noah Stone...he just happened.  Noah Stone has returned to Chicago, after his six year serving as an Army Doctor. His only family lives here, his two brothers that he would do anything for. At thirty-five, he doesn't need anyone else. One and done is good enough for him. His past made sure he was incapable of love. By chance and circumstance, a young, smart-mouthed nurse keeps showing up in his life. Slowly, Noah realizes that he's changing. Changing the way he is thinking, the way he is acting. As much as he tries to fight it, he realizes he can’t fight the fate that keeps bringing them together.
