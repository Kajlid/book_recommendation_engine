  "title": "I Hate Christmas: A Manifesto for the Modern-day Scrooge",
  "description": "Does the sight of a house festooned in glowing colored bulbs and a huge lighted reindeer bring you out in a cold sweat? Or does the thought of eating turkey for days and days make you groan inside? And what about the adorable little carolers - does their out-of-tune wailing set your teeth on edge? And the oh-so-annoying Christmas albums constantly playing in every crowded shop you visit? And the lack of any vegetable besides Brussel sprouts to balance the treacley sweets? Then this is the survival book for you. Find comfort in the curmudgeonly anti-Christmas comments. Laugh at the ludicrous festive facts. And pity those about you that are taken in by the silly-season madness!",
