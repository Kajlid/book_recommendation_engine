  "description": "More money, more ships, more problems.  As the accidental inheritor of a small pirate fleet young Captain Henry Dyer should have it made. But ‘should’ is not a word suited to the uncertain world of pirates, and Henry rapidly finds himself in over his head, facing off against hurricanes, the Royal Navy and not least the whims of his devious little husband, Jem, who always has his eye out for the next big score.  When an Italian heiress approaches Jem with a plan to claim her controversial inheritance, Jem leaps at the opportunity, dragging a reluctant Henry in his wake. All they have to do – according to Jem – is sail to Saint Domingue, present some proof of identity, sign some documents and sail home with a fat percentage of the profits.  In theory, it’s the simplest scam in the world. In practice, it’s a lot more difficult, especially when the so-called civilized society of Cap François proves darker and even more dangerous than the life of a pirate.",
