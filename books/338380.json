So when a gorgeous stranger offers her food and a place to stay in exchange for help around his colony's farm, she's hardly in a position to say no. The farm may be her chance to finally have someplace permanent to call home. But the seemingly idyllic town has secrets, and it soon becomes clear that not everyone here is happy with her arrival….As the leader of his people, Matt has always been strict about ensuring no one learns too much about who - and what - they are. The second he meets Calli, his carefully constructed rules no longer apply. Calli is his - he's as sure of it as his wolf is. Matt's need to protect her is tested as Calli's own past threatens to haunt her…and someone lurking in the shadows promises to destroy them both.",
