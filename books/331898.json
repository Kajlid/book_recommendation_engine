  "description": "Making decisions I regret is basically a hobby.So I guess it really wasn’t that surprising when I went out on a date with an Elite.And then he tried to assault me.I might be small, but I’m not meek. I fought him off… then went straight to the dean.He didn’t believe me. No one does.And now my date from hell is in revenge mode, and I somehow end up in the campus pool.Did I mention I can’t swim?Lucky for me, a knight in shining armor saves me from drowning.Except he’s not wearing shining armor. He’s naked.And he’s also Elite.Seriously, what is up with these Elite swimmers?Of course, I have no intention of ever seeing his very good-looking, naked highness again.Elite obviously can’t be trusted.Until he wraps me in his hoodie and promises to believe me.Now I’m drowning again—but this time in his enigmatic cobalt eyes and addictive touch.My only oxygen is him. I think I maybe could fall in love.But will he keep his promise when I tell him the truth about his teammate?Or will trusting Ryan with my heart and my life be just another decision to regret?",
