The fast moving Supernatural Thriller is sure to make the little hairs on the back of your neck bristle. After certain chapters you might even find yourself looking around to make sure you are alone. The main character, Daniel Reese, is a proud father and husband who recently purchased his family's dream home; or so he thought! The terror unfolds when he realizes that he is dealing with a force far greater than his mental and physical capacity. Daniel Reese had no idea that opening those massive barn doors would reveal so many dark, bizarre secrets.",
