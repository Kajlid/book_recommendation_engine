How much danger can there be in one more try?    THE DAY THAT RUINED EVERYTHING  Serious-minded headmistress Miss Lucy Lancester believes her handsome rogue has moved on to his next conquest, leaving her free to cherish their one night together for the rest of her bluestocking days. Until the afternoon he arrives at her school intent on proving their one night wasn't enough—and this time, the scandal can't be contained. Left with few options and no reputation, Lucy turns to the one man she's sworn never to be alone with again. How dangerous can it be to spend her nights in the company of a rake?",
