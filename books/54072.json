  "description": "Jeffrey Thomas and Carlton Mellick collaborate on their own twisted visions of heaven and hell.UGLY HEAVEN At one point in time, Heaven was a paradise. It was a blissful utopia full of wonders far beyond human comprehension. But that was a long, long time ago. The afterlife is now in ruins. It has become an ugly, lonely wasteland populated by strange monstrous beasts, masturbating angels, and sad man-like beings wallowing in the remains of the once-great Kingdom of God. As two recently departed souls arrive in Heaven, they discover their eternal home is not one of divine peace but of nightmarish ugliness. So they go on a quest to explore this dead alien landscape, desperately seeking answers, allies, and some sort of place they can forever call home.BEAUTIFUL HELL A writer named Frank Lyre finds himself damned to an afterlife where Demons and Angels are equally sadistic and conflicted, where torturers become seducers, where Jesus likes to sit for a pleasant chat and God is not only going through monstrous changes to His body, but a personal crisis that might forever change His vision of creation. BEAUTIFUL HELL is a sequel of sorts to Jeffrey Thomas' acclaimed novel LETTERS FROM HADES, but stands on its own as a harrowing study of damnation and regeneration, physical passion and emotional pain, faith and rebellion, and the conflict between the spirit and the flesh.",
