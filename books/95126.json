  "description": "Nicole, Amy, Charlotte, Grace, and Binah are best friends. They do everything together -- dancing, homework, ice-skating, picnics, sleepover parties.... But the arrival of a new student, Dominic de la Guardia, changes everything. His dashing looks and charming manners have them vying for his attention. As the annual fall dance approaches, it is up to a quirky teacher, Miss Fluffernutter, and a pumpernickel-loving fairy godmother to save the English Roses's friendship.About the Author: Madonna Ritchie was born in Bay City, Michigan.
