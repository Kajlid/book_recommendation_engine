I was a child when Nico found me, resulting in my adoption by a woman who raised me alongside the Mayson children. They became my best friends and life was good until tragedy struck and I ran off to join the military. When I came home, everyone welcomed me with open arms. I was at an all-time low, drowning in my dark thoughts, unsure how to go on, until love saved me.Rose:Being on the run with a small child hasn't been easy. I thought weâ€™d finally discovered our safe haven in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. A relationship was the last thing on my mind, then I met Robert Kent, a wounded hero inside and out. While I tried to resist him, doing so was impossible, as if something greater than ourselves wanted us together. Our respective pasts made us kindred souls. When mine comes for me, I pray we're strong enough to survive it.Until Love is part of the Aurora Rose Reynolds's Happily Ever Alpha World.
