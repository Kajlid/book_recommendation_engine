  "description": "Lollipops. Toys. Cash. Sex. Leilani's job is more addicting than sugar. It's her drug. She might look meek and too young to be a college student, but sheâ€™s a naughty girl with a dirty secret. Leilani grants fantasies. When a request comes in, Leilani dons her pseudonym \"Lollipop\" and transforms into a high school cheerleader, a dominating cat girl, or even a sweet little Victorian girl who loves candy and ice cream. Her business satisfies her lust, pays just enough for college tuition, and always draws her back, despite the abuse that torments her afterward. But when a gorgeous classmate finds out and urges her to stop, Leilani's first fear isn't getting kicked out of college. She's terrified that she might give up her primal lust for genuine intimacy. Warning: Contains strong language, graphic violence, implied pedophilia, dubious consent, and disturbing situations.All characters are over the legal age of consent.",
