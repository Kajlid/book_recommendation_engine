  "title": "To Train Up a Child",
  "description": "Three thousand years ago, a wise man said, “Train up a child in the way that he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it.”  Good training is not crisis management; it is what you do before the need of discipline arises.Most parenting is accidental rather than deliberate.  Imagine building a house that way.  We don’t need to reinvent training.  There are child training principles and methods that have worked from antiquity.  To neglect deliberate training is to shove your child into a sea of choices and passions without a boat of compass.This book is not about discipline, nor problem children.  The emphasis is on the training of a child before the need to discipline arises.  It is apparent that, though they expect obedience, most parents never attempt to train their child to obey.  They wait until the behavior becomes unbearable and then explode.  With proper training, discipline can be reduced to 5% of what many now practice.  As you come to understand the difference between training and discipline, you will have a renewed vision for your family, no more raised voices, no contention, no bad attitudes, fewer spankings, a cheerful atmosphere in the home and total obedience from your children.",
