  "title": "Rank Absurdity: An Irreverent Military Memoir",
  "description": "A lighthearted memoir of the unlikeliest sort—the tale of one man’s long, strange trip through West Point and the decidedly unglamorous world of military intelligence.Sean was a skinny teenager with one good eye and marginal athletic ability who hated camping. It never occurred to anyone who knew him that he’d pursue a career in the Army. Nevertheless, he was accepted to West Point, and almost flunked out immediately for being bad at gymnastics and analyzing poetry. Eventually he got a pretty good handle on being a cadet and graduated, only to embark on a military intelligence career that was a lot like a James Bond movie—if James Bond slept in tents, ate bad food, and chugged black coffee and antihistamines to get through the day.Along the way Sean cut a brownie into seven equal slices while being screamed at, accidentally got high in the middle of law class, turned a UN base camp into a bed and breakfast for a VIP who wanted to go swim in a nearby lake, and helped call a simulated artillery strike on a West Texas cattle feeder. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.In short, Rank Absurdity is a military memoir of a completely different stripe—frank and irreverent, told by someone with an inability to take themselves too seriously.",
