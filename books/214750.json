As their bond deepens, Kieran becomes smothering and flies into terrifying rages. He confides in Chloe that he suffered a traumatic childhood, and Chloe is moved to help him. If only he could be healed, she thinks, their relationship would be perfect. Her efforts backfire, and Kieran becomes violent. Chloe breaks up with him, but Kieran pursues her relentlessly.
