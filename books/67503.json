  "title": "Fire After Dark",
  "description": "A story that will captivate, exhilarate and intoxicate you like no other, perfect for those who loved E. L. James' bestselling Fifty Shades of Grey but were left wanting more...It started with a spark...Everything changed when I met Dominic. My heart had just been broken, split into jagged fragments that can jigsaw together to make me look enough like a normal, happy person. Dominic has shown me a kind of abandonment I've never known before. He takes me down a path of pure pleasure, but of pain, too - his love offers me both lightness and dark. And where he leads me, I have no choice but to follow. Deeply intense and romantic, provocative and sensual, FIRE AFTER DARK will take you to a place where love and sex are liberated from their limits.",
