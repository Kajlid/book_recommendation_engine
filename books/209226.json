  "description": "\"The best new discussion of the primary system.\" ―Jill Lepore, author of These Truths In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt came out of retirement to challenge William Howard Taft for the Republican nomination. TR seized on the campaign theme “Let the People Rule”―a cry echoed in today’s elections―and through the course of his run helped create thirteen new primaries. Though he won most of the primaries, party bosses proved too powerful, and Roosevelt walked out of the convention to create his own Bull Moose Party―only to make the shocking political calculation to ban black delegates from his new coalition. In Let the People Rule , Geoffrey Cowan takes readers inside the dramatic campaign that changed American politics forever. 8 pages of illustrations",
