  "description": "Summer Stories features a delightful series of paintings by Maine artist Leslie Anderson along with a dozen short stories inspired by these paintings. Anderson's works capture people and events characteristic of a summer in Maine-for example, Hauling Buoys, Fair Night, Clammer, Hay Day, and Last Night at the Lake. The accompanying stories, by ten acclaimed and award-winning Maine writers, animate the paintings, revealing and honoring the genuine uniqueness of a summer in Maine. There is tenderness and warmth, but also danger and torment, and throughout, an experience of the qualities that make Maine what it is-resourcefulness, determination, strength, and independence. If you know Maine, you may find yourself in one of these paintings or stories; if you've never been to Maine, this book will excite your imagination and make you want to visit Maine to craft your own summer story. Short stories in this book are by Maine writers Mary Lou Bagley, Nancy L. Brown, Meredith Nash Fossel, Claire Guyton, Kathryn Hall, David Karraker, Catherine J. S. Lee, Laura Levenson, John B. Nichols, Jr., and Anna Noyes",
