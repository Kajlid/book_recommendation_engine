  "description": "China is not just a different country; it's a completely different world. In Chinatized, author Dan Shipman offers readers a ticket inside the minds of an American couple as they honestly attempt to find a normal life in mainland China. Follow Dan and Kathryn as they grow through their sometimes-bizarre experiences and resulting observations during the three-year period they resided in China. Chinatized grew from the real-life letters Dan sent home that capture the development of ideas from an American expatriate's perspective. Employed by a large American construction company, Dan is simply amazed when he walks onto the jobsite the first day. From that horrified first impression to well-received attempts to introduce a bit of American culture, Dan and Kathryn learn to swim in a new pond with the help of expatriate friendsmany who had lived in China several years. While Chinatized bears the authentic, thought-provoking feelings of the author, it is not just a travelogue. It is also an investigation of a very different culture from a thoroughly American perspective. Chinatized is required reading for anyone considering working, living, or traveling in China. 'Filled with sometimes frustrating and often humorous anecdotes, this book illustrates the complexities of communicating with people from a very different culture. Common vocabulary is not enoughit conveys an understanding of the philosophy and intrinsic values of the Chinese people, and yet at the same time, how to teach safety and growth toward modern needs.' Ruth Gottstein, Publisher Emerita, Volcano Press. This is an eLIVE book. Each printed copy contains a special code redeemable for the free download of the audio version of the book.",
