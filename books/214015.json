  "title": "Loverboys",
  "description": "Loverboys is the award-winning author Ana Castillo's stunning collection of twenty-three stories that depict the wildly varied faces of love, from rapturous beginnings to bittersweet endings.From the regret-tinged soulfulness of the title story in which a woman reminisces about a former lover, to the down-and-dirty settling of scores in \"Vatolandia\" to the high-spirited comedy of \"La Miss Rose,\" about a West Indian fortuneteller on a mission to help the lovelorn, Ana Castillo bares the secret hearts of women and men. By turns hopeful, hilarious, and heartbreaking, Loverboys is an irresistible pairing of author and subject. In prose that is at once erotic and eloquent, streetwise and surreal-in a voice like no other in recent literary fiction-Ana Castillo covers the waterfront of modern romance and proves why she is, in the words of Julia Alvarez, \"a first-rate storyteller.\"",
