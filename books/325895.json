  "description": "I am the dark notes of a song,The shadows at your back,The tears that fall from your eyes,The cool touch of the blade at your throat,The hot, burning bullet that pierces your skull.I am the writer of this story,I am the guide. The Director.I have led the pieces to their place on the board.In this arena, the game of life, I am the Master.And yet, I am nothing.I have always believed I was nothing.One with no past. No memory.Nothing. Just nothing.And yet, I have all the power. I have all the control.I am the one who chooses who lives and who dies.I know how it will all end, because everything has fallen into place,Just as I planned.I realize now what I have been all along. This whole time......I am death.__𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗹𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝘀𝗵𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗻!𝘔𝘦𝘳𝘤𝘺 𝘪𝘴 𝘢 𝘥𝘢𝘳𝘬, 𝘢𝘨𝘦-𝘨𝘢𝘱, 𝘤𝘢𝘱𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘳𝘰𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘢𝘭 𝘣𝘰𝘰𝘬 𝘰𝘧 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘉𝘭𝘦𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘏𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘴 𝘚𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴.**𝗧𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗪𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: 𝘋𝘶𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘶𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘷𝘪𝘰𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘴𝘤𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘴, 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘣𝘰𝘰𝘬 𝘪𝘴 𝘮𝘦𝘢𝘯𝘵 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘢𝘥𝘶𝘭𝘵 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘴, 18+.",
