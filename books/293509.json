  "description": "Humor. Horror. And a hottie with a wicked roundhouse.Chris Kantra isn’t exactly what you’d call cool. His friends are social rejects. The jocks and cheerleaders love to torment him. And he’s borne the nickname “paste boy” since the first grade.But his prospects quickly improve when he gets killed. Now he has a shot with Chastity Sky, an ex-cheerleader turned Goth with a third-degree black belt in taekwondo. She’s attracted to dead things, and that’s just what Chris is. As the town falls under attack by renegade zombies and Chris struggles to adjust to “life” as a law-abiding corpse, he finally finds his chance to ask Chastity to prom. Will she make his dreams come true, or will she cave in his skull with a kick to the temple? Read the book to find out. Also read on to see if Chris, Chastity, and his squad of geeky pals can save the town from the undead hordes, a psycho cheerleading captain, and a money-grubbing mayor who’s looking to cash in. Part zany comedy. Part gore and guts. This raucous satirical romp is ripe for anyone who’s ever rooted for the underdog and dreamed of cold justice served with a side of bloody pom-poms.",
