  "description": "Mryl Alder Norton was the daughter of the most famous consulting detective of all A man named Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes didn't know for three decades he had a daughter. Now, she's a professor of logic at Smith College and has ideas of her own of how justice should be served. The year is 1921. From roiling rifts in the nascent New England Mafia to a brutal double murder, Myrl and Faye take on a case that puts their lives at risk and forces Faye to confront a demon from her past. A drug, Heroin, is about to become criminalized, the first women officers in the U. S. are hired by the Boston City Police, and Myrl and Faye are asked to find answers to a grisly murder that looks like the work of the infamous Axeman. This Monograph was first penned by my great aunt Faye and published in 1923. Now is the first time it has been released to a new generation of readers. \"The great detective as a woman? Yes. with all the quirks, foibles and misanthropy. all the genius and the darkness that runs through that remarkable mind.\" --Laurie R. King \"Myrl and Faye are two lively women sleuths!\" --Publisher's Weekly “Abbey Pen Baker successfully creates a new world where a young woman detective embodies an equal amount of courage, curiosity, determination, and brains…An exciting plot, a refreshing main character, and precise and evocative language combine to offer us a fine read.” – Sena Jeter Naslund “Baker juggles her large cast and their secrets dexterously….Recommended for readers who aren’t sick of the glut of Holmes pastiches, and even for those who are’ – Kirkus Reviews.",
