  "title": "MIND: PSYCHOLOGY--The Untold Story...",
  "description": "This is a book about the most important discoveries in psychology. Not just the gnawed bones of the studies in a textbook, but what has been left out of our textbooks.• The success of Genius is not about the brain; it is about learning how to think. How the greatest minds in history made their discoveries, in their own words.• Quest for the mind code; how the mind is programmed by the environment. • What the greatest minds in psychology know about how the mind works.• Cogito, ergo, cogito, cogito. I think, therefore, I think, I think. The fact that we can think has created the illusion that we do think. Test yourself.• Mind control; an everyday occurrence. Kamikaze pilots, suicide bombers, celebrity and Sacred Cows. The General Theory of Relativity.• New The brain itself cannot develop without experience.• Understanding how the mind works gives us the potential to control our own mind, just as Einstein’s understanding of the atom gave us the potential of controlling the atom.",
