  "description": "The final installment in the City of Dragons series! When my fiancé Lachlan Flint finds out that his daughter’s killer has been murdered in a locked cell with no apparent entry points, he says he has to take a crack at the case. He says it’s a thought experiment, but I’m fairly sure it’s about closure. Nothing has had a deeper affect on Lachlan than the death of his daughter. Normally, I’d be all for closure, but things are getting bad with the Green King. The ancient sea monster attacked my hotel with a supernatural tidal wave that closed me down for business and put us all in danger. I want to figure out how to stop the Green King, not go off and try to solve murders. But, as I said, nothing has had a deeper affect on Lachlan, so off we all go to Texas, where we’re neck deep in prison politics and shady suspects. All the while, the Green King closes in.",
