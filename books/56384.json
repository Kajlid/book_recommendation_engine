  "title": "Rhinoceros Tap: 15 Seriously Silly Songs",
  "description": "Sing a song of Boynton! Before there was the Grammy-nominated Philadelphia Chickens, the #1 New York Times children’s bestseller, there was Rhinoceros Tap, the collection of seriously silly songs. This truly delightful set—a Recording Industry Association of America Gold album with 647,000 copies in print—combines a big illustrated songbook and CD so children and grown-ups alike can read along, sing along, dance along, cluck along, and oink along to the fifteen original songs.There's \"O, Lonely Peas,\" to appeal to every finicky young eater. The five-year-old's lament, \"Bad Babies.\" A mouse's impassioned ballad to his beloved, \"I Love You More Than Cheese.\" Plus the lead number, \"Rhinoceros Tap,\" the ever-popular “Barnyard Dance,” and more. With lyrics and pictures by Boynton and music written with and played by the one and only Michael Ford, these songs have the style, swing, charm, and pizzazz that little listeners deserve. Ready? All together now.",
