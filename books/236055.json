  "description": "Can a touch of Satin bring a straight copper to his knees?  Detective Joel Hunter is on surveillance when he first lays eyes on Satin, the singer with the amazing voice, which is as beautiful as she is. But when the stake-out comes to an end, he can’t resist going back to the bar. He gets a shock when he learns what lies beneath the satin dress, but an even bigger one when he realizes he’s attracted to the owner of that sultry voice - Ross Dauntry. Ross can’t figure out why the cop keeps coming back, even after he’s learned the truth. Is Joel attracted to him, or to Satin? Because the answer is important, and one way or another, Ross needs to know…  46,000 words. A standalone novella of satin and sensuality... Although this story is in the same series as Lace, you will not find Dave and Shawn in these pages - Joel and Ross provide enough heat of their own.",
