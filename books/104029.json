  "description": "Dozens have been corrupted by tainted water from the Well of the Damned, including King Gavin Kinshield's beloved wife. He's desperate to reverse the water's effects and restore Feanna to the kind and compassionate woman he married.  And what of his helpless heir growing in her toxic womb? To save his unborn son, Gavin must find a solution before the darkness that’s overtaken Feanna also stamps out the tiny spark within her. Help seems to appear in the unlikely form of the Guardians, two ghostly figures tethered to the crystal that lies deep within the wellspring. Can Gavin trust them... or will their own agenda take the lives of his wife and son—and bring on the utter destruction of the seven realms?",
