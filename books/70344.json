  "description": "In the near future the United States is one of a very few countries that still survives as a democracy, most of the others having fallen into anarchy or repressive oligarchy. LLE, Longevity Law Enforcement, is an elite squad of detectives granted special prerogatives and charged with enforcing the carefully constructed laws that govern the use of the Longevity process. When LLE’s top team, Chris, Livvy, and Louie, Chris’ unique, neuro-enhanced dog, investigates a brutal Syndicate of illegal labs trying to force its way into D.C., Louie finds key evidence that might help his partners crack the Syndicate’s power. If they can survive long enough.",
