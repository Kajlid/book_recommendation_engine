But preparations are disrupted by a series of peculiar events: a naked, wild-haired figure is glimpsed running through the woods; strange symbols are carved onto trees and gateposts; a metal sculpture takes on a mysterious life of its own.The incidents, which are initially assumed to be student pranks, escalate in menace and intensity, until one of Honeysett's fellow exhibitors lies dead - and Honeysett finds himself the prime suspect in the ensuing murder investigation. It's clear that someone is trying to frame him. But who? And why?",
