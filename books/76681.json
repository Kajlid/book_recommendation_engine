  "description": "True to the preoccupations of Cary's novels written in the 1940s, The Moonlight emphasizes individual moral freedom and self-determination. Rose is a frail but willful spinster who becomes head of the family estate and self-appointed guardian of morality. Her death triggers painful memories for her sister Ella, who must confront the tragic consequences of a family's guilt, relentless martyrdom and denial of romantic love.",
