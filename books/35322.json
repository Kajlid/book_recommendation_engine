  "description": "In an attempt to gain Congressional approval for a top secret weapons system, Washington lobbyist \"Bird\" McIntyre and sexy NeoCon wonkette Angel Templeton start a rumor that the Chinese secret service is trying to assassinate the Dalai Lama. Their outrageous scheme provokes a series of crises involving the White House, the CIA, and a strangely sympathetic and vulnerable Chinese president, with both countries veering perilously towards war.Buckley has drawn his most convincing and outrageous characters to date: Bird, failed novelist of amusingly awful Clancy-esque thrillers; Angel, combination Anne Coulter and Ayn Rand; Bird's demanding, equestrian wife, Myndi; Bewks, his feckless but endearing Civil War re-enactor brother; the mild-mannered Chinese President Fa and his devoted aide Gang, maneuvering desperately against sinister Politburo hard-liners Minister Lo and General Han.Blending the skewering genius of \nThank You for Smoking\n with \n  Dr. Strangelove\n's dark comedy, \nThey Eat Puppies, Don't They?\n has something to offend — and amuse — everyone.",
