  "description": "Love, Care, Trust & Respect is a pocket-sized guide to the vital ingredients of loving relationships. Natalie Lue, author of the popular self-help blog, Baggage Reclaim, has taken more than a decade’s worth of teachings and distilled them into this compassionate manual, jam-packed with powerful insights into what makes healthy relationships tick. It’s not unusual to have an idea of what’s needed in a relationship but to then struggle to put these into practice or recognise them, leading to confusion, frustration and disappointment that affects your confidence to create, forge and sustain healthy relationships, or that leads to you remaining in unfulfilling/unhealthy ones long past their sell-by-date. There are a lot of so-called rules and Natalie explains why these don’t work, instead offering universal principles that apply in every mutually fulfilling relationship. Discover the five landmarks and four qualities for a loving partner, why casual relationships are like zero-hours contracts, the key relationship blocks, their symptoms, why they cause pain, fear and guilt and how to begin dissolving them, and discover the purpose of your relationships and how to enjoy more love, care, trust and respect. This title is in British English.",
