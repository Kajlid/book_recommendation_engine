A lot can change though in a short amount of time and now there’s an unavoidable factor in her life that will change everything. Will Dani be able to save the only good she’s ever known? Can she fight for the love she wants—or is it just too little too late? Corey has spent the last several months missing the only woman he’s ever wanted, but things aren’t about to get any easier. When demons from Corey’s past rise to the surface, he is put in the middle of something he thought was laid to rest. When drugs, money and an ex that wants to stir up trouble—returns to the picture— Corey will be left fighting for his life. Will he be able to protect the only person he loves from a dangerous world she knows nothing about? Or will his past claim his life and inevitably…His heart. Sometimes fate has its own ideas but will that be the end for Corey and Dani? Or will their fight for love prevail?",
