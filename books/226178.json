  "title": "The List",
  "description": "When the British arrive in Philadelphia on the heels of the departing American army, Joseph Galloway begins compiling a list of influential men loyal to the Crown--a list that could threaten the future of the young nation. While the misery and the dangers of British occupation bring turmoil into the lives of Philadelphians--loyalist and patriot alike--the destiny of liberty hangs on the tip of a quill pen poised above a piece of parchment. A meticulously researched novel based on a mystery that changed the course of the American Revolution, 'The List' brings to life the times that set us free. Highly recommended for young and old.",
