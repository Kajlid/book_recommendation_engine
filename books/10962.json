  "description": "THE SUPERNATURAL POWER OF A TRANSFORMED MIND! You can live a supernatural life. In fact, moving in the spiritual realm should be as routine as prayer, worship and reading Scripture. It is part of what Jesus purchased for us on the Cross! Healing, deliverance and signs-and-wonders are an inheritance for all followers of Jesus Christ. The Supernatural Power of a Transformed Mind teaches you how to remove the blinders of religious limitation to see your own life changed, the lost redeemed and communities transformed. You too can move from an intellectual faith and tap into an abundance of miracle-working authority, unleashing the power of God's glory.",
