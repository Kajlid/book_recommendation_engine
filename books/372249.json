  "description": "A delightful collection of folk tales from West Africa including 18 Anansi tales, as well as 17 others. Includes the story of how the tales came to be called Anansi tales. In the olden days all the stories which men told were stories of Nyankupon, the chief of the gods. Spider wanted the stories to be about him. Nyankupon agreed, on one condition, namely that he bring him three things: a jar full of live bees, a boa-constrictor, and a tiger. How Anansi contrived to achieve all these tasks is related in the opening story. Suitable for ages 6 and up.",
