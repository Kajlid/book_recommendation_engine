The dead man controlled hundreds of millions of dollars of government money. If the World Bank cannot locate it within the next several days, all aid money to the Palestinians will be cut off. Visiting Nablus, Omar Yussef must solve the murder and find the money, or all Palestinians will suffer. Matt Beynon Rees was born in South Wales. He has covered the Middle East as a journalist for over a decade and was TIME magazine’s Jerusalem bureau chief from 2000 to 2006. He is the author of the nonfiction work Cain’s Field: Faith, Fratricide and Fear in the Middle East and two previous mysteries in the Omar Yussef series.",
