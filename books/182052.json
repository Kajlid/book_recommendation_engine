All work and no play can make even this immortal long for the excitement of the Russian nightlife.She just has to ditch Kam her guardian angel and slip out for some fun after dark. No problem there for a red-blooded elemental like herself. Bring it!Of course, she wasn’t expecting Cain the oldest of the vampires to show up. Tall, dark and dangerous their attraction smoldered from day one. Except, he is trouble with a capital “T.”Morrigan won’t slow down though, not even for Cain or the danger that surrounds him. She’s young, hot and knows what she wants, no reason not to live life to the max and have some fun while doing it.",
