  "description": "Raymond causes a stir in the country town of Glaston when he buys Glastonbridge, a house of vast, neo-Gothic fantasy abandoned for decades. It’s an ambitious project, and all previous renovators have come to grief. Out of the woodwork real estate agents, a jealous sister, the heritage council, prospective tourism operators and journalists, proffering opinions, make his life a misery. As the restoration goes on, Raymond becomes increasingly isolated, unable to trust anyone, alienating his friends and giving courage to his enemies. He believes that unseen forces are trying to remove him from his grand project.  At turns pitied, admired, humoured and loved, Raymond undoubtedly has the knowledge, vision and fortune to make Glastonbridge thrive again, but will he be able to see it through?Glass Houses is a gentle satire with a rapier edge, perfectly capturing the socially mobile mid-nineties milieu of city folk with country houses. Anne Coombs’s final novel is about finding your place of refuge and reaching for what you want",
