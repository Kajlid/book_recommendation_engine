  "title": "Conversations With God Book 4: Awaken the Species, A New and Unexpected Dialogue",
  "description": "In the middle of the night on 2nd August 2016, Neale Donald Walsch found himself drawn into a new and totally unexpected dialogue with God in which he suddenly faced two questions: Is the human race being offered help by Highly Evolved Beings from Another Dimension? Is there a key role that humans are being invited to play in advancing their own evolution by joining in a mutual mission to assist the planet during the critical times ahead? He was told the answer to both questions is yes. Then he was given 16 specific examples of how Highly Evolved Beings respond to life differently than humans and how adopting even a few of those behaviours could forever change the course of world history for the better. That information makes up the body of this work.",
