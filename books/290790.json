  "description": "Christian Price is a scientist who suffered a tragedy unsolved by local police. In an effort to right that which he perceives is wrong, he begins to execute experiments in different cities to test the response times of law enforcement agencies. Detective Hardwick is a thirty-year veteran of the Atlanta Police Department. He and his fellow officers, who have always been successful in keeping crime rates low in the precinct, find themselves the latest targets of Christian’s experiments, placing innocent civilians in the path of his malevolence.  Will more unwilling participants be lost to Christian’s brutality or can the detectives follow his perverse directives before time slips away?",
