  "description": "An alternate cover edition exists here.Our Pride and Our Joy is a true story told with photographs and verse. The story is about our feral community, that had totally adopted us, and we them. The amazing alpha male and female of the Pride, along with the antics of the kittens are both portrayed. Last year was enlightening for us, as we watched the Pride grow. It was as if we had our own episode of \"The Wild Kingdom\" being played out before use each day. Both the text and the accompanying photography were produced my myself. This book was a pure pleasure to write, a story that I just and to tell, and I know you will find it to be equally enjoyable to read.",
