  "description": "WHISPERING FOG,One fall night a mystifying fog captures a young girl from the 20th century and a captain of an old sailing ship from the 18th century bringing them together.Belinda Brady, a young girl who lives next to a soaring old lighthouse becomes a part of an old seafaring tale, a tale of a whispering fog, a monster from the sea controlling the destiny of ill-fated ships.On an unusual foggy night in 1959, Belinda sees an image out in the sea, a ship of years ago with soaring beige sails flapping like bird’s wings. She hears a ship’s lonely bell tolling and begins her descent into the misty vapor climbing down the steep, rocky cliff to help the ship’s crew. She loses her footing on the slick rocks falling literally into the whispering fog.Did the story end that night for Belinda when she fell down the cliff, or was it a dream of a young girl? On foggy nights, fishermen out in the sea have heard an old ship’s bell tolling and voices whispering Belinda’s name.",
