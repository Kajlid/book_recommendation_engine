  "description": "THERE IS AN UNSPOKEN WORD IN CHRISTIANITY...THAT WORD IS INTIMACY!Deep inside every true child of God is a desire to know Him intimately. Intimacy with God is seldom experienced by God's people because it is not talked about, we don't know what it is, and we don't know how to obtain it.Do you have a hunger in your soul for a deeper experience of God? Has your search for such an experience often led to frustration and more questions?WHEN GOODNESS FINDS YOU invites you to live a life of intimacy with God.RETURN TO A LIFE OF INNOCENCE.FIND THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD YOU WERE DESIGNED TO ENJOY.DISCOVER INTIMACY IN SIMPLE WAYS.IGNITE THE FIRE IN YOUR SOUL BY TAKING THE STEPS OF A CHILD.FIND OUT HOW TO POSITION YOURSELF FOR GOD'S GOODNESS TO FIND YOU.\"Intimacy with God isn't a topic that can be written about from a merely academic perspective. Scott Boucher communicates that with an ease and candor that can only come through a man who writes from experience. If you want the often-misunderstood concept of intimacy with God to come alive, do yourself a favor and read this book.\"--Shawn Hennessy, lead pastor, Life Church, Green Bay, WI\"I highly recommend this book; it is birthed out of many years of Scott's experience.\"--Rev. Arni Jacobson, international director of leadership, Grace International\"For those who have not yet experienced the pleasure and joy of partaking of the Lord in this way, you are in for the treat of your life. I believe this is the most important aspect of our Christian faith, and sadly, the most missed experience for those who call themselves Christian.\"--John Kieffer, Wisconsin State Facilitator, Mission America Coalition",
