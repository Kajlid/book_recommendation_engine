  "description": "Navigating the halls of Kipperton High should be easy for someone like Margot Maples. She's smart, sweet, and ready to start fresh. But with her best friend moved away, she's stuck wondering just how to fit in. Making her transition more difficult is Max, who always knows how to push her buttons, Walter, her geeky suitor, Cassie, the girl who seemingly has it all, and Peter, her first true crush. So, life doesn't go just the way she hopes. Join Margot on a journey through the beginning of ninth grade - a time when your reputation is determined by the most trivial of matters, including where you eat, how many friends you have, and - most notably - who you kiss.",
