  "title": "Panda Girl",
  "description": "Transplanted from New York City to the countryside, Sunny doesn’t fit in, and with a nickname like Panda Girl, she’s positive she’ll never belong. As Sunny experiences crippling fear, the death of a family member, and serious bullying with life or death consequences, she realizes that she can’t let fear run her life. Set in rural upstate New York, Sunny shares the perils of being a kid with a horrible nickname from sixth grade to the end of her ninth grade year. In that time, she sees friendships, as well as herself and her family, grow and change—sometimes for the better and sometimes not. A portion of the profits from the sale of Panda Girl will be donated to the Society for the Prevention of Teen Suicide. To find out more, go to http://www.sptsusa.org/",
