  "description": "[Siren Everlasting Classic Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, werewolves] Joshua Tate has always sashayed through life, just having fun and taking care of his little brother, Taylor. He enjoyed who he was until he talked to his Mom, his own personal critic, who is happy to remind him off all of his shortcomings. Law Santiago loves his brothers. The only problem is the fact that they tease him to no end about his preference for playing bottom. It's a sore subject—and one he wishes they would forget. Law finally finds his mate, and he's perfect in every way. Unfortunately, Law and Joshua are both full of self-doubt from their families' ridicule. Can these two help each other accept who they are, or will the constant interruptions—from family, vampires, and elves who have it out for Law's mate—keep them from the perfect life? Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
