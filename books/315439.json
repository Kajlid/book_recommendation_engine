  "description": "If they wouldn’t have planted those pumpkins, especially in that spot, maybe none of this would have happened . . . Fifteen-year-old Jeremy Fisher has always been an outsider, but now that he’s been convicted of a crime he “sort of” committed, his status as a small-town pariah has just been made official. Bullied at school, branded a criminal by the community, and grieving the loss of his father, who just left one day, the only bright spot in Jeremy’s bleak world is Roxanne, one of the most popular girls in school who happens to take a shine to him—or is it just pity?—in the midst of his troubles.As the community prepares for Halloween, Jeremy notices something strange is afoot, and he suspects it has something to do with the ghastly jack o’ lanterns that are mysteriously popping up all over town. Before Jeremy realizes it, he and Roxanne are caught up in a desperate struggle to save their community from a supernatural force that may have a closer connection to the two friends than either of them realize.",
