  "title": "Single That: Dispelling The Top 10 Myths Of The Single Woman",
  "description": "Single, that does not mean broken, lonely, or desperate.\n\nEven if for extended periods, being single does not mean that you are hard to love. These are a few of the myths that Single That puts to rest while empowering women to refuse being defined by whether or not we have a significant other. Whether dating, divorced, in a relationship, or learning how to be alone, you will receive an empathetic yet assertive nudge toward the belief that you are enough. You will receive support if already comfortable and confident in this idea as Single That addresses misconceptions especially prevalent when assessing single women in their 30s and older.A practical guide in defense, support, and admiration of the single woman, Single That obliterates audacious assumptions one by one, and serves as a reminder that we are much more than a relationship status. We are certainly more than the negative connotations that others choose to associate with our relationship status. This book is a must-read for every past and present single woman, as well as every man who would like first-hand insight into what being a single woman really means.",
