  "description": "He might’ve been the right person—if I hadn’t been so damaged. And he hadn’t been only sixteen years old.  One day Jørgen comes home from work, he spots a young man in front of the gate to his flat—a young man who falls over in a seizure on the sidewalk. Jørgen takes him in and when his efforts to find someone who can take the kid off his hands fails, he’s left with him for the night.  Geir’s always been bullied for his epilepsy, and now for being gay. But he can’t change either of the facts, because they’re not ever going to go away. All Geir wants is a friend, and he thinks maybe he can have one in Jørgen. Except the lines blur between friendship and something more.  What started out as helping someone in need, slowly turns into something much more when Geir keeps appearing in his life. But can someone as damaged as him, with so much trauma in his past that are ruining his present, ever manage a relationship with another person? When just a simple touch is enough to bring on a flashback, it isn’t promising.",
