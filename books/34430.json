  "description": "A riveting biography of the groundbreaking innovator who was a giant in the worlds of computing, music, filmmaking, design, smart phones, and more. A finalist for the YALSA Excellence in Nonfiction Award!\"Your time is limited. . . . have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.\" ―Steve JobsFrom the start, his path was never predictable. Steve Jobs was given up for adoption at birth, dropped out of college after one semester, and at the age of twenty, created Apple in his parents' garage with his friend Steve Wozniack.Then came the core and hallmark of his genius―his exacting moderation for perfection, his counterculture life approach, and his level of taste and style that pushed all boundaries. A devoted husband, father, and Buddhist, he battled cancer for over a decade, became the ultimate CEO, and made the world want every product he touched, from the Macintosh to the iPhone, from iTunes and the iPod to the Macbook.Critically acclaimed author Karen Blumenthal takes us to the core of this complicated and legendary man while simultaneously exploring the evolution of computers. Framed by Jobs' inspirational Stanford commencement speech and illustrated throughout with black and white photos, this is the story of the man who changed our world.Read more thrilling nonfiction by Karen Hillary Rodham A Woman Living History (A YALSA Excellence in Nonfiction Award Finalist) Murder, Moonshine, and the Lawless Years of Prohibition The Gun That Changed AmericaPraise for Steve The Man Who Thought A “This is a smart book about a smart subject by a smart writer.” ― Booklist, starred review“Students who know Steve Jobs only through Apple's iTunes, iPhones, and iPads will have their eyes opened by this accessible and well-written biography.” ― VOYA“An engaging and intimate portrait.
