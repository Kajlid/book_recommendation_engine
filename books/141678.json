  "description": "Life in a Transparent Society isn’t always easy, especially if you’re a Vampire.  As intelligent surveillance proliferated throughout the World, gradually obliterating any darkness, strange things were brought into the light. One of these anomalies is a young woman who claims to be a Vampire.  Though she is undeniably inhuman, her body is not beyond the abilities of her era’s biotechnology. Her captors believe her to be an experimental transhuman, and patiently listen to her preposterous story in the hopes of sifting some degree of truth from it.  The girl herself though realizes she can no longer remain hidden in the Orwellian surveillance state that the World has become. No darkness remains for her to hide in, and in the light she can only burn.",
