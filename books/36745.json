  "description": "To the unititiated, Hillingbury seems much like any other dormitory home-counties surburb, but to the residents it's a sexual playground of domination and submission. The women who run the social scene also run their submissives - or 'pets' - ragged. In the social pecking order, sexual domination equals real-life dominance. For Jeannie, newly arrived in the area, this leads to the discovery of her own submissive sexuality, but she dosen't think it's fair that it should determine her place in the social order. Jeannie's a spirited girl, and the sparks that fly ensure that the women of Hillingbury will find it harder than they thought, now that Jeannie's around, to keep up appearances.",
