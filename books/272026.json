  "description": "Being born a witch has always been just a detail from my past, you know, like summer camp, or the time Timmy ate a bug, but now, thanks to one very pushy Immortal, a handful of mutant shifters, a psycho named Chaos and a nice guy (I think) named Emmet, my magic’s become a real pain in my ass.San Diego was a totally chill choice for college, until this whole moon-cycle madness was thrown in my lap (more like shoved in my face) and now I’m bumbling with basic spells, crash studying to go from zero to fierce in a matter of days.Only problem with this test is that it’s graded pass/fail where failure is death.I wouldn’t wish magic on anyone. It attracts all the wrong entities, the kind you can’t run from, the kind who always find you, the kind who know your dark secrets even before you do.",
