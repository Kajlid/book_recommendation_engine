  "description": "The war has begun in earnest. The main gateway has opened and the minions of the Onderwereld are starting to come through in greater and greater numbers. For now they can hold them off, but when your enemy just reincarnates a week after you kill them, what can you do? It's a war of attrition for Sean's side, a war that will come with a very high price.  However, Sean knows that there are weapons that can kill a demon so that it can't respawn and he's bound and determined to get them, even if it means going back through a gateway. He just has to find a way to sneak past a million demons and then run around their home without getting caught.  But he still has a few extra cards up his sleeve to play in this game.  WARNING: \"Times Like These\" contains explicit sexuality, nudity, violence, bad language, robbery, murder, demons doing nasty things, self-defense, pro-active self-defense, confiscation of public property, unscrupulous and manipulative people, polyamory, explicit sex, mayhem, more demons, people who aim to misbehave, gratuitous sex and violence, and two female werejaguars who put on an act at the casino that would really get your attention - too bad you missed it.",
