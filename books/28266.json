  "description": "When she has to convince the Alpha of Warden to pick her as his mate, she finds herself frustratingly captivated by the domineering male...whose language she doesn’t even speak-- THE SILVERS-- Rem Walker knows she’s doomed when she wakes with silver hair, blue eyes, and magic coursing through her veins... Shifter wolves have labeled her kind as a Silver—a human kissed by the moon. The wolves will go to great lengths to have her, even abducting her from her family home. These Silver women will be of great use to their packs, especially to the unmated Alphas... Rem never expects another to target her, though. On her forced journey to the wolves, an Elder Witch ensnares Rem in a binding death curse, threatening her younger brother as leverage. The only way to break free of the witch's demands is to convince Ronan, the Alpha of the Warden shifters, to choose her as his mate before he chooses another Silver. It should be easy, given how much the wolves desire the Silvers... But Ronan is one of the most shrewd, domineering, and frustratingly handsome males Rem’s ever seen. How can she focus when she's in foreign lands, harboring dark secrets, and can't speak their language? With everything to prove—and everything to lose—Rem’s world hangs in the balance between betraying the ones she loves, or fighting for herself... It would be so much easier to betray the Alpha if she didn’t enjoy his touch so much…",
