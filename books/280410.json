  "description": "Purple dragons, fiery dragons, cross-eyed dragons, playing the banjo, flying, feasting, and fighting. Dinosaurs stuck in the bath, grinding up bones, having a party, eating the fridge, bellowing, raving, and dancing. Hairy monsters, scary monsters, monsters of fire, monsters of snow, roaring,gulping, and gobbling. Here are three books of poems in one about every kind of dragon, dinosaur, and monster you can think of.",
