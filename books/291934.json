  "description": "It was supposed to be a summer we’d never forget.Instead, everything was stolen from me.The best friend who was more like a sister. The innocent way I looked at life.Leaving me with only unanswered questions. Returning to the island is the second chance I didn’t know I needed.And Hunter is the surprise that knocks me sideways. There’s a hurt in him that calls to my own.A strength I find in sharing our scars.Igniting a spark that turns to flame. But someone isn’t happy about the world I’m building for myself.And nothing will stop them from tearing it all apart…",
