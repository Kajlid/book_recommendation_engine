  "description": "Librarian Note: Older cover of B00LH3Q0X0.Earth is gone. Centuries have passed since the First Cataclysm ended life on the blue planet. Humanity’s survivors are now dispersed among distant colonies, thousands of light years from the barren, frozen rock that was once their home. A new Republic has formed – one in which freedom no longer exists. In return for the protection of the Consulate Magistratus, citizens must concede their rights absolutely. The Magistratus controls interstellar travel, access to technology – even procreation. Every citizen is implanted with a device to monitor their location, health and nutrition and emotions - perhaps even more. Organised religion is forbidden. All crime is punished by banishment, or a lifetime of penal servitude aboard the Kolyma prison fleet. Humanity’s true history survives only in whispers of a secret archive. Yet there are those who preach a new religion and who want to be free. A revolution is coming… The Heretic is the first book in the Beyond the Wall series, a hard science-fiction epic space opera about the future of humanity and the discovery of the truth of its past.",
