  "description": "If you loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer, then you’ll love Aria Naveed. Kicking butt and saving people is kind of her thing.  It has been six years since the Awakening, and peace in Spokane, Washington is still tenuous at best. The vampires and shifters are all vying for control of the city and the humans seem to be the ones suffering the consequences, or so it seems.  Aria Naveed has spent the last two years of her life fighting to make the many wrongs of the world right, but soon finds out that the humans aren’t as weak as they appear and may be a more terrifying foe than any of the other races combined.  When a stranger rolls into town with trouble on his heels, Aria finds herself trapped in the middle of a battle that could cost her more than she has bargained for. Will a fight for justice turn into an unexpected fight for her life?  If you love snarky heroines, kick-butt fight scenes, and unexpected twists, then grab your copy of Cursed by Fire today!",
