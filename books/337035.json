  "description": "BRADYOur quick hellos are followed by drawn out goodbyes.What started out as one fun night turned into a regular thing none of us ever planned for.I can’t walk away from Kit and Prescott. Kit is the stern nurturer I need. He’s the caretaker, the solid presence. Prescott enables my wild ways. He’s someone I can have fun with. They couldn’t be more perfect for me.But come graduation, I have to move across the country, and geography isn’t our only obstacle. Being in a relationship with two men isn’t good for my public image, my brother’s NFL career, or the media frenzy that surrounds my famously queer family.We have a plan to meet up once a year, but with every reunion, every brief visit, we fall deeper.There has to be a breaking point, something that will end it for us, or soon it will be impossible to say goodbye at all.",
