  "description": "SAVAGE TERROR WAITS UNDER A DARKENING MOON. Seeking to escape her psychopathic husband, Jessica Lobato flees Chicago with her five-year-old daughter Megan. Reaching the small town of Hope Springs, Oklahoma, they rent a trailer house out in the country and think they're finally safe. But this small town has a very dark secret; one that emerges when the moon is full. A pack of werewolves hides amongst the populace and secretly kills selected people to satisfy their hunger. Megan is the next chosen by the pack to be devoured during the upcoming full eclipse of the moon. Jessica is about to learn there are worse things to fear in the night than a murderous husband. Ebon Moon is a tense, bestial tale of lycanthrope horror the way a werewolf novel should be.",
