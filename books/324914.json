  "description": "Curiosity is all around us. You just need to explore it. This book is doing exactly that - exploring various questions and hypotheseses about past, present and future world and society we're living in. How would a human child develop without external influence and love?Is social media leading society into oblivion & abyss?What is the impact of too much information on humans, their depression, and anxiety?What will sex robots do to humanity?What would happen to the world if we all stopped spending money?How would people behave if there were no laws?What would happen if a modern human was transferred 2000 years from now in history?What would happen without electricity for a year?If you've wondered about these and and many other questions then you're in the right place.What you are going to read is by no means scientifically accurate in every way or a complete truth, but it is one man's reflections on different topics with a pinch of creativity. A good part of the book is supported by various research, but a good portion is open to the imagination. \"I wrote this book, to share my view, which can be correct, it can be fictional and imaginable, but it is curious and explorational in many ways. That is the essence of writing - to explore your mind while bringing fiction closer to nonfiction.\" - Domagoj PernarThe book consists of 18 chapters that are not connected subjectwise but are somehow connected in curiosity. Those chapters are structured to make you question your foundations of thinking and consider difficult subjects.",
