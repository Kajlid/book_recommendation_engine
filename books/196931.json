  "description": "An online connection.Masked by anonymity.No cameras. No pictures.Curiosity ignited to intrigue. I thought I knew what I was getting into, but had no idea how far we would go... My intention was to test the waters, dip my toe in the wading pool. Instead I surrendered to the world of seduction and submission as he submerged me--body, mind, and soul--into an ocean of eroticism.  Emails, texts, and hidden identities, were one thing. But now, coming face-to-face with the mystery man, the star of my fantasies, both terrifies and completely thrills me. If all goes according to plan, he will intensify the exquisite bond we share by transporting me to that glorious intersection between agony and ecstasy. If not, everything we've built will come crashing down around us, destroying my dreams in the process.Either way, there is no going back. Because I want more. Much more.He always says, \"For every ounce of pleasure, a price must be paid.\" And I am going to pay...Warning: If you’re not a fan of dirty talk or dominant alpha males, “Her Web Master” may not be for you, but if you're looking for a filthy online boyfriend who will make your toes curl, meet Sophie’s mysterious Dom.",
