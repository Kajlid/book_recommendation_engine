  "title": "Zombie Apocalypse Preparation: How to Survive in an Undead World and Have Fun Doing It!",
  "description": "We guarantee this is the only tool you need to survive the zombie. OK, that's not really true. But when the SHTF you're going to want a survival guide that's not just geared toward day-to-day survival. You'll need one that addresses the essential skills for true nourishment of the human spirit. Living through the end of the world isn't worth a damn unless you can enjoy yourself in any way you want. (Except, of course, for anything having to do with abuse. We could never condone such things. At least the publisher's lawyers say we can't.) We can't guarantee this guide will save your life. But we can guarantee it will keep you smiling while the living dead are chowing down on you.",
