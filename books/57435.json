  "title": "Panzer Gunner: From my Native Canada to the German Ostfront and Back: In Action with 25th Panzer Regiment, 7th Panzer Division 1944-45",
  "description": "The bulk of the book is a detailed account of the author’s training, and his subsequent service with 25th Panzer Regiment, part of 7th Panzer Division. Bruno Friesen served as a gunner aboard, initially Panzer IV’s, before crewing the lesser-known Japdpanzer IV tank hunter. Apart from providing a large fund of information about specific German tanks and their combat performance, the author writes in great detail about the combat they experienced on the Eastern Front. If one wants to know how German tank crews fought the Soviets in the last year of the war, then this book provides an outstanding account, containing material simply not found elsewhere.",
