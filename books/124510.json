  "description": "While exploring in the forest with Big Bear, Little Bear sets out on his own adventures. All by himself, he finds a rock to climb and a branch to bounce on. And every step of the way, Big Bear is nearby to praise him for a job well done. But when Little Bear tries to cross a stream, he finds himself in trouble. Of course, Big Bear is always there to lend a reassuring hand. Now, the award-winning team of Waddell and Firth tell another classic tale about the love and support that all Big Bears give their Little Bears.",
