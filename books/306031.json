Not much has changed in the small town I once called home—like the things that drove me away in the first place. But it only takes me a few hours to find the one sexy, tattooed, and bearded change I can’t seem to resist. Parker Lancaster: Cocky. Crass. In desperate need of someone to clean up my mess. Mia MacTavish is prim, proper, and extremely off limits… But I can’t keep my hands off of her. I know I should stay away. She’s got a kid and no plans to stay in Midland. Even knowing who she is, I’d be a fool not to take the one night she offers. Then things get even more complicated when she comes back wanting more… Can you really keep a secret in a small town?   Pit stop is a MF contemporary small town single mom workplace romance and the third book in the Midland Springs Romance series.
