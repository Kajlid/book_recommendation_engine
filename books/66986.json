  "description": "Lady Vivian Worth knows perfectly well how to behave like a lady. But observing proper manners when no one is around to impress is just plain silly. When Luke Forest, the newly named Duke of Foxhaven, arrives early to visit his bride-to-be, he catches Vivian acting most unladylikeâ€”in her chemise. Though amused by her unconventional ways, Luke hadn't planned on marrying such a sprightly and opinionated lady. He'll just have to find her another husband. But can he stand to see the vivacious woman in the arms of someone else?",
