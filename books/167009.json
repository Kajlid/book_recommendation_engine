  "description": "It is a time of cruel frost giants, dark elves, mystical ogre mages, wicked were-beasts, disgruntled dwarves, prophesized Eulideans, and gateways to other realms.  Frost giants and dark elves threaten Midheim.  Armed with weapons of magic, Farling and his friends find themselves battling ancient foes as they seek to prevent their realm from harm.  While the giant wyrm gnaws at the roots of the World Tree, maintaining a balance between chaos and order, many enemies of Midheim seek to tip the balance of power in their favor.  In a strange twist of fate, Farling and his friends unexpectedly find themselves being trained how to fight monsters by an Ogre Mage.  But is the ogre a friend or merely a minion for the dark elves?  With their enemies many, their friends few, Farling and his friends must use all their wits and skills as they strive to save their realm from harm and protect the prophesized Eulidean from capture.",
