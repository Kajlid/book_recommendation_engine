And legends of magic and vampires, nothing more than a bunch of hocus pocus stuffed within book pages or painted on the big screen.But when a woman, no one else can see, enters her office and delivers a riddle filled warning about her intended fate, Gabrian's grip on sanity takes a big hit—terrified she is falling into madness.As Gabrian untangles secrets of her past, she discovers a powerful, hidden world of magic in which there is no return.Now, she must choose a side.To walk in the light… or to run within the shadows of darkness.",
