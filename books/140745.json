  "description": "If she was such a good fortune-teller, she should've seen it coming. But part-time Tarot-reader Selena Moon is as surprised as anyone when Jim Bishop, the bad boy she left behind, returns from who-knows-where to reclaim the one girl he could never forget. Torn between her new life down South and family obligations up North, Selena has no time for love, romance, or any other complication. And who can blame her? The first guy to claim her heart, along with her innocence, spoiled her for the safer, easier guys who came after. Armed, dangerous, and still smarting from Selena's teary rejection years earlier, Bishop vowed never to return to the city of his youth, where he excelled at two things – inviting trouble and making a mess of things, particularly his relationship with the only girl he ever loved. She's fearful of repeating the past. He's never been afraid of anything – until now. Because with murder and mayhem surrounding Selena, fate, along with an unwelcome rival, might steal her away before he finally has the chance to win her back for now and always. This standalone new adult novel of over 120,000 words features mature content, sexual situations, and adult language. It's not advised for underage readers.",
