  "description": "A reunion to end all reunions Since their separation years ago, Sean Maddock has imagined a lot of scenarios where he and Kristine would get back together. So finally getting served with divorce papers is a real shock. It's not until he seeks out Kristine and feels the same hot kick of desire that he suddenly knows why—he still wants his wife! Clearly it's time to move on. But before Sean signs on the dotted line to end their marriage, he wants one more weekend. Just the two of them, closed up in an isolated cabin. Surely by Sunday night they will have played out all their sexy memories—maybe even made a few new ones. Then he'll be able to walk away…or not!",
