  "description": "A top-secret British operation is underway to uncover facts regarding Soviet missiles in Germany. The government lures a German-speaking Pole turned Englishman, Fred Leiser, back from retirement to reverse potential international upheaval. Michael Jayston accompanies the listener on a fascinating insider's tour of an international spy network and introduces the dedicated and complicated cast of characters who risk all to carry out their missions. Jayston exposes the unabashed greed of the government's motives as its members manipulate the rusty Leiser. The mission through Germany is elaborate and demanding, and Jayston's description of Leiser's dire predicament never loses momentum.",
