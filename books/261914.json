  "description": "Test pilot Sam Reese used to have all the \"right stuff.\" Now ... well, he isn't so sure. He survived the crash of his plane, but it's still up for grabs whether he'll survive the shocking and extraordinary results of his brush with death. When he picks Bourner's Crossing, Upper Peninsula, Michigan, population 213, as a likely place to lick his wounds--and to hide his light under a bushel--he doesn't plan on getting the hots for the local nurse midwife... Sexy, nurturing Kate Morgan sees straight through the cracks in Sam's shattered armor, and she aches to give him the compassion and tenderness his tortured soul needs. If only he'll let her. If only she can show him that, no matter how far or fast he runs, he can't escape fate--or love.",
