  "title": "Denied Tenure: Clifton's First Day",
  "description": "All Clifton Beck ever wanted was to be a college professor. He graduated from the best schools in the country and settled into a job where he was comfortable. But, being a terrific researcher and producing quality work didn't seem to matter – Clifton’s tenure was denied.Clifton's denial left him with limited options, the best of which involved moving in with his 95 year-old grandmother in Florida and teaching high school. Clifton reluctantly takes the job and rent-free housing offer from his grandmother, who turns out not to be most traditional geriatric. This first short story in the Denied Tenure series recounts the first day that Clifton spends as a teacher at Washington Irving High School. He encounters students, teachers, and a superstitious principal that test his limits in every way possible.",
