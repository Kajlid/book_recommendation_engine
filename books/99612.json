  "description": "Noel Wright is stuck in Sin City, in a rut doing the same things and seeing the same people every day until a sexy stranger ordering dessert—and not just that on the menu—turns Noel’s predictable world upside down. Kai, a member of a popular Korean pop group lives a charmed and glamorous life, surrounded by everything he could ever want and yet he feels empty and stuck. A chance meeting at a local casino diner sets his ordered world careening happily out of control as a luscious, full-figured waitress sends his closed heart into a tailspin. When these two complete opposites meet, worlds collide and sparks fly and the world of K-Pop will never be the same again. But will a meddling uncle, an unforgiving public, a secret admirer, a jealous friend, and Kai’s unruly group mates bring the couple together or ultimately tear them apart?",
