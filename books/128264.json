  "description": "Witty, warm, and poignant, food blogger Sasha Martin's memoir about cooking her way to happiness and self-acceptance is a culinary journey like no other. Over the course of 195 weeks, food writer and blogger Sasha Martin set out to cook-and eat-a meal from every country in the world. As cooking unlocked the memories of her rough-and-tumble childhood and the loss and heartbreak that came with it, Martin became more determined than ever to find peace and elevate her life through the prism of food and world cultures. From the tiny, makeshift kitchen of her eccentric, creative mother, to a string of foster homes, to the house from which she launched her own cooking adventure, Martin's heartfelt, brutally honest memoir reveals the power of cooking to bond, to empower, and to heal-and celebrates the simple truth that happiness is created from within.\"This beautifully written book is both poignant and uplifting. Not to mention delicious. It's an amazing family tale that reminds me of The Glass Castle, but with more food. And not just any food: We're talking cinnamon raisin pizza.\" -A.J. Jacobs, author of The Year of Living Biblically\"Life From Scratch is an unconventional love story. This beautiful book begins with the quest of cooking a meal from every country-a noble feat of it's own!-but then turns it into something far beyond a kitchen adventure. Be prepared to be changed as you experience Sasha's journey for yourself.\" -Chris Guillebeau, author of The Happiness Pursuit",
