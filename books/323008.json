My daughter will always come first, but when Ari gets under my skin, will I find the courage to love again?Or will the lure and danger of my old profession prove to be the only commitment I’m able to make?Join Seth and Ari as they navigate love after loss, and come face to face with the most chaotic family either has ever met.
