  "description": "Where Can You Turn for HopeWhen the Hurt Runs Deep? At some point in life, every one of us will face the dark pain of heartache and despair, a hurt that pierces so deep we’re left gasping with  Why me? Why now? What have I done to deserve this? Will the pain ever go away? How can God just stand by and let this happen? What do I have left to hope for?  Writing from insights she has gained, not only through her own valleys of deep hurt but also from years of study and counseling others through their pain, Kay Arthur points the way toward genuine healing. With candor, grace, and vulnerability, she invites you to join her on a journey toward wholeness as you exchange your fears and frustrations, hurts and disappointments for a hope that will never disappoint.",
