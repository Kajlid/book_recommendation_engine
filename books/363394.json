  "description": "College students Jeremy and Ryan both have rocky pasts, but when Ryan discovers his friend has a dangerous fascination for gay bondage, he decides to show Jeremy that giving up control isn’t safe or sexy.

Lust drives them both deeper into a 24/7 lifestyle, but neither of them is prepared to deal with the emotional backlash.When fear threatens to destroy their relationship, Jeremy has to not only submit but also find a way to help his Master heal well enough to admit to his own needs. If Jeremy can find a way to confront the past, maybe he can repair their relationship and rediscover their balance as Dominant and submissive. If he fails, they both lose.Reader Jeremy and Ryan both make some unsafe choices and decisions. Their way is by no means a safe exploration of BDSM. Don’t try this at home!",
