  "description": "Karla Black had everything she ever wanted until the night tragedy tore her world apart, stealing her husband and her identity in one vicious twist. Twelve months later Karla is a shadow of the woman she used to be, struggling through her grief, living with bankrupt emotions, and resisting any suggestion that God might give her a second chance at love.  Ian McAlister was a helpless bystander as breast cancer took his beloved wife from him one breath at a time. As days of grief turn into months, Ian begins to dwell on the vow she elicited from him before her death. Promise me that you won’t grieve for too long. But how will he know when it’s time?  Two broken hearts, two futures destroyed by death, until a chance meeting in an unexpected place kindles a friendship between Karla and Ian that rockets into a romance neither one anticipated. Can they overcome their grief and the objection of family members to grab onto the surprising future that God has for them?",
