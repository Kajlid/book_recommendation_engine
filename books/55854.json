  "description": "I woke up with this thing on my wrist, the thing I'm using to write this, I know it's called an Opal but I don't know HOW I know that. I don't even really know why I'm writing, except that I feel like I have to--and that maybe it'll help me figure things out. I can't get anything straight inside my head, everything's fuzzy and it's difficult to focus. Edges keep slipping away.I'm in a ... maze. Or a prison. Everything's perfectly black and white--the colours, I mean, not the situation. Huh, this situation is anything BUT black and white. I'm wearing a dress, for a start, explain that! It was probably really pretty before it got all torn and dirty, I don't know how, it was like that when I woke up. I'm not in such good shape either, I'm bruised and aching and I've got weird scratches all over my arms and my left eye is a little swollen--I can see myself in the reflection of my Opal's screen. I can see myself, and I know my face, it's familiar to me, but ... but ...... but I don't know who I am ...\"Hidden Power\" is the third book in the Charlotte Powers series.",
