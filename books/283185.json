  "title": "Johnny Thunders: In Cold Blood",
  "description": "Thirteen years after its initial publication, Johnny Thunder's authorized biography has been resurrected and revised. The cult bible of all things Thunders, it is the definitive portrait of the condemned man of rock 'n' roll, from the baptism of fire and tragedy that was the New York Dolls, through the junkie punk years of the Heartbreakers and beyond. It is an unflinching account of a unique guitarist whose drug problems often overshadowed his considerable style and talent, and whose influence on such bands as The Sex Pistols and Guns N' Roses is still resonant.",
