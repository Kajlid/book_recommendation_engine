A twin brother I miss. A lifetime of penance to be paid. But regret consumes me, and what-if’s haunt me. How do you forgive the irreversible errors of a boy, trying too hard to be a man? Emerson Lane. She’s my how.Warm. Passionate. Unexpected. She’s everything good in this world. She makes me feel dangerous things. Hopeful things.Redemption isn’t something I thought I’d ever find. Until the keeper of my second chance found me.",
