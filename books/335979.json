It seems the perfect match-except Livia, possessed by the spirit of a fiery reader who dropped the novel before reaching the end, is determined to change her fate as an Empress destined to die a violent death.Royal intrigue, assassination plots and political turmoil are the least of Livia's worries, of course. When she enters a magical marriage contract with Croft to rehabilitate his image, each swearing to divorce when they fall in love with someone else, forces beyond their control pull Livia and Croft toward a conspiracy that could upend their lives forever.",
