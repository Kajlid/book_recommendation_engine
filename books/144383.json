High-profile, low-risk—just the way Ash likes it.But a violent interruption of the auction throws Ash into a chaotic race against time, where every decision could be fatal.Fast-paced and gripping, The Auction delivers action, suspense, and a minor cliffhanger that promises more to come from this richly imagined science-fiction world, where the fine line between friend and foe makes trust the ultimate gamble. Perfect for fans of thrilling sci-fi with a twist of intrigue.Note from the I wrote this short story during my early exploration of The Gate. As the world has grown and evolved through my current work-in-progress, Threads of the Weaver, I see how it connects to the larger narrative and plan to revisit it in the future. By reading or purchasing this early work, you’re directly supporting the development of The Gate and its ongoing stories—thank you for being part of the journey!",
