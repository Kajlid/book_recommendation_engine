  "description": "The offer of a lifetime. Or maybe a nightmare...  I’ve always wanted to be a writer and here’s my chance. My job is to spin every story about Nash into something good. If I do my job I’ll get a book deal. It should be easy...  Yeah, Nash is nothing but d*ckhead lust with a pulse.  Yeah, I may have had a couple dreams of him before I met him. But getting too close to me is forbidden. If he tries anything crazy, his rock star life is over. I’m the daughter of the executive with the deal on the table. He touches me and there’s no deal.  So now I’m nothing but temptation. A role I’ve never played before. A role I’m not sure of. Because the first thing I learn when dealing with rock stars...  They will do anything to get what they want. And right now, Nash wants me.",
