  "description": "This is a two–part BBC adaptation of Toby Hadoke's sensational stand–up show about Doctor Who, fandom, and one man's lifelong obsession.Toby Hadoke was born to love Doctor Who. To Toby—a shy, weedy kid whose dad had left home—the Doctor was a hero, and the show a lifeline he clung to throughout his childhood. He kept the faith when other boys mocked him, girlfriends dumped him, and (worst of all) Doctor Who was cancelled. After living in the closet for 16 years, finally the time has arrived to come out and admit it: yes, he is a Doctor Who fan and proud of it. Climb aboard award–winning comedian Toby Hadoke's TARDIS on a trip through time, charting the rise, fall, and rise again of a television legend through his voice–overs and reminiscences. A swift, personal, satirical, and razor–sharp comic odyssey from child to man, through obsession, joy, and disappointment, this will thrill and delight both hardcore fans and those who wouldn't know a Slitheen from a Silurian.",
