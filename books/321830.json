Bad news.I'm their nanny, even worse.Yet, their relationship is toxic.A one night stand gone wrong.An attempt to make things right for a baby he didn't know he even wanted.I'm not in the position to be in the middle of that...Yet, there's something there...Something between us that's undeniable.This isn't going to end well...",
