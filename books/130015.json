  "description": "Dr. Gail Phillips steps onto the shores of Loch Ness to disprove the Loch Ness monster theory for good so everyone can stop wasting their time. As a marine biologist with a background in archeology, she's convinced all of the world's myths such as Big Foot, the Tasmanian devil, and even Nessie are lies. Her father disappeared while following Yettie tracks in the Alps, and she doesn't want to lose another mislead soul.Flynn Maloney comes from a family of fanatic cryptozoologists. As a native of Scotland, he believes in Nessie as strongly as Gail believes in science. Despite his initial attraction for her, he's joined her research team to prove her wrong. He wants to find Nessie for a special girl in his life, to show her dreams really can come true.As they conduct sonar studies and sweeps of the lake, their differing opinions are at odds with their budding attraction. Gail doesn't believe in anything unscientific, such as romance, thinking the charming Flynn Maloney is full of baloney. Flynn can't believe he's falling for someone with no imagination or faith. To make matters worse, their videographer is covering his true identity. Together they must unravel his plan before he destroys everything they are working for. Will Gail force Flynn to question his faith, or will she discover more than she bargained for in the Scottish highlands?",
