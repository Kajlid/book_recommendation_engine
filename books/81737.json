  "description": "The scribe Sarah married Darius, and at times she feels as if she has married the Persian aristocracy too. But there is another point she did not expect in her marriage—Sarah has grown to love her husband. She has wealth, property, honor, and power, yet securing her husband's love seems unattainable. And though Darius has been on numberless battlefields facing fierce enemies, he finds himself standing before Sarah with a fear he has never before felt—all because he wishes to express the truth to his wife.A hidden message, treachery, opposition, and a God-given success, will lead to an unlikely bounty.",
