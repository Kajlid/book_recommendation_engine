  "title": "Where Hunting Dogs Rest",
  "description": "Every winter throughout Spain it is estimated that up to one hundred thousand hunting dogs are abandoned or killed at the end of the hare-coursing season when they are no longer needed, perform badly, or are too old. This book portrays dogs that have been rescued and sets them against the landscapes in Spain where they are typically abandoned. Shot in a style that references the tone and mood of Velázquez, who painted at a time when these dogs were treated with great respect, Martin Usborne's photographs show both the classical beauty of the animals and the ugliness of their modern situation.",
