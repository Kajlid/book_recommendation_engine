  "description": "Dangerously sexy nobleman and former spymaster Rayne Kenyon, Earl of Haviland, has no interest in love.

Rayne makes a surprising choice of brides by settling on the plain spinster daughter of a fellow spy who once saved his life. Yet spirited, witty Madeline Ellis proves much more than he bargained for...\n\nBut who could imagine that a simple marriage of convenience can suddenly be flooded with danger, desire, and unexpected love?",
