  "title": "Tristan Stone and the Battle for Praetoria",
  "description": "In Tristan Stone’s newly discovered elemental world, society is divided by four elements. Aquaknights. Dragonites. Praetorians. Aerossians. For Tristan, who knows nothing of his past and lost the only person who could give him the answers he needs, it’s complicated. As the trials begin on Praetoria, Tristan must determine who his true friends are and what, if any, place romance has in his new life. Weapon training, Elementus, and control of water are just a few of the Aquaknight skills Tristan must master. Throw into the mix a stubborn, beautiful, and fiery Kali Marks, and he may have more than he can handle. Getting schooled in the ways of Praetoria, he must find the strength of his own bloodline as an Aquaknight before it’s too late and he loses those he loves and Praetoria is changed forever. Little does he know, his bloodline represents the greatest threat.",
