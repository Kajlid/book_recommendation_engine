  "description": "The Top End of Australia—a tropical paradise filled with beauty. Wonder. Danger. For two young boys growing up, the remote beaches and aqua waters of the Northern Territory provide a playground of adventure. So it is for half-Aboriginal Jarrah Yindi and his best friend Luke Lawson, who spend their summers diving for pearls and dodging Old Salty, a man-eating crocodile, under the stormy summer skies of Darwin.And as the boys grow older, their friendship gradually becomes a need to be together, and slowly something more blossoms. But for two teenage boys, falling in love is very different to understanding love.As they teeter on the brink of manhood, as life beyond school looms like a summer storm—at once exciting and terrifying—will life tear the two friends apart?Or will love keep them together forever?",
