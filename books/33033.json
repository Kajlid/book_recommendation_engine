  "title": "Elective Affinities",
  "description": "Elective Affinities was written when Goethe was sixty and long established as Germany's literary giant. This is a new edition of his penetrating study of marriage and passion, bringing together four people in an inexorable manner. The novel asks whether we have free will or not and confronts its characters with the monstrous consequences of repressing what little \"real life\" they have in themselves, a life so far removed from their natural states that it appears to them as something terrible and destructive.",
