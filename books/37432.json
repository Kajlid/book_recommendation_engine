  "description": "[Siren Classic Erotic Alternative Futuristic Sci-Fi Romance, M/M, shape-shifters] Mo doesn't know what to do with Mykel. He's new to the future he's living in and doesn't understand half of what people tell him, let alone show him. When Mykel insists that they are mates, Mo's set to run in the other direction. Mykel knows Mo is his mate the second he lays eyes on the sexy human. He packs up everything he owns and leaves his family to join his mate on board the Lady Blue. Life would be perfect if only his mate would accept him. Trouble follows the crew of the Lady Blue crew with every turn, and Mo and Mykel are no exception. When plans backfire and go wrong, saving each other just might be easier than admitting that they belong together. But the past won't be forgotten, and when Mo goes on a wild mission doomed to failure, Mykel races to his rescue, refusing to give up on the one man that makes him feel whole. Now, it's just a matter of saving Mo from himself. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
