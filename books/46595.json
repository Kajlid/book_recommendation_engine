  "description": "Robotics researcher Henry Travis uses his brain for just about everything, but once he meets Nick Shelton over the hood of his 1960 Mercedes 300, he's at a loss. How does he control his attraction to this brash, sexy mechanic?Nick owns his own classic car garage, and he is more than willing to hit it with the brainy, seriously hot, Henry. What he doesn't need is the aggro that comes with feelings. But since his 14yo nephew, Grant, has come to live with him, he's been dealing with aggravation every day. And now his dad lives with him, too. A dad who doesn't mind commenting on Nick's lame parenting skills.With Henry turning his crank in a big way, and Nick enjoying not being in charge for a change, things heat up pretty fast. They're actually dating, with dinner and everything, before he knows it. And the after-dinner drinks at Henry's gorgeous house have Nick wiping the sweat from his brow.But Henry and Grant don't get along; Nick isn't sure he wants a relationship at all, and Nick's dad, Big Mike, has an opinion on everything.How's a guy to have fun on the weekends - even during the week, for crying out loud - with all the family baggage hanging around?",
