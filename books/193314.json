  "description": "Damien's always been afraid of heights, but he's never been afraid of fieldwork or of being in the spotlight. At least, he wasn't before the galaâ€”the one where his grandpa nearly caused a massacre and heroes from the League almost killed his best friend. Now he finds himself dreading the very things he used to love, and all he wants is to skate by in school, avoid fieldwork, and keep a low profile.But avoiding his fears isn't as easy as he hopes, especially when the school decides to send him and his best friend to hunt down a dangerous criminal. And as if that isn't bad enough, it turns out he also has to pass a flying test if he wants to make it through the school year, even though his debilitating fear of heights means it's pretty much impossible.In order to pass the test and catch a criminal, Damien accepts help from unlikely allies. But when his mission goes south and he accidentally lets a terrible weapon fall into the wrong hands, he'll have to overcome his doubts and save his friends from a psychotic killer bent on using his worst fears against him.",
