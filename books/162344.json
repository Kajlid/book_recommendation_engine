  "description": "How hard would you be willing to fight, to fulfill your dreams? What would be your breaking point? Angela and Jason Vesely had a simple wish: to have a baby and start their family together. A common desire of most couples, but not always so easy for a growing number of the population. Their story of reaching a seemingly average goal is anything but typical. Were they able to conquer the extreme circumstances they faced on their unimaginable journey? This is the story of the Vesely’s battle for their son. An adoption agency and birth mother want to take back a 3-month old baby boy from a couple who wanted to give him a loving home after learning that the adoptive mother was pregnant. The 22-year old biological mother (who had signed away all parental rights) said that she wanted the parents who adopted her son to not have their own biological children. She wanted them to either raise her son as an only child or to adopt if they wanted to expand their family (Does she have the right to dictate these terms?). But Jason and Angela Vesely say they didn’t purposely hide Angela’s pregnancy when they applied to adopt two years prior; as this is an impossibility. They were guardedly optimistic about this pregnancy because Angela had miscarried three times before. They say they were never asked whether she was pregnant or not and were never told of the birth mothers wishes for no biological children. They loved their adopted son as if he was their own and an agency wanted to take him away. A court battle ensued.",
