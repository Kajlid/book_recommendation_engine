Dangerous secrets…and a girl who could offer ultimate peace or devastation to this precarious new world.Far from now, after an asteroid has destroyed society on earth as we know it, humanity has been plunged back into dark middle ages. Warring realms dominate the land with secret plots and cruel leaders. Only a select few have any link to the glories of the past world. These descendants alone have access to the technology and knowledge of their ancestors, kept hidden for them in special time capsules.

On her eighteenth birthday, she’ll finally have access to her time capsule, rumored to be the most powerful of all. After spending the last twelve years in hiding from her villainous brother, now the king, she’s about to find out what the old world has destined for her. First, though, she’ll have to survive a deadly attack, being kidnapped by a warrior from an enemy land, and her own greatest fears. She’ll find the lines between enemy and friend blurred, making trust both necessary and dangerous. Emmy’s led a sheltered life, but she’s no pampered princess. She’s spirited and determined to fight her way to freedom, but is she prepared for the future she’s about to enter?",
