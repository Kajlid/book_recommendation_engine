What could it be?\"She’s had it forever. A tiny mark on her hand. No big deal, right?

Bunderson is one part fantasy, one part mystery, one part romance, and all parts awesome. Join Tori as she learns to master her new found powers and discovers what her mark really means. Full of suspense, The Mark is an addicting read you won’t be able to put down.",
