So preoccupied is Pascoe that he hardly notices the uproar in his own department. Eight female animal rights protesters have unearthed human bones on the grounds of a drug company’s research headquarters.Yorkshire police superintendent Andrew Dalziel, a man of prodigious appetite, falls quickly for one of the activists: a generously endowed woman who calls herself Cap Marvell. While Dalziel begins to dally, the investigation into the unidentified corpse collides with the mystery of Pascoe’s disgraced great-grandfather and a high-stakes pharmaceutical research project. Suddenly the Yorkshire woods are giving up their darkest secrets: of animal instincts, human passions, and a conspiracy that has killed once, and will do so again...",
