  "title": "Penelope: A Novel of New Amsterdam",
  "description": "In 1640s Amsterdam, the richest city in Europe, near-penniless Penelope Kent dreams of voyaging to America to search for her merchant-father who disappeared on a secretive get-rich-quick scheme. To voyage requires a husband or guardian. Matthew, her betrothed, dreams of finding a new home in America for his congregation of English Separatists like the Pilgrims did a generation ago. But the elders of Matthew’s congregation accuse Penelope of immoral behavior that threatens to expel Penelope from the congregation, from Matthew’s life, and from her dream. She can't wait to escape Amsterdam but never imagines the dangers that await her in the New World.Note to genealogists: This story is inspired by the real-life adventures of the person variously known as Penelope Kent, Penelope Lent, Penelope Prince, Penelope Thompson, Penelope Stout, Penelope van Princes, and Penelope van Princen.",
