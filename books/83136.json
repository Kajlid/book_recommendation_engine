  "title": "Roamer",
  "description": "At twenty years old, Harper expected herself to be working hard in college, meeting new people, dating the boy of her dreams, and arguing with her family about her life decisions. Instead, she’s trekking, night and day, across state lines and running from the nightmares known as Roamers. She owns nothing but the clothes on her back, a limited amount of supplies in her bag and the well-used machete strapped to her hip. Her family and friends are dead and she has no idea where she’s going. She only knows that if she doesn’t keep moving, the Roamers will find her. Decaying bodies and gnashing teeth, Roamers want nothing more than a warm, fleshy body to sink their teeth into. Harper’s only goal each day is to keep herself from becoming another victim of the Roamer virus that has decimated the world’s population. Harper travels alone, rarely coming in contact other uninfected people, until she meets Desiree and West – A twelve year old girl with a gun slung over her shoulder and a man with more than enough hatred to go around. And when West shoves a gun in Harper’s face as a warm greeting, she is forced to travel with them and endure their ridiculous rules that go against every survival instinct she has. When unexpected events and unexplainable occurrences arise, Harper must figure out who she trusts and what she’s going to do with the accumulating evidence that a Roamer bite might be something more than just a death sentence. In a world full of Roamers, desperate people and unspeakable violence, Harper wonders how she’s going to survive and keep her final promise she made to her brother.",
