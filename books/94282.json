  "title": "Deadly Resurrection",
  "description": "A mysterious murder. A tragic accident. And the newspaper story of the millennium. Who would want to kill Lawrence Smyth? Nobel Laureate biologist and University of Chicago professor, Smyth's ground-breaking work on cellular regeneration died with him - at least so it seemed until he suddenly and unexpectedly came back to life in the morgue. His impossible claim to have perfected a miracle drug capable of restoring the recently deceased would seem an incredible hoax but for his credentials and the unavoidable fact of his recent resurrection. Agatha Dupree, veteran reporter at the Tattler, a tabloid with pretensions of literacy, finds herself caught between her own deeply ingrained cynicism and her concern for her colleague Michael Groff's daughter, clinging to life in a local ICU. With Smyth's attacker still at large and Magdalene at death's door, Agatha is torn between solving the mystery and stealing one of the two remaining doses of the life-giving formula. Racing against the clock and with the perpetrator close on her heels, the ending to this resurrection will be a deadly one unless Agatha can unravel the clues in time. An Agatha Dupree mystery series novel.",
