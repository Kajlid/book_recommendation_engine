  "title": "We Can't Help It If We're From Florida",
  "description": "Florida is more than just fodder for hard-boiled crime novels and zany farces. This anthology of new stories and essays challenges a star-studded line up of current and former Floridians to write about the state through a literary lens, though not without the requisite weirdness. The Florida within this book contains: lightning, oil spills, road rage, a lizard tied to a balloon, swimmers, sleepwalkers, characters that love Florida, characters that hate Florida, and at least three sinkholes.Anthology contributors:Lindsay Hunter Kevin Moffett Lidia Yuknavitch Jeff Parker Laura van den Berg Sarah Gerard Jaquira DÃ­az Alissa Nutting Kristen Arnett Sohrab Homi Fracis Derrick Austin John Brandon Jason Ockert Michael J.
