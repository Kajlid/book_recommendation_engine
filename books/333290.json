In the wake of the River Pack’s annual Mating Pull, twenty-year-old wolf, Sóley, may have found her one true mate in the Alpha’s son, Kanoa, but the fight for their future has only just begun. With pack law stating Kanoa must mark a wolf of the Socialite rank, Sóley now has one chance to prove to the Alpha Council and the entire River Pack that she’s worthy of the Beta-to-be. The Socialite test won’t be easy, but being in Kanoa’s arms feels like home, and she’ll do anything to stay there.With the pack heatedly divided over Sóley’s rank promotion, Kanoa wishes he could do more to secure her place by his side. But with rogue wolves stalking dangerously close to the border, and warnings of an imminent attack, it’s all he can do to keep her safe. It’s unclear if Sóley is the target or if she’s merely a convenient scapegoat for a far more sinister plot, but Kanoa soon discovers his father has been keeping secrets, leaving him to question his own ability to lead. When the escalating pack unrest places Sóley’s life in danger, Kanoa is no longer sure whom he can trust. His happily ever after with Sóley finally feels within reach, but what if it comes at a price they’re not willing to pay?This is a sweet, PG-13, fade to black romance.",
