  "description": "THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE MEETS THE DAY OF THE JACKAL IN A “POWERFUL! BRILLIANT! SEXY!” ( Publisher's Weekly ) HISTORICAL THRILLER .Sole survivor of a top secret CIA mind-control experiment, Zeb Marlowe, has begun to remake his shattered psyche, when Jai Jai Leland, the beautiful young widow of a man who didn't survive, asks him to help her solve the mystery of her husband's violent death. Pulled into her dangerous quest despite himself, Marlowe and Jai Jai search for Dr. Victor Ressid, creator of the illegal experiment that ravaged Marlowe’s mind — and turned ordinary, decent people into killing machines. Meanwhile, stripped of his medical credentials and in thrall to perverse erotic desires, Ressid is consumed by fantasies of revenge against Marlowe, the only subject to defy him. Against an ominous background of escalating global terror, Marlowe and Jai Jai must risk their lives to stop a nuclear threat — even as they wonder if Marlowe, too, has been turned into a human time bomb. International in scope, Code MK-Ultra takes place on the beautiful islands of the Caribbean, in Damascus and Dublin, in the Philippines, Washington, DC, and in an underground torture chamber located on Victor Ressid's secluded private estate located near the Mexico-Belize border. Although fiction, Code MK-Ultra is based on illegal real-life psychiatric experiments conducted on human subjects by the CIA in American and Canadian universities in the 1960s and 1970s concurrent with the violent protests against the Vietnam War and the unravelling of the Watergate scandals.",
