  "description": "Everyone has or had an imaginary friend in their lives one time or another, but what did yours tell you to do? Does yours tell you to cheat, kill, or destroy? Or do they simply talk to you at night? Many are afraid to answer these questions, but if one chooses to ignore them, sometimes they can become so real, they will surely over power your mind and every rational thought you ever had; so take some time to investigate the voices that are talking to you, the longer you ignore them, the stronger they will become. Take a look into the life of a small town girl who was constantly abused by her mother and complete strangers. She was hid away from the public by her mother in an old cellar; it was there that she first discovered her ability to create imaginary friends, and once the imaginary friends where formed she sent them all out on revenge killings. But was it the imaginary friends doing the killing or her?",
