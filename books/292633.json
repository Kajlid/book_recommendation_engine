But her childhood nemesis won't set her free without a service.Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone witch extraordinaire, has been summoned into action.

Without Gideon's sword, Harrow will fail, and the Ninth House will die.Of course, some things are better left dead.",
