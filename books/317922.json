Memory Glue. To brew it, Alexis just needs eight ingredients: stuff like nose hair from a baku (dream-eater), sweat from a duyung (sea siren) and...OK. Maybe some are tricky to find in local supermarkets. To obtain them Alexis must journey to a realm where the fabled creatures from Grandpa's folktales are alive in the flesh (and often flesh-eating). At least she'll have fun company: the nasty kenit (forest imp) who'd cast the horrible spell on Grandpa, and her no-nonsense Grandma, who harbours a secret that’ll change Alexis' life forever. Piece of cake, right?  Oh, there's also a deadline. Can Grandpa be saved before he's forever lost to the mists within his mind? Based on a true story.",
