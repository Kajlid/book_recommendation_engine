  "description": "Green Foliage spreads, the summer through,When all is fair and the skies are blue, But far more precious are the flowers,That blossom through the darkest hours...E.M.Roberts wrote her journal of poetry in World War 2. Times were very bleak but she rarely lost her sense of humour, or her courage.Her poems give a fascinating insight into life during the war, and we belive that her strong, distinctive voice and lively style will be enjoyed by many.",
