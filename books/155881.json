  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Daphne Werring knows trouble. She's had her fair share of it back in Atlanta, but now that her parents have moved her and her brothers to rural Georgia (more like royal Bored-ga), nothing has changed. A chance encounter with a not-so-ordinary boy leads her to run away on an adventure beyond any she's ever known. From secret underground tunnels to tales of abuse and imprisonment at the Neverland Academy for boys, Daphne, her new friend, Finn, and his band of 'lost' boys embark on a quest to bring the horrific truths to light and to stop the wrongdoings before the headmaster runs them out . . . or worse.",
