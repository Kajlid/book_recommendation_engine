  "description": "Gable Powers had all the makings of everything my father had ever warned me about: a reputation that was anything but stellar, a dirty mouth that had me shivering at the things he uttered in my ear, and a body (oh, God, that body) that was covered in tattoos, all of which added up to a solid ten-point-oh on the bad-boy scale.  The first time I met him, I instantly loathed him.  The second time was even worse.  He was a jerk. He was an ass.  He had secrets.  He was nothing I thought I ever wanted.  So why couldnâ€™t I resist him?  New adult. Not recommended for readers under 17.",
