  "title": "Hurrah For The Blackshirts!: Fascists and Fascism in Britain Between the Wars",
  "description": "Britain is celebrated for having avoided the extremism, political violence, and instability that blighted many European countries between the two world wars. However, disillusionment with parliamentary democracy, outbreaks of fascist violence, and fears of communist subversion in industry and the Empire ran through the entire period. Fascist organizations may have failed to attract the support they achieved elsewhere but fascist ideas were adopted from top to bottom of society and by men and women in all parts of the country. This book will demonstrate for the first time the true spread and depth of fascist beliefs - and the extent to which they were distinctly British.",
