  "description": "There's one thing I need in my life right now and one thing only -- a new job.So I'm stoked when I land a dream gig as a bodyguard for a rock star.But there's definitely one thing I do not need at all -- a complication.Like being wildly attracted to the guy who just hired me.So I vow to do everything I can to deny the intense attraction for the man I'm sworn to protect.All I have to do is ignore it. Eventually it'll go away, right?But that's not what happens one night after a concert...MAYBE THIS TIME is a 14,000-word prequel novella about how Stone and Jackson meet and it leads into their full-length novel ONE TIME ONLY. You don't have to read MAYBE THIS TIME to enjoy ONE TIME ONLY, but you'll likely enjoy this story before the story!",
