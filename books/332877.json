  "description": "When Layla Brennan married her high school sweetheart, Brett Foster, she finally got the big, loving family she’d always his. Now she’s closer to Brett’s parents than he is, partners with his sister in a successful pet-photography business, and confidant to his younger brother. She couldn’t be more of a Foster if she’d been born one. There’s just one Brett wants a divorce. Stunned and heartbroken, Layla turns to the Fosters for comfort, only to realize that losing Brett means losing them as well. What else can she do but sue him for the most valuable thing he’s got–namely, his family. Breaking up may be hard to do, but for Layla and Brett it’s even harder to undo.Fresh, funny, poignant, and brimming with insight into what makes modern families tick–and what can blow them apart– Family Affair proves that in love and war, everything’s relative.",
