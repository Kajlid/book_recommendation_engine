  "description": "Charlie Beresford would rather be doing anything this summer than hauling furniture for a moving company. Come September, he'll be leaving for college, away from the awkwardness of Augustinian Academy, away from his father's constant hints about prospective girlfriends.Then Kevin Conroyâ€”the Mighty KC--joins the moving crew. A star baseball player bound for the big leagues, Charlie is shocked when cool, confident KC suggests hanging out, especially when KC asks him to stay over--and the happiness their connection brings Charlie.But the summer is changing Charlie--putting muscles on his skinny frame, compelling him to face hard truths, showing him how it feels not just to lose your heart but to break someone else's. Funny, sweet, and moving, Tom Mendicino's insightful coming-of-age story perfectly evokes that moment when you stop living life from the safety of the bleachers--and finally step up to home plate.\nPraise for Tom Mendicino's Probation\n\"Thoughtful, textured and poignant. . .an exciting impressive debut.\" --Time Out NY\"A smart, engaging, witty, sad and unusual book about the complicated nature of family and love.\" --Bart Yates29,141",
