  "description": "Snowbound in the middle of nowhere, Haley Granderson's plans for a fresh start in Colorado have been put on hold, but things could be worse considering she's also stuck in an elegant Victorian farmhouse with six of the most charming and ethereally beautiful strangers she's ever seen. One of her beguiling benefactors in particular is proving hard to resist and even though they just met, Haley finds herself falling head over heels in love with him. Kinney Richards is sweet, supermodel sexy, and certifiably crazy--in a cute way. All that only fuels Haley's fascination with him. To top it off, Kinney is convinced they are meant to be together forever and that marrying him would be the beginning of an eternity of romantic bliss. The thing is, Kinney is haunted by his secrets and some of the things he says and does make no sense. Haley has too many issues of her own to deal with that now. But when Kinney is threatened by an old enemy and at risk to lose Haley's love forever, he lays open his heart and lets her step fully into his strange, wondrous world. Now Haley can't possibly say no--especially to the part where her fianc√© has wings.",
