  "description": "With the arrival of a new generation of the Davis-Lewis family, and the opening of an upscale day spa, confidence is finally returning to the small Florida town of Chattahoochee. The triumph over the vicious hate crime that crippled Jake Witherspoon has become a subtle right of passage, hardly mentioned in the day to day hustle and bustle of birthdays and business plans. People are smiling again, the evening news happens to someone else, and the gossip under the Triple C's hair-dryers is finally getting good. Yet, before Piddie's last batch of Cathead Biscuits has a chance to cool, something new is crawling through the tall grass. A prominent citizen is hiding a dirty little secret; one that will shake the community to its roots and leave a legacy of doubt and mistrust that may never heal. Return with us to Chattahoochee, where Southern hospitality, strong family ties, and small town values collide with the darkest side of human nature in a story told with unflappable Southern charm.",
