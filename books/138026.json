  "description": "Cookbook. Copulation. Comedy.Satirical smut with some really great recipes.Sondra’s life is a drama of errors-- a lousy job, and low self-esteem with only a commemorative plate collection to her name. Eduardo is living a fantasy-- a beautiful house and an envy-inducing job as a photographer. But he is crippled by loneliness and his penchant for sleeping around.A once-in-a-lifetime trip to Spain will set the pair on course toward each other; but not without betrayal, accidents and the occasional ménage à trois. Will it be love at first sight? Can they help satisfy each other's needs? What should they eat? We all hunger for sex, and of course, food; Sondra and Eduardo are no different. Mouth Full: Rendezvous & Recipes is a searingly funny and sexy story with a culinary twist. Combining prose and recipes, this novella is not a typical parody but an erotic adventure that will have you laughing-- then running to the kitchen (to cook, make love or maybe both). Warning: Unlike most erotica, this cookbook-cum-novella is intentionally funny and plays with (no pun intended) the romance genre. Don't burn your hands. Readers have been salivating: “Wry, erotic, ironic, gastronomic -- a delightful page-turner!” - Amazon Reviewer “...utter nonsense!” - Goodreads Reviewer “I couldn't wait to get home and try a few things out on my husband...if you know what I mean. Recipes!” - Amazon Reviewer",
