  "description": "I try not to look for trouble, though it always finds me.Now I’m asking for it.I’m going to host a gathering of werecats to discuss the recent changes in our small world, changes I brought about for the most part. I told Hasan I would handle this and I am going to, even if he doesn’t believe in me.For this to work, I need to be vigilant. The humans are watching my every move, my werewolves are vulnerable, and the werecats are a wildcard.Three factions, one city, and years of animosity and treachery between them.And then there’s me: Jacky Leon, or Jacqueline, daughter of Hasan. Werecat representative to humanity, my father’s representative in the Americas, and fiancé to a rogue Alpha werewolf.",
