  "description": "Enter a very private universe: the world of a Maker.... It is an infinity born from emptiness. A world of dragonflies and golden afternoons. A town inhabited by shadows... A world built from dreams... And in the Dream, there are the Makers... The minds that make the rules. The minds that pay the price to defend infinity. Tread softly - for you tread upon their dreams... ---- DREAMSCAPE is a voyage into a land of haunting beauty. It is a journey hand-in-hand with a very human soul.",
