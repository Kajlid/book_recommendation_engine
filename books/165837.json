  "description": "Cherry, the enigmatic and lusty lesbian madam, explores her own perverse fantasies, diving deeper into the protected realm of her world. The ladies are spoiled in Cherry's personal care with fine wine, dining and expensive giftsâ€”but she demands their sexual devotion in exchange. Decadent behavior thrives as flames ignite both at Cherry's private, women-only sex club, and in her mansion. Indulging in pleasures of the flesh, Cherry gives in to her young, gorgeous live-in's desire for making love as a couple for the first time. Devon and Winterlynn find themselves on an extended lover's retreat in the guest suite, performing a naughty, explicit show for the boss. Mysterious Bethany arrives as the club's star attraction. Seeking more than a one night stand singing for the members, Bethany treats the audience to a grand display of scintillating erotic play atop the bar for all to enjoy. Dusty finds her loyalties tested. The beat mistress DJ Carson's forbidden affairs are brought to light, and Cherry gives an unexpected ultimatum.Read the amazing review by Sylvia Storm: http://ereaderotica.com/?p=6243",
