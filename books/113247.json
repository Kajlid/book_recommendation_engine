  "description": "She was the girl. The only girl. The only girl I ever wanted. The only girl I ever loved. The only girl I could ever love. And I killed it. I destroyed it. I threw her love away. For nine years, I've kept the memory of her locked in the deepest corner of my heart... all the while hating myself for what I did to her. To us. Now, without warning, she's walked back into my life. I'm covered in tats. She's covered in Polo. I write heavy metal songs. She writes chick-lit. My eyes are angry. Her eyes are sad. I still long for her with every fiber of my being. But I have no idea if she feels the same. I guess it's time to find out. ***** Playing for Love at Deep Haven is a standalone novel. FAIR WARNING: This book contains scenes of detailed intimacy and liberal use of profanity. It is intended for readers 18 and over.",
