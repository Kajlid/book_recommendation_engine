  "description": "Now available in English, in this bestselling political thriller-drama, MILENA is a young woman, who thinks she has it all when she lands a job as the President's interpreter. Bright, beautiful, willing to take a chance, she is the embodiment of the new Eastern Europe. But a bold new future comes at a cost. As her country suffers the growing pains of greed, Milena is caught up in the machinery of crime, corruption and human trafficking. Will love buy her a way out, or will she, like so many flowers of Montenegro, be lost in the profits of her enemies? 'Knezevic's fiction is so tremendously powerful, perhaps also because it is based in truth,' J. Pogacnik, Jutarnji List.",
