  "description": "When a single Ruminarii Hammerhead arrives to invade the small backwater Terran colony of Deanna, the people of Atro City go to meet them at the space port with open arms. (Perhaps exposed is a better word?)Life as a private investigator, slash bounty hunter isn’t all Gary Beck wanted it to be. There aren’t any big mansions on a palm beach owned by an affluent writer generous enough to let him live rent-free and use his spare Ferrari. But then you have to ask yourself, what could you expect living on a planet like Deanna? As a third rate colony in the Terran Empire, Deanna had more than its fair share of dull moments. What could you expect from a planet like that? It orbits a star called Ramalama. If you think that’s funny, Deanna’s two moons are called Ding and Dong, respectively. (This is a local joke.) Cindy Mei Winter hoped to put her violent and somehow depressing past behind her, but now it seemed her new beginning (and her holiday) were going to have to wait. The Gimp are back and this is no time to be a sissy. With the talents of Fred the Arborian and Gary (aka Beck the Badfeller), as well as the Skegg’s Valley Dynamite Fishing Club, how could she possibly go wrong?Complete with a supporting cast of huge space ships, Ruminarii warriors, bounty hunters, Crabby-grass, Falling Sherry – and red-horned wildebeest!",
