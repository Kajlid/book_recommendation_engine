  "description": "When vampires were ‘outed’ in the year 2020, the humans attempted to alter their diet to ensure their safety. This resulted in a worldwide bloodbath known as the Rage. Now fourteen years on and the world has been torn apart and rebuilt from the ground up to accommodate the vampires unholy desire for human blood.  But despite the constant push of the Equal Rights Movement, vampires are still being depicted as the ruthless, rabid monsters they had become in the months of the Rage. Many humans still oppose their presence and do not agree with the forced peaceful coexistence.  One person who shares this belief is a young scientist named Nico Bergan. Doctor Bergan wants to return the world to its former glory. His way of achieving this goal… creating a cure for vampirism.",
