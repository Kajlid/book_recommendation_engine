  "description": "Margo Ford just became an heiress. Not the Paris Hilton kind. Her billions came after her beloved father died and her insanely wealthy, M.I.A. mother was forced to claim her. Unfortunately, some terrorists noticed, and they hatched a plot to kidnap her from boarding school. After a news report goes awry, reporting that Margo has been kidnapped, and her mother offers the humiliating sum of $500,000 for her return, Margo doesn't want anything to do with her new guardian. Then she is sentenced to a summer of \"protection\" on her mother's private island. If there's one thing 19-year-old Logan Greer wants, it's to get off this godforsaken planet. After fourteen years as his father's whipping boy, he used his over-sized brain to get him into an exclusive boarding school, and then to M.I.T. Luck has never been on Logan's side - that is, until a billionaire space enthusiast notices his research and invites him to spend the summer planet-hunting at her island observatory. Logan will get thousands of dollars for each planet he discovers - thousands of dollars he can send back to Georgia, where his dad is drinking and drugging away the family farm. But the longterm payoff is even greater: If he can manage to impress his financier, he could be invited on the manned Mars mission she's planning. The only thing standing in his way is Margo Ford.The last thing Margo needs, after the heartbreak of finding out her mother won't be coming to the island to meet her, is to get up close and personal with the observatory's rudest researcher. The trouble is, he's also the hottest guy on the island - and her surprise cabana roommate.",
