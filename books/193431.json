  "title": "The E.T. Chronicles: What Myths and Legends Tell Us about Human Origins",
  "description": "The E.T. Chronicles is a startling and comprehensive examination of ancient myths and legends that describe extraterrestrial visitors and their encounters with humanity since the dawn of time. Organized into a chronology that starts with \"in the beginning\" and ends with the advent of civilization, it brings together myths from many cultures (including the Sumerians, the Greek, the Maya and the Aborigines of Australia) and explores them in the context of current scientific discoveries. The result is a mind-blowing re-visioning of human origins through close reading of ancient texts relating - creation- gods and goddesses- heaven- the gods and their toys (space ships or chariots?)- the quest for immortality Could it be that those ancient stories of the gods were more than just the product of someone's fanciful imagination? Is it possible that the writers, chroniclers, and scribes of our distant past actually record an accurate view of our origin? Could it be that we are really children of the stars?",
