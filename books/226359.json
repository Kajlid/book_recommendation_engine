  "description": "One final contender stands between Claire and claiming the Fallen Throne—but Faith isn’t giving up without a fight. Defeating Faith and taking her blood isn’t all Claire has to worry about. She must find the last few drops of her own original blood—before the big three usurp her realm and end any chance of her completing the prophecy.Mace offers a strong shoulder, but as long as Claire aches for the missing Thanos, she can’t let herself lean on it.Meanwhile, the Oracle has emerged from a 500-year hiatus to gleefully fling monkey wrenches into Claire’s timeline. Claire loses several hours to one of the hag’s schemes, resulting in Faith getting away with the Prince of Time. Which definitely isn’t part of the prophecy.Putting the Time King back together again won’t be easy. Even if Claire manages to gather all the parts, nothing fits like it did before. The cracks expose the truth that will change everything…including who’ll be the last man standing by Claire’s side.",
