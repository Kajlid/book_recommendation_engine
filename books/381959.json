  "description": "Your Call to Open to Love's Deepest Bliss Every woman knows the fairy tale―find the right man, give him what he wants and needs, and he'll love you forever. But when the myth you've been asked to believe fails to deliver―when you sense you've been settling for far less than you know in your heart is possible―then how do you attract and keep a man capable of meeting what you most passionately yearn for? In Dear Lover , David Deida explores every aspect of the feminine practice of spiritual intimacy, from sexuality and lovemaking, to family and career, to emotions, trust, and commitment. Written as a collection of letters from a man to his dear lover, here is this internationally acclaimed writer's invitation to practice love as a living art, as you discover how to pick the man of deep integrity who will satisfy the needs of your body, heart, and spirit.",
