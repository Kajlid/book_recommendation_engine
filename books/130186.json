Twenty years after her disappearance, her brother believes that a woman he glimpsed on the Internet is his sister, now living in Toronto. The closer Dan gets to finding her, however, the less sense things make. Just when he thinks he know whatâ€™s driving his client, an unexpected revelation forces him to choose between what he's been told and his gut instinct, which says things are not all they seem.",
