  "description": "English mime, musician, photographer and actor Tim Dry was featured as ‘J’Quille – Whiphid’ and a ‘Mon Calamari Officer’ in Episode VI “Return Of The Jedi”. These are his honest, amusing, irreverent and very often surreal recollections of being in the movie and of his subsequent appearances twenty years later at Star Wars Conventions all over the world in the 2000s. Think Bill Bryson meets 'Galaxy Quest' and you're on the right track. It has a foreword written by ROBERT WATTS (Producer of 'Star Wars' Episodes IV -VI and the 'Indiana Jones' trilogy), as well as 10 pages of photographs.",
