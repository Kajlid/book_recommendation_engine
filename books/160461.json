Things take a turn on Halloween when a handsome stranger walks into town.  At first Jack seems like any other rugged countryman, exploring the terrain, but as Victoria grows closer to him, she discovers something about him - he makes her feel different... he makes her feel alive again.  Will this reclusive vampire be able to accept this stranger into her life? Or will her past come back to haunt her?  ***This story contains adult subject matter.
