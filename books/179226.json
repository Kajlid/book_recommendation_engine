He is the ancient trickster god Loki, in magical disguise on a mission of his own. A mission that will come to a sudden and disastrous end…  The woman he's never forgotten Demi-goddess Sylvi has spent eight hundred years trying to forget her long-ago affair with Loki, which destroyed her dreams and got her banished from her home.

The fact that her magic can be enhanced by sex makes ignoring Loki even harder—especially when they must utilize her rare talent.
