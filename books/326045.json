  "description": "HOW DO YOU TELL THE WORLD YOU'RE NOT WHO THEY THINK YOU ARE?Raised in a rigid Christian home, Sarah Igwe nurses a growing distaste for the church and every religious shackle that has hedged her in. Finally, her escape comes when she is admitted into the University of Uyo and she begins shedding off her religious skin. However, her plans meet a bulwark when she starts falling in love with the passionate Jesus freak, Declan Kalu. Now, she is caught in a dilemma between choosing Declan and the very faith she has come to despise or walking away from both to a freedom enshrouded in regret… Young, principled Christian paradigm, Titi Edet weaves a spotless life amidst a generation teeming with darkness. One single experience brings all she has built crashing down. She must now decide whether to lose everyone's regard for her, or to live a lie henceforth… Declan Kalu revers Titi Edet, who unlocks him into a deep relationship with God, separating him from his past life of immorality. Now his budding friendship (and chemistry) with Sarah threatens to suck him back into the very desires and lifestyle he's been saved from. Can he break free from the stronghold of his past without losing Sarah's soul to darkness?",
