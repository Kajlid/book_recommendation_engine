  "description": "“A Rose by Any Other Name – Life Lessons from an Unremarkable Dog” follows the exploits of a typical family and the dogs that tolerated them. This touching memoir tells the story of the dogs that influenced the author’s formative years, his dog-less years and the eventual arrival of ‘Duchess Desert Rose’ – a half Lab, half Shepherd mix. ‘Rose’ is a story with a wide range – from the shores of the St. Lawrence River to the Mountains of Northern Mexico. Part autobiography, part training manual and part social commentary, “A Rose by Any Other Name” is pure entertainment.",
