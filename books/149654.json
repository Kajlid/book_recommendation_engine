  "description": "The claws were bad enough in the first place--nasty, crawling little death-robots. But when they began to imitate their creators, it was time for the human race to make peace--if it could \" Philip K. Dick said of his story \"Second Variety\": \"My grand theme--who is human and who only appears as human?--emerges most fully. Unless we can individually and collectively be certain of the answer to this question, we face what is, in my view, the most serious problem possible. Without answering it adequately, we cannot even be certain of our own selves.\" Reviewing the story, critic Zack Handlen wrote, \"'Second Variety' is grim, violent, and suspenseful. . . . While most of the twists are easy to spot once you discover the main plot--basically 'Are you or aren't you a machine'-- they still have an impact, and Dick makes his point quite clearly.\"",
