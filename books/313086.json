Or I did until my husband died.Now, I believe in surviving this world without him.I have a plan mapped out for the rest of my life, and it doesn’t involve a man.

My head has plans, but what happens when my heart can’t say no? Keegan:Hot as hell sex with no strings attached. That’s my credo.It works, too, until she walks into my office. Calliope. A young widow with totally different priorities than me.There’s no future for us, but I can’t stay away, either.For the first time, I want something complicated and messy, and I want it with her. But that means breaking the promise I made her on the day we met. Based on British Bedmate by Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward, this book focuses on Calliope, Simon’s best friend.",
