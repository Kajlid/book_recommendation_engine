  "description": "From the Moment They Kill, the Countdown Begins. His Patience Festering With Time. Fifteen-year-old Hidalgo has so many dreams.Dreams are all he has, of one day escaping dusty Pichilingue, Mexico to toil alongside his father in the vineyards of the Napa Valley, to make his mother proud.He cannot imagine in the wildest of those dreams that one day he will achieve true greatness, or survive an unspeakable tragedy that will rip his family apart.Or that he will shake hands with the devil to find justice, the very crime boss he knows wants his son dead.Synopsis:Hidalgo is brave for his mother as they cross the border into California; yet inside he’s terrified, his mind filled with dreams and nightmares.Though what he does not imagine is that one day he will achieve true greatness, his destiny much worse than spending his life bent over, breaking his back under a hot sun. Or that his greatest ambition will be murder.He is preordained to become a leader of men, kind and benevolent, gracious and caring, intolerant of those undeserving of mercy.Filling his days and years to forget, his vital spirit is broken by the faded dream of one day finding and killing the man who stole his life.Not once throughout his two terms in office has he shown clemency to the hopeful residents of death row at the eleventh hour, nor will he now. But this time it’s personal.",
