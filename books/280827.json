They’ve found it in the raggedy comfort of KnitWit, in their fire-lit stitch ’n bitch at Joe’s, in the halls of their quirky private school, even in the arms of boyfriends.But now the girls are staring down the end of high school. Fueled by the stresses of college applications and service projects, will it also mean the end of the Chicks? Or can this unlikely foursome bind off the happy ending that only true friendship can craft?The Chicks return, along with four hip new projects.",
