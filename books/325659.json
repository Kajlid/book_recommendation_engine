  "description": "Hex signs protect every barn and outbuilding. The local tannery spews its poison on the land and in the river. And babies disappear at birth. An orphan and one-time felon who earned his nickname -from the sound a crowbar makes when it hits a man-s head,- Johannes -Wump- Hozer is now the custodian of Our Lady of the Innocents parish in Three Bridges, PA. Wump is old and tired. He-s fought all his life against the tannery-s waste, against God, and against the blind eyes of his good neighbors. Nowadays he tries to ignore the old priest-s exploits with the young women of the parish and the strangeness surrounding the local orphanage, and does what good he can for his wife, the church, the sisters who run the orphanage, and the poor orphans themselves. Then childhood memories and strange presentments begin to plague Wump when a brick wall unearthed at the site of a new restaurant collapses, and raw sewage carries hundreds of baby bones into the pit left behind. Looks like the devil-s made Three Bridges his playground, and Wump needs to find out why; the babies keep screaming and he has to make it stop.",
