  "description": "\"Don’t tell me you didn’t miss me!\"Rafael’s devilish sister Mary has returned to the Nettlebush Indian Reservation after a year of absence and a failed stint in a rock band. But the reason behind Mary’s triumphant homecoming is anything less than sororal: Mary has her sights set on Paul Looks Over, the man responsible for her father’s death. Nothing—and nobody—will stop Mary from staking a Blood Law of her own, a decision that will force Rafael to choose between his love for Skylar and his very family. Words: 86,880",
