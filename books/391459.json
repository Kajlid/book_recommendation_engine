Mandy's new classmate Sara has moved to Welford just in time for Halloween-and she's brought her Labrador and four gorgeous Lab puppies. Mandy is instantly charmed by the adorable pups. So when the puppies are stolen, she and James vow to help Sara catch the thief. To make matters worse, the friends learn that the puppies may have a serious eye condition, and need to be tested as soon as possible. If the missing puppies aren't found quickly, they run the risk of going blind. Can Mandy and James find the puppies before it's too late?",
