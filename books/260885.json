  "description": "I watched her. I knew I shouldn’t. It was a mistake. Wrong. Forbidden. A glimpse of heaven before a depraved angel led me to hell. One email was all it would take to end the torture. A simple email, dropping Eden Wilder from my class and my life. But I couldn’t do it. I was selfish—taking any bit of her I could. That’s how addictions start. You give in just a little. Just once. Before long, your obsession has grown into a violent storm, shrouding you in darkness as it consumes your thoughts. Consumes your whole damn life. And everything you’ve worked for is gone. But you honestly don’t give a f*ck. You’d serve your soul up on a silver platter for your addiction. And she was mine. Recommended for readers 18+ due to strong adult language, themes, and a stalkerific hero who puts the FUN in dysfunctional. Enjoy!",
