Not if I want to find out what my mother was hiding before she died.But it’s not just any forest. The noises in the woods at night aren’t animals—they’re monsters.They watch me from the trees, slither through the lake, and creep in the shadows outside my window.By day, the society hides their secrets from me. By night, I disappear into the world of monsters and discover secrets of my own.Secrets about being meant for their world, the Void.About how they’re going to keep me forever, enthralled by their claws and primal hunger.Possessed with desire for fangs and horns.Embraced by tentacles and their insatiable cravings.But I’m not just here to dig into the past.The society’s retreat is not what it seems. There must be a sacrifice…And that sacrifice is me.An Invocation of Monsters is a steamy fast-burn standalone romance with knots, bioluminescent tentacles, and three possessive monsters.
