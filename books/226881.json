The one thing they can agree on, though, is that marriage is for suckers.Everything is going their way until a drunken bet leads Alec and Chase to the altar. Their temporary “I Do’s” aren’t as amusing in the sober light of day when they find themselves thrown into married life and everything that goes with it.The question they have to ask themselves now is, can their friendship survive being married for a month?",
