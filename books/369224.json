  "description": "Prepare yourself for a spectacular tour of the world's many habitats, each possessing its own unique mood. From the claustrophobic darkness of the Deep Ocean to the big skies of the Open Plains; the merciless, ever-expanding Deserts to the diminishing Jungles, teeming with violent life. The thread that binds them all is water - the precious element that has carved our world and makes all life possible - and only three percent of which on the entire Earth is fresh.Within each habitat, we take a journey of exploration. We find the hidden life - the animals who have yet to be extensively filmed, either through the inaccessibility of their habitat or their own elusive behaviour. Mass migration spectacles, blind cave fish, bioluminescent corals and rarely-seen large mountain cats, all beautifully captured by the world's best nature photographers.With a foreword by Sir David Attenborough, Planet Earth is the ultimate portrait of our planet, and the perfect companion piece to a truly historic television event.",
