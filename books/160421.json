  "description": "Alien invasions don't always end with London in flames or New York in ruins. Sometimes, they end with the stroke of a pen...The year is 2221. For two hundred years, the world has been shaped by the Infinite Charter, a contract which dictates the terms of our surrender and plots the course of our future. In a world where alien technology has turned the laws of physics inside out and supernaturally-gifted individuals walk amongst us, 29-year old Clyde Evans is a man tasked with maintaining order. His job: hunt down those who violate the Charter and bring them to justice.His latest target is Claire Eisenholm, a girl cursed with the gift of time travel. A failed voyage to the edge of the universe has given her knowledge that could bring the entire system crashing down... if only someone would listen to what she has to say.Clyde is joined by a party girl computer hacker; a disgraced prize fighter; a slick-talking hustler turned quantum physicist; and a holy woman hell bent on toppling the alien regime. Together, they face enemy hunters, hostile worlds, and a psychotic time traveler who is constantly two steps ahead of them, all while under the thumb of a faceless master and the ever-present gaze of the Solarans.The Light at the End of the Wormhole weaves a 23rd century science fiction world with the magic of fantasy, the intensity of a thriller, and the twists of a mystery as it follows a crew of misfits on an interstellar roadtrip to oblivion and back again.",
