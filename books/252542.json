  "description": "In this tightly woven and entertaining thriller, former oil executive turned author, Steve Hadden, delivers a credible and thought provoking story about an unlikely pair of resilient heroes who battle Big Oil and a corrupt US Senator to uncover the most significant breakthrough of our time. In a darkened warehouse in Colombia, a father of two and the second highest ranking executive in the third largest oil company in the world is murdered in what the company calls a botched kidnapping attempt. Three thousand miles away, on a rock wall in New Mexico, a renowned environmental scientist and experienced climber falls to his death. The two deaths are linked by a deadly conspiracy to conceal a discovery that could change the balance of power and wealth in the world overnight, end global warming and bring oil companies to their knees. When thirty-three-year-old Nathan Robbins refuses to accept his company’s account of the death of his mentor and friend, he’s forced to risk everything to uncover the truth. Determined to avenge his friend’s death, he follows the clues to New Mexico and discovers he must rely on the help of Jessica Adams, a beautiful environmentalist who hates everything he represents. Trapped between Targon’s CEO and a prominent United States Senator, they race to follow the trail of evidence from Los Alamos National Laboratory to the chambers of the U.S. Senate. First, they must find the key at the birthplace of the most powerful force the world has ever known—and stay alive to tell their story.",
