He’s targeting all her former haunts and connections in New Orleans, using the wildness of Mardi Gras week to commit his crimes.He thought she betrayed him and never looked back…Rowan, veteran Marine, has hated Adalyn for getting his team killed. Until he discovers that the former CIA agent risked everything to stop the real perpetrator. Now they’re racing against the clock to stop a faceless madman determined to kill them and as many people as possible before the week is over. If they can’t figure out who he is or what his endgame is, an entire city could go up in flames—with them in it.",
