  "description": "“If I was a doctor, I’d go to Africa and save those children.” Hal wants to help people in need, but in 2050 that’s not what medicine is about. Doctors are just cogs in a giant healthcare machine. Sarah falls in love with Hal in college, and joins him in his fight to become a caring, compassionate physician in a system that only cares about grades and money. Contending with artificial intelligence and bionic implants in medical school, Hal’s struggle to avoid becoming a RoboDoc is an emotional roller coaster. Sarah does everything humanly possible to save his last spark of passion and hope; she even follows him to Africa in search of his dreams. Can she rescue his humanity? Are RoboDocs the problem or the solution? These are the doctors we are training today. They will be your doctors tomorrow.",
