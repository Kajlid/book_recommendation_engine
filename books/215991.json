  "description": "The Peaceful Pill Handbook is the controversial, ground-breaking new book from Australian end-of-life physician Dr Philip Nitschke. The Peaceful Pill Handbook for the first time offers a comparative analysis of end of life approaches comparing the peacefulness and reliability of methods such as the purchase of Pentobartibal Sodium (Nembutal) in Mexico, the manufacture of the homemade Peaceful Pill, the use of Helium and Exit bag, the prescription drug Propoxyphene, and the Swiss option offered by the Dignitas service in Zurich. Currently subject to a censorship hearing in Australia and New Zealand, The Peaceful Pill Handbook offers a succinct, scientifically-grounded guide to end-of-life options, voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide.",
