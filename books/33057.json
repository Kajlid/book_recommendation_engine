Shannon's grief finds its outlet in angry rebellion, but with devastating consequences. Chuck struggles with a sense of powerlessness and with the fear he's brought a far-reaching curse on his family with his affair. Bobbi teeters on the edge of emotional collapse, but a cancer diagnosis seems to offer her a way out. Yet, in their darkest moments, God sends hope and answers from the most unexpected places.",
