  "description": "Wilhelmina Harper's The Gunniwolf is a classic-beloved by readers, storytellers, and teachers. Its vibrant, rhythmic read-aloud text-sprinkled with dialect-tells the story of Little Girl, who is forbidden to enter the jungle for fear of meeting the Gunniwolf. But when she does, this version's Gunniwolf seems almost playful-if just a little scary. But Little Girl learns her lesson, and a new generation of listeners will be rapt with delight at this \"guten sweeten\" book.",
