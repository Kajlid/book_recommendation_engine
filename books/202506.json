  "description": "Shaw When I found out I was pregnant with the Robert Stone’s child, I had no idea my world would unravel. But it did. I lost my internship, was kicked out of my mother’s house, and had virtually no money to my name and no place to go. I did what any rational, newly impregnated woman would do…I called Robert and left him scathing messages. When I still didn’t hear from him, I called his family and begged them. I didn’t know Robert tragically died. And it’s not my fault that Cameron, his cold, ruthless, asshole brother flew from England to retrieve me and prove to all that I was lying. Cameron I don’t believe she carries Rob’s child. No, I’m convinced that she is nothing but a con artist bent on stealing money and the very last scrap of sanity from my parents who are still morning my brother. But I can’t be sure, not definitely. So for the foreseeable future I will keep Shaw Mallory under my roof and close at hand. The problem is, the more time I spend with her, the more I find that I’m attracted to her. I want to possess her. I desire her. Now it's my turn to beg... Short story. Cliffhanger ending. Part 1 of 3. (Very) Adult content.",
