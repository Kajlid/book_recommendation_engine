  "description": "When Mary encounters a handsome stranger in the night, she begins a clandestine affair that sets off a chain reaction of Biblical proportions. Propelled by a sense of adventure and a desire for sexual fulfillment, the young libertine seeks out pleasure of every variety, often at the expense of her own safety, in a time when adultery is a capital offense. As her son Jesus comes of age, he begins his own rebellion, embracing his most primal desires as he begins a revolution that will echo through the ages.",
