  "title": "The Catholic Church and Conversion",
  "description": "In this book, Chesterton's brilliance as a writer and thinker again shine through as he explains his understanding of Catholicism and the Catholic Church and how its appeal to reason and truth eventually won him over. For Chesterton, two essentials lay at the heart of conversion, and without these, a man misses the point of it all. He describes these in his own \"One is that he believes it to be solid objective truth, which is true whether he likes it or not; and the other is that he seeks liberation from his sins.\" That is why Chesterton became a Catholic, and what he describes in his unique and colorful way in this book.",
