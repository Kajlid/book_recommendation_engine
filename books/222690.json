  "title": "Damone Ramone: A Rock and Roll Betrayal",
  "description": "This book contains offensive language, perverse situations, and difficult truths.The Ramone family pariah exposes everything in a shocking tell-all. Damone Ramone reveals who was really behind both the Ramones and punk rock writ large. The unsung prodigy finally has his day. Mr. Ramone composed a classical composition in 1969 that his brothers plagiarized. The stolen composition was reconstituted as Ramones, Leave Home, Rocket to Russia, and Road to Ruin. These recordings changed music forever, and Mr. Ramone has not been credited or remunerated in any way. Furthermore, his brothers have propagated a false family history since 1974 in order to cover up their crime. The Ramones were in fact brothers, and their supposed “real” birth names were fictitious. Mr. Ramone reveals the true Ramone family history from the old country to the Fort Tilden Beach home where they grew up. He details his struggle against a cruel propaganda machine that ostracized and exiled him for decades in order to deprive him of credit and punish him for his genius. In time for the 40th Anniversary of Punk, Mr. Ramone’s book will rewrite punk history, thus ending an empire of lies. Accounts shall be settled and justice shall be restored.",
