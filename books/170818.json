  "description": "The continuation of the Deadly Beauties trilogy...  Purgatory was opened for the dark ones to escape, but so much more crept out. Over twenty years later, the consequences are finally starting to appear. And the world full of deadly beauties finds even more deception and secrets to face.  As an immortal, it's hard to have any new experiences after living for so long. History seems to repeat itself... over and over. No one knows that better than Gage Kross, the dark user many overlook. But even if you think you know how something is going to end, sometimes life doesn't give you the choice of deciding what to do.  When he meets Kimber, something that he thought died inside of him suddenly comes back to life. However, she's supposed to be one of the few women he can't be with. Then again, the sweetest fruits are usually the forbidden.  Just when things heat up, life unravels and ghosts come back to haunt Gage and his friends. The past invades the future, consequences are revealed, and impossible secrets emerge from the darkness, while new secrets are formed.  It's hard to trust people who are trained to hide the truth, so falling in love seems to be a daunting task no matter what. But it's a world full of seduction, and sometimes love happens whether you want it to or not - even when death is breathing fire down your neck.  Although this is a book one, there is no major cliffhanger.",
