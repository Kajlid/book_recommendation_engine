  "description": "ASIN moved from less recent edition hereIn Teleport This, Simon and Gilbert, two terrestrial physicists, leave Earth and stumble into and across a larger universe, trying desperately to find their way back to Earth in one piece while possibly purchasing a working lightsaber or two along the way. As they travel about, the boys meet up with girls both human and electrical, AI is explained, dog-people are examined, battles ensue, aliens interact with reality TV, situations get juicy, brains get probed and, of course, a liberal amount of alcohol is consumed throughout. All this for your reading pleasure.  So let’s go and don’t forget the tequila and chips.  Teleport This is the first book in the Small Universe series. Simon and Gilbert’s adventures continue in Soul to Soul and Geppetto’s Daughter. All three books are available in a single volume titled The Teleport This Trilogy at the super low price of $4.99 US.",
