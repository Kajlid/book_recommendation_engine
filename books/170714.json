  "description": "A story for lovers of animals, art, and holiday harmonyAs Christmas approaches, the animals of the north woods tremble with excitement. Bear Noel is coming! He strides toward them with his gift-laden sack, while they roll and romp in the snow, waiting. It is Christmas Eve, the one night of the year when a hare and a wolf, a fox and a boar, a hedgehog and a possum, an owl and a mole can gather peacefully, in the spirit of the happy holiday. Olivier Dunrea's gentle story about the advent of Christmas and his exquisite, snow-filled pictures evoke all the warmth and wonder of a magical time.",
