  "description": "Burning icy-blue eyes alight with defiance, the decadent, tainted windows into a debauched soul…In the exotic, sun-drenched Mediterranean town of Taormina, a young Englishman scrutinizing sensual images of bronze-toned young men is enthralled by the photographic portrait of the nefarious nobleman, Count Eyolf d’Magnus-Eriksson. “Who is Eriksson…?” he innocently asks his host, eliciting an erotic tale of decadence and desolation set on the Isle of Capri, a “paradise of vices.” On the cliffs overlooking the crashing waves of the Tyrrhenian, Count Eriksson, an obscenely wealthy, hedonistic, and coldly beautiful young aristocrat builds a home in adulation to the Roman wolf god, Lupercus, where he fearlessly invites and willingly embraces the carnal beast, Lupo. Theirs is a forbidden union of volatile passions and destructive desires, a tale that arouses an exquisite flame in the blood of the young Englishman.",
