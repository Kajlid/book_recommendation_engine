It is a total of 213 pages and includes photographs of the author's family so you come away feeling like you know her personally and can totally relate to her experiences and her life.There is very little that Ann doesn't share about her experiences as a mom~ from the moment she recognized her OB-Gyn in her church hallway and being told soon after that she was expecting her first child (after waiting and trying to conceive for 4-1/2 years)...to the hilarious account of her hysterectomy.  Ann tells it all...but don't worry~ even though she got permission from all three of her sons to tell their stories, she has saved up enough for everyone's inevitable therapy down the road! Enjoy her short, 2-3 page snippets that can be picked up and put down quickly, if in fact you can put it down at all!  She has been compared to Erma Bombeck in her humorous writing style and her short memoir style makes it easy for busy moms of all ages to relate and relish her mommy moments.  No matter what stage of motherhood you are experiencing, there is something in this book for you!",
