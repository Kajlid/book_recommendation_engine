  "description": "Suzi heard the scream and came running. The governess almost immediately spotted the arrow. She hurriedly closed and locked the doors, lit a candle, pulled the heavy curtains together, and then embraced her charge who was huddled on the floor shaking like someone with a fever. Suzi rocked the newly crowned Queen of Nurum, to and fro the way she had when she was a little girl. As Alisza wept, Suzi wiped away the tears that cruised down her cheeks. \"It will be all right,\" Suzi soothed, wondering how things could ever be all right again. Neither of them had ever experienced such a stressful situation. Although Alisza's parents had been cold and heartless people, they provided financial stability for the two women and kept them safe. What would they do now? Where could they turn for help? Who could they trust? \"Why did they try to kill me?\" Alisza asked brokenly. \"What did I do to them? And where are my guards?\" \"It was not you personally dear. They are afraid of how you will exercise the power you have been handed.\" \"Tell me what to do,\" Alisza cried clutching Suzi's bodice. \"It is a time for caution. Do not do anything rash. We must determine who our enemy is.\"",
