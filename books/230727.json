  "description": "Joel Suzuki and friends have saved Spectraland—the island of music and magic—once again. But now those responsible for the island’s near destruction have gone missing, and all clues point to a mysterious land across the Forbidden Tides known as the Six States beneath the Shroud. At least, it used to be—since a new leader rose to power, it has been called the Mono Realm, a place where diversity isn’t tolerated. For people on the autism spectrum like Joel and his bandmate Felicity Smith, it’s a hostile environment indeed. And now, to make matters worse, Joel discovers that the fugitives they’re pursuing are not simply hiding in the Mono Realm, they’re intent on taking it over—with potentially dire consequences not only for this world, but for Earth as well. A rebellion is stirring in this land of magic and tech, and if Joel can just get his mind off Felicity—and her prickly love interest, Thornleaf—his unique gifts and abilities might just save the day.",
