  "description": "Welcome to my instructional freelancing book. Numerous times, I have been asked to create a book to help people start out in the freelancing industry, and I have finally made the time to get this book written. It was freelancers who had struggled or are struggling that came to me and asked me to write this book, so I took their suggestions seriously. This book is a guide to starting out in the freelancing trade. If you’re already freelancing successfully, then you may not find it as useful, but remember that there is always something new to be learned, and knowledge is priceless. Freelancing can be an enjoyable job if you do it the right way. Do it the wrong way, and it can be a stressful and emotional time. The key to success in anything is planning, and freelancing isn’t any different from any other task that you decide to take on. You can’t just wake up one day and expect to make a fortune. Nothing ever comes that easy, but with hard work, the right attitude, and proper advice, you will make it in the freelancing world. Inside this book, I will cover every step that you need to take to set yourself up for a successful career freelancing. From choosing the right service to provide that suits your talents and skills, to branding both yourself and your business services, using freelancer sites to get established, branching out and building your own websites, clients and other useful information that every freelancer should be aware of.",
