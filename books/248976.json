  "description": "Throughout history and the present, inspiring and encouraging words from black people are like music to our souls when we become tired or distressed. The contribution and sacrifice of black people of the past and present are relevant, as we continue to fight inequality, racism and police brutality. Music or words in melodic form has always lifted black people when slave master's whip come out, or when white mobs slaughter and murder innocent black people without remorse. It is still a pleasure and honor to be a black person, for our legacy is comprised of extraordinary people who have done great things through their abilities to corroborate the struggle of their times. Therefore, African Americans should be proud despite the problems of today, for our rich ancestry is tied together, and together we are the recipients of a legacy they did not quit, tire or acquiesce when hate threaten their livelihood.",
