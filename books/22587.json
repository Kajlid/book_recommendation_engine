  "description": "Action, suspense, passion, betrayal, and a little bit of sex... a fast-paced story you'll never forget. The political thriller with heart!  \" 5.5 out of 5 Stars – Top Pick.\" Underground Book Reviews \"It’s not just the fast-moving plot, the realistic portrayal of life inside the Beltway, nor the cohesion of the story. It’s the carefully crafted characters portraying the heart of a mother, the devotion of a dear friend, and the soul-destructing power of politics, money, and cocaine. I highly recommend this very entertaining book.\" \"RUNNING had me up till the wee hours of the morning!\" \"RUNNING is an addictive read. The election details feel real, the idea of two female presidential candidates something that could happen any day. When you read this book, be sure you have plenty of time as you won't want to put it down until it's over.\" \"A must read. Terrific book. Kept my interest all the way to the end. I highly recommend this book to everyone.\" \"It grabbed me and didn't let go.\" Catherine Young, Vice President and newly-anointed Democratic nominee, is surging in the polls.

Suddenly a medical emergency puts the President in the hospital and forces Catherine to act in his place… a perfect opportunity for her to show her Oval Office stuff. Just when her election looks like a sure thing, Catherine's romantic fling from decades ago comes to light. Will the American public accept a woman with a past?",
