  "description": "What happens when you stumble upon your childhood crush, only to discover that he’s been turned into a vampire?I feel like I spend my whole life putting out fires. That's probably just part of the territory with being a magpie-shifter from such a chaotic family. All I want is to keep my loved ones safe and have some fun. I’ve never been cut out to be the responsible one.And Jordan Houjin is still everything I remember … hot, sexy arrogance and smoldering smart mouth. Except now he’s angry at the world and disappears every time I run into him. But that’s fine because I want nothing to do with a vampire my family would never accept anyway. Don’t I?Unfortunately, he’s the only one I know who can help me keep this dragon egg alive.",
