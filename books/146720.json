  "description": "A Hand in God's Till is a thought-provoking and passionate story of love, tragedy and hope, set against the sexual and spiritual backdrop of 1967‘s “Summer of Love”.As Adam Busk arrives in London, having been expelled from the strict confines of boarding school, he is hungry for excitement.He is quickly drawn to the burgeoning underground scene of psychedelic music, mind expanding drugs and the promise of sex, where he meets the enigmatic Belinda.When she disappears, Adam finds himself embroiled in the murky world of drug dealers and corrupt police.From a Notting Hill commune to a mystical quest across England, this is as much a journey of self discovery for Adam as it is a revelation of the times.If you’re intrigued by the era, but too young to have been there, or simply want to revisit this evocative time, A Hand in God’s Till will take you on an unforgettable trip.\"Wrapped in each other's arms, our tears eventually sealed our eyes, transporting us to the refuge of sleep, not as lovers, but as guardians of each other's pain.\"",
