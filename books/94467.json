Travel with him to the jungle, the desert, the forest, the ocean—and don’t forget to keep your body moving! Get “creatively fit” with Animal Motions—a fun, easy to follow, low-impact movement routine that shows how using your imagination can help make moving your body even more fun! It's great for home, school, or libraries. This children’s picture book was inspired from the author’s, Melissa Pilgrim, theatre classes with young children and written to help kids everywhere learn how to be “creatively fit” by doing two things at once: 1) shows children how to move and stretch their body in a variety of animal-like poses to help them develop healthy lifestyle habits, stay active, and be more confident with how their body moves overall, 2) teaches children how they can be creative and use their imagination as they pretend to be 17 different kinds of animals living in various habitats. The beautiful, full page watercolor illustrations that help guide the child’s imagination are done by Ira V. Gates. Teachers & Parents: 6 FREE lesson plans are available at animalmotions.com for both preschool and kindergarten.Kids: A FREE Animal Motions mini-poster to print out and color is available there too!Exciting News: Animal Motions is now available in a fun app! Features colorful pages, engaging animations, audio hotspots (so children can hear the sounds animals make!), and \"Read to Me,\" \"Read Myself,\" and \"Auto-play\" options with professional voice over narration.
