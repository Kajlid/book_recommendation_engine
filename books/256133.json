When her parents accidentally discover her infatuation with Angela Rice, it starts a cascade of events that throws Ivy into one harrowing situation after another.

Nora Gray, a year behind Ivy in school, has had her heart set on Ivy since she first saw the striking girl with the piercing eyes and short blonde hair. Nora and Ivy are thrown together by chance, and their newfound friendship soon becomes much more than casual. Set in a small town, in the heart of Vermont ski country, Ivy soon discovers that the safe comfort of home, is anything but safe, for her or the ones she cares for.",
