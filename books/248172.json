  "description": "Artie knows that an unusual gift from his teacher can only mean one thing; his dream of becoming a magician is certain to come true. Why else would she give a top hat to an 11-year-old boy? With his brother Tommy, neighbor Pauline, and Maggie the dressmaker dummy by his side, things are finally looking up, until life around him gets weird. His parents refuse to admit that anything is wrong, but a mysterious knock on the door reveals that Artie's greatest fear has come true. They can call it anything they want, even put whipped cream and a cherry on top of it, but there's no way Artie can see this trouble in the midst of The Great Depression as an adventure. Or is it? Could what looks like the worst thing for Artie really be the key that unlocks his future as a magician?",
