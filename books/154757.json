They have scars, but they’re breathing, and that’s more than the other victims can say. Yet while they try to settle back into their routine, saving lives through Jesse’s rare ability, neither can quite shake the feeling that the danger hasn’t truly passed. Then another death replacement agent goes missing, and Jesse may be the only one who can find her. But is the agent really another victim? Or is she the trap that will get them killed?",
