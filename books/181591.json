  "description": "Book 3 in The Blue Butterfly Series  My name is Connie Swift. I am thirteen. I am a typical teenager, my life full of boys, make-up and music. I love my sister, Mae, immensely but she can be an embarrassment at times, her quiet and withdrawn personality driving a wedge between us. You wouldn’t think we are twins, we are totally different people. She’s artistic and gentle and I’m creative and crude but nature gave us a link that would never be broken. Life is good. My family loves me and we aren’t short of money. We have homes in four different countries, three sports cars lined up on the driveway and cash stashed in numerous accounts and hidden places. My father is a cop and my mother is just a secretary for the local council. They owe no –one. Yet, on the night of my fourteenth birthday my own debt is due. The debt I promised him to save Mae’s life. But it isn’t money I owe. It’s me. However, I am ready. My things are packed and await by the side of the door. My tracks have been covered. My soul is primed and as the door opens and he stands looking at me, his stare as evasive as his chilling smile, I take one last look at my beautiful sister then slip my hand into his and softly shut the door behind me. Over the next ten years I am trained to become exactly what he wants me to be. A soldier for the Phantoms. An assassin with no conscience. A shadow of the girl I once was. And one of many women that feeds his sick and twisted sexual desires.  ***WARNING*** This book contains disturbing scenes of torture, sexual and physical violence and humiliation.",
