The thought of going back in time hundreds of years scares Soph to death, but her family needs her to do it to break a centuries-old curse. If she does not succeed, the outcome means death for her and her entire family. The problem is that she's not accurate in where she ends up.Coerced into attempting what Soph believes is impossible, the young witch learns that she must save the life of the son of the man who cursed her family. The curse cannot be broken and her family cannot be spared in any other way. To make things worse, she must endure shipwreck and is accused of witchcraft in seventeenth century New England, a time when witches often found their way to the end of the noose.If she can't save the man she's searching for in time, she risks getting stuck in the past with the curse firmly in place. Her success means breaking the curse and freeing her family to find true love. But her journey to the past brings her closer to hidden fears than she ever imagined!",
