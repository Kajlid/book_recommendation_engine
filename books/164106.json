  "description": "With the approach of the Winter Solstice, Sarah Ashby, a rising, young financial executive, has an emotional meltdown that unleashes an overpowering hunger for some essential, lost part of herself connected to her inner power and beauty, and the mysteries of the sacred feminine. Following her instincts and the dream directives of a raven, Sarah propels herself on a spiritual adventure that lands her on a remote, rugged island on the Canadian West Coast and into the alternative, pagan world of magic, ritual and the Dark Goddess. But how can Sarah navigate these strange waters without unraveling her existing world and sacrificing the things she most deeply cherishes?",
