  "title": "Every Five Minutes",
  "description": "Every Five Minutes is a novel about the colour cornflower blue, a white dog (but cats are mentioned too), a woman called Gina (though that might not be her real name), beaches, parks, city streets, exotic places, coffee, flowers, polished stones, a unicorn and a swan, words, theatre, movies, music, and love. Most of all it’s about a woman and a remarkable man. From Amazon reviews: This is a very compelling story…simple but well crafted and complete in the telling…moving, gentle and bittersweet. A nicely crafted story…leaving room for one's own imagination to fill in some detail. A most enjoyable read.
