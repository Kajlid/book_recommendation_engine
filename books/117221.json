  "description": "When Jakob Aikllenn saves the life of the woman he was sent to kill, his defiance forces him to Roldunn, the homeland he once fled in disgrace. There, a betrayal of dark magic transforms him, leaving a choice between faith and vengeance, between what he has become and the love he does not deserve. The assassin soon learns that Roldunn holds many secrets, terrible truths that will cause him to succumb to the darkness inside him, unleashing a revenge that will finally return him to his true path. Princess Kaya’s life is turned upside down when she learns the emperor wants her dead and her only chance for safety lies in Roldunn, the realm of her father’s enemy. She departs with a desperate plan to unite the two realms against the empire. The King of Roldunn, however, has revived the dark arts and what awaits Kaya is far worse than any imperial assassin. After his latest job goes bad, Jax heads home to Roldunn for some time away. The thief soon finds his fingers itching, however. When Jakob, his childhood friend, returns seeking revenge, Jax sees an opportunity to steal the treasure rumored to lie beneath the king’s dungeons. But when the treasure proves nothing like the rumors say, the thief finds destiny staring him in the face. The birth of a new God has cut off the forces of light and dark, veiling the skies and stymieing the battle between good and evil. No longer enticed by either, mankind dwindles without purpose. Now, The Fates have made their final, desperate move, drawing their players to The North where evil is returning to the world. But with the darkness comes hope, for opposition brings growth and growth must be.",
