  "description": "Every choice has a consequence.I believe in soul mates. Why? Because I have one and her name is Lily Madison.I’ve loved Lily my whole life. She’s all I’ve ever known. All I’ve ever seen. Everything. To me, she is perfect. Sometimes, when something has always been there, it is hard to recognize it for what it is. It is easy to take for granted. I didn’t realize how deeply Lily was ingrained in every fabric of my soul because I’d never had to feel her absence. It’s all so obvious now, but at the time it was not. I had to figure it out on my own.I wish I could have realized what it was that was truly important in life because once choices are made and paths are altered…it is so hard to go back, sometimes impossible. I know this because I stand here with a two-carat engagement ring in my hand waiting to ask someone to be my wife. I’m ready to love and cherish her ‘til death do us part. But, there is just one problem. She isn’t Lily. Will the choices that have been made change our path forever or will fate find its way?***intended for adults 18+ sexual content***This is the 2nd book in the two book Choices Series. The first book, A Beautiful Kind of Love needs to read prior to reading this book.",
