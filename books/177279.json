  "description": "The USA Today–bestselling author crafts a haunting Southern tale of a house that harbors centuries-old sorrows and a family fraught with lies.“Do you know what stories Sarah could tell you about the things that happened in these little cabins? They’d curl that pretty red hair of yours.”Outside of Charleston, South Carolina, beyond hanging curtains of Spanish moss, at the end of a shaded tunnel of overarching oaks, stands the antebellum mansion of Peppernell Manor in all its faded grandeur. At the request of her friend Evie Peppernell, recently divorced Carleigh Warner and her young daughter Lucy have come to the plantation house to refurbish the interior. But the tall white columns and black shutters hide a dark history of slavery, violence, and greed. The ghost of a former slave is said to haunt the home, and Carleigh is told she disapproves of her restoration efforts. And beneath the polite hospitality of the Peppernell family lie simmering resentments and poisonous secrets that culminate in murder—and place Carleigh and her child in grave danger . . .“If you’re a fan of Gothic Romantic Suspense novels by Phyllis A. Whitney, Victoria Holt, and Barbara Michaels, you’re going to love The Ghosts of Peppernell Manor.” —Jane Reads",
