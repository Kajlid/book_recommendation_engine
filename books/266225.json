  "description": "They've always been a trioâ€”why should love be any different?Ever since their first days together at Quantico, FBI agents Ev Monteiro, Lucas Vallejo and Quinn Langston have had one another's backs. They're as close as friends can get, sharing everything from an apartment to past traumas few others know about.But that all changed when Quinn and Ev confessed their feelings for each other six months ago...then three days later when she started having erotic dreams about the other most important man in their lives.She's hopeful that a trip to Wolf Creek, Montana, for a friend's wedding can help her put those frustrating desires to rest, but when she gets there, Ev finds two examples of just how well unorthodox relationships can work. Maddy and Lily Hollis, the owner of the Triple Diamond B&B and her sister, are both happily involved with two men and it only serves to make Ev's situation all the more complicated.But before Ev is able to untangle her feelings or have that impossible conversation with her two best friends, they're thrust into a violent situation that might just rip away any future they could have shared.And if all three of them do make it out alive, will they have the courage to defy the status quo and embrace what might be waiting for them?",
