  "description": "Imagine you’re forty-four, you live in Jersey, your name is Eve--and a shiny red apple (in the form of thirty-one year old Aidan Wharton) has just been dropped in your lap. Do you resist the temptation, or go for it?Eve Merritt used to believe that being the perfect daughter, perfect wife, and perfect mom was her ticket to living happily-ever-after. When the good girl routine doesn’t pay off as expected, Eve vows that from now on, she’s having her apple and her Eden, too!But right from the start, there’s trouble in paradise. Eve finds herself falling hard for Aidan, but with her family in an uproar over their affair, and a stalker from Aidan’s past bedeviling them, it will take all of Eve’s courage to overcome the decades’ old conditioning of putting everyone else’s happiness and well-being ahead of her own.",
