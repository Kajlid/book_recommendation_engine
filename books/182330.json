However, because they are so powerful, they will need a fourth to complete them, to calm them and help them reach their full potential.Aden, a young were, has been his pack's omega ever since, at the age of fifteen, he didn't shift like everyone else. Caught, reviled, and tortured because of his empathic abilities, he knew on the night he was told to run as sport for the pack hunters that it would end in his death. What he didn't know, however, was that on the same night he'd also meet the love of his life and a pathway to answers, because Aden is far more than just a pack omega. What begins as a hunt soon becomes a new adventure as Aden discovers that he has not only one, but three destined mates, and his role as lover is far more than trivial. The fate of all humankind rests upon it.",
