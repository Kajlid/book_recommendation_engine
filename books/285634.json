  "description": "In 1803, Robert Wellesley launched an unauthorized British takeover of India.  In 1804, the dead began to devour the living.  Things haven't been the same since.  Cursed creatures wander the plains of India, stumble through her jungles, and invade the cities of the people. In a world turned upside down, four youth with little in common find their lives intertwined in the struggle for survival. Destiny pushes them together in unexpected ways, but the curse of the nineteenth century threatens to tear them apart. Together can they form a united front and save the world?",
