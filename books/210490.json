  "description": "The Cinderella legend takes a star turn in this imaginative and contemporary retelling of the familiar tale. Giselle is a savvy and stylish young woman with an unsurpassed talent for hairstyling. Orphaned in childhood, she has since been confined to the shadows of the palace by Carlotta, Delight, and Wilhelmina, three of the most narcissistic and vain denizens of the court. When the town ruler decides to end his reign, he proclaims a grand ball, where the citizen with the most amazing coiffure will be awarded the crown. The three divas squabble to have Giselle execute their creations, but when the contest day arrives, her masterpiece is concealed by a voluminous hood. In a stunning upset, she takes a stand against useless vanity and demonstrates to the townspeople that a true leader must never be victim to fashion. With one bold move Giselle changes her lot in life and transforms the very roots of society. The exquisite collages and extravagant gatefold pages in this volume will captivate readers of all ages while clever rhyming verses celebrate the power of being genuine.",
