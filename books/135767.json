  "description": "With his memory altered to protect the timeline he's foreseen, Weaver Taran m'Connor returns to slavery to search of his Brother's stolen soul.  The enemy are armed with a devastating weapon, a mineral, methirri, formed into slave collars. It cuts a Weaver away from harvesting sunlight for reuse as laser energy. Worse it tears out a 'Traveling' Weaver soul and imprison it forever in nothingness, the bodies reharvested by the Spider Lords.  After Bren's soul is taken, m'Connor and his friend, Gerion, are helped to escape by an enemy High Lady Mariner, taking m'Fetrin's empty but living body with them. It is kept alive by a dog spirit.  Unaware that m'Fetrin is trapped inside methirri, m'Connor assumes his people's mentors, the Akkarra 'trees', will have harvested his soul and can restore it. But they report it is lost beyond all paths of time and space.  With his memory altered to protect the timeline his Testing reveals, m'Connor returns to enemy lands in a bid to find an enemy soldier, an engineering officer, Lerant, who has discovered the legendary Catalyst blade, The Sunburst Sword. But he has been raised to fear and loathe Sunweaving, and his foster brother is killed in battle against the Weavers.  What hope does m'Connor have of convincing him he must become an ally? Lerant's dead brother haunts him, desperate to reveal to him the truth of his heritage.",
