  "description": "The first novel from a global literary superstar and author of The Sound of Things Falling.\"Juan Gabriel Vásquez's The Informers is a thrilling new discovery.” —Colm Tóibín\"One of the most original new voices of Latin American literature.\" -- Mario Vargas Llosa, winner of the Nobel Prize for LiteratureWhen Gabriel Santoro's book is scathingly reviewed by his own father, a famous Bogotá rhetorician, Gabriel is devastated. Cataloguing the life of longtime family friend Sara Guterman, a Jewish German immigrant who escaped to Colombia during the 1930s, Gabriel's book seemed an innocent attempt to preserve a piece of his country's rapidly vanishing past. But as Gabriel pours over his research looking for clues to his father's anger, he discovers a sinister secret locked in the pages. After his father's death, and with the help of Sara Guterman and his father's girlfriend, Angelina, Gabriel peels back layer after shocking layer of family history-from the streets of 1940s Bogotá to a stranger's doorstep in 1990s Medellín-to reveal a hidden portrait of their past-dark, complex, and inescapable.",
