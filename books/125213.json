  "description": "HIGHLY ILLOGICAL Scientist Dylan Prescott had never pictured himself as a swashbuckler--until he ended up in another solar system! There he close encountered the ever-controlled, logical Julianna Valderian who had been convicted of treason. To save her Dylan needed to get them back to Earth. The hard part was knowing which temptation was stronger--the impulse to strangle the exasperating Julianna or the urge to drag her off to bed. Maybe it was time to test out human physical love, Julianna told herself. After all, she studied aliens. Experimenting with Dylan was risky: logic said that together their physical elements were pure chemistry, while caution argued their emotional components were highly explosive. Or was she just scared of this human emotion called love?",
