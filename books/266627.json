  "description": "Jessica Reynolds hasn’t taken a vacation in five years. But when her tyrant of a boss forces her to take two weeks off—or else—right before Christmas, suddenly visions of beaches and piña coladas are dancing in her head.  Unfortunately for Jess, her family has other plans for her vacation. Before she can escape to Bermuda, Jessica’s mom has guilted her into coming home to run her injured sister’s booth at a Christmas market. Now, instead of sunshine, cocktails, and scantily-clad cabana boys, Jess finds herself back home in sleepy little Bright, Vermont—with no sun in sight.  After fleeing Bright eleven years ago, the last thing Jess wants is to be stuck shivering for days selling her sister’s nuts—roasted chestnuts, that is. Especially when it becomes clear that her family could have ulterior motives for Jess coming home. Motives that might just include the sinfully attractive, but arrogant newest acquaintance of the family.  But Jess’s family doesn’t know about her struggles at work, struggles that threaten to erupt in Bright. Will Jess dare to reach for the life she’s always wanted, or will this be her final Christmas in Bright?",
