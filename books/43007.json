  "title": "25 Stories of Life and Love in Australia",
  "description": "This is a collection of highly readable Short Stories, set in Australia. Most are romances, although there are a number of human interest tales that have been well received. In the later category, two stand out. 'The Virgin Dancer', a very short yet moving tale of a middle aged woman left behind due to family responsibilities, finally finding love and fulfillment, culminating in her mind-boggling discovery that she, too, could dance. 'Family Values' is a lightly-written story of a confident, impish young boy visiting his grandparents, and the embarrassment of his parents.",
