  "description": "My life has always been a series of carefully constructed roads. Always the passenger, never the driver. Always the puppet, never the master. Always the pawn, never the queen.Except with Dante. He makes me feel like a princess, a goddess, a queen...His queen.But is our love deep enough to survive the cruelty of our past?Is our faith true enough to weather even the most violent of storms?Is our hope strong enough to outshine the darkest of days and bleakest of nights?Dante made me believe in the power of fate. I need to trust that fate won't steer me wrong now. After everything weâ€™ve survived, one thing remains certain...Fate can be as arbitrary as the flip of a coin.",
