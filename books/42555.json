  "title": "Peng Ma: Abstract Ink Painting",
  "description": "This book provides a critical study of the abstract ink painting of the Chinese Canadian artist Peng Ma, who early in his career saw abstraction as an artistic advancement on tradition. Chao’s critical approach to Ma’s work juxtaposes stimulation and resistance as the ongoing impact of Western abstract painting on contemporary Chinese brush painting. She goes on to investigate how Ma’s cross-cultural experience has gradually developed his hybrid aesthetics to embrace Eastern and Western art traditions to create his own distinctive art. Includes 210 reproductions.",
