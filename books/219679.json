  "description": "Clarke Gannon does not want to be involved with dragon-shifter Naelen Spencer. Seriously. No matter how broad his shoulders are, or how much self-professed groveling he does, or how devoted to her he claims to be, she’s not interested. When her ex, gargoyle Logan Gray, shows up asking her to run away with him, she feels as though she ought to take him up on his offer, but something’s holding her back. It’s not Naelen, though. Really, it’s not. She’s glad to have a distraction when Naelen tells her about some scientists who have been doing experiments on rogue dragons in a remote lab in the Colorado mountains. Now, the dragons have escaped into the facility, and they’re killing anyone that comes across their path. Killing dragons is what Clarke’s good at. She’d rather stare death in the face than try to deal with her confusing love life. And that’s exactly what she plans on doing.",
