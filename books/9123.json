  "description": "Monsters are the order of the day ... and the midnight hour ... with this book. PARTNERS IN SLIME is a collection of horrific short stories by 'Partners in Slime' Michael McCarty and Mark McLaughlin. Here you will find a gruesome collection of vile monsters and human freaks ... everything from the insect-god Ghattambah to ravenous zombies to wicked little Baby Caligula.PARTNERS IN SLIME includes the long stories \"Giant Cockroaches from Outer Space\" by Michael McCarty, and \"The Nightmare Quadrant\" by Mark McLaughlin. You'll never look at a cockroach or a praying mantis the same way again after you read these two stories. \"Giant Cockroaches from Outer Space\" concerns jumbo-sized aliens who happen to resemble ... and act like ... a certain abhorred Earth pest, while \"The Nightmare Quadrant\" tells of a vintage supernatural TV show that lasted for only one episode, because of its creator's bizarre secret ... a secret stranger than any horror movie.",
