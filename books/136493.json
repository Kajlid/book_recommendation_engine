When Devlin arrives late for the birth of Eloise O’Conner, he can’t believe his best friend has taken over his position as her guardian angel. Though Devlin pleads with him to hand the child’s guardianship back over to him, Nathaniel refuses. The two guardian angels have been friends for thousands of years, but after seeing how vulnerable and sick the baby is, Nathaniel isn't willing to risk her life with a tardy, irresponsible angel. Devlin’s new obsession with fallen angels and sexy women seem to be affecting his judgement and Nathaniel believes he’ll be too distracted to guard Eloise. Outraged, Devlin accuses Nathaniel of betrayal and threatens to take Eloise back, with or without his approval.",
