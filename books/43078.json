She moves to Utah with a broken heart and a head full of shattered dreams hoping to start over.She also tries to find her place in the LDS church again, but it’s easier said than done.

She knows everything will be fine so long as she doesn’t fall in love with her temporary husband. But as with everything else in Emma’s life, things don’t go as expected.Before she knows it she’s fallen in love with Andrew, but holds no illusions that his expectations of their merger have changed.
