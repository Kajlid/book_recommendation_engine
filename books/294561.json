  "title": "Debunking Howard Zinn: Exposing the Fake History That Turned a Generation against America",
  "description": "Howard Zinn’s A People’s History of the United States has sold over 2.5 million copies and is still required reading in some high school and college classrooms. But its polemic rewriting of American history as a story of oppression is an agenda-driven fairy tale that has no place in academia. In Fake History, Mary Grabar debunks Howard Zinn's lies and traces the damage his mega-bestseller has done to American education, culture, and politics.",
