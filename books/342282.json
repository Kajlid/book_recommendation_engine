  "title": "I've been a Naughty Nurse",
  "description": "Joanna Watson, a recently divorced top surgical nurse in picturesque Statesville, North Carolina, is frustrated with her stalled career and dead-in-the-water sex life when she suddenly finds herself trapped in an elevator with an unknown, abrasive Yankee surgeon, Dr, Harlan Wilkinson. The elevator gets stuck, the lights go out, and spontaneous, hot-n-heavy sex commences. Joanna is mortified at her own behavior--and yet she thirsts for more. Meanwhile, Joanna's colleague Shirley Daniels--an overworked, underpaid nurse-anesthetist who's neglected her personal life for years because she's been busy caring for her dying parents--finds her own hidden sensual side awakened by Dr. Harlan Wilkinson, too. And these two romantic rivals are sure to get into some sticky situations before all is said and done.Vital Signs is a sexed-up, small-town version of Grey's Anatomy--a busy, high-pressure hospital environment that is a perfect breeding ground for hot sex and hotter sexual tension.",
