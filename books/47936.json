  "title": "Half Moon Rising",
  "description": "After more than a decade, Troy Bishop is going home to the family he left behind when his parents died. Little does Troy know, he's about to get a lot more than he bargained for.... Sawyer Quinton has been waiting for his mate for as long as he can remember, and was beginning to think he'd never find him. Until Troy Bishop walked back onto the Reservation. The attraction is immediate for both men, but one is hiding a secret and the other must finally open is heart. Sometimes you can't go back home....and sometimes when you do...you never leave.This is the fourth book in the Assassin/Shifter stories. To fully appreciate the characters, I recommend you start with \"A Marked Man\" then \"Alaska with Love\" and finally \"By the Light of the Moon\" This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find objectionable: male/male sexual practices, violence.",
