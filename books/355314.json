Just as abruptly, the demon is attacked by a tall, hunky guy flashing a sword, who later claims to have \"just been passing through.\"Adrian is an Immortal, a son of Isis in third Dynasty Egypt, and ultimate loner. It doesn't take much for Adrian and Amber to begin a passionate affair, but it will take a lot longer for this ultimate control freak to surrender his heart.As Amber looks for her sister's murderer, Adrian continues to search for his brother Tain, missing for 700 years. But the hunts cause severe complications. Amber assembles a multi-talented team—a dragon, a werewolf, a powerful vampire, a movie star, a police detective, a worldwide coven of good witches, Immortal brothers and their mother goddess—to meet the challenge.",
