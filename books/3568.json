  "description": "The Shackled Continent, Robert Guests fascinating first book, seeks to diagnose the sickness that continues to hobble Africas development. Using reportage, first hand experience and economic insight, Robert Guest takes us to the roots of the problems. Two fifths of African nations are at war, AIDS has lowered life expectancy to as young as forty years old and investment is almost impossible as houses that could be used as collateral do not formally belong to their owners. Most shocking of all is the evidence that the billions of dollars of aid, given to Africa has had little perceptible effect on the poor. The Shackled Continent offers, sometimes controversial, explanations for this state of affairs. In this magnificent and engaging book, Robert Guest provides an invigorating history and an inspired commentary on the enigma of modern Africa. Was extensivelyand ecstaticallyreviewed on hardback publication. Interest in Africa will be high as 2005 is the twenty-year anniversary of Live Aid.",
