  "title": "The Black Moth",
  "description": "When the insolent Duke of Andover falls in love with the beautiful Diana, she unfortunately does not return his love.There follows a kidnapping which, happily, is brought to nought by a highwayman whom it amuses to play Robin Hood - taking from the rich to give to the poor - and who is in reality the noble Earl of Wyncham. The provocative Lady Lavinia, who feels she must elope against her own wish, skips coquettishly between the pages of this romance, eventually to be reunitied with her patient spouse, who becomes brother-in-law to the \"rescued\" Diana.All in all, a tangling and untangling of the colourful threads of an era of which Miss Heyer loves to write and of which her enthusiastic readers the whole world over never tire of reading.",
