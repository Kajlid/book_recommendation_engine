Filled with wondrous magic, deadly danger and unexpected twists, Dreams of the Last Born is a must read for any fantasy/adventure fan.Two moons share the night sky above Perator. Their brightness is slowly diminishing as a steadily deepening veil of darkness creeps over the land. Along with the darkness comes a curse of barrenness—no children have been born for five years. A mysterious mystic arrives in a small, isolated village. He falls in love with Aeta, a woman whose dreams sometimes foresee the future. He promises her she will bear a healthy son, but that he cannot stay to see the baby born. Deadly beings known as Blood Hunters are on his trail and will never rest until they have destroyed him. Aeta names her son Penderyn. Wanting him to have a normal childhood, she decides to keep the secret of his father’s nature from Penderyn until he is grown. When she dies in a fire shortly before Penderyn’s twelfth birthday, the secret of his birthright dies with her. Thus begins the saga of Penderyn the Last Born, the bearer of magic he can neither understand nor control. The fate of all Perator lies in his hands—but can he unlock the secrets of his powers before the forces of darkness plunge the world into permanent blackness?",
