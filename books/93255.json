  "description": "After weeks spent hitch-hiking across lonely back highways in search of himself, twenty-one-year-old drifter Colby Booker is starting to worry that he’s getting nowhere fast…...And then, he hitches a ride from John Larkin, an enigmatic loner living in the Nebraska countryside. Fascinated with this handsome, mysterious man, Colby accepts the offer of a hot meal at John's secluded cottage, completely unaware that he's about to discover firsthand the man’s darkest, most intense secrets. As a twisted, kinky connection between the two strangers begins to blossom, Colby dares to hope that he might have finally found what he’s been looking for: his place. But nothing will prepare the budding young slave for what comes next…[AUTHOR’S NOTE: This is an adult story focused on themes of bondage, discipline, and sadomasochism between adult men over the age of eighteen.
