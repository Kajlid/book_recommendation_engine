  "title": "The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down",
  "description": "A robbery, a lynching, and a mourning mother shake up the Yada Yadas.I had never felt so violated! The Yada Yada Prayer Group was \"gettin' down\" with God in prayer and praise one night when a heroin-crazed woman barged into my house, demanded our valuables, and threatened us with a 10-inch knife--a knife that drew blood.We wondered if we'd ever get back to normal after this terrifying experience. I assumed we would. After all, we'd started praying together at the Chicago Women's Conference last spring,Â and we'd been through a lot already as spiritual sisters. This was just one more hurdle to conquer, right?But then a well-meaning gesture suddenly incited a backlash of anger in the group, forcing us to confront generations of racial division, pain, and distrust--and stretching our friendship to the limit. And a shocking confrontation in my third-grade classroom forced me to face my own accountability and learn what true forgiveness really is.",
