  "description": "Rainen looked up in time to see my horse come crashing into the ground just a few feet away from her. Her eyes widened as she gazed into the sky. “Hayden! Shield!”  I threw my shield out to cover everyone who was closest to me. I felt my energy touch Rainen’s and I glanced at her before looking up to see what had made the screeching sound in the sky. My first thought was about dropping my shield and to welcome the dragon flying over us. My second thought was that this was no dragon. The creature in question had to be to same size as Faren, the fire dragon I was bonded to, who was about thirty feet long. Well, the same length as Faren. Whatever this was it was lacking the bulk of a dragon. It looked more like a snake with wings and ten sets of legs. It was covered from head to tail in oily looking brown feathers. I felt the push of magic come from up above and I pushed against it with my own. The energy receded as the creature flew past us. I started to pull back my shield and felt Rainen doing the same. The screeching sound came again. Rainen swore under her breath. \tAs the final battle draws near, Hayden must deal with personal loss, unexpected good news, and the usual attempts on her life. Was the prophecy right and can she do everything that is expected of her? Can she go through with her plan when just one mistake could wipe out everyone she loves?",
