Unable to undo his rash decision, it seems the two are destined to spend the next sixty years making each other miserable.Then gods start disappearing.Now Meghan finds herself with the opportunity to rid herself of Lack once and for all. If she can solve the mystery of the gods’ disappearance she can win back her freedom, but is an ordinary school secretary really up to the task? All Meghan wants to do is hide in the safety of her comfortable existence, but when people start dying Meghan finds she may be the city’s only hope and her dream of a normal, quiet life may lost forever.",
