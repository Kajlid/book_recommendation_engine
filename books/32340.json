  "description": "Gold, gems, or magical amulets–where there’s treasure to be had, from the high seas to the farthest reaches of the galaxy, pirates will always seek to claim it. But sometimes, the rarest and most precious treasures can’t possibly fit in a treasure chest. In these seven erotic stories, the true prizes are companionship and belonging–and treasure of a more intimate nature.
