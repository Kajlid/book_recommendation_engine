  "description": "Hey, itâ€™s me Liz here again. So after Mason just dropped this massive bomb on me about my dad, it takes every ounce of strength I have to contain my temper. Unfortunately, Liam one of my new best friends and the Aries God doesn't always manage to escape my rage and my powers at times seem to be uncontrollable. This all becomes more than I can take and I decide that it's time for me to head home and let someone else be the Scorpio Goddess, but as usual things don't always work out how we want them. Especially, after we find out what Alric has been up too and how he always manages to stay one step ahead. It becomes a long and emotional roller coaster as I try to get back home, hunt for my dad and then try to save a dimension I have grown to love along with the people in it. Thank the Gods I have amazing friends -including some who come as a surprise to even me- that are there to fight together with me side by side every step of the way. It becomes the war to end all wars and if we lose it will mean the end of us and the Zodiac dimension forever.",
