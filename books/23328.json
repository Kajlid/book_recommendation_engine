  "description": "I should have died quick. But I didn't. I'm a miracle of modern medicine, only the medicine doesn't get much credit, I notice. People say I'm lucky, or I'm blessed, and then they turn away.I'm not the only miracle. There's Odd too.Polly Furnas had The Plan for the future. Get married to Bridger Morgan, for one. College, career, babies. Etc. All the important choices were made.It was all happily-ever-after as a diamond-ring commercial.But The Plan did not include a lethal drug-resistant infection. It did not include â€œsome more reconstruction and scar revision in the future.\" And it certainly did not include Odd Estes, a trip to Portland in an ancient Cadillac to \"tear Bridger a new one,\" fly fishing, marshmallows, Crisco, or a loaded gun.But plans change. Stories get revised and new choices must be made.Polly and Odd have choices. Surviving or not. Catch or release.",
