  "description": "After Peter Pan and Tinker Bell are forced to leave the Lost Island called Neverland, the Green Fairy is separated from her only friend and sent to the realm known as Wonderland. No longer a soul thief, she is given the charge of collecting the madness of mortals. Luckily for her, this punishment would prove to be a rather vengeful opportunity. For it was madness that would bring her to the very person she felt was responsible for everything she had lost- Wendy Darling. Though Pan had twisted the reality of what truly had happened in Neverland, it seemed that Wendy’s mind couldn’t escape the nightmares hidden in the deepest corners of her mind. With both of her brothers denying the adventure beyond the second star, her parents eventually decided that sending her away would be best for the family. Wendy is sent to an asylum; the best that money can buy. But even with special privileges like visits to the surrounding gardens and time with the little kitten her mother had given her, the loss of one’s sanity proved to be too much for her. Once Tinker Bell discovers her enemy’s whereabouts, she sends the guardian of Wonderland to lure her down the rabbit hole. But no sooner had the curious child followed the White Rabbit into the veil, did Captain Hook discover what happened. It was then that the Blue Fairy and Hook concoct a plan for him to enter the realm of madness to save Wendy Darling before she loses her sanity completely and is doomed to remain in Wonderland forever.",
