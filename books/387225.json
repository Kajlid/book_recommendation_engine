When a secret admirer begins showering her with attention, Kate begins to fear for her safety. Then a gorgeous mystery man moves into the apartment next door, and Kate unexpectedly finds herself with a few dangerous cravings of her own.

Styx insinuates himself into her life in hopes of stopping the killer. But all too quickly, the killer isn’t the only one obsessing over the irresistible doctor. Shocking disclosures soon come to light about the woman Styx has been assigned to protect, and dark secrets from Styx’s past come back to haunt him, putting Kate in jeopardy. If he refuses to break an old vow, Kate’s life could hang in the balance…but if he goes back on his word, Styx just might kill her himself.",
