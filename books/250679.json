  "description": "A teenage boy is found mutilated and murdered in an apartment building. Forensic scientist Rhona Macleod is called to the scene, but her grim task is made even more unsettling by the boy’s remarkable resemblance to her—and the fact that she gave up a baby boy for adoption 17 years before. Racked with guilt, she sets out to find the boy’s killer and determine whether he is her long-lost son. In doing so, she immerses herself in the sinister world of an internet pedophile ring. Some very powerful men have a lot to lose if she succeeds, and everything to gain if she dies.",
