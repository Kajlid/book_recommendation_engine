  "description": "The holidays are supposed to be full of cheer, right? Then why on earth is everyone in the sleepy, beachside town of Calgon, Florida, wrestling with painful issues and situations? Life is full of surprises in Calgon, and the holiday season proves to be no exception. Cupcake baker and amateur sleuth, Melissa Beckett, and her dashing husband Chas, face a very new reality, that underscores their own personal limitations in no uncertain terms. Missy’s best friend Echo is going through some heavy duty choices of her own, and Chas’ business partner finds himself in a very sticky relationship scenario. In the midst of all of the personal turmoil, a gruesome murder is discovered, and Chas once again has to take charge, hoping that he finds the ruthless killer, before tragedy strikes a bit closer to home. You’ll love this fast-paced, action-packed drama that is filled to the brim with emotion and intrigue! This exciting Cozy Mystery can be read as a standalone, but if you’d like to know more about Missy, Chas and the rest of the Calgon gang, their history can be found in the two series previous to this one. The first Missy and Chas series is Frosted Love Cozy Mysteries, and the second is The INNcredibly Sweet Series. Enjoy them all!",
