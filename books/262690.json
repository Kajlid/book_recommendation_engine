  "description": "I’m coming after Kreedence. I want him to know what it feels like to live in fear. Just as I did for so many years.  Three dragon shifters and a hellhound should be more than enough help. And yet, I’m seeking out allies in all the wrong places: a prince with resources, a deadly king with power, and a mysterious queen who died decades ago.  New secrets will come to light. They’ll destroy everything I thought I knew about myself and the world around me.  Our secrets will always haunt us.  Or hunt us.  This is a Reverse Harem series containing M/M themes. Recommended for readers 18 and over.",
