  "description": "In 1934, Stephen Vincent Benet planned and began a long narrative poem about the western migration of peoples and more specifically the pioneers, first as they came to America and then as they spread out through America toward the West. It was to be a long poem of 3 to possibly 5 books. He worked on it off and on, but in 1943 he put together for publication, Book One, Western Star. His untimely death leaves only this part of his project.",
