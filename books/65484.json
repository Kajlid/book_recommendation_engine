  "description": "Even a good man may feel driven to sign on with the devil.  Paul Clark is a Catholic priest who's been on the fast track to becoming a bishop. But he suddenly faces a heart-wrenching problem, when choices he made as a young man come roaring back into his life. A mysterious woman, who claims to be with \"an agency of the federal government,\" offers to solve his problem. But there's a price to pay--Father Clark must undertake some very un-priestly actions. An attack in a Chicago alley...a daring escape from a Mexican jail...and a fight to the death in a Guyanese jungle...all these, and more, must be survived in order to protect someone he loves.  This priest is about to learn how much easier it is to preach love than to live it.",
