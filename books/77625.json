  "description": "Hawaii seems like Paradise to Tamsen and Arab, newly arrived in 1868 with their husbands Dan and Juan--but it is not. Beneath the beauty, like the hot lava bubbling in the volcano's crater, trouble seethes in Paradise.The daughters are destined to be caught in the turmoil between Americans who want annexation of the islands and native Hawaiians who want to keep their country. And in their own family, danger looms . . . for in Em's daughter Martha there is anger and a desire for vengeance that threatens to erupt and engulf them all.",
