  "description": "When Emilie Wyld, a disenchanted art student, takes a caretaker position at Kingsgrove Estate in the sleepy southern town of Willow Vale, she thinks she's just found the best way to start a new life on her own. All she has to do is care for the house and keep the gentle, mute proprietor, Miss Adalynn King, company. But as she explores Willow Vale and meets the locals, she discovers another side to the charming, friendly place-whisperings of misused Voodoo. It isn't long before Emilie realizes that the rambling, isolated estate holds secrets and Miss King won't admit what she knows.As the grand estate's strange creaks and cries become more than the strain of old timber and stone, Emilie comes face-to-face with the haunting past that Miss King can't endure alone. Soon the electrifying presence of a long-ago, forgotten man begins to haunt Emilie-there's something about him she just can't shake, and she finds herself longing to help him. But the darkness that surrounds the small southern town isn't going to make it easy for her. Suddenly, Emilie realizes she's the only one who can fight to uncover the traumas and wrong-doings from the King family's past, and make a great sacrifice for the sake of love.",
