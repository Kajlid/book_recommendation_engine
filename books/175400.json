  "description": "A corpse sends a simple scientist into a dark world of conspiracy and murder in this crime thriller by the USA Today-bestselling author The Deadline.When a world-renowned forensic anthropologist journeys to Winchester, Wyoming, to examine the long-dead remains of a woman who claimed to be Etta Place--the Old West's most mysterious and legendary female outlaw--he's not expecting to find a man's headless corpse in her crypt. The grisly discovery plunges him and Jefferson Morgan--the editor of the weekly Winchester Bullet--into a shadowy and deadly world of satellite-savvy highway pirates, rural meth labs, computer hackers and old-fashioned corruption. And they might not survive the fall....\"Gorgeously written, complex and satisfying--a damn near perfect mystery.\"--John Lescroart, New York Times-bestselling author\"A great job with a fresh, original idea. The Obituary weaves elements of the best forensics writers at work today, as well as the best detective writers--a great mix.\"--Michael Palmer, New York Times-bestselling author",
