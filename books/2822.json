  "description": "pubOne.info thank you for your continued support and wish to present you this new edition. Of the five stories in this volume, -The Lagoon, - the last in order, is the earliest in date. It is the first short story I ever wrote and marks, in a manner of speaking, the end of my first phase, the Malayan phase with its special subject and its verbal suggestions. Conceived in the same mood which produced -Almayer's Folly- and -An Outcast of the Islands, - it is told in the same breath (with what was left of it, that is, after the end of -An Outcast-), seen with the same vision, rendered in the same method - if such a thing as method did exist then in my conscious relation to this new adventure of writing for print. I doubt it very much. One does one's work first and theorises about it afterwards. It is a very amusing and egotistical occupation of no use whatever to any one and just as likely as not to lead to false conclusion",
