  "description": "What if John F. Kennedy had lost the 1960 election? The winner was supposed to have been the more experienced Republican, Vice President Richard M. Nixon. And some believe he would have been, had it not been for vote rigging and skullduggery on Kennedy s behalf. In The Madman Theory, 49-year-old Richard Nixon does win the 60 election and we find out for the first time how Nixon, rather than Kennedy, would have handled the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when the world stood at the brink of nuclear Armageddon. Would Nixon have pushed us over the edge? Could his wife, Pat struggling to reconcile her proper role as a wife with her estrangement from the man who thrust her into a public life she despises pull her husband back from the precipice?",
