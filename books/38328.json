  "description": "Casey Harrington will never forget that the Christmas she turned 8 years old she got an Easy Bake Oven instead of the Cowboy Cody doll she’d begged Santa for. It’s a disappointment that shaped her life. Now, twenty years later, she is a high-powered marketing executive living and working in NYC, who can’t cook, doesn’t want to, and has a strange obsession with all things cowboy related. A job offer too good to be true brings her to a Colorado ranch where she is instructed by her new boss to learn the Western lifestyle from Bonner Blue Boyd, ranch manager and living personification of her childhood crush Cowboy Cody.Bonner doesn’t know what to do with this city girl on the ranch, particularly since he expected “Casey” to be a man. He fights his attraction to her for as long as any man could, and even when he gives in and the sparks fly, both know it could never work for the long run. She’s city and he’s country. To be together either she has to sacrifice the world she’s always known or he does. What they need is a miracle…luckily it’s the right season for those.Note: This is an erotic romance with a little back door action.",
