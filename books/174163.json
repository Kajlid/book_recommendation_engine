  "title": "Rackham's Fairies, Elves and Goblins: More than 80 Full-Color Illustrations",
  "description": "Through his extraordinarily drawn interpretations of favorite fairy tales and fantastic literature, Arthur Rackham (1867�1939) remains an enduring legend of the Victorian era's Golden Age of Illustration. Rackham took the printing developments of the early twentieth century further than any other artist of his time, masterfully manipulating the latest color processes. At once a technical and artistic genius, Rackham had few equals when it came to the use of muted color, ambience, and expressive lines.This magnificent collection displays more than eighty of Arthur Rackham's most beguiling illustrations. These phantasmagoric renderings spring from such literary legends as Rip Van Winkle, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Aesop's Fables, Puck of Pook's Hill, Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, and A Wonder Book. From the loveliest fairy to the most grotesque goblin, Rackham's art captures the wonder, innocence, and adventure that forever stir the human heart.",
