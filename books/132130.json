  "description": "Reasonable rates. Do Family legends hint at lost family treasures? Have writing from ancestors I can use to jump-time? Call me: Angel Meyers. No psychic readings or ghost exorcisms (that’s not my gig).\nAngel Meyers loves cheesecake and hot men, possesses I-catch-cute-guys cleavage, and is the only person she knows with her gift. Her talent for touching handwritten documents and connecting with the mind of the writer, dead or alive, lets her delve into the past and locate lost family treasure for her clients. When she’s hired to locate a Rembrandt lost one hundred and fifty years ago, Angel sees a whole bundle of dollar signs. If she finds the painting, her fee would be enough to buy her much dreamed of animal rescue farm. There’s just one tricky bit, when she touches the writing of Clyde Owen Jones, the last man to know the painting’s whereabouts, Angel feels a malevolence coming off the pages and realizes Clyde was pure evil. But the evil doesn’t remain with the dead, it’s here now, and it wants the same thing Angel does — the Rembrandt and maybe her soul. Can Tyreal the Private Investigator Angel found too hot not to hire and Viggo her guardian angel, protect her from herself and Hell’s evil?",
