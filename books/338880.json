Several years later, as I huddled in a foxhole, I wondered where we were going or where we could go.\" *\"I feel like a man sitting in a car that's going down a hill,\" my father said, \"but it's too late to get out.\" * \"May 7, 1945, Germany officially surrendered to the Western Allies. On May 9, Russian troops marched into Berlin. I could not even guess what the future held for me.\" * \"Augsburg is about fifty miles from Dachau, location of the infamous concentration camp.
