  "description": "The Passionate Pilgrim is a collection of poems and sonnets that were attributed to William Shakespeare upon their publication, though it is unclear which of them were truly written by the bard. Three of the poems contained in The Passionate Pilgrim were originally written for Shakespeare's play Love's Labour's Lost.Known as \"The Bard of Avon,\" William Shakespeare is arguably the greatest English-language writer known. Enormously popular during his life, Shakespeare's works continue to resonate more than three centuries after his death, as has his influence on theatre and literature. Shakespeare's innovative use of character, language, and experimentation with romance as tragedy served as a foundation for later playwrights and dramatists, and some of his most famous lines of dialogue have become part of everyday speech.HarperPerennial Classics brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms.
