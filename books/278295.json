  "description": "The story is about Takanashi Momoko, a 16-year-old girl. Her life is pretty normal, until her twin brother, Akira, disappears. Akira was supposed to enter a high-class all-boys school but he runs away to pursue his dream of becoming a photographer, leaving only a note explaining his actions. At first Momoko and her mother thought it was just a joke but he really didn't come back. Now Momoko's mother went ballistic and started cutting her daughter's hair saying that she has to take her brother's place until he comes back. Not good for her since she has to disguise herself as a boy and what's this about being roommates with another guy? Will she be able to hide her secret and survive or will she be found out?",
