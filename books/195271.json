Some call this wily, often underestimated female shaman “the Disrupter.”When Borsar, the murderous priest, arrives to ask Sanyel for help in rescuing his son from a madwoman’s cult, she has every right to be wary. Her former foe says he has changed, and claims that Sanyel herself set him upon his current humble path. No one believes the fat priest, and for good reason—his past is a bloody one. Despite her doubts, Sanyel agrees to assist the man, but complications arise.A detour to the far side of the mountains through a mysterious tunnel leads to unexpected peril in the land of the Cruxun, a belligerent people who enslave or kill all outsiders. Borsar proves a valuable and surprising companion as Sanyel and friends seek a way out of their dilemma. Assisting them is the advantageous knowledge that Sanyel resembles a legendary figure from Cruxun history. An astonishing surprise awaits their group when the mysterious tunnel, a remnant of an advanced culture from the distant past, reveals its hidden purpose. (Second book of Sanyel series)",
