  "title": "Butcher, Baker: A True Account of a Serial Murder",
  "description": "As oil-boom money poured into Anchorage, Alaska the city quickly became a prime destination for the seedier elements of society. However, something even worse lurked in their midst. To all who knew him, Robert Hansen was a typical hardworking businessman, husband, and father. But hidden beneath the veneer of mild respectability was a monster. From 1971 to 1983, Hansen was a human predator, stalking women on the edges of Anchorage society whose gruesome fates would shock the nation. After his arrest, Hansen confessed to seventeen brutal murders, though authorities suspect there were more than thirty victims.Alaska State Trooper Walter Gilmour and writer Leland E. Hale tell the story of Hansen's twisted depredations--from the dark urges that drove his madness to the women who died at his hand and finally to the authorities who captured and convicted the killer who came to be known as the \"Butcher Baker.\"",
