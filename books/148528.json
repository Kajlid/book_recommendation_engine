It isn't the danger--Clint's made the reputation by being reliably ruthless, a quality that keeps his wounds deeply undercover. What's got Clint in a lather is Julie herself. The pretty, petite schoolteacher he's been hired to return to her wealthy fiance is no fainting trust-fund baby. She's a bit of a hellcat, one who won't be deterred when she sets her sights on something. And her sights are set on Clint.The one rule Clint never breaks is this--don't get involved with the client.

And the closer he sticks to the feisty, seductive woman who makes him feel alive...the harder it gets for him to ever consider letting her go...",
