  "description": "“One of the most enjoyable reads I have had in quite some time.” – J.G. Once there was an Epic Struggle Between Good and Evil. Unfortunately, Vergil slept through it. Thanks to an accident involving some magic powder, Vergil, a knight in the service of the Order of Avaress, awakens in a world irrevocably changed by the outcome of that epic battle. Finding himself suddenly an old man, Vergil must try to navigate this strange new world with only the help of his slightly dim but well-meaning servant Handri. Despite the peaceful, civilized veneer of modern-day Dis, Vergil is convinced that a great evil still threatens the land, and he and Handri set about to uncover and vanquish it. But Vergil's prejudices and chivalric principles prove worse than useless in this strange new world, and he succeeds only in getting himself in deeper and deeper in trouble while stirring up simmering animosities between goblins and humans. Can Vergil separate illusion from reality and uncover the true threat to Dis before it's too late? Find out in this fast-paced, lighthearted fantasy!",
