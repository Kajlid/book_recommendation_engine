  "description": "Leo Graf was just your average highly efficient mind your own business, fix what's wrong, and move on to the next job. Everything neat and according to spec, just the way he liked it. Safety Regs weren't just the rule book he swore by; he'd helped write them. But all that changed on his assignment to the Cay Habitat. Leo was to teach welding to a secretly produced batch of humanoid workers genetically engineered with two additional arms instead of legs to be ideally suited to working in free fall. Could he just stand there and allow the exploitation of hundreds of helpless children merely to enhance the bottom line of a heartless mega-corporation? Leo hadn't anticipated a situation where the right thing to do was neither safe nor in the rules. Leo adopted a thousand quaddies. Now all he had to do was teach them to be free.",
