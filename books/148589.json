  "description": "Juliette is the fifth book in the series Blood-Rose Guardians. It follows the experiences and self-exploration of Juliette through the course of one year as she engages with the responsibilities of both her human life and in her role as a Guardian. Juliette lives with her identical twin sister, Charlotte, in Australia's beautiful Queensland. She is an avid horse-rider and newly employed nurse at the local hospital. During the course of her year, she will face demons both physical and psychological and embark on a journey that pushes her beyond her greatest expectations. As a Guardian, she will acquire new skills and strengths as she faces her weaknesses and the challenges that rise with the encroaching Darkness. Juliette is a story about the importance of faith in one's self and about humbly accepting help, even from strangers, when it is needed. It is a tale, as are all the Blood-Rose Guardian books, about good versus evil and the challenges faced by the Guardians as the Darkness continues to gain momentum in its pursuit of world domination.",
