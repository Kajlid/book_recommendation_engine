  "description": "Lacey Sharpe doesn’t particularly enjoy mixing with the majority of people she works with, but this Christmas, attendance is not optional. Not when the masquerade party is to introduce her new boss to the company. The boss she’s never met, the boss she screwed in a bar bathroom the night before.Nate Hayward has been transferred from the US to the UK, and he can’t get the woman he hooked up with his first night in the country out of his head. He didn’t expect to see her at his company’s Christmas party, hiding behind a mask.Things heat up between them, as Lacey tries to fight the connection between them, but Nate certainly knows how to turn her on.*A short, steamy Christmas story*",
