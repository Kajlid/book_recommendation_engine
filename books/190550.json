  "description": "Kimi, a curvy accomplished botanist, is proud of how her expertise helps humankind thrive on Planet Venora. The only negative aspect of her job is her occasional interactions with emotionless cyborgs, such as Lee 5, who help ensure the safety of Venora’s citizens. When she’s selected for a special mission to visit Earth and sample the new plants growing there, Kimi couldn’t be more excited. Her excitement falters, however, when she’s introduced to the mission’s security detail: none other than the cyborg Lee 5. It isn’t long, though, before the cramped confines of their spaceship push them closer and closer to each other, so that they can’t deny the attraction between them. But will she ever be able to discern his true feelings?",
