  "description": "It has taken thirty-one years, but the story will now finally be told. It's a story of love, compassion, and forgiveness. Lillie Hopkins had a miraculous encounter that changed her life forever on the day she gave birth to her one and only child. The joy and excitement she had previously anticipated suddenly disappeared and was replaced with the unbearable realization that something dreadful had occurred and things had gone horribly wrong. She was absolutely devastated and consumed with an irreparable broken heart. Excruciating sadness, agonizing sorrow, and total brokenness threatened her very desire to live, but then she had an angelic encounter which left her with indescribable peace. You will discover how Lillie caught a glimpse of heaven and was touched by an angel on April 21, 1980, the day her beloved son, Derrich, was born.",
