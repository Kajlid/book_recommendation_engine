  "description": "Throughout its domination of Earth, humanity has been tormented by its own imperfection. The miracle of life is tarnished by the tragedy of sin. All fall short of the glory. Three months have passed since darkness overwhelmed the Fourteenth of Novosibirsk-since the lion's mane was surrendered for horns. Scott Remington has succumbed to the worst side of human nature, one consumed by violence and rage. He has become the very thing he sought to punish. With rightness hanging in the balance, he must now face the fiercest enemy he has ever known: himself. Redemption awaits. Will the fallen find their way?",
