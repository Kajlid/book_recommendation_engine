  "description": "“Little witch Dorrie’s first day at ghoul school does not get off to a good start, for she can’t find her lucky sock. Then, when she and her friends proceed with their first lesson, they make the whole schoolhouse fly up over Witchville. . . . Coombs’ text is great fun for adults as well as children. . . . Another winner from this popular author/illustrator.”—School Library Journal“On their first day of school, little witch Dorrie and her friend find Professor Zucchini mysteriously absent. Unfazed, they poke about among his charms and potions and unexpectedly raise the schoolhouse aloft. A second spell returns the good professor to himself, and he’s able to get them all back to earth—and in a more convenient location, too. With lively, humorous illustrations in full color and an easily read text, a welcome addition to a popular series.”—Kirkus Reviews",
