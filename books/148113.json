  "description": "According to actual documents hidden in the Apocrypha, an ancient race of supernatural beings known as Irin roam the Earth. Impervious to aging, illness or mortal injury, they wage a continuous war against those who once threatened the survival of mankind by corrupting the natural order. While ever present, they prefer to remain unseen in order to freely move among us. Those who are seen are easily overlooked and immediately forgotten. Walk down any street in the world and you will pass at least one Irin. Depending on the threat or situation, sometimes many. _______________________________________ When his flame-haired partner disappears after a brutal beating, the legendary Irin enforcer known as Riley Storm sets out to bring her back. Ending his search in Los Angeles, territory he once ruled over, he discovers an alarming secret behind the city's most violent criminals and decides to reclaim not only his fiery companion and fiercest ally but the land he once called home.",
