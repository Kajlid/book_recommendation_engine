An avid reader of manga, as a teenager he discovered gekiga, whose realistic style strongly influenced his artistic development. In this travel book dedicated to Venice, Taniguchi conveys acute sensitivity and deep poetry. The subtle harmony of the narration suffuses this refinement with a degree of nostalgia.",
