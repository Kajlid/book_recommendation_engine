When he dreams in one world, he awakens in the other. In one reality, Thomas is a respected military leader urgently trying to deliver the vastly outnumbered Forest People from an agonizing calamity that will end life as they know it. In the other, he's trying desperately to work with the world's top leaders to stop the release of the deadliest airborne virus ever created. The earth's population is facing the worst global crisis in history. This virus has a three-week latency period, and only ten days remain before its deadly power is unleashed. Thomas must find a way to change history--or face the destruction of two worlds.",
