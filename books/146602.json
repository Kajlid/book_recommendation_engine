  "title": "MS Madness: A \"Giggle More, Cry Less\" Story of Multiple Sclerosis",
  "description": "Yvonne deSousa's diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis came with an insightful declaration from a new doctor (\"MS sucks\") and a brother's helpful advice (\"You could totally get one of those handicapped parking plates now\"). What followed was a year of \"accidentally\" kicking an officious male doctor in the crotch, becoming an undercover agent to pay for medication made from Chinese hamster ovary cells, discovering the amazing effects of legal speed, and battling her arch-nemesis, the dreaded food vegetables. Throughout her MS journey, Yvonne learned how to use humor to find acceptance in her diagnosis, and how to smile in the face of a debilitating chronic illness. MS Madness will make you laugh while learning the real story of what MS, a disease that affects 400,000 Americans daily, can do to a perfectly normal person. Life with multiple sclerosis can be daunting, but Yvonne shares her giggles at the bizarre world she has unwittingly entered and the new perspectives it has given her on life. MS Madness makes us realize that with a sense of humor, we can survive anything.",
