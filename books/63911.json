  "title": "Unsinkable",
  "description": "A provocative novel about the only black family on board the Titanic—a beautiful, intimate look at racial tension, family discord, and how love conquers all. Fifteen-year-old Corinne LaRoche’s life changes one evening when she returns home and witnesses racist French policemen harassing her father. Her frustrated father decides the family is leaving France and moving back to Canada. Without their mother, Corinne, her sister, and her father step onto the beautiful Titanic. Racial barriers are clearly defined on this ship, making this trip less luxurious to the LaRoche family compared to the rest of the white passengers. As life-altering family secrets surface, the ship steadily makes the course that will ultimately end in tragedy. The LaRoche family could not have imagined their impending fate as well as the underlying family tension surfacing during the four days before the sinking. From this day forward, their lives will never be the same.",
