  "description": "Jerome Klapka Jerome (1859 - 1927), English author, known for his humorous essays.\"What readers ask nowadays in a book is that it should improve, instruct, and elevate. This book wouldn't elevate a cow. I cannot conscientiously recommend it for any useful purposes whatever. All I can suggest is that when you get tired of reading 'the best hundred books, ' you may take this up for half an hour. It will be a change.\" (from the Preface to \"Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow by Jerome Jerome)",
