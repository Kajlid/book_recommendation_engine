Recently, a new criminal organization has moved into the city. If they continue to disturb the current crime boss and his empire, they will start a turf war that will hurt a lot of innocent people.  The mayor, meanwhile, has declared that the Vigilante is to be arrested on sight for fear others may try to copy him. Ashlyn cannot explain it, but she feels a connection with him and believes that he actually helps the OPD. If he truly has the abilities they say, she can sleep better at night knowing he has watch. Many in the department however, will go out of their way to make a name for themselves by being the cop that brings him in. Even if it costs lives.  There's a war coming and a lot of blood will be shed, unless Ashlyn can stop it with help from the Vigilante. That's if the Orias Police stay out of the way.  She works for the law, he works above it. Will they find a way to save the city and come together, or will their worlds forever keep their love apart? This debut novel puts a fresh spin on the female heroine, the man that loves her and those she's sworn to protect.",
