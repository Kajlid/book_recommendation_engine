  "description": "Out west of San Antonio, the Caldwell Ranch is growing by leaps and bounds. So much so that ranch manager Cooper Caldwell is forced to hire a full-time veterinarian. A rough-cut cowboy and former rodeo champ, Cooper doesn't talk much and never smiles. He doesn't have a reason to - until Jason Delgado shows up for an interview.  City born and bred, Jason has never worked on a ranch, but his resume is impressive and so is his education. He's leaving behind a private practice in Dallas in favor of the dirty, dusty life of working on a cattle spread. The Caldwell Ranch is as far as he can get from civilization, but he never expects to find his salvation in the tough, quiet Cooper.  But when there's a growing threat on the ranch and Jason's at the center of it, will he stay? Will Cooper risk it all to convince him to? Both men must overcome old pain and new fears if they're to make a go of it together.  Word Approximately 15,000",
