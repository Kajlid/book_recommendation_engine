But when he meets Belen, a strange girl with no memory of her past, he soon discovers how much more adventure--and danger--awaits him. Not long after Belen joins the circus, a wizard arrives and stops the show--not by magic, but by accusation. Belen is not human, he she is a shapeshifting dragon, who destroyed a nearby town.

Henham's series inspired by The New York Times best-seller A Practical Guide to Dragons , a new hero polishes the tarnished reputation of a noble silver dragon.",
