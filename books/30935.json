  "description": "I signed a pact with the devil. Now what?For my defense, I had no idea what I was getting into when I met her.Tall, gorgeous, and funny, she wasn't only wild in bed, but had sinful red lips I still can’t get enough of.One problem, though. She comes with a warning: stay away or you’ll get burned.And she wears the color of the devil perfectly. First hint she was about to ruin me. Yeah, it should have figured it out straight from the beginning.The truth is that I didn't. The new, more reckless version of me, loves the danger she promises. And the way she spices up my existence.When I'm forced with a choice—keep going or put an end to our crazy relationship—I must decide if she's worth the risk.Will playing with fire become my new addiction, or should I just run for my life?",
