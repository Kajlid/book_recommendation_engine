  "description": "A Myron Bolitar novel with a twist!Myron hasn’t heard from Terese Collins in years. Not since their affair ended without explanation. He’s had no contact with her since, so her call catches him off guard. She’s in Paris, she says, in trouble and only Myron can help. Terese tells him a sad story she’s never before revealed: a good marriage, her struggles to get pregnant, the happiest moment of her life when her only child was born, the day everything she’d ever loved was taken from her. As the years passed Terese heard nothing from her ex-husband, until the phone call that brought her to Paris.But on arrival, Terese finds her husband has been murdered, leaving her as a prime suspect. Then comes a startling piece of evidence that turns the entire case upside down, laying bare Terese’s long-buried family secrets in the most shocking way and leaving Myron nowhere to turn for help. Caught in a foreign landscape where nothing is as it seems, he must tear apart the city – and eventually the globe – fighting for answers to unfathomable questions that will take Myron, and Harlan Coben’s readers, where they have never gone before.",
