  "description": "Auria was the last nation in Europe to be occupied by the Global Defence Organisation, the same organisation that promised to bring peace when riots spread rapidly across the continent. Now governing all of Old Europe, the GDO’s control over Auria begins to increase and their tactics to dominate the population become more violent; 17-year-old Cassia Fortis decides that she’s had enough of being repressed and chooses to take matters into her own hands.With her loyal friend Luca, Cassia joins the GDO army, in the hope that she can find a way to free her Dad from prison and reunite her parents. What she doesn’t account for is the measures she will have to take to prove her loyalty to the regime and the devastating path her best friend Jake will take.",
