  "description": "It's winter 1991, 8:37pm, a loud alarm sounds at a military early warning radar station as a couple of UFOs are detected over the northern part of the UK. They demonstrate operational capabilities far beyond anything we could produce. Major Dan Strange and Professor Lucy Compton from DI55 (Aerospace Intelligence) are called in to investigate. Neither of them could have even imagined how the night would unfold.The back-cover 'Blurb':November 1991. One of the biggest UFO ‘Flaps’ in recorded history was about to occur in the skies over northern Europe.

Everyone hated the night shift, nothing ever happened, ever, then suddenly at 20:37 Zulu a loud ‘Two Tone’ alarm sounded …………Excerpt:'Sentinel Charlie Charlie, this is Speedbird 235, we can see your two aircraft...can't make out the type, very bright red, wait a sec...yes, very red...changing from scarlet to crimson, there may be some blue and green in there as well...the colours are continually changing as I'm speaking...can't really make out the shape...wait...they're getting closer...stand by...looks like they are quite long flattish looking platforms...one is a couple of hundred feet above the other. The colours are changing all the time, still predominantly red...very, very bright.' The audio from the speaker crackled. 'They're getting closer, should we be worried?'",
