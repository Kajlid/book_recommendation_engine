  "title": "The Realm of Radiance: A Modern Fable",
  "description": "This enchanting modern fable follows in the tradition of \"The Alchemist\" and “The Celestine Prophecy” -- an inspiring hero's journey for both young adults and mature readers. “Highly imaginative…(with) magical transformations throughout the narrative…There is a sweetness to (the protagonist’s) innocence and vulnerability.” Kirkus Reviews Jonah, a shy 17-year old overwhelmed by loss and ready to give up, hears a Voice inviting him to search for true love and mystical wisdom. From his home on an isolated island in the north Atlantic, he begins a passionate odyssey filled with life-threatening adventure, incandescent romance and True Magic. As Jonah chases his dream, he encounters a haunting young sorceress, a mind-blowing trickster Wizard and his older brother, a rogue, spiritual master. They, and others, lead him ever further beyond the ordinary and deeper into his own heart and the world of mystery. The author's own life stories and wide-ranging experiences in Eastern mystical traditions inspired the novel. The book also includes a dozen lyrical illustrations by the Maltese artist Andrea Leljak. Jonathan and his sorceress wife Barbara live in San Francisco and on California's Central Coast. They share their quarters with a wise calico cat and America's most adorable mutt who are head over paws in love with each other. Jonathan and Barbara also have three magical adult children.",
