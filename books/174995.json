  "description": "An alternate title and cover for this ASIN can be found here.All the Storm episodes in ONE Boxed Set!   Timothy Banks is Hollywood's hottest star. He is funny, charming and utterly sexy.  I probably shouldn't have named my vibrator after him. I probably shouldn't have abandoned him in the middle of a winter storm. I probably shouldn't have started playing BDSM games with him.  Yet I did all these things. I'm the girl who runs a pizza shop in Liverpool, Nova Scotia. Population 2700.  And I'm about to find out that Tim Banks and I live in very different worlds.",
