  "description": "Alternative cover edition for ASIN B071DYKKJ6.A broken and battered U.S. Marine. A rock-and-roll diva who’s just been dumped. When there’s nothing left to lose, will you turn to the one person who can save you?  A dozen years ago, they were high-school sweethearts, until life took them in different directions. Marine Mike Lindstrom lived and breathed the Corps until an IED ended his career and took away the most precious thing in his life. Emotionally and physically broken, he’s come home to the small Maine town of Jackson Falls to heal. But Mikey’s not the man he once was. Angry, bitter, and grieving, he’s adrift, lost in a sea of anxiety, nightmares, and well-meaning family. He's as broken as Humpty-Dumpty, and nobody can put him back together.  Then Paige MacKenzie walks back into his life.  Rock-and-roll royalty, Paige was recently dumped and publicly humiliated by her fiancé. She’s come home to lick her wounds and wait for the media frenzy to die down before she returns to L.A. to finish her next album. The first person she runs into is the man she almost married at seventeen. The last she’d heard, Mikey Lindstrom was halfway around the globe, saving the world. They haven’t spoken in twelve years. Until now, that was just fine by her.  So why does it feel like Mikey’s drowning, and she’s the only one who can save him?  Come home to Jackson Falls. You'll be glad you did.",
