Accepting Rhett’s proposal of forever is easier than she expected and more fulfilling than she ever dreamed. Now that she’s done trying to keep him at arm’s length, she knows that his arms are the only place she was ever meant to be.But Rhett and Tori made harrowing, destructive choices on their unconventional path to happily ever after, and choices always have consequences. With more than just physical distance threatening to tear them apart, they must trust in their newly rekindled love to navigate what comes next.Can Rhett uphold all the hastily made promises that now seem so hard to keep? Can Tori muster the strength to support her man while she faces the reality of her own greatest fears? Not even forever would be long enough for this love—but what if forever isn’t an option anymore?Content Warning: While You’re There is a steamy new adult romance that includes mature themes, substance abuse, fertility struggles, references to infidelity, and language that some may find offensive. It is the second book in the Hampton Hearts Series and it should be read in order. This story ends with a happily ever after, but Rhett and Tori’s journey will continue in the holiday novella “When You’re Home for the Holidays,” coming November 2021.",
