  "description": "An omega locked in a tower, a beta secretly in love, and an alpha prince who isn’t what he seems... who said fairy tales don’t come true?  James is the playboy alpha prince of Ember, whose reputation long precedes him. When he gets into trouble one time too many, the king lays an ultimatum at his feet—get married or be disowned.  Even the fences and laws keeping orphans Rory and Lucas apart can’t stop the love between them. About to be separated forever, a chance encounter with Prince James sees them on their way to the palace for his courtship contest.  James can’t change the law but he can give Rory and Lucas a chance, however brief, to be together. He never expects to find himself tangled up in their relationship. It can’t last—there’s no place for him in a love as perfect as theirs.  When the royal family’s dark past catches up with them, torn between his feelings for Lucas and James, Rory is forced to make a terrible choice...  Bestowed is a novel-length read, featuring a polyamorous romance, a modern-day fairy tale, angst, knotting, mpreg, cake, and happy endings. There are some difficult themes in this story, with allusions to child abuse and neglect. There are scenes not suitable for readers under the age of eighteen.",
