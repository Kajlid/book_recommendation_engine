  "description": "Have you ever read a romance novel and wondered what it would be like to date one of the heroes in the stories? We’ve all been lost to the beautiful and touching stories, the funny and quirky antics of the characters, and the, sometimes, unbelievable love stories that fill the pages of those books.  Through the Standard Romance Story series of novellas, I would like you to embark on a quest of what it would be like – in REAL life – to date these heroes. Our main heroine, Jane, is put through the ringer as she fails, and sometimes, succeeds on her own dates with the typical men found in romance literature.  Each book is a new date with a new man – the REAL man – that is nothing like the characters you read about in books.  Follow Jane as she dates the standard romance guys in an attempt to find true love: The rocker, the biker, the billionaire, the tattooed bad boy, the firefighter, the lawyer, the vampire, the cowboy, the alpha, the teacher, the movie star, the professional athlete, the fighter and the captor.  Which one will finally win her heart?",
