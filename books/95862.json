  "description": "The Christian Writer's Coach: How to Get the Most Out of a Writers Conference is the first in a series of books specially designed by Northwest Christian Writers Association writers. It is our goal to give you best-practices information and to put tools in your tool belt to help you succeed as a writer. We started this book with five bios of successful people in the industry. People who started out just like you and are making it in the world of publishing. This book is designed as a primer for a writers conference. After the bios, the book is divided into three parts: • Before a conference • During a conference • After a conferenceIn each section, your questions will be answered in articles on how to be prepared and how to put your best foot forward. Then we have provided links to the most helpful resources on the web. We hope you find this a fun and interactive research tool. God created you for a purpose, and he gifted you with the ability to use words to inspire others and to shape culture. It is our prayer that as you read this book, you will find new tools that will alleviate the mystery of publishing and help you fulfill the dream you were called to.
