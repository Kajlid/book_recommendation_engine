  "description": "Master of Restraint and sadist, Dexter Hayes has always used the following adage as a form of self-preservation: never ask questions when you aren’t prepared to hear the answers. Dexter turned a blind eye on Maître du Jeu’s activities, only doing as he was told without question. His sole focus for the past few years had been on his girlfriend, Monica James, and their housemate, Tobias Kline. When the riots began at Restraint, the two halves of Dexter’s world collided, putting everyone at risk. Adelaide Whittenhower published the Mistress & Master of Restraint, exposing the secrets of Dominion’s underground. The book drew the public to Restraint, and it has been spiraling out of control. Dexter tried to maintain his stance of never knowing too much, but he was swept into the fray. He had lost control of Monica, allowing her insecurities to ruin her from the inside out. Tobias flexed his newfound independence by no longer following Dexter’s instruction. The members of Restraint were running rampant, forgetting their training and doing whatever they wished. Dexter felt he knew the people in his life, but as the questions he never asked were being answered, he learned they were always complete strangers. As the battle lines were drawn, Dexter learned a valuable lesson– pleading ignorance may have been his greatest downfall yet.Publishers NoticeThe author did an extensive rewrite on this title, and the entire Mistress & Master of Restraint series.
