One summer, when she and her friends take a road trip across America, she hopes that the experience will live up to her wildest fantasies. Yet out on the road, Rose discovers a very different kind of adventure - becoming fixated on a local motorcycle gang with mysterious flower symbols painted on their jackets. One night, as tensions rise, and Rose finds herself cut off from her boyfriend and friends, stripped naked and humiliated in the middle of a crowded trucker's bar, she looks around the room, wondering if anyone will step in and save her. What happens next leads Rose deep into a world of white-hot lust and animal desires, as this pure, innocent girl finds herself riding with the baddest biker gang around, known only as ... The Flowers of Hell.Warning: This 13,000+ word novella contains extremely graphic sex scenes, and is definitely not for the faint of heart. It is intended only for mature readers, aged eighteen years and above. You have been warned!",
