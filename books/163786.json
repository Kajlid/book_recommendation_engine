  "description": "The tiny village of Lusty in Ireland is home to far more secrets than it is people. Awkward city-girl, Ellie, is the last to be picked in every aspect of her life. At over six-foot, her one claim to fame is that a missile was named after her when she was born. Little is expected of her and she has delivered exactly that...until now Ellie is putting all her hopes into a study trip to Lusty. It is here that she uncovers secret, romantic letters hidden decades before. As Ellie becomes entangled in a heart-warming, but potentially tragic love-story, she begins to uncover her own first love in the most unlikely of places. Praise for Paula Clamp’s previous novels: ‘Paula has a touch of magic…once again she creates strong characters and writes about how there can be as many perspectives about a person as there are people’ Irish Examiner ‘Written with insightful genius’ Sunday World",
