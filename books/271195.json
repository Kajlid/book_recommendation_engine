  "title": "Charles Dickens' Christmas Stories: A Classic Collection for Yuletide",
  "description": "Cosy up for a festive reading bonanza with these heart-warming seasonal tales of Christmas by Charles Dickens. As well as the universally loved A Christmas Carol, the collection also includes lesser known treasures such as The Chimes, The Battle of Life, The Haunted Man and The Cricket on the Hearth. Dickens was a tireless campaigner for social justice and his empathy with the deserving poor shines through in these stories, which often culminate in the change of heart of a misanthrope.",
