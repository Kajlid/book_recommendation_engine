  "description": "Walker Davis is going to ruin me… but for once, it might be worth it. I’m a pariah, an outcast, and my life is not my own. I went to that hockey game hoping for an escape and found one in him. They call Walker Davis “Disney” for a reason, because the superstar goalie is the “Prince Charming” of every girl’s dreams. He told me he understood I just wanted one perfect night… But now he’s everywhere I go. He seems to know everything about me. He keeps saying I’m the one. And he’s trying to change my last name. He’s crazy… A wrong date can never be a happily ever after though… right?*Note: Walker Davis is a morally grey antihero who is obsessed with his girl and will do anything to keep her. This is a darker hockey romance.",
