  "description": "Joshua Elazari is an orthodox Jew. Intensely brilliant and charismatic, he is and advanced Talmudic student at an elite Rabbinical college. And at the same time a doctoral student in English at Princeton University. Christine Mellowrand is a strikingly beautiful coed in her final year year of undergraduate studies at Princeton. Exceptionally intelligent and charming, and strong willed, she also enjoys the advantages of wealth and a highly cultured home. Josh is invited to deliver the second of the English department faculty lectures during the Fall semester. Chris attends and is overwhelmed. She becomes fascinated by Josh as a person and by the realm of thought he opens up to her. A singularly exquisite and passionate love draws together two extraordinary young people who were not meant for each other - the brilliant, uncompromising Jew and the exceptionally gifted and striking Gentile girl. Powerful and perceptive, interlaced with keen humor and sharp wit. This book provides a glimpse into the Yeshiva world of Orthodox Judaism, its philosophies and values.",
