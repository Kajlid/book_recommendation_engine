  "title": "The Red Badge of Courage",
  "description": "The Civil War, with brother pitted against brother, is perhaps the most traumatic event in U.S. history. Of all American novels, The Red Badge of Courage most powerfully captures the sights and sounds of that conflict, and the emotions of those who fought. Seduced by dreams of military glory, Henry Fleming enlists in the Union Army, only to discover that real warfare is radically different from his fantasies. We see every incident from Henry's point of view--from his anxiety before battle and confusion and terror of actual conflict--giving us a particularly vivid sense of a soldier's experience. A truly classic work of American literature.",
