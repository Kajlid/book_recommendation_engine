  "description": "It has been only a single calendar block since Orien completed learning at the Penhaven Arts school, but finding himself far away from achieving his dream of conducting stage shows in Tietopus Town, he is anxious to learn to fly a jetcar, stage his own performance and maybe win the heart of the lead actress. The only thing standing in his way is real life, which is far harder to live out than his dreams.‘Orien’s Jet lessons’ is part of the Orien series, which includes ‘Orien and the League of Artists’ and ‘Orien Battles the Fog-Devils.",
