  "description": "Barrett McGuire is the grumpiest, growliest, most frustrating man on the planet.He’s also my boss, my first crush, and—three months ago—my one and only one-night-stand.I’m pretty sure I’m already addicted to his body, but that doesn’t matter. After an empowering solo trip to the other side of the world—during which Barrett made no attempt to contact me or discuss said one night stand—I’ve realized I have to let go of this crush and move on. I’ve wasted enough time pining for a man who doesn’t feel the way I do.Now that I'm home, I’m determined to keep the walls around my heart high and impenetrable.Then Barrett adopts the world’s ugliest dog because he knows how much I love animals. He also texts to say how much he missed me, then shows up at my house simply to devour my lady parts (while saying naughty things that give me a new appreciation for his bossy side).He tells me he wants to change, to be what I need, then proves it with the most romantic “just one bed” weekend ever.But can Barrett and I make it work in the real world?Or will the scars on his heart ruin our second chance the way it did our first?Welcome to Bad Dog where the men are incredible, the animals are ridiculous, and the happy ever afters are super emotional and steamy. Not Today Bossman is a Standalone Romance with Spice!",
