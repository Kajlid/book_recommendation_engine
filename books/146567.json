  "description": "Warning: This story was written to unlock your darkest fantasies and innermost desires. It is not for the faint of heart and is not your mother's erotica. All of the sexual descriptions found in this book are very explicit in nature. It's not suitable for someone under 18 years of age. Read at your own risk.  Belle's choice to become the Beast's prisoner changes her in ways she never imagined.  After her Beast transforms back into his human form, they eagerly explore each other’s bodies. He can ram his fingers into her and probe his tongue deep between her lips. She can feel the warm bulge of his muscles and run her fingers through his red-gold hair, but it’s not enough. Their sexual affair began long before he was human, and Belle can’t help remembering what it was like to have sex with her Beast. She learned to love him through all the blood and sacrifice it required. Belle and Prince Adam must learn to find new ways to express their depraved desires  Words: 16,700",
