  "title": "Rrose is a Rrose is a Rrose: Gender Performance in Photography",
  "description": "The Guggenheim's classic study of photo-based artworks that question gender identity is back in print at last. This important volume, whose title combines Gertrude Stein's famous motto, \"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose,\" with the name of Marcel Duchamp's feminine alter ego, Rrose Selavy, features portraits, self-portraits and photomontages in which the gender of the subject is highlighted through performance for the camera or through technical manipulation of the image. In many of the works, photography's strong aura of realism and objectivity promotes a fantasy of total gender transformation. In other pieces, the photographic representation articulates an incongruity between the posing body and its assumed costume. Features work by Cecil Beaton, Brassa‘, Claude Cahun, Marcel Duchamp, Hannah Hàch, Man Ray, Janine Antoni, Matthew Barney, Nan Goldin, Lyle Ashton Harris, Robert Mapplethorpe, Annette Messager, Yasumasa Morimura, Catherine Opie, Lucas Samaras, Cindy Sherman, Inez van Lamsweerde and Andy Warhol.",
