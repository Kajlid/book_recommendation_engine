  "description": "I found my stillness, my space between breaths, when I was a kid. The answer is simple. If it hurts, I pour music on it.   After years of hard work, it's finally happening. Tragic has a number one album and we've gone from being discussed as one hit wonders to hearing words like meteoric mentioned alongside our name.  With two tours planned and another album on its way, we have a lot to look forward to. Playing in a different city every night, the shimmer and roar of the crowd, after parties and endless women.  My lifelong dream is in the palm of my hand until one phone call leaves everything hanging in the balance.",
