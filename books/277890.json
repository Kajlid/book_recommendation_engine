  "title": "Coast To Coast Ghosts: True Stories of Hauntings Across America",
  "description": "Ghosts have been the entertaining subject of many works of fiction, but they're even more intriguing (and perhaps even scarier) when they are the focus of real-life hauntings in our own backyard. An employee of the St. James Hotel in New Mexico watches in shock as a fair-haired toddler with a terribly disfigured face disappears into the floor. This is just one of the paranormal mysteries Leslie Rule shares with us--a result of extensive interviews and research uncovering the reasons behind ghost sightings across the country.Coast to Coast Ghosts features dozens of spine-tingling, real-life ghost stories and approximately fifty black-and-white photographs taken by Rule, including some believed to have captured actual apparitions.Only the reader can decide. . . .",
