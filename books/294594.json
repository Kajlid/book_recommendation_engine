  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B07TD1HR7GRyn Leverette has just lived through the worst day of her life. Not only did she find her boyfriend cheating on her, but she also goes home to find an assassin waiting to kill her. The kicker? He’s a vampire working for someone who desperately wants her dead. For reasons unknown, Ryn is suddenly sucked into a world of darkness and blood. Bummer, since becoming a vampire wasn't exactly on her college to-do list. The only upside to the situation is the gorgeous man whose scent calls to her like a siren song. It’s called a blood-bond, and if Ryn takes the bite she so desperately desires, she might end up the mate of the most handsome man she’s ever seen. But is she ready for that after her last failed relationship? Or will the assassin catch up to her before she can decide?  *** This is Book One in a multiple part series! The first book flows right into the second, which will be published very soon!",
