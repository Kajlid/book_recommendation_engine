  "title": "Mundaka Upanishad With Commentary of Shankara",
  "description": "The Mundaka Upanishad is one of the major Upanishads belonging to the Atharva Veda. Mundaka means ''shaved'' like a shaved head. The teachings revealed in this Upanishad are meant to leave the student clean, or shaved of the veil of ignorance. Indeed, the study of this Upanishad has been traditionally confined to the shaven-heads, or the sannyasins , who have renounced everything and devoted themselves exclusively to contemplation. The book consists of 64 mantras. The Gambhirananda translation includes the Devanagri script, English translation and Shankara's commentary. This is the second edition as revised by the translator.",
