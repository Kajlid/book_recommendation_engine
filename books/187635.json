  "description": "Avery Nolan’s father has never been a part of her life.  As a result, she finds herself becoming a caretaker. Always trying to please other people, willing to tuck her own concerns aside for the happiness of others.  She is selfless.  She is a nurturer.  On the outside, it appears Kade Thomas has it all, but no one can understand the guilt and ache he feels daily.  He is haunted by his past.  Every time he closes his eyes, he finds himself reliving the same nightmare, over and over again.  He blames himself for the loss of Jenna.  He pushed her too far and she paid the price.  Avery saw something special in Kade, from the first day she met him—she could feel it.  But the darkness that consumes him is…  Uncontrollable.  Will she finally be the one to break down the walls he’s built around his heart and soul? Or will she find some walls are just Indestructible…",
