The rich girl has a blast with the country folk. The poor girl indulges in the wealthy lifestyle she'd only dreamed about.They both sing like birds, but are pretty shy about it. Being pretty girls in the South, their relatives enter them in a beauty pageant of course.Everything falls to pieces and the girls feel bad they caused so much pain with the switch.But it all works out in a way that brings them the family they yearned for and much more. So much more.",
