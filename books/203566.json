And suddenly everything shifts.The deep bond growing between them wasn’t part of their enemies’ plan. No one counted on Brandon and Justine falling in love.Not even Brandon and Justine.A sensual 18th century tale of deception and revenge, and the healing of two souls hungering for love and absolution.",
