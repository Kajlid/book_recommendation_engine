  "title": "Therapeutic Communication: Knowing What to Say When",
  "description": "This uniquely practical volume examines precisely what the therapist can say at key moments to enhance therapeutic effectiveness and the process of healing and change. Through vivid clinical illustrations, the book illuminates why some communications in therapy are particularly effective, while others addressing essentially the very same content may actually be countertherapeutic. Wachtel's powerful integrative theory also provides new insights into how psychological disorder evolves, how it is maintained, and how psychotherapy contributes to change.",
