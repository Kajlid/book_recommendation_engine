  "description": "Mia Blake wasn’t the first girl to be taken by the vampires.She had heard all about the girls who were missing, and even though they were only “missing”, she knew in her heart that those girls were dead. She felt sad for them, sure. But more than that, she felt glad that they had been strangers – not someone she knew, and certainly not her. Things like that didn’t happen to girls like her. They always happened to someone else, and that’s why she barely blinked as she made her way across an empty football field, through a deserted parking lot, to meet a fate she had arrogantly assumed was reserved for other people.She was a stupid girl.She paid for it.",
