  "description": "Gabby   Looking back, I should have seen the signs. Perhaps I did, but I subconsciously chose to ignore them.  From the time I was ten, when I first met Dylan, I knew he was my forever guy. Back then, I couldn’t put words to what I was feeling, but, as the years progressed, I came to recognize it for what it was—soul-deep love. The kind only very few people ever get to experience.  Dylan was more than just my best friend, my childhood sweetheart, my lover. He was my soul mate. We were carved from the same whole—destined to be together forever.  Until he changed.  And I believed I was no longer good enough.  Until he shattered me so completely, it felt like I ceased to exist.  And I’d never experienced such heart-crushing pain.  Until he leveled me a second time, and I truly wanted to die.  But I had to stay strong because I wasn’t alone in this cruel twist of fate.  I look to the sky, pleading with the stars, begging someone to tell me what I should do because I don’t know how to deal with this. I don’t know how to cope when my forever has changed, and I can’t help wondering if I had seen the signs earlier, if I’d pushed him, would it have been enough to save us?  Or had fate already decided to alter our forever?  Due to mature content and potential triggers this book is only recommended to readers over the age of eighteen.",
