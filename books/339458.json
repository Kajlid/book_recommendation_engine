  "description": "It was happening again! February was here and Kathy still didn't have a date for Valentine's Day. What was wrong with these guys? Kathy was sexy and fun, but no one ever noticed that come February. No, it was always some other woman who got the flowers sent to her office, the chocolates delivered to her desk, or that special piece of jewelry presented at the restaurant. And it was definitely always some other woman who got swept off her feet and taken home for a night of incredible, mind-blowing passion. This year Kathy wanted in on the magic and she was pulling out all of the stops to make it happen. Slinky dresses, spiked shoes, alluring perfume, she'd do whatever it took to get the right man's attention. This year, come February 14th, Kathy wouldn't be the one sitting at home. Whatever it took this would not be another dateless Valentine's Day.",
