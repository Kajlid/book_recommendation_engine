  "description": "Who am I? Where did I come from? Where am I going? We all have asked ourselves these questions, but few have sought the answers that truly make sense. Dr. Ivan Figueroa-Otero not only dares to answer them, but humbly presents a guide to understanding these and other questions about our spiritual nature, while closing the apparent gap between the religious and scientific vision with an eclectic and original delivery. \"I invite you to explore your soul in the infinite dimensional spirals of knowledge of the School of Life. I hope that the fruits of my failings help you to surpass your exams with fewer burdens and more joy.\" Iv√°n Figueroa-Otero MD FACS",
