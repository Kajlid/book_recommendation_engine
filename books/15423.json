  "description": "For fans of Robert Jordan's  Wheel of Time  and George Martin's  Game of Thrones  comes a truly epic,action-packed fantasy with stunning female leads.  The Steel Queen is the first book of  The Silk & Steel Saga,  a seven book adventure full of knights and swords, love and betrayal, sorcery and seduction. Kingdoms and characters come alive as they are woven together in complex plot twists. Evil is brilliant,handsome, and even seductive, using human nature to deceive, divide, corrupt and conquer. But a word of warning is due, for this saga is not for the faint of heart, but for those who want serious characters with smart, complex plot twists. You empathize with the good and pray they prevail but you truly feast on the bad who are utterly compelling. Azinger's series is fast-paced action-packed fantasy. Katherine, 'The Imp': a young princess with the stout heart of a warrior will challenge the minions of a thousand-year-old evil. The Spider Queen; who uses her beauty to beguile, her spies to foresee, and her gold to control, will need all of her skill and strength to fight a rebellion with her own blood at it's heart. Steffan, the puppeteer, will corrupt the innocent and unwary with greed and desire, as he sets an entire kingdom ablaze.",
