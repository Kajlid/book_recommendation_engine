  "description": "His only mission was to protect the human descendant of Danae...Triton, god of the sea and commander of the Warrior Tritones' only job was to stop the Gigantes from overthrowing the Olympians and to keep their world from the eyes of man. Because of a promise given by his father centuries ago, he had been sent to rescue the foolish mortal Ariadne Phillips.Little did he know that her dark beauty and personality would entrap him as no other goddess or mermaid have tried to do. He wanted to keep her but could he live with her for eternity if it turned out to be a mistake? In his quest to save her, he...an immortal deity had been forced to laugh, cry and had his own life placed in jeopardy when the very thought or idea had never existed. She only wanted to fulfill her childhood dream and meet a gorgeous Greek male while she's at it...Ari got the opportunity of a lifetime...to model for a magazine and visit the beautiful islands of Greece.  Strange and erotic dreams plagued her after reading an old Greek journal passed down by her late grandmother.  After literally meeting the man of her \"dreams\" and finding out his god status, she questioned what would he want with a mortal. Getting to know his world and coming to the understanding that you don't have to be omnipotent gave her the confidence to stand up and fight for what she wanted and not even the threat of death would stand in her way.  *PS* A head's up; this is an adult book for grown folks. Just because we're older, doesn't mean we don't like to have fun. Meant for 18+ Enter at your own risk.",
