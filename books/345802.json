  "description": "The suburb where Adam, Paul, and Josey live has transformed into a wasteland of empty houses and slow, shambling dead. In this new world where a deadly virus transforms its victims into living dead things hungering for human flesh, this small band of survivors must do anything and everything they can to survive from one day to the next. In the city, a small haven has appeared in the form of a fortified church building... but the good Reverend in charge isn't everything he seems. The 'holy place' is quickly becoming a madhouse surrounded by the dead and led by the insane. Adam and his friends trek unknowingly across this mysterious and dangerous post-apocalyptic world on a collision course with the vicious church dwellers in the city. Will there be a way out for the survivors, or are they all headed for a Dead End?",
