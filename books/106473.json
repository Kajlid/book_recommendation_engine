Someone else is out there with him, though, watching, waiting to cause him harm. After he’s run off the road, Oliver has no choice but to aid Langham in finding her killer—no choice because more people are killed and more people call out to him…he’s unable to ignore their pleas.As the body count grows and the investigation becomes more complex, Oliver realises that Langham is indeed very gay—and out to make Oliver his.",
