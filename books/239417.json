  "description": "She has a ring on her finger. He doesn’t care.To prevent unwanted advances from horny jerks, Serena Lee’s friend gave her a fake engagement ring. And it has worked like magic—until she encounters Shawn Choi, her overly possessive and controlling (but ridiculously sexy) ex, in a coffee shop. Despite the rock on her finger, Shawn relentlessly pursuits her. His goal—to get her in his bed and to put a ring of his own on that little finger. ***A contemporary romance novelette featuring insta-love and an over-the-top alpha male lead***Excerpt:He took her hand, frowning. “Is that an engagement ring?”She ripped her hand away from his, hoping the ring would work its guy-repelling magic. “Yes.”“It’s a lot smaller than the one I offered you.”Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. “Size doesn’t matter.”“Oh, we both know that’s not true.”She bristled at his double entendre. “My fiance is waiting for me at home. He has a black belt.”Amusement shone in his brown eyes. “Was that supposed to scare me?”Why wasn’t he letting up? He was actually sliding closer to her body instead of farther away from her. “I have a fiance,” she said.“And I’m supposed to care because…?” He lifted her chin, staring at her full lips, the lips he’d kissed at least hundreds of times that one summer.",
