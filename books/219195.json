  "description": "Transcendent Bread is a work conceived while I was studying the apocalyptic scriptures in the Bible, and it concerns the events and people that surrounded it as word of it spread. Written during and somewhat after it happened, it is an honest and factual account of these events, which took place from the mid-’70s to the mid-’80s.",
