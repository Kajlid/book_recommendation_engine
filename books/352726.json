  "description": "Book Three in the Lost Boys and Love Letters Series A gunshot wound isn't enough to slow down Detective Patrick Hawkins, so his friends conspire to ship him off to visit his best friend and ex-lover, Dr. Julian Piet, for some forced recovery time. If only Julian and his new boyfriend weren't so disgustingly cute all the time, Patrick might actually have a chance to enjoy himself. Enter Brad Wilde, Alberta's hottest bartender. Brad might be inexperienced and shy by nature, but that doesn't stop the sparks from flying between them. But Patrick is used to casual flings and one-night stands, and he's not quite sure what to do about his attraction to Brad. All of Patrick's doubts seem trivial when Julian's neighbor's child goes missing and the whole town mobilizes to find her. When the search for Hallie turns up a decomposing body, the police begin to fear they'll never find her alive. As Brad and Patrick try to help, they will have to overcome the physical and emotional distance between them to have any hope of finding Hallie before she falls victim to the same fate as the mysterious corpse.",
