Born two years after her father’s death by specialised IVF procedure Kaelyn has a special talent – she knows when the vampires are close. Together with Kaelyn, Narelle must find other survivors and band together if they are to stay alive. Perth is no longer safe and they must journey north to the abandoned army camp at Lake Argyle. The vampires are looking for the one shining light, the one destined to be the saviour of the vampire race, and when they learn that ‘light’ is travelling north, they follow. The fight for human survival has once again begun.",
