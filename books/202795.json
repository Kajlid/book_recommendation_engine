  "description": "Fiction by Fiction series is intended to bring new directions and up to date trends in fiction. The present Fiction by Fiction book presents Shakespeare's Hamlet Remixed by Nigel Tomm. Nigel Tomm's Hamlet is not a drama in the traditional sense. This is a drama that takes place between words and language itself, in which Nigel Tomm deconstructs Shakespeare's Hamlet. Hamlet here is a mere word, lost in its own and externally imposed meanings that create the action, which starts, continues, and ends in an abstract scene representing life and everything beyond it is reflected in mirrors, green color, and endless dialogues that are not present, but are substituted by incessant speaking or just text and words, which create and undo themselves in the eyes of the reader.",
