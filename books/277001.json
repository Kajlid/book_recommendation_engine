  "title": "The Phantom of the Opal",
  "description": "Out of print.​When Tig Alden, former teen detective on TV's Private Eye High, returns to the Outer Banks of North Carolina for her mom's funeral, she's shocked to discover that her mother, Professor Caroline Riggs-Alden, was apparently the victim of not just the accidental fall that took her life, but also of theft. The distinctive black opal ring that Caroline had always worn—the ring that she had promised to leave to Tig's fifteen-year-old daughter, Paige—isn't on her finger when they open the coffin. But who could have taken Caroline's ring? Was it the funeral director? Or perhaps the college student who found Caroline's body at the foot of the stairs in the science building?Tig is determined to find the opal and to sort out the odd behavior of her mother's cat, the aptly-named Attila. Her detective skills are a little rusty, however, and this time, there are no writers to tell her whodunit. She'll have to rely on her wits—and maybe a bit of help from the cat.",
