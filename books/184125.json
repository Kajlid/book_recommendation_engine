  "title": "The Fox",
  "description": "The simple life of a woodland fox is turned upside down when a cataclysmic natural disaster throws the small island habitat into chaos. Creatures of all shapes and sizes -- from tiny rodents to towering bears and majestic whales -- scramble for safety, but this intrepid fox inexplicably runs TOWARDS the danger. This exciting tale by author Frederick Brremaud is told without narration or dialogue, conveyed entirely through the beautiful illustrations of Federico Bertolucci. A beautiful, all-ages title that explores genuine natural behavior through the dramatic lens of Disney-esque storytelling, like a nature documentary in illustration.",
