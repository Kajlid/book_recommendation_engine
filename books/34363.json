  "description": "Cherry Ames is back, just as you remember her! The books are just as you remember them, retaining the same look, feel, and sense of adventure and patriotism as when they were first published. With fully illustrated color covers and a soft-finished hardcover format just like the originals, these books will transport you back to the days when you were reading about this spunky young nurse. Series editor and registered nurse Harriet Forman was inspired by, and remains a devoted fan of, Cherry Ames: \"...I was going to follow in her footsteps and become a nurseÂ—nothing else would do.\"Worn out from an exhausting year of working as a visiting nurse in New York, Cherry takes a 'vacation' as staff nurse on a two weeks cruise to Curacao. Cherry's working vacation on a glamorous cruise ship entangles her in a search for a hidden stash of rare ambergris.",
