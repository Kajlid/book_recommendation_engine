  "title": "The Mind of the Soul: Responsible Choice",
  "description": "People make hundreds of choices every day, yet most of them feel they have little control over their lives. Here, Gary Zukav, author of the monumental bestseller The Seat of the Soul, joins his spiritual partner, Linda Francis, in a revolutionary look at the power of choice to change lives from the inside out.The Mind of the Soul describes with easy-to-read text and practical exercises how each moment in life presents a whether to persist in old, limited patterns or to experiment with the unbounded, liberating potential ahead. Whether your choices are large -- concerning work, marriage, parenting, divorce -- or appear small, such as whether to show annoyance when angry, they carry consequences for which you must assume responsibility. The Mind of the Soul shows you how, in every situation, one choice among the many that present themselves is the optimal choice -- to create harmony, cooperation, or reverence for life. This special book offers the freedom to experiment with your life, to see what does or doesn't work for you, to change yourself instead of blaming others -- in short, to open your heart and develop authentic power.With the same sensitivity that made The Heart of the Emotional Awareness so meaningful, Zukav and Francis guide you, step by step, in developing the ability to break free of the unconscious choices that hold you back and limit your fulfillment in life.",
