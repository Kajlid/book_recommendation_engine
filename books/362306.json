  "description": "As the Librarian for a small sleepy town of Demon, Arizona, Lani Monroe has a certain sedate image to maintain. But her calm life takes a hot turn when she falls through a portal to Hell and lands in the lap of the oh-so-sexy Prince of Pestilence. Meryk has no idea how the human ended up in his arms or why she seems to think she’s asleep, but he’s more than willing to prove he can be the demon of her dreams.",
