  "description": "I was only trying to help a friend. I swear. I was legit asking for a friend who was finally ready to date again.I knew what she wanted in a man — smart, funny, ambitious, well-read (no, the sports section doesn't count), and plays a wicked game of badminton.So I did what any good friend would do. Posted it for her. It seemed like a good idea at the time — I’d weed through the candidates, and bring her my top picks.But then he responded. Is it wrong to date the guy I screened for my bestie? Not asking for a friend.ASKING FOR A FRIEND is a Boyfriend Material series standalone! Three best friends. Three outrageous proposals. Three chances to fall in love. Three brand new standalones from Lauren Blakely!",
