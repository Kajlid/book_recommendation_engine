Maybe not anyone.When I find out I inherited a bookstore and apartment on a small East Coast island, I jump at the chance for a new life.Turns out, I’ve also inherited a sexy, tattooed guy who not only rents the space next to my store for his tattoo parlor but my apartment too.Did I mention he’s really hot?And surprisingly sweet?GideonI wasn’t looking for a roommate, but it’s not like I can stay at Milo’s place while he’s banished to a hotel.Our unlikely friendship is instant. According to Milo, we’re bestie goals.And if he doesn’t wear pants at home, who am I to complain?Milo’s not like anyone I’ve ever known. I like laughing and flirting with him. He’s adorably honest, eager, and sexier than he realizes.Now I just have to figure out how to convince him that maybe it’s time for an upgrade from bestie to boyfriend goals.",
