  "description": "The Korean War has often been referred to as a forgotten war, and the SNB is certainly a forgotten aircraft. But just as the military in this war served as valiantly as those in other wares, this plane also performed its job as well as its more glamorous counterparts. In Bug Smasher, a novel author John J. Fischer based on his own flying experience during the Korean War, tribute is paid to the SNB. Called Bug Smashers because of this result of their low-altitude flight, these planes transported brass and wounded soldiers throughout the war area, often encountering dangerous situations but not equipped for heavy combat. As fine reading, Bug Smasher provides a little-seen view of this unjustly neglected war.",
