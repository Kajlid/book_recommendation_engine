  "description": "Where do the king's beautiful daughter disappear to night after night?  And who can solve the mystery of the twelve pairs of dancing slippers, worn to shreds by the morning?Internationally acclained illustrator Jane Ray brings to vivid life the fun-loving princesses of the classic Grimm fairy tale, as they boldly escape the confines of their father's castle.  Each one is a character in her own right--a loving sister and a not-so-dutiful daughter--enjoying their moments of freedom as well as their beautiful brocade ballgowns.With its sumptuous detailed illustrations and gold and silver highlights, The Twelve Dancing Princesses is the latest jewel in the crown of Jane Ray's retellings of classic stories, which are themselves rapidly becoming modern classics.",
