As one of the top embryologists in the country, I’ve spent years creating babies in the lab for other people as my own dreams of motherhood fade.I’m done waiting. I decide to start the journey to parenthood alone.Then Quinn strolls back into my life, with all the finesse of a hurricane. I’m a fool to think I don’t want him anymore, and one reckless night of passion ends with me pregnant by the man I swore I’d never love again. Now he doesn’t just want my heart, he wants it all. The baby. Love. A life where we’re happy. But even as he promises me the future I always desired, I can’t help but fear that something will rip him away from me again. This time . . . indefinitely.",
