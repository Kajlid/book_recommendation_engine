  "description": "Chikit-chikit-chik!A squirrel is chittering. Bees are buzzing. The sun is high in the sky. And Little Owl is supposed to be asleep, but when he wakes up early, he’s just too curious to close his eyes again. The forest he knows so well at nighttime is completely different – and exciting – in the day! After watching butterflies dance, wolf pups play, and then his very first rainbow, Little Owl returns to his tree. He has many new stories for his mama.A blue sky companion to Little Owl’s Night , Little Owl’s Day is just right for young children and the perfect introduction to the joy and wonder of the natural world.",
