  "description": "If she had simply been the mother of Winston Churchill, her place in history would have been assured. But the Brooklyn-born Jennie was also the most fascinating and desirable woman of her age, the toast and the scandal of two continents throughout her long life. Volume I, THE ROMANTIC YEARS, follows Jennie as she leaves her wealthy American home to marry Lord Randolph Churchill. Lord Randolph was a rising politician whom she helped shape into one of the most important men in the British Empire. His career was cut short by his early death in 1895 at the age of 46. \"A captivating biography about a mid-Victorian `modern' woman who was villified, envied, loved, loathed--but never ignored.\" (The Cleveland Press)",
