  "description": "James Williams' life isn't what he thought it would be. In his thirties now, he's a divorcee who finally admitted he's gay. As a sub without a Dom, he joins Incognito to find the love of his life--but soon realizes it's not easy, especially when his life is literally burning down around him. Soren is big, he's bad, and he's had his heart broken one too many times by beautiful men. He spends his time at the club sating his physical needs and ignoring his heart, until sad-eyed James stands up to him and makes him realize he needs more.",
