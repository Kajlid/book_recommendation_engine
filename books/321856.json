He knows having her design the inn they’ve always loved is exactly what she needs to find herself and heal her heart again, and he’s on a short timeline to show her that he, and Pine Cove Spings are home. Time is ticking for Madison and Colton to get the inn ready for the Christmas Tour of Homes and when he lays his heart on the line, she has to decide between old dreams and new. Will they find love at the Sugar Plum Inn?This novella was previously published in the Sugar Plum Kisses anthology (Nov. 2021), under the same title.",
