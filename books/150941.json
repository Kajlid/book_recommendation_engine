  "description": "Time Skip is a twist on the usual time travel tale. Our protagonist doesn't exactly travel through time, he skips back in it.Curtis Lovelle was a middle aged man with a happy life. He had a good marriage and little boy who was the light of his life. When asked by a coworker, “If you could do things over again, would you do anything different?” Curtis was sure he would not. But when he woke up in his parent’s house, eighteen years in the past, he would find out how just how impossible it could be to do recreate the life he led.Curtis begins again as a sixteen year old, trying desperately not to alter the course of his life. As he negotiates high school for the second time, he becomes keenly aware of how easily each mistake can send his life off on a new trajectory. And if that isn’t frustrating enough, he soon realizes that he is uniquely positioned to stop the mass murder of more than 3000 people seventeen years before it happens. Torn by his need to regain his life and his obligation to stop the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Curtis experiences heart breaking setbacks and incredible triumphs as he navigates his way through a life he has already lived.",
