  "description": "Neglected! Abused! Abandoned! Jessica grew up in what one would think is a perfect world. Wealthy parents, the best schools, and almost anything she wanted at just an arm stretch away. Almost anything! The very thing she yearns for the most is so far out of her grasp and causes her so much pain. PAIN! The very thing she tries so desperately to escape and heal, but it never seems to go away. That is until she gets a razor…and cuts! With each cut her body fills with scars, but she finds the indescribable break from reality…and her pain…that she needs. Will Jessica finally get her hearts deepest desire? Or will the razor go too deep during one of her desperate attempts to ease the pain?",
