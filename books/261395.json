  "title": "The Tenderness Of Wolves",
  "description": "A skillful blend of literary thriller, wilderness adventure, and historical romance, Stef Penney's panoramic novel traces the impact of a brutal murder on the lives of several settlers in Canada's Northern Territories in the winter of 1869. Mysteries surround the victim, a Frenchman named Laurent Jammett who once worked for the Hudson Bay Company. But in this lonely outpost on the edge of the world, everyone harbors a secret -- including Jammett's neighbor Mrs. Ross, her teenage son, Francis, and William Parker, the enigmatic half-breed trapper who sets out with her in search of the truth. Much has been made of the fact that this gorgeous set piece, with its perfectly described North American landscape, was written by an agoraphobic author who never set foot in Canada. We think it's far more astounding that The Tenderness of Wolves is the product of a first-time novelist. Surely, Stef Penney is a literary force to be reckoned with.",
