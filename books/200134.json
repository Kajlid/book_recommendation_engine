  "description": "A long time ago a mouse learned to fly . . . and crossed the Atlantic.But what happened next? Torben Kuhlmann's stunning new book transports readers to the moon and beyond! On the heels of The Tale of a Flying Mouse comes The Adventurous Journey of a Mouse to the Moon —where dreams are determined only by the size of your imagination and the biggest innovators are the smallest of all. The book ends with a brief non-fiction history of human space travel—from Galileo’s observations concerning the nature of the universe to man's first steps on the moon.",
