  "description": "Maxwell Fielding is a police detective. Gruff, stubborn, and a little blind to subtlety, Max is the perfect poster boy for stereotypical masculinity. Used to dealing with the dregs of society, he never backs down from a fight, but his attitude is a reckless one. Skyler Trent is Max’s lover, a dress designer who happens to be a cross-dresser and the polar opposite of Max. When a rough day on the job sets the stage for disaster, Max’s quick temper and a need to play knight-in-shining-armor makes a bad situation even worse. After a very observant Skyler patches Max up, both are forced to face some less-visible wounds that are just as in need of healing. Max needs to find the courage to admit a few things to Skyler—and to himself—or he might lose everything. __________ Only Words (Max & Skyler 1) is a 4,930-word gay romance of the feel-good variety. The Max & Skyler short stories by Acer Adamson are meant to be read in the following 1. Only Words (Max & Skyler 1) 2. Any Excuse (Max & Skyler 2) 3. Every Minute (Max & Skyler 3) 4.
