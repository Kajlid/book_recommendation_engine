What he imagines he will find is a girl who has grown up to become someone that the world desperately needs. Why else would his dad have died saving her? Instead, what he discovers is that Amanda can barely make it from one day to the next. Utterly disillusioned, he prepares to return home when he befriends a little girl who needs him more than anything. However, this friendship soon becomes compromised as Evan comes across Amanda again, and they start to become involved.",
