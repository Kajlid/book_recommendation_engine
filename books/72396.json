  "title": "The Song of Songs: A New Translation",
  "description": "HARDCOVER GIFT EDITIONThe Song of Songs, often referred to as the Song of Solomon, is one of the greatest love poems of all time. In their lyrical new translation, Ariel Bloch and Chana Bloch restore the sensuousness of the original language and strip away the veils of mistranslation that have obscured the power and meaning of the poem. Presented en face , this translation is scrupulously faithful to the Hebrew text.",
