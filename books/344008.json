  "title": "The Lost World of Quintana Roo",
  "description": "At the ripe old age of 21, back in 1957, Peissel gave up his Wall Street activities & went off alone to the Mexican jungles of the Quintana Roo territory where he discovered several Mayan cities lost for over 400 years. This seething jungle was the site of one of the highest civilizations ever achieved by humanity. The Mayan Indians have ruled the jungle there for 3700 years. Those Mayas still living in the jungle today preserve the physical type but have almost no memory of their vanished splendor. With colossal innocence & no food or gun (he even loses his shoes & knife), he staggers down 250 miles of Mosquito Coast discovering town after lost town which archaeologists had missed from their planes & boats. The largest town he investigates turns out to be an enormous architectural complex almost a mile square, which he describes at thrilling length. He relates his nearly constant fright with much wit & irony. Highly recommended.--Kirkus (edited)",
