  "description": "Love is blind …. I only wish it was.Because then I wouldn’t see what I can never have.  They say when you know, you know. What a load of nonsense. Because the only thing I know is …. he’s off limits. Workplace relationships are inappropriate and seedy.  Every morning I step onto his plane. Every morning he smiles and says a polite hello. I give him a controlled nod, acknowledging him as I pass, pretending not to notice him.But I can feel his eyes undress me as I walk past. And if I’m being honest, they do a lot more. If his gaze gives me tingles, I dread to think what an actual touch could do. Maybe I’m imagining the entire thing. Daydreaming the ultimate fantasy.Because he’s my Private Pilot.And I’m just his smitten boss.",
