  "description": "A moment in time, unforeseen, unavoidable, can change a life forever. A Dublin taxi driver’s life pivots on a moment of insanity when a teenage girl loses her life. So begins a dark journey for Danny Coyne; he’s not responsible for her death, yet he carries the guilt. He seeks solace in drinking and pushes away those closest to him as he steps into the life of the dead girl and forms a bond with her best friend. His self control will be tested to the limit as he seeks to mete out justice on those responsible and fight his own inner demons. Every choice has a consequence.",
