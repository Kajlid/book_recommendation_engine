  "description": "Ex-navy seal Joe Vanek and the newly arrived agent Ren Raus are sent on a mission from the private security organization Terra Vanguard. However, the seemingly simple task of gathering information on a US submarine, reveals an age-old conspiracy that proves to be far more than the agents of Terra had bargained for. Their journey in search for whoeverâ€™s behind the attack will take them all across the world - from the secrets hidden deep into the Atlantic ocean, through Germany, Russia and all the way to the frozen heart of Iceland. A submarine lost at sea during the Second World War holds more than bodies, and so do the mysterious metal caskets Vanek and Raus find in an underwater cave during their mission. A race against time with the highest stakes available; a global catastrophe, strange outbreaks spreading between hundreds of people in a seemingly unrelated manner, and a decades old secret. New bonds and intentions will be revealed, along with Ren Raus' true reason for working in Terra. Will Vanek accept his partner's personal intentions, and finally expose the web of secrets alongside Ren and his strange acquaintance, a hacker with a dark past? Ultimately, it all lies within the deep.",
