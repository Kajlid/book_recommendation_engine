They’re headed to Smith College in the fall, to continue on the path of the blueblood debutante. But something is rotten in their beloved Mexico. The Revolution has started; Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa are on the move. Adulio, their faithful servant and overseer of the Del Toro ranch has come to fetch them. They are needed in Mexico.Follow the girls on an adventure, a road to discovery where they will have to summon their courage and call upon their talents, their loyalty, their faith in each other to overcome the challenges facing them as they search for inner and outer peace, battling the old demons, greed, lust, vanity, self-doubt and a new one, likely the most difficult of them all, maturation into adulthood. The people of Mexico need them, need their help fighting the minions of a greedy oil company and the totalitarian thugs held over from the Díaz Regime, with the father of Yellow Journalism thrown in for good measure.Read the story of these strong and intelligent young women as they respond to first love, romance, intrigue and betrayal. Will they defeat the dragon, or will it consume them, take them down and make them just one of the many victims in the sad and tragic life story that is Mexico?Marta’s Quest is the final chapter in The Mule Tamer Trilogy, chronicling the exploits, trials and tribulations of this remarkable and heroic family.",
