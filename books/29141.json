  "description": "“I do not know what you have done, but put your mouth right here. Confess your crime to this fruit jar as though it were God’s ear.” ~ from The Whisper JarSome secrets are kept in jars — others, in books.Some are left forgotten in musty rooms — others, created in old barns.Some are brought about by destiny — others, born in blood.Secrets — they are the hidden heart of this collection. In these pages, you will encounter a Blood Digger who bonds two children irrevocably together; a young woman who learns of her destiny through the random selection of a Bible verse; and a boy whose life begins to reflect the stories he reads…Most importantly, though, if someone should ever happen to offer you a Jilly Jally Butter Mint, just say “No!”",
