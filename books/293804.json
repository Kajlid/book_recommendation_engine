  "description": "From Top 100 Amazon Bestselling Author, R.C. Stephens, comes an emotional small-town romance about second chances and the power of true love.  Some love stories are picture perfect. That’s the complete opposite of us. I fell in love with Knox when I was just a girl. Our love was the kind of love to last a lifetime, but deceit tore us apart. He left me behind to become a world-renowned rock star. Now he’s back in our small town, and he wants a second chance, but he doesn’t realize how deep the deceit in this town runs. Once, a small town with big lies, was enough to tear us apart. Can it also be what brings us back together?*This book was previously published under a different title and cover in 2016. This is a refreshed cover, title, and storyline.*",
