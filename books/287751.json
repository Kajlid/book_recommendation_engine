NOW IT'S TIME FOR HER REIGN.Aurora Pavan wanted to change her world.She wanted to protect her people, not because they paid taxes, but because they deserved to live without fear. She wanted Pavan to be a home that welcomed everyone--remnants, stormhunters, and witches included.For the first time in her life, she did not dread the duty into which she was born. She wanted it.Then she met him. The Stormlord--the man who wielded the same magic as she, but with the intent to destroy rather than save. The Aurora Pavan who came home from that confrontation was not the same girl that had braved the wildlands and joined a rebellion.

And her kingdom needs her.If only she can keep the new darkness inside her at bay.The series that USA Today called \"bright, electric, and imaginative\" continues: Aurora Pavan rises to take her throne in this third installment of the Stormheart series by New York Times bestselling author Cora Carmack.",
