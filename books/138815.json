  "description": "A coming-of-age novel set in the counterculture of the 1960s.\"Stained Glass Rain is as image dense and metaphysically jam-packed as any acid trip. Yet for all the very accurate descriptions of hallucinatory experience, this book is no mere nostalgia trip.... Like LSD itself, the sixties have been demonized and beatified but rarely have they been humanized as fully as in this novel.\" --Howard V. Hendrix,",
