  "description": "See me in the tux between the redhead with the deep-V dress and the topless blonde? The guy holding the pomegranate mojito? That's me, Simon Coffe, owner of Hideaway Cove in Sorendi Isle. The party kicks ass, people are having a great time, and I’ve got my sights set on this classy Asian beauty across the pool. But then, my assistant informs me that an environmentalist has arrived to shut down my swim-with-the-dolphins attraction. A woman named Jia Whitaker, determined to hate me. And, oh yeah, it's the classy Asian beauty across the pool. The one I was about to hit on. Nothing my charm can’t fix. Game on.",
