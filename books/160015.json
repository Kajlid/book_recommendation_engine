  "description": "\"'Masterpiece' would be an exaggeration, but only a small one.\"―Andrew Ervin, Washington Post Book World \"A phantasmagoria of American paranoia and self-loathing in the person of a deranged but somehow good-hearted middle-aged mail carrier in steep decline, the book hums with a kind of chipper angst,\" writes Jonathan Lethem in the Los Angeles Times Book Review . Mailman tells the blackly comic story of Albert Lippincott. Albert is Nestor, New York's mailman extraordinaire―aggressively cheerful, obsessively efficient. But he also has a few things to hide: his habit of reading other people's mail, a nervous breakdown, and a sexually ambiguous entanglement with his sister. Now his supervisors are on to his letter-hoarding compulsion, and there's a throbbing pain under his right arm. Things are closing in on Albert, who will soon be forced to confront, once and for all, his life's failures. Funny and moving, driven by a wild, compulsive interior voice, Mailman is a unique creation, a deeply original American novel. Already optioned to the movies, this astonishing and kinetically charged tale was one of the most exuberantly praised novels of 2003.",
