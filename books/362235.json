A small band of survivors crosses what's left of America, in constant danger and trying to hold onto what little humanity they can.In the blink of an eye, humanity is lost, and the Crossed are upon us. Men, women, and children alike fall victim to the mystery infection that makes killers out of parents and rapists out of lovers. Ruthless, berserk, and evil beyond measure, these cackling demons spread their plague across the Earth, brining humanity to near-extinction. Now, a small band of survivors make their cautious way across a deserted America, existing in a state of constant terror. The only thing they have in common is their determination to survive... but in this frightening new world, survival has a cost all its own. How far will they go to stay alive, and can they do so without become monsters themselves?",
