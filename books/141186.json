  "description": "Scandal forced Lady Lily Melrose into an untenable decision: marry the man she wanted but who wanted someone else or leave her home for America. She gambled and stayed. Now, almost four years later, Lily is ready to gamble again—on a future that means leaving her neglectful, absent husband behind. But when a deadly adversary threatens them both, Lily realizes how little she understood about her husband—and her marriage. She's faced with another impossible choice: leave the man she loved to face certain death or stay and fight to help him deliver on a promise he no longer remembers.Robert Melrose was raised as the forgotten third-born son with no future—without even the label of black sheep to keep him respectable. Not content with obscurity, he cultivated his own path to power, aligning himself with a world where betrayal is deadly. But when an accident wipes away his past, Robert can't remember who he is or what he's done. What he does know is that his wife, Lily, evokes a strong need inside—a need to prove he's better than his past. But when his past becomes a present danger, Robert must choose: gain the trust and love of the woman intent on leaving or let her walk away from him and the danger that might cost both their lives.---------------Also included in Heating It Up, One Hero at a Time: Seven Full-Length Sensual Historical Romance Novels, A Limited Edition Boxed Sethttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...",
