  "description": "Alternate cover edition for ASIN B003CV7UB6Haters gonna hate.Eighteen-year-old Junie Baltimore is glad the band Roman Holiday is dead, done, so last year. She can finally take their wannabe rock songs off the jukebox in her late father's bar and introduce her simple-minded peers to real rock 'n roll. It's the perfect plan―until she accidentally crosses paths with the estranged lead singer, Roman Montgomery, and finds herself oddly attracted to his quirky humor and hipster red suspenders. He isn't half-bad, really. In fact, he likes rock 'n roll, too―and he has a killer arm tat.But Roman is hiding a secret that is slowly eating him from the inside out. The truth is buried somewhere beneath his guarded emerald eyes, but is Junie willing to risk everything―including her late father's bar―to find out what it is?Because guys like him never fall for girls like her. Not even in love songs.Who is she kidding? It's an easy choice... right?",
