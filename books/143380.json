  "description": "He'd never really be all right again, but it was what he deserved after the war. He was broken, he knew it. Life messed you up, and all that was left to do was the best you can to survive.Yeah, he was messed up, but so was she, worse than he could ever imagine. Any chance that two people so shattered could help each other to heal and learn to love? Especially when one is human...and one is not.Tamesine had a past that she couldn't remember, and was afraid to try, because nearly 800 years ago, tragedy drove her beyond sanity. Now, she wanted to be well and whole again...and in L.A. the universe provided an answer. He walked into her dreams, literally...a stranger, human, no less...and that should never have been possible. But there he was, in as much need as she was. Pain had ripped them apart from their paths. Perhaps they had been brought together for a greater destiny.Â Book 7, Tamesine's story, one of the most powerful vampires on Earth, and a man from Wisconsin who didn't think he should be alive at all.",
