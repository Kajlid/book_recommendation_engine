  "description": "Good and evil play their game to determine whether or not humanity gets a second chance or not, and their pawns are the living and the dead in Adrian's world. ALPA and Westfield have buried the hatchet and formed a strong alliance, both their settlements safe for a time and growing slowly. It's so safe Adrian has even found the time to find a new kind of love with Mallory. All is well.But when evil plays the game, it plays for keeps, and the greatest move of all requires the movement of a piece very close to Adrian.And when Adrian is betrayed by someone he loves, the whole world may suffer the consequences of his Wrath.Wrath, Book Five of the AUD epic brings a whole new vision of the apocalypse to the story. Good and evil speak out for better or worse in Providence and Dream a Little Dream, and perhaps worst of all, in A Traitor's Death, Adrian's will to go on might be shattered for good.Contains a foreword by author Kirk Allmond.",
