Even Gangstas Cry  I got thrown into one hell of a shitstorm, putting a strain on my empathy and leaving those who are at my side in a path of mass destruction. My only aim is to find those who betrayed not only me, but my family. I will not rest or waver until they are brought down.  In the midst of my inner turmoil, an outsider tries to force their way in. Tension grows high when bullets start to fly and my boundaries are pushed.  Can the men I hold at my side to help me find the killer? Will we be able to hold the lines to our territory that seem to become weaker with each passing moment?  Only time will tell. I just hope we all make it through to the end.  ----------------------------------------  This book contains multiple triggers which include drugs, violence, and mature content.
