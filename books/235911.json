  "description": "USA Today Bestselling author Adriana Locke pens a banter-filled romance between a baseball player and a woman that hates athletes more than anything in the world. His baseball stats are perfect. When Danielle Ashley looks closer, she realizes so is everything else. A sinful smirk. Downright delicious body. And if the way Lincoln Landry pursues her, even when she tries to shut him down, means anything—so is his stamina. There’s no denying the chemistry between them. Their attraction is fierce. They’re both single, share amazing banter, and they both adore children. What’s the problem? It’s as tangled as their sheets.",
