But death has been shaped from rot.Like a phoenix caught fire, I will need to rise from the ashes and learn to wield my own power. Because my wings may have been clipped, but I am not in a cage, and I'm finally free to fly from the frozen kingdoms I've been kept in.Yet the world doesn't want to let me.That's the thing when you turn against a kingâ€”everyone else turns against you.Good thing I have a different king in my corner.But even with the dark threat of Slade Ravinger, the other monarchs are coming for me.So I will fight for him and he will kill for me, and if we need to become the villains, then so be it.Because so long as I live in this world, I won't be used again.Please note: This is an adult fantasy series with dark elements that may be triggering, including past emotional and physical trauma, violence, adult language, and explicit romance.
