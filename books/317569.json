  "title": "Jane of Chelsea: Lady Amaranth and the Ring of Shallot",
  "description": "Jane wouldn't dream of another journey to court let alone a strange world, especially after her long weary travel from Whitehall Palace. It's an unscheduled adventure, only clearing of the mist away, to a world beyond where Jane found herself in the center of division. And it's begun before Jane ever realizes that she and her cousin Edward were inexplicably marooned in a realm called Chelsea. Ever puzzled at what comes next, Jane only hopes to live a day at a time as a secret of her own emerges, which her cousin Edward refuses to accept. Walking on the bridges, running up the corridors, and swimming in the lake, Jane scarcely perceives homebound roads might be foggier than she would like them to be.",
