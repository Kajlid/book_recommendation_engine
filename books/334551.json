  "description": "Sterling It’s always been her, and I just never realized. Now that I’m looking at her that way, I can’t unsee it… and I don’t want to. Alyssa has been my best friend since kindergarten, and these intense new feelings could cost me our friendship. She’s the one I share everything with, good or bad. It makes sense to share my life with her. But I can’t risk losing the only woman I’ve ever loved, which will happen if she doesn’t feel the same. Alyssa is loyal and kind and takes my breath away. I just wish it hadn’t taken me so long to figure out what’s been right in front of me. Alyssa Falling for my best friend is easy, but keeping it to myself while figuring out what to do about it is the hard part. Because in a small town, everyone knows everyone… and their business. Sterling is the perfect guy—handsome, with a heart of gold and a protective streak. I know he’ll do anything for me… except maybe admit he feels the same way I do. So, I’m stuck in limbo and am in love with my best friend. Just when I work up the nerve to finally tell him how I feel, everything changes with a confession and two words: stay tonight.",
