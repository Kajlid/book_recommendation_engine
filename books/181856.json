  "description": "What do we need most of all? Money and sex? No. Air and water! But what if the atmosphere changes and oceans move? Shall we have to stop making love and money, and disappear like dinosaurs? Andrew Barkov, a Miami Police Lieutenant, struggles to find a way to save humanity using genetic engineering. Why him? He's a deviant! Born by a genetically modified mother, he's able to run fast, fight fiercely and love deeply, even in the changed atmosphere. But what's most important about him and his team of allies is that they have a survival gene--the ability to risk their life for others! Will that be enough to save humanity?FROM THE AUTHORWe are all mutants. Already. But we've got used to our present form. Our mutation stages are reflected in every woman's pregnancy: fish, reptile, rabbit, human. What's next? What will we look like in the future? And what if we need to speed up the process of mutations? These questions led me to the idea of writing Survival Gene. It's the work of fiction based on scientific facts as well as original hypotheses. The characters are common people who live, love and fight in the near future, namely 2060. That's the year when the world will end according to Sir Isaac Newton's prediction.In my opinion, the \"end\" will not mean death. It will mean global changes--first of all, changes of the human race. Should we fear it? Should we deny the changes and die? Or accept them and live on?",
