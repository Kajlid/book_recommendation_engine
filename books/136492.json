  "description": "\"Captures all the bliss and folly of Mary Shelley’s disastrous surrender to love, and the sorrowful steps by which she became the author of FRANKENSTEIN.\" — NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEWIn 1814, poet Percy Shelley enters the life of young Mary Godwin like an angel of deliverance. Seduced by his radical and romantic ideas, she flees with him to Europe, where they mingle with other free-spirited artists and poets. Frowned on by family and society, Mary becomes haunted by hideous visions — and as tragedy strikes, she realizes her dreams have become nightmares, and her angel . . . a monster. Has the time come for Mary Shelley to set her monster free?",
