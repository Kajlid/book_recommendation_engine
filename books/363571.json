  "title": "Weaving the Visions: New Patterns in Feminist Spirituality",
  "description": "In this sequel to Womanspirit Rising, Judith Plaskow and Carol Christ have selected key writings in feminist spirituality, focusing on constructive elements in the feminist approach to religion in North America and the great diversity of women’s experience. The writings presented here deal with a reconceptualization of the central religious categories of theology through a wide range of voices and traditions. Contributors are white, black, Chicana, Asian American, and Native American, and represent Jewish, Christian, Goddess, Native American, Yoruba, Voudou, and other perspectives. “Feminist too often have avoided and denied [our] differences,” write the editors, “but difference is the source of our creativity, the ‘raw and powerful’ connection from which our personal power is forged.”",
