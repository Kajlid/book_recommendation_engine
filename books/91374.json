  "description": "\"You threw your fifty-thousand-dollar engagement ring off the Brooklyn Bridge?\" Lilly shows up to her lavish divorce party with one goal in mind—to leave as quickly as possible minus a husband! Except he has other plans…and Riccardo De Campo isn't easy to say \"no\" to. Forced back into Riccardo's glittering, gossip-fueled world, the price of perfection is still too high and Lilly's old insecurities resurface. An unexpected consequence of their reunion raises the stakes even higher, and the media's golden couple must finally confront the truth behind the headlines. Congratulations to Jennifer Hayward, winner of Harlequin's 2012 So You Think You Can Write competition!",
