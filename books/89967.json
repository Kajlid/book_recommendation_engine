  "description": "Fairy Tales for the Mature. 'Why is it always the young and glamorous - the beautiful princesses and handsome princes - who dominate fairy tales? These fun, adult, fairy tales are written from the viewpoint of the older Red Riding Hood's grandma, a fairy godmother with a touch of Alzheimer's, the matron of Rapunzel's boarding school, a very stressed planning officer, the troll in the tower block and many more.'",
