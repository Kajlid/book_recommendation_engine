  "description": "Aylin had no idea how much her life would change when she entered the local bookstore one summer morning. The young woman she met completed the triad of powerful faeries that would stand against the force of witches seeking to acquire the ancient powers held inside The Rune. As if protecting The Rune isn't enough for these three faeries, they also have to deal with leading normal lives. Aylin struggles with herself when Terra's brother becomes a romantic interest, and when she encounters heartbreaking treachery from an unexpected source. Aylin, Eliana, and Terra begin an incredible journey discovering their unique gifts and forming an unbreakable bond to each other and to their destiny.",
