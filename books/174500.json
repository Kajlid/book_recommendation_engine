  "title": "Daniella Bound",
  "description": "Daniella Blanchard is enjoying a romantic interlude with the handsome Eric Lehane, when he makes the suggestion - an interlude on a summer's afternoon involving ropes, a blindfold and a waiting chair. Only when bound and helpless, subjected to an intense game of sexual tease and denial, does the student begin to suspect her lover's wicked ulterior motives in their relationship. But Daniella is no meek submissive and she has secrets of her own, which will take Eric by storm. One scorching twist follows another in what becomes a weekend-long struggle of body and mind for sexual supremacy. Who will come out on top in this explosively erotic contest - Eric, Daniella, or sheer all-consuming passion?",
