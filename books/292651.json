  "description": "What had happened to the ever so confident Dhani? Why wasn’t she sure of herself anymore? She wondered if she would be the same Dhani ever again. Dhani, a girl who thought her life was finally perfect, was now seeing it fall apart. But she was too proud to accept in front of the world about how defeated she felt. Dhruv had braved every hurdle that life had thrown at him; and when he finally felt complete with Dhani by his side, destiny showed him its ugliest face ever. Embark on a journey of love in its purest form. Love between a father and daughter, a brother and sister, a man and woman; and the love above any other… love for one's motherland, and the urge to protect it at any cost. Diya Aur Baati Hum tells us the story of a love so potent, it changes lives and destinies. A beautiful story of love, friendship, faith, acceptance, hope and courage.",
