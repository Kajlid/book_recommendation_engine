  "description": "Federal agent Rae Phillips is haunted by a voice she hasn't heard in two years â€” not since she recorded the deathbed confession of a dangerous man whose words had the power to topple a major drug cartel. That night she fell in love with a stranger whose face was shrouded in darkness. Now her fellow agents are dying. It seems that anyone connected with that long-ago case is being systematically murdered. Then Rae herself is drugged and abducted, held hostage by a captor as mysterious as he is seductive. And the dangerous game he's playing with her mind is only a prelude to the doubly dangerous game he's playing with her heart.",
