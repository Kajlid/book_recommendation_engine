In our world, it’s a means to an end. Even if she somehow catches me off guard, and makes me care more than I should, more than I thought I would, it shouldn’t matter. There is no place for love and devotion in the Mafia.So why would that change now?ArielleI was brought up to fulfill my duty. As a woman in the Mafia, as a daughter and now as a wife. But when my duty as a daughter interferes with my duty as a wife, there will be grave consequences. Christiano is a powerful man with a ruthless reputation. None survive his wrath, man or woman. The fire-breathing beast stirring beneath his skin is ever present, and the more I get to know him, the more I want to drown in his flames.",
