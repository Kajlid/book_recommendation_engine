  "description": "Harriet Truman returns to Foggy Point thinking she’s just going to see to her aunt Beth’s customers while the lady takes a European cruise. Instead, she discovers she now owns both business and house, whether she wanted to or not. Still, she’s stuck until Aunt Beth comes home, and she does enjoy being a part of creating beautiful quilts. But then Avanell Jalbert, her aunt’s best friend, is murdered on the same night someone breaks into Harriet’s studio and trashes the place. Something is coming unravelled in Foggy Point, and Harriet is caught in the tangle. The question is, can she figure out what’s going on before she ends up dead herself.",
