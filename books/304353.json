Nope.There, I find her secret family—because she had one of those too.How many lies are we at? Honestly, I’ve lost count, but local gossip captures my attention. Apparently, Mum’s other family play laser tag every Wednesday. Not even joking. Laser tag.What the hell is this place?In hindsight, the massive guy with honey irises was my first major clue. Unusual eyes for a human, right?Perfect eyes for a werewolf.But sexy supernaturals, thongs, and mounting financial strain aside, Mum’s past is buried somewhere in this valley, and I need to dig up the truth or find a way to live with her lies.What do you do when neither option will leave you unscathed?",
