  "description": "The third book in the transformational Beyond the Known series, The Kingdom is a stunning and powerful conclusion to the trilogy.Paul Selig's profound gift is to channel the unfiltered wisdom of The Guides--higher beings who exist beyond the borders of traditional human understanding--and share it with the world. The Kingdom is a transcription of Paul's channeled messages, direct from the Guides in their complete and unedited form.With beautiful language and profound wisdom, The Guides share an awe-inspiring glimpse into an understanding apart from and above our own. The first two books of the series urged readers to step beyond their own understanding and enter into the transformational work this knowledge demands. This process of growth and transformation finds its ultimate completion and fulfillment in The Kingdom as readers are invited to dwell in a world transformed by a new understanding.",
