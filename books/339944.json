  "title": "Big Chickens Go to Town",
  "description": "Why did the chickens cross the road? To get to town, of course! When those four lily-livered chickens are accidentally dumped off the farmer?s truck, they have no choice but to follow the feed trail through a day of crazy hijinks. What ensues is a raucous adventure through town, including foreign food, weird noises, and strange birds. Sidesplitting silliness abounds in this third riotously funny read-aloud by Leslie Helakoski, once again illustrated with Henry Cole?s boisterous art.",
