  "description": "Oscar night. Rock star legend, Ashland Keys should be on top of the world, but the blond blue-eyed SoCal surfer is disillusioned with fame, done with drugs, bored with the groupies and sick of all the fake f*ckery. A rising star, Fanny Bay is nominated for best original song in the same category as the Dirt Dogs band, but the novel redhead with the corkscrew curls and the slight Canadian accent would prefer to chart a course with a different destination. Hollywood is not for her. He’s full of regrets, darkness and secrets. She’s full of hope and light and has mysteries of her own. He’s her reserved hero. She’s his gypsy rose. He’s water. She’s fire. Together, they don’t make sense. But he’s what she’s always wanted, and she just might be everything he needs.",
