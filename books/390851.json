  "description": "Ben-Hur is the remarkable saga of betrayal, revenge, and redemption, played out in the bloodstained arenas of ancient Rome. Framed for attempting to murder a Roman official, Ben-Hur is robbed of his freedom, family, and fortune. Condemned to death as a galley slave, he lives only to avenge himself against the Roman tribune Messala—the boyhood friend who betrayed him.Ben-Hur vividly recreates the sweep of Imperial Rome—from a thrilling sea battle, to the famous chariot race, to the agony of the Crucifixion. It is the moving, personal tale of the prince who became a slave and then—through a unique twist of fate—was able to fight his way back to the free world as a champion gladiator.Written by the territorial governor of New Mexico, Ben-Hur was an immediate bestseller upon its release in 1880—selling over two million copies—and continues to be an enduring classic.",
