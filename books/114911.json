  "description": "In the tradition of It’s a Wonderful Life and Pirates of the Caribbean, S DeGiorgio casts the Pacific Ocean as a nautical canvas for a Christmas tale that teaches us you don’t have to be a bad man to be a great pirate.This is a short, four chapter book with minimal images (one at the start of each chapter). It uses many pirate terms and expressions that might feel unfamiliar to some people. Kids age 10 and up and avid young readers should be fine. Just in case, see pirate terms and expressions used in Yo Ho Ho and a Very Merry Christmas!Yo Ho Ho and a Very Merry Christmas! promises to become a holiday classic readers of all ages will enjoy for years to come.Captain Blackjack Rob's great shame is that he has never fired his guns on the king’s fleet, nor plundered the holds of a captured merchant ship, despite the exploits of his father and grandfather—two of the most notorious pirates ever to have sailed the seven seas.Left to rot in the king's jail, and nearly forgotten, Captain Rob and his crew seize an offer to deliver Yuletide cargo to the Town of Dryden by Christmas Eve, in exchange for their release. But in order to reach their destination in time, earn the king’s pardon, and ensure their freedom, they will have to chart a course straight through pirate-infested waters—a fool’s errand while sailing under the king’s colors.",
