  "description": "A dead bore! Miss Georgina Powers concluded after shutting the door in the face of her latest suitor, announcing to one and all that spinsterhood was preferable to a life with a dimwit twice her age. She longed for a love match, not the humdrum offers that came her way. But as the granddaughter of Lady Mercer, Georgina was expected to make a shrewd alliance of the first order. And now after refusing this most eligible suitor she was being shipped off to distant relations in the wilds of Ireland, where sheer boredom would force her to reflect on her folly. To the surprise of both Georgina and her disapproving grandmama, the Emerald Isle yielded the roguish Mr. Shannon, a handsome Irishman with a most scandalous past. Georgina was sure to set the ton on its ear with her choice of a groom, but for all the wrong reasons!",
