  "description": "He's the inventor of Past-Tense TV (featuring \"Got Smart,\" \"Father Knew Best,\" and \"It Was Left to Beaver\"); the tireless crusader for such charities as the Center for Research into the Heebie Jeebies, Children of Parents with Bad Teeth, and the State Hospital for Those Who Felt All Right About a Year Ago; founder of the George Carlin Book Club (top titles: \"How to Act Laid-Back During a Grease Fire,\" \"Fill Your Life with Croutons,\" and \"The Meaning of Corn\"); and the only social commentator with the guts to point out that \"the day after tomorrow is the third day of the rest of your life.\"Yes, George Carlin is back with more of what he does better than any other comic today: uproarious observations, laser-targeted crankiness, linguistic legerdemain, and inspired weirdness. (\"If the shoe fits, get another just like it.\" \"When you sneeze, all the numbers in your head go up by one.\") Napalm & Silly Putty is just what his fans have been waiting for-another generous helping of notions, nonsense, assertions, assumptions, mockery, merriment, silliness, sarcasm, and, to be sure, plenty of disturbing references and toxic alienation. George wouldn't have it any other way.",
