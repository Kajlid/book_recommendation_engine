  "description": "THE TESTAMENT OF CTHULHU features five stories of weird horror in the tradition of H.P. Lovecraft and Robert W. Chambers. In \"Sea-Green Gown With Gold Buttons,\" a tale of THE KING IN YELLOW, a beautiful drag queen is caught in a web of evil upon falling in love with a citizen of Carcosa. A grotesque deity exacts an unspeakably complete vengeance in \"The Foul One Lives To Destroy.\" In \"The Testament Of Cthulhu,\" an ailing traveler visits a community with a hideous secret ... a secret that might be the answer to his complex medical problems. \"The Ambassador From Ulthar\" tells of a young man who cannot escape his fate after injuring a denizen of the Dreamlands. While escaping from an abusive relationship, an aspiring writer encounters an unlikely ally in \"The Sea-Spider.\" Mark McLaughlin is the author of BEST LITTLE WITCH-HOUSE IN ARKHAM and MAGIC CANNOT DIE, and Michael Sheehan, Jr. has co-authored THE ABOMINATIONS OF NEPHREN-KA, THE HORROR IN THE WATER TOWER, THE BLASPHEMY IN THE CANOPIC JAR, SHOGGOTH APOCALYPSE, THE RELIC IN THE EGYPTIAN GALLERY, and THE CREATURE IN THE WAXWORKS with McLaughlin.",
