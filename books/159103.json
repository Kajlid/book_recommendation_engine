  "description": "After a long winter in their small town of Jackpine, best friends Margaret and Louise are looking forward to enjoying some R&R in Thunder Bay. Louise has insisted that their stay include taking part in a women’s “discover your inner goddess” retreat. Margaret plans to track down a famously reclusive wildlife artist to persuade him to do a workshop for her art club in Jackpine. Things get off to a rocky start when their hotel refuses to accommodate Louise’s canine companion Vince, and they are forced to stay at a dodgy establishment over a strip bar. Then Margaret clashes with the retreat leader. To complicate matters further, a dead body turns up next door to their retreat.The deceased turns out to be a local casino manager with a lot of enemies. When Margaret spots the dead man’s widow being squired around town by a male companion, her curiosity is piqued. The ever-intrepid friends, against all advice and their better judgment, become embroiled in looking for clues to the murder. It’s a search that takes them all over the city and surrounding countryside, where they encounter a whole cast of possible suspects, including a dangerously lovelorn church organist, a stripper-turned barmaid, a fiery septuagenarian, and a widow with very expensive tastes. But are they getting too close to the truth for their own good?",
