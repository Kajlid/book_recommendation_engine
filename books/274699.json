The dictator Konstantius uses terror to rule a crumbling state from the capital, Berlin. His minions plot his downfall and prepare to seize power. Aurora Peralta, military intelligence agent, spies on the government and on the Han. She is ambushed by rebels in Iraq, implicated in political murder in Berlin and survives a siege in Turkey. Posted to London, she embarks on a secret affair with Konstantius’ deputy, Julian Regio. When Konstantius dies, Julian becomes dictator, promising to restore democracy – once he has conquered the Han. Will he save Europa from tyranny or plunge it into ruin?
