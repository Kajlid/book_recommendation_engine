  "description": "The memory of a stolen kiss ten years ago stirs up an adventure eighty years in the making.Wynn Jeffries has wanderlust. Unfortunately, her life stalled somewhere between graduating college and slinging drinks at the local dive bar. Stuck in a one-room apartment with no career, no boyfriend, no…life, she dreams of something more. Something amazing. Something like Oliver Reeves, her high school crush, who's back in town and reminding Wynn of the way she used to want things.When a forgotten news-clipping about two prohibition moonshiners falls out of a book belonging to Wynn’s grandmother, a well-kept family secret is finally revealed. Is Wynn’s gypsy spirit the result of an overactive imagination or did she inherit it from a woman so determined to live a big life that she gave up everything to have it?The choices we make now shape our future. It’s the fear of making the wrong ones that give us doubt. So the question how much are we willing to sacrifice to have the life we want?",
