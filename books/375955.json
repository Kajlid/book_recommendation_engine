  "title": "Sanditon, Lady Susan, & The History of England",
  "description": "This rare collection is a must for all Jane-ites. It represents what Richard Church regarded as Jane Austen’s literary work-basket and contains some of Austen’s earliest work—her hilarious brief History of England, illustrated by her favorite sister, which is a worthy forerunner of 1066 & All That to the unfinished Sanditon, the novel of her maturity on which she was writing at her death at age forty-two. Also included are the two epistolary novels, Lady Susan and Love and Friendship, and The Watsons, Catharine, Lesley Castle, Evelyn, Frederic and Elfrida, Jack and Alice, Edgar and Emma, Henry and Eliza, and The Three Sisters.",
