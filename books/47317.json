Emma should be looking forward to escaping her mundane small town, and going on to college—finally.

But all her plans for a less-sucky future go out the window with the discovery of a seriously creepy woman in her backyard.As it turns out, zombies are real.In the first book of the Boring Life Series, Emma’s life is turned upside down as she’s forced to leave everything behind, running off with Finn and a group of extremely odd misfits that include Finn’s jackhole brother Cash, and his unorthodox girlfriend Marley.

As they do all then can to try and survive the impending apocalypse, Emma will realize that maybe her painfully boring life hadn’t been such a bad thing, after all.",
