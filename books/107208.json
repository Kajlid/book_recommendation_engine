  "title": "Shy",
  "description": "\"If I disappeared, would anyone notice?\"Sara rarely speaks. Her parents are uncomfortable around her. Notes are the only words she shares with the sister who is nothing like her. Bullied at school, people think she is weak and walked on — a bystander in her own life. And Sara knows they're right.Until the tribal sorcerer from her dreams sends a startling message: \"You belong to me.\"Sara's soul might not belong to this world for long, but before she's caught up in her true past, she meets Tarren and feels the electricity of a first love. Sara learns that sometimes dreams are real — and being shy about who she really is might mean being dead.",
