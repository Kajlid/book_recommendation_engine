  "description": "FEAR ABIDES...  Since its discovery, the island of Haven and its ore-rich mines have kept House Hallander from being overrun by the larger, wealthier houses of the Draconian mainland. But Haven is not the godsend it seemed.  The last ship to reach Hallander's harbor from Haven carries no ore but only a single passenger - a dying old man with a strange mark burned in his forehead. His final words: \"They sent me.\"  Immediately, a platoon of soldiers is dispatched to Haven with Lord Hallander’s only surviving son, Dane, to lead them. Their mission, be it one of rescue or vengeance, is to secure the island and keep the precious artery of ore flowing. Dane, branded a failure for a forbidden act of mercy, is given the impossible task as one last chance to regain his father’s love and his people’s respect.  Once on Haven, they discover the colony deserted, its pantry stocked, its buildings undamaged, and not a soul in sight.  At least not any soul they would want to meet.",
