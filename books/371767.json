  "title": "Vocations for Girls",
  "description": "Vocations for Girls, updated in 1951, is a great reflection on how things used to be, equality-wise, for girls/women who wanted to work for their living instead of marrying.It is an honest view of job prospects during that era, emphasizing nursing, clerical work, shop keeping, and discouraging physician, dentist, engineering and scientists. For these vocations, an honest assessment of the possibilities of making a long term career are listed as difficult to impossible.Housekeeping, as in married with children; and home workers, as in servant, are very much emphasized.For its time, this book is fairly enlightened, inasmuch as it does indicate potential for that rare \"girl\" who can get a Ph.D. in a difficult field and has the guts and physical stamina to compete.Of real interest is the inclusion of military service as a good career path for a girl; at that time, not many \"girls\" considered that path. Also emphasized was what a good thing a job in the government could be. Finally, the book does speak of hope for the future, and for the truly determined women minorities who would plow the way for the women of today, who take such job opportunities largely for granted.",
