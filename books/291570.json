  "description": "There’s a house in Cambria with no phone, no internet, no connection to the outside world. Dante and Mandy are stuck there together. He needs a live-in assistant. She needs a place to hide. If she gives him total obedience, he’ll do everything in his power to clean up the mess she made back home. Anything less than unquestioning compliance, and she goes back to LA humiliated. Those are the rules. Take them or leave them. Mandy figures she can do Dante’s menial tasks for awhile. Do what he says until the heat dies down. She has no idea how hot it’s going to get until he tells her she has to do them on her knees. ---- This is a STANDALONE.",
