  "title": "Rebel Moms: The Off-Road Map for the Off-Road Mom",
  "description": "Modern motherhood has changed; it isn't just frilly aprons, mini-vans, and soccer practice anymore. You are a modern mom-a rebel mom-ready to raise your kids while running a successful business, starting a band, or finding your voice, while doing the things you love and fighting for what's right. Even so, the path to epic mom rebellion is not always easy. Meet the women who have seen, conquered, and survived-making a difference, doing things their own way and on their own terms. They are activists, teachers, veterans, firefighters, pin-ups, fast food workers, tattoo artists, and more. A rebel mom has no set definition beyond her tendency to elude definition. These women, from varying places and backgrounds, have seen it divorce, abuse, depression, and disability. They have succeeded and raised children with tough grins on their faces. Are you a new or expecting mother? Are you a mother who's fed up with the super-mom/super-woman myth? Or are you a pro who's been there and done that, but would still love to learn from other rebel moms? It's never too late to learn a new trick, and motherhood is never the same for anyone. Cultures change, as do child-rearing practices, but certain aspects of being a mom are universal and timeless-love, support, and strength. The rebel moms have mastered the art of motherhood, and you can embrace the revolution.",
