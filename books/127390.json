  "description": "A young woman is found, brutally raped and set on fire. The police investigation eventually leads to the arrest of two defendants. They are charged with the kidnapping, sexual assault, and attempted murder of the young woman. Attorney Richards represents one of the two defendants. While the client maintains his innocence, he remains uncooperative. The case takes a bizarre twist when the client’s family is threatened, a potential witness is murdered and the co-defendant’s attorney begins to act strangely. When Attorney Richards confronts the other attorney, she refuses to discuss the case and raises the claim of confidential communications. The district attorney refuses to see any connection between the Richards’ client and the new murder and proceeds with the prosecution and secures a conviction. Things get hairy when Attorney Richards seeks a new trial.",
