  "title": "MAXWELL 1: Not Without Guilt",
  "description": "MAXWELL, Part 1  While Abel faces trial for the death of Devlin’s brother – Craig Grant – Max and Horatio struggle with memories of the past, and what they still mean to one another. Holding the key that will free their hearts from the chains that have bound them for two decades, Horatio must hide it away and keep it secret now that “new” hearts are involved.  But as Seth and Carl watch the two men fighting to let go of the past – and crumbling beneath their age old love for each other – they begin to understand that you don’t get to choose who you love, but that your heart chooses for you. And that “great love” never dies…and cannot be replaced.  Warning: This book contains homosexual relations and language not suitable for readers below 17yo.  NOTE: For those coming across the 'Phoenix Club' series sporadically, they were written in this order, and if possible, should be read accordingly, due to story lines that run through all the books :  ABEL CALEB ANGEL GABRIEL MAXWELL",
