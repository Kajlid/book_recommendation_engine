  "description": "We all lived through Max & Jane’s relationship unfolding right before our eyes – literally! After a most romantic proposal with Tuscany and an Andrea Bocelli concert as their backdrop, the story ended with the two of them riding off into a Ducati sunset. As ideal as this sounds, a wedding is not an easy task and with Jane and Max, nothing is smooth sailing. They will get married, come hell or high water…right?!?",
