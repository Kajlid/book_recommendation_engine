  "description": "WHERE NO ONE HAS GONE BEFORE Astrophysicist Bram Starbuck was determined to prove his fellow scientists wrong. They dismissed his theories on space travel, but they wouldn't after he returned from Earth. Only something went wrong, and he ended up in the wrong place, wrong century -- but with the RIGHT woman. When Maine Police Chief Charity Prescott found the nearly naked, unconscious man during a blizzard, she nursed him back to health. Then she realized the sexy stranger was the man she'd been fantasizing about. It was as if her thoughts had reached out and pulled him out of the sky. It was as if their love had been destined by the stars. But very human forces threatened to tear them apart... and destroy Starbuck.",
