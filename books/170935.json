  "description": "GiGi (well, Griselda Griswald actually, but everybody calls her GiGi) is a woman with a mission: to help people improve the way they look, increase their self-esteem, and eventually, make them happier people. Being a personal shopper is a dark art, with few tangible rewards. Spread by word of mouth, her clients would never admit they needed her assistance. Not even if they put them under torture. Let us be honest, who would admit to being in need of a style consultant?With the constant struggle to keep her business afloat, a powerful enemy is lining up ready to make a meal out of her, knowing very well that GiGi’s approach, eventually, will make her successful. Whilst she invents new ways to make her consultancy firm successful, she finds who could be the love of her life, thanks to some of her best friends.Here is a taster:--“Those clothes could have been very good for our Beloved Queen who is in her eighties, but come off it; she was barely in her thirties! One in particular horrified me, a blue and yellow sequin dress with pink, humungous flowers all over the place. I poked at it with a stick from a distance to ensure it was not alive and ready to kill me. You know, sometimes they haunt you. Could these really be her clothes or were they keepsakes from an old, deceased aunt?”-- (less)",
