  "description": "Fiona Marshall usually loves her job as a nurse at Lambert Memorial Hospital, but lately her mind has been elsewhere. Her sister lies in a coma on the other side of town—close to death—even if their parents won’t admit it. Plus there are rumors that the hospital has brought in spies—fake patients judging their every move. She'd never let her personal life interfere with her job, but when patients suffer mysterious complications, the investigation turns to Fiona, her boss accusing her of harming those under her care. Just as she's about to do something drastic, someone she never expected to see again lands in one of her hospital beds and stirs up a little hope, as well as stirring up something else inside her. Jasper Raleigh is a man on a mission...even if this one is stranger than most. On assignment to protect a Saudi Prince at Lambert Memorial, things take a turn for the worse. Before he can even start he ends up experiencing things from the other side: as a patient. Lying injured in a hospital bed, he meets his nurse, a woman from his past that he’s never forgotten—Fiona. As she tends to his wounds, they uncover something odd going on at the hospital. Something's not right, and it looks like one of the top attending physicians is involved. But what’s even more crazy is the lust growing between him and Fiona all over again. Sparks fly even as they're stuck in the middle of a medical terrorist attack, but bullets fly faster. Can Jasper uncover the truth and help Fiona save her job, and her life, or will a hidden enemy take them out to keep his secret?",
