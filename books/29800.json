  "description": "World-famous (and now retired) photographer Jenvieve Adams has a debt to repay-and a soft spot for modern witches who have lost their way. Or so she thinks, until they actually show up. Jennie is the newest guide for WitchLight, and her first two students are about to arrive. One is an obsessive psychologist with hidden layers under her repressed exterior. The other is a grown-up juvenile delinquent with a passion for words and a kick-ass biscuit recipe. Can Jennie help unlock their hearts?",
