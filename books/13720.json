  "description": "William Lowell Kane and Abel Rosnovski -- two men from widely different backgrounds, whose driving passions are overshadowed only by their obsession to destroy each other. One, a millionaire Boston brahmin, the other, a penniless Polish immigrant--two men born on the same day in 1906, on opposite sides of the world, reaching the top in 20th-century America. Spanning 60 years, KANE & ABEL is the enormously compelling story of these two ruthless, powerful businessmen who's ultimate confrontation rocks the financial community--and their personal lives.--inside description",
