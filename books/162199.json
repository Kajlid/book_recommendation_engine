  "description": "When Ashley relocates from Las Vegas to Destiny, a quiet little suburb of Atlanta, it isn't as dull as she first thinks. The lone surviving female of an ancient line of humans, she soon realizes she is anything but ordinary. She finds herself chosen to lead the human race into battle against demons and the Dark One. A group of angels have sworn to protect her and find the task increasingly difficult as the time of war draws near. While Ashley explores her true destiny as an Intercessor, she is captivated by hot but inscrutable Justin. In the end only one of their desires can prevail and the Earthly gates to Heaven and Hell are at risk. Ashley is entangled in the endless struggle of good versus evil, where the balance between the two is more closely linked than we could've ever imagined.",
