  "description": "Steele:I'm a second-year hockey player for the Seattle Sockeyes. Imagine my shock when I return from a trip to find my former roommate has transferred his lease to my nemesis. She's so annoying I can't stand to be in the same room with her. She pushes all my buttons and is my exact opposite. Despite it all, I want to rip off her clothes and make mad passionate love to her. What is wrong with me? Hyacinth:I'm the free-spirited daughter of a radical activist. I've marched in my share of protests, and saving the world is my life's mission, but lately I'm wondering where my life is headed. When I'm offered the chance to share the lease on a fancy condo only two blocks from my bartending job, I jump on it. Like with most things, this one is too good to be true. My roommate is a finicky, annoying AF hot hockey player I've butted heads with in the past who thinks my causes are ridiculous. He pushes all my buttons, and I never expected to fall for him, but I did.",
