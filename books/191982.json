  "description": "OPPOSITES ATTRACT by Tirza Schaefer Jada, a very intellectually orientated lecturer for modern philosophy from Virginia, visits her school friend Andy, now a successful Atlanta lawyer and his wife Kathy who owns an art gallery. A surprise visitor arrives, Kyle, Kathy's best friend's brother who has just returned stateside from deployment. The sexy, masculine Marine SpecOps officer and the pacifist philosophy lecturer don't get on at all at first, but at the same time, Jada cannot deny the attraction she feels for the charismatic warrior. When she meets him in a bar back home in Virginia where both find themselves in the company of their respective friends, a crisis occurs and instinctively, Jada turns to Kyle for help. After Kyle and his Marine team save the day, she gains a different perspective on military men and spiritual shamans and when she finds herself sharing a bed with him, she wishes he wasn't such a gentleman after all. Kyle needs Jada's help in turn and when she agrees to help, a web of conspiracy and lies leaves her in despair and just as she thought, she has finally got Kyle, he leaves for good. In her despair, she turns to her friends in Atlanta and is confronted with Kyle and his team of Marines once again. Will Jada get over her heartache and is there another chance at happiness for her and Kyle after all? Over 66,500 words.",
