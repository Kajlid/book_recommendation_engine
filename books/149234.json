She didn't expect to end up in a long-distance relationship with a computer-savvy Southern boy. Yet Vincent seems determined to defy the odds. To prove his intentions, he sets off on his own quest to visit Angeli and win her family's approval. But along the way heâ€™ll have to contend with her offbeat friends, trigger-happy father, and a few questionable run-ins with Northern hospitality. South meets North this time around, and \"normal\" isn't anywhere on the map.With a thousand miles and radically different upbringings between them, can Angeli and Vincent forge a forever-worthy bond? Or are the roadblocks they face too much for either of them to overcome?",
