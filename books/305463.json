  "title": "Be a Dick: How One Person Can Change the World in the Most Unexpected Way",
  "description": "My name is Marc. And I am a Dick. I'm a Dick to all of my friends. And to my family. I'm a Dick to people I know. And to people I don't know. In fact, if we were to bump into each other someday, whether it be online or in real life, I would probably be a Dick to you, too. It's nothing personal. It's just who I am. And who I believe we all should be. Be a How One Person Can Change the World in the Most Unexpected Way is the true story of one's journey to live a life that matters and the surprising path it takes along the way. If you don't already consider yourself a Dick, you'll definitely want to be one by the time you finish reading this book!",
