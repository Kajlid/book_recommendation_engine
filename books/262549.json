  "description": "“I want you for who you are, not in spite of it.”  - Gabriella Conti  For ten years, Gabby had wanted only one person—Marco Bianchi. But he was off-limits. Right-hand man to her brother, Nico, she knew he would never think of her as more than his boss’s little sister.  But when tragedy strikes, things change.  Leaving Gabby to wonder if maybe her feelings weren’t as one-sided as she’d thought.   \"I threaten, torture, maim, and kill. My honor is the only good piece of me I have left.”  - Marco Bianchi  Growing up with nothing, honor and loyalty meant everything to Marco. Which was why Gabriella Conti was off-limits, even if she was his obsession. Because, as badly as he wanted Gabriella, he knew her brother would never approve.  And he owed Nico everything.  But with the Russians in town, things were about to change.  Marco needed to protect  his girl.   Author's note: This is a full-length, steamy, contemporary romance novel without a cliffhanger. It is part of a series, but is a stand-alone centering on new main characters. Due to sex, language, and violence it is recommended for persons over 18.*** HEA ***",
