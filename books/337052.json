  "description": "“Why would I choose, when anyone can see the two of you come as part of a package?”\nThat’s what she said. Those were the words that changed my life.Until then Jules and I were friends. Best friends only. Best friends since before we could remember. We had to be. We were the last two wolves born into an aging pack. Our pack was secretive and a little backward, but we had a great life. Sure, our alpha was a bit of a douche, but all alphas are douches. Everyone knows that. Thank God, Jules and I were both going to be betas.The night new-girl Storm refused to choose between Jules and I, changed everything. The way I looked at him changed forever. He went from my goofball best friend, to being the hottest creature I’d ever seen. At the time I thought it was the end of the world.It wasn’t the end of the world...It was just the beginning.Then our first shift happened, and confusion hit harder.Why was one of us acting distinctly douche-y? And why was the other running a fever and pleading for things only an omega would want?The First and The Last is a paranormal omegaverse MM romance. It features a bi-awakening that happens during a shared experience with a woman. It contains a dash of knotting, a pinch of gratuitous violence, and a heat that’s hot enough to put your eReader at risk of melting. This story does not contain MPREG.",
