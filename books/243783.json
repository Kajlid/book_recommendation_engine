  "description": "Being a fairy princess isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, especially when you have to choose between saving your people… And killing your girlfriend. Oh, and let’s not forget having to pass summer school, too.Talk about a hot mess.First, there’s Rouen, princess of the dark Fae, goth-rock star Euphoria, and soon-to-be senior at Richmond Elite High. Her world is all things ice, snow, and death. And that death will include her own people unless she can defeat her evil father in a Battle of Wits and War and seize the throne. Trouble is, taking the throne is a death sentence for the princess of the fair Fae. In other words, a quick death for Syl, Rouen’s girlfriend.And that’s so not good.Second, there’s Syl, princess of the fair Fae, geek girl mathlete, also an incoming senior. Things aren’t any easier for her. Syl must save her people by battling her old nemesis, the fair Fae prince, and the same rules apply: taking the throne means a death sentence for the other court’s princess, Rouen.Even worse, Syl and Rouen’s enemies have figured out they’re in love. Now, both Rouen’s father and Syl’s archenemy are teaming up to ensure neither of them makes it till Midsummer’s Day—never mind the fall semester. Looks like passing summer school is the least of their worries!",
