  "title": "The Dead Won't Sleep",
  "description": "The body of a young teenage hooker is found washed up on the beach near Glasgow. This stark event barely captures a headline in the cynical world of tabloid newspapers. This is Glasgow in the 1990s and she's just another dead heroin addict. But Tracey Eadie was only fourteen years old and came from a children's home in Glasgow. How did she get from there to where she is now? One of Tracey's friends on the street contacts Rosie Gilmour, a tabloid journalist. She gives Rosie a tip off that's dynamite, too hot to print but impossible to ignore. Rosie has covered many dark stories in her career. Her background has plenty in common with Tracey's and her own life could have gone either way. Her investigation exposes a sordid tale of corruption and child abuse that leads from the murky streets of Glasgow to the very top of the establishment. For Rosie, it is the only story worth telling, but she soon discovers that the forces united against her will stop at nothing to make sure nobody ever gets to the truth.",
