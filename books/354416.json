  "title": "Bought: Destitute Yet Defiant",
  "description": "He's scarred, sexy and unashamedly Sicilian... Silvio Brianza dragged himself out of the slums, but his scars run deep.... She's defiant, desirable and utterly disobedient! Jessie still scrapes her living, scrubbing floors by day and singing in seedy bars by night.... Silvio had turned his back on that world, but now that he's found Jessie he's going to make her his! Jessie may be powerless to resist Silvio's raw sexuality but no amount of dresses and diamonds can change their history. He's her enemy, he's shunned his past -- he'll never love the street girl she is.",
