  "title": "Die Laughing: War Humour From WW1 To Present Day",
  "description": "This nostalgic book takes a wry look at wartime humour from the First World War to the current troubles in Iraq. Through war and adversity, laughter has lifted the spirits of those facing traumatic situations. Ordinary people have donated many of the images, drawings, poems and 'pithy' sayings. Genuine stories of the hilarity of people who were about to die will touch readers' hearts. Chapters cover the armed forces, the role of woman, the home front and blackouts, conscientious objectors, war's legacy, remembrance and the future.The public have been magnanimous answering with gusto requests for 'stories' from all walks of life, social classes, and professions, and from all corners of the UK, including Northern Ireland, The Channel Islands, The Isle of Wright, and even Eire (Southern Ireland). A number of images and poems date as far back as 1914, graphics from scrapbooks kept as family heirlooms were all generously donated. Poems of servicemen and women from 1914 onwards are featured. All historical information has been corroborated by meticulous research methods.",
