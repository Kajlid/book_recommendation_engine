  "description": "For 72 years Louise Devereaux has carried the grim story of an unfortunate woman who was erroneously hanged for a murder she didn't commit. Who was the real murderer? Will Allen Kingsley be able to find witnesses to verify Louise's story? Will he be able to piece together enough evidence to bring justice for the long overdue crime? Why do the people of Madrid (pronounced Mad-rid) treat him with such disdain? Why do they look at his wife with such compassion?",
