  "description": "You already know about Noah. Just wait until you read the animal's story.Thimblerig is a little groundhog with big problems. He’s a loner con-artist who’s losing his mojo; the wild dogs who run the forest harass him at every turn; he’s having vivid nightmares of apocalyptic floods; and worst of all, he believes he sees unicorns when everyone knows unicorns are only the stuff of legend. But what one animal might call a problem, Thimblerig calls an opportunity. In a moment of inspiration, he comes up with the ultimate con: persuade as many suckers as he can that a world-ending flood is coming; the fabled unicorns have told him where the only safe place will be; and only he can lead them to safety. All for a reasonable price, of course. When the flood really does come, Thimblerig has a choice: either save the ones who trusted him, or lose everything. And that’s when he discovers that his problems have only just begun.",
