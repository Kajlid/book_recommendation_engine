  "description": "One night, alone, in the midst of a bottle of Jack and a pity party over the loss of his girlfriend, Neville Barker witnesses an alien ship crash. He finds a body, clearly not human, and takes it until he can figure out how to cash in on it.But when the alien wakes up, Neville finds it to be friendly. He sets out help Bob (the alien) get home. But things get out of hand quickly - a panicked motel keeper goes after them with a shotgun, they interrupt an armed robbery only to leave the gas station in flames behind them, and a dangerous police chase leaves their car buried in the Pacific. Neville must recruit his girlfriend’s help if he’s going to get Bob home. On the way, he hopes to win back her heart. But they’re not alone. Homeland Security is on the case, as is an astrophysicist from S.E.T.I. They have their own reasons for finding Bob, not the least of which is the rash of abductions that have taken place while Bob’s “people” search for him. NEVILLE & BOB is G-rated, family fun, feature screenplay.",
