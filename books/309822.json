  "description": "Memories all stripped away, a nameless woman is sold at auction. Her buyer might be an angel, but he's no holy symbol--and he's clearly got bad intentions.When the angels are evil and the demons won't help, what then?Then you run like hell, you hide and do whatever it takes to stay alive. Even pick a fight with an alien twice your size.*~*~*Dae, Ilsuk, and Xuakai have been living together for a long time, finding love and companionship among one another and their young daughter, Minsie.The sudden appearance of a fugitive in their storage bay isn't what they anticipated on this particular market run, and she may have been the first to draw blood...but Ilsuk has smelled this type of fear before and knows what sorts of things cause it.The men will do whatever it takes to keep their daughter safe, but when little Minsie decides to make friends with the beast below deck, they have to reevaluate how they see the feral woman.She may turn out to be exactly what they all needed.*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*18+ reader discretion is advised; themes of self-harm, suicide, assault, and rape.",
