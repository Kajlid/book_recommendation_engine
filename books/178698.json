  "description": "If you could change your life by flipping one switch your mind, what would you change? Would you be slimmer and healthier? Would you develop a better relationship with your family, would you earn more money? It’s time to start turning those dreams into reality… The Secret That Changed My Life – And Will Change Yours Too I’ve always been a dreamer. Sadly, those dreams were often out of reach. I’d achieve success in one part of my life – maybe getting good grades, or a promotion – only to see negative side-effects, such as weight gain and stress. And that was when things worked out; more often than not, I simply failed to achieve my goals. Thankfully, all that changed a few years back, when I stumbled across the Identity Switch method. Effortless Alteration “No pain, no gain” – it’s a mantra that’s drilled into many of us. But what if it weren’t true? What if achievement weren’t a function of blood, sweat and tears – but mere psychology? In the last few years, a lot of research has been conducted into the power of systems and habits, most recently with the work of BJ Fogg and Charles Duhigg. Good habits alone can improve a person’s life. But good habits coupled with key psychological strategies can make a person invincible. This book discusses the art of making achievement feel effortless, via lethal psychological strategies and habit formation hacks – all rolled into one powerful process, aka the Identity Switch Method.",
