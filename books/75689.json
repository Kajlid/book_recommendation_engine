  "description": "Kids will love this lighthearted and fun tale about keeping clean, featuring an adorable character that bath-resistant little ones will really relate to. It’s never bath time for Big Smelly Bear: he doesn’t brush, he doesn’t wash, and he’s simply unBEARable. No one can stand to come close! Then, one day, he wakes up with a most awful, unreachable itch. He could really use a little scratch from a friend, but Big Fluffy Bear won’t help because Big Smelly Bear stinks! Will he change his ways and bathe? The witty ending is sure to satisfy!",
