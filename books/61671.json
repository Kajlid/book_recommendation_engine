  "description": "The first book in the award-winning Summer King Chronicles.  As the last of his kind in a gryfon pride ruled by the conquering Red Kings, Shard has always known his destiny is merely to survive. He must strive to keep up with larger, stronger, crueler gryfons in order to earn his place as a warrior, or face exile. While on the dangerous initiation hunt that will either make or ruin him, Shard desperately takes the unexpected advice of a strange she-wolf who seeks him out, and hints that Shardâ€™s past is not all that it seems.  Drawn to learn more, Shard risks the future he wants by making allies of creatures most gryfons call enemies, and learning ancient skills forbidden by the conquering kings. Secrets of his family, the Conquering, and perhaps even his own destiny begin to reveal themselves.  When the gryfon king declares open war on the wolves Shard has befriended, it throws his past and uncertain future into the turmoil between. Now with battle lines drawn, Shard must decide whether to fight beside his own king . . . or against him.",
