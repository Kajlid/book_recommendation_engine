  "description": "alternate cover edition for ASIN B00JI60KX4The government is on the scene. MIBs have been dispatched. Freak Force Five is on its way in a supersonic jet. Why? There is an agent in the air from a capsule returning from space. It is an extraterrestrial agent that gets into menâ€™s liquid. That's right. When a man ejaculates he creates a monster. Today, in Beaver Lick, Arizona, when a man finishes, he falls into a deep sleep and the liquid stain turns into an living, moving silicone-made sentient Alien Dildo that preys on young women so they can asexually reproduce. Triangulum Stain is a story about how a team of scientists created long before this agent lands in Arizona to stop just such an outbreak, a few civilians who found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time, and some super-trained female Women in Black, each with a peculiar and amazing skill, try to stop this erotic alien takeover of Earth. Will they survive or will they all be sexed to death? Finding out is a fun thrill-ride. The story is Michael Crichton meets Mika Tan. It is the new one from Moctezuma Johnson.",
