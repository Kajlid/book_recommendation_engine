  "title": "God Is Stranger: Finding God in Unexpected Places",
  "description": "Who is God? Many of us call God our Father, Lord, Friend, and Savior. But when we delve into the perplexing bits of Scripture, we discover a God who cannot be pinned down, explained, or predicted. Is it possible that we have missed the Bible's consistent teaching that God is other, higher, stranger ? Krish Kandiah offers us a fresh look at some of the difficult, awkward, and even troubling Bible passages, helping us discover that when God shows up unannounced, uninvited, and unrecognized, that's precisely when big things happen. God Is Stranger challenges us to replace our sanitized concept of God with a more awe-inspiring, magnificent and majestic, true-to-the-Bible God. Allow yourself to be surprised by God as you find him in unexpected places doing the unexpected.",
