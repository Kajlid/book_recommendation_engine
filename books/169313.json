  "description": "“A symbol of wealth, power and prosperity, the crown was never meant to be found.” Carried away in the torrents of curiosity, Dr Ryan Johnson is accompanied by his happy-go-lucky friend, Christian Willis, to the golden city of Jaisalmer, India, in search of a crown lost centuries ago. They never expected a simple archaeological excavation to turn into a game of life and death. Problems arise when Ryan picks up a street fight and finds himself in a messy situation with a feisty, Deiva Chauhan. In a foreign land rich in traditional acts, his bachelorhood is at stake when he is simply ordered to act as Deiva’s fiancé. An easy ordeal if only the two could get along. Ryan discovers that his expedition was never an easy one especially if the only clue available was an old tale which to his disbelief said that magic was involved in hiding the crown. In a romantic adventure where Ryan’s beliefs are questioned and courage is tested, will he be able to stand up to the challenges of his quest?",
