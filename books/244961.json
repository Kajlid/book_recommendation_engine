  "title": "Clockworks: A Multimedia Bibliography of Works Useful for the Study of the Human/Machine Interface in SF",
  "description": "This volume provides an annotated list of works related to the interaction of humans and machines in SF, a field which includes science fiction, some fantasy and horror, and related types of speculative works. Though the book focuses on works produced in English between 1895 and 1990, foreign language material and works produced before 1895 and after 1990 are included as well. The reference contains works in a range of media, with entries grouped in chapters on literature, literary criticism, drama and dramatic criticism, graphic and plastic arts, music, and background. Each entry includes an annotation that overviews the significance of the human/machine interface in the work cited. The usefulness of the work is increased by the thorough author, title, and keyword and theme indexes.",
