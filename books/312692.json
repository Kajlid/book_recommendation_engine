  "description": "\"Letters mingle souls,\" said the poet John Donne, & no better proof of this statement could be found than this collection of the letters of Kahlil Gibran. For in his letters the author of The Prophet,The Broken Wings, The Voice of the Master & other 20th-century classics bared his soul completely, & their strange magic inspired in his correspondents a like self-revelation. The letters in this book span 1904 to 1930, & truly constitute a self-portrait of the poet in the time of his greatest productivity.",
