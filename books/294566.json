  "description": "I fell in love with Penny as soon as she fell into my arms. I wasn’t a believer in fate, but she convinced me. And every day she convinced me just how special our relationship was. It was us against the world. And I foolishly thought our love was indestructible.  Now I know that love isn’t about light and darkness or whirlwinds of color. Love can’t be defined in such simple terms. When you lose it, all of that becomes clear.  I don’t know how much longer I can breathe in a world where I look into my wife’s eyes and only see a stranger. I’d do anything to get her back. But this is one thing I don’t know how to fix.  This is the end to our love story. I just hope to God it’s not the end of us.",
