  "description": "Long-suffering assistant Evie Summers will lose her job unless she can convince her film agency's biggest and most difficult client, Ezra Chester, to finish the script for a Hollywood romcom. The catch? He hasn't started writing it.Suffering from 'writer's block,' he will only put pen to paper if singleton Evie can prove to him that you can fall in love like they do in the movies. Forget internet dating, Evie can only meet a man the way that Sally met Harry, or Hugh Grant meets anyone. Cue her entering into one ridiculous romcom scenario after another. But can life ever be like the movies?Because if this was a romcom, surely the assistant would fall in love with the arrogant yet ridiculously good-looking screenwriter and not, for example, the sensible single dad she meets along the way.Of course, real life is never that straightforward . . .For readers who enjoyed Hot Mess, Everything I Know About Love and To All The Boys I've Loved Before",
