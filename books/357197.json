  "description": "Nothing to fear...or is there? Imperial patrolship captain Chasidah Bergren has more trouble than she needs. Stripped of command in a sham court-martial and sent to the harsh prison world of Moabar, her life can't possibly get any worse. Until she's rescued by smuggler Gabriel Ross Sullivan, her former nemesis and almost lover. A dead man with a mission. He offers her freedom in exchange for her help in stopping an illegal genetics experiment that's already claimed far too many lives. And could place the Empire on the brink of civil war. But Chaz doesn't know that Sully's a ghost with a deadly, dark secret. A secret she was trained to hate and fear; one she may have to risk her life and her heart to protect.Affaire de Coeur Award Winner for Best Futuristic! 2003 Prism Award Finalist! 2002 Pearl Award Honorable Mention Winner! 2002 Sime~Gen Reviewer's Choice Winner for Best Romance 2002 Royal Palm Award Winner for Best Science Fiction/Paranormal 2002 Sapphire Award Finalist",
