  "title": "Tabloid Love: Looking for Mr. Right in All the Wrong Places, A Memoir",
  "description": "Dubbed one of the summer’s hottest beach reads by People, Glamour, Cosmo, and the Weekend “Today” show, Tabloid Love introduces Bridget Harrison, an almost thirty-year-old Brit and rookie reporter for the New York Post. While her London friends begin to marry, Bridget chases her dream of becoming a hard-news journalist. But just as she perfects the art of interviewing strangers about ghoulish crimes, she discovers that finding a mate seems impossible in the ultimate singles city. Then Bridget lands her very own Post dating column, and half a million New Yorkers read about her weekly romantic disasters. Whether covering celebrity parties in the Hamptons or struggling to hide her inter-office crush, Bridget retains such humor and humility “you’ll not only root for her, you’ll wish she were your best friend.” (Harper’s Bazaar)",
