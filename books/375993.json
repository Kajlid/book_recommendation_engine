  "description": "A gay-ish submissive and a very gay dominant. Gay Pride rallies have never been so much fun. When Langford sees Tayton lurking in the rain opposite a gay pride rally, he couldn’t be more thrilled that the cute guy from the sandwich shop is finally prepared to come out of the closet. Tayton isn’t so sure he’s all that ready to come out. Technically, he’s not even sure he’s entirely gay—even if he has had a crush on Langford for months. Can a man who’s not even sure he’s gay really find happiness with a man who’s never been in the closet?",
