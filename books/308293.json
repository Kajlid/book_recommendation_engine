  "description": "Lara is depressed, lonely and homesick—on top of broken hearted after the boy she thought she loved in Austria turned out to be a traitor. While the family settles into a new life in Switzerland, thanks to the always-positive disposition of their new mother, Marlene, Lara retreats further into her sadness, longing for the freedom to live life on her own terms.There's just one problem: she's hiding a secret that threatens to destroy not only herself but the family she loves. When Lara tires of living a lie, she makes a choice that comes with grave repercussions. As her world crumbles, the family is put at risk once again.All That Shines and Whispers explores themes of betrayal, sacrifice, consequence and redemption set against the backdrop of Nazi-era Europe. It is, in many ways, a coming-of-age story, tracing the mistakes young women make stumbling towards adulthood—in pursuit of love and trust and security—and all the identities they try on in order to know themselves.",
