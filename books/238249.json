  "description": "Avery Rendon is weeks away from realizing her dream as a Commonwealth fighter pilot when planetary politics intervene. Reluctantly, she returns to her home planet of Asria, still hoping to break free of her controlling family and their faith. Not much has changed on Asria though, and after her almost-fiancé walks out on her, she’s not sure life can get much worse.She’s wrong. When the Haederan Empire invades Asria, intent on rebuilding their interstellar domain, Avery becomes a target. She also becomes something else—a Commonwealth intelligence officer. It’s not long before she stumbles upon information that could change the course of the war, and suddenly she’s on the run, forced to confront her fear of death and her lingering doubts about her faith’s teachings.Swept up in something more dangerous than politics or flying, Avery begins to wonder if her destiny lies somewhere closer to home. If those old beliefs are worth clinging to. And if she’ll live to see the end of it all.",
