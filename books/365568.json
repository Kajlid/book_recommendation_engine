Tales of knights in search of princesses, forest creatures frequenting caverns, and wish-granting fairies are told in the spirit of tradition and imagination in this anthology. The enchanted world of fairytales that generations of Americans have come to know and love has come to include Swedish favorites: The Seven Wishes, The Giant Who Slept for Ten Thousand Years, The Changelings, and many more. Spellbinding art by Sweden 's greatest fairytale illustrator, John Bauer, brings these folktales to life.",
