  "description": "Isabel’s first encounter with Peter has left her crazy with desire – as well as frustration. A second meeting promises the completion she so badly needs. Before this can happen though, her submissive desires are put to the test. Signing her autonomy away to a man who makes her feel like a hunted rabbit could be the stupidest thing she’s ever done. But the reward is a glimpse into Peter’s wild life, deep in the New Mexican wilderness – and the most intense passion of her life. Just as Isabel’s heart begins to open to the fascinatingly free-spirited man, he slips out of her grasp, reminding her that he’s as enigmatic as ever. Isabel and The Wolf: Part Two is a 25,000 word novella and the second episode in the new werewolf erotic romance serial by Ariana Hawkes. It contains cliffhangers. It also contains strong sexual themes and is not intended for readers under the age of 18.",
