  "description": "A DARK ROMANCE  Past collides with present. Love, lust, pain, desire, hope, hopelessness, want, need, anger, release. It’s all the same in the end. Because Fate chooses to toss us into the deep end every time. Only the strong of body will learn to swim through what Fate throws our way. Only the strong of mind will learn to float with it. What we can’t resist will consume us. What we can’t overcome will become us. Even death isn’t a release as it too consumes. Only love or hate exists in the end. In all its twisted and messed up forms. Love always knows how to float. Hate always knows how to pull us down. This is the ending to this story. Be warned…it’s a dark ending and not exactly happy. But I’m happy with it ~ Willow  Excerpts:  It’s her eyes I remember most. How they would dart around in fear; how they would relax and widen in perfect submission; how the deep chocolate brown was made darker with her emotions. Always so readable, always so expressive, her eyes gave everything away so easily even in her blankest looks. Tonight was no different.  ….  The others don’t understand pain. Don’t get what it can be, what it can do. With the lash of a whip, I tear through the memories we five share and the darkest memories I keep to myself. I merge the feel of a new mark with ones I’ve worn in our past. I amplify the pain with the memories, adding fire to the fever of every sexual encounter, even the most vanilla. It’s how we survived, how I thrived.",
