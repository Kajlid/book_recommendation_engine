  "description": "I wasn’t even remotely interested in collecting the third instrument of assassination. It was far better for everyone involved — and for Warner, specifically — if I just let it be. And since I was the only one who could retrieve the artifacts, I figured it was my call to make. I was wrong. And though that wasn’t unusual, I was just so … so … wrong … about everything. I was wrong about who I was protecting and why. I was wrong about who and what I could control. And I was wrong about who I was becoming. Baker of cupcakes, maker of trinkets, half-witch, half-dragon, dowser, alchemist … Why couldn’t I just be Jade?Artifacts, Dragons, and Other Lethal Magic is the sixth book in the Dowser series, which is set in the same universe as the Oracle, Reconstructionist, Amplifier, Archivist, and Misfits of the Adept Universe series. While it is not necessary to read all the series, in order to avoid spoilers the ideal reading order of the Adept Universe begins with Cupcakes, Trinkets, and Other Deadly Magic (Dowser 1).",
