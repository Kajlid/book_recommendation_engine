Now, ten years later, Sugar has rebuilt her life, but still hides her heart behind the log walls of her lodge on Lake Superior. Drug Task Force Agent Donovan Walsh follows his most sought after drug lord to Duluth, Minnesota. His plan is simple; protect the key witness to McElevain’s destruction and track down the proof he needs to put him away for life. He just wasn’t planning for his witness to be the most beautiful, and most difficult, woman in all of Duluth.Sugar finds herself drawn to her new bodyguard, but can’t risk her heart for a romance destined to break it. When an attempt is made on her life she trusts Van to lead her through a dangerous rumba of deceit, kidnapping, and murder, but when the last notes fade away Sugar has one decision left to make. Will Van heal her heart or break it?",
