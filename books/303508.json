  "description": "Do not fall in love with girls on floating islands.Do not grab her letter from the sky and chase her unknown outline into the heavens.Do not follow little lights into the darkness and lose your way— or find it.Winifred Otiena lives in a city that shares a very special holiday with a floating continent: they send paper airplanes up to their sister land each year. The island in exchange passes down lanterns of every color back to earth. Winnie is young when she catches her first lantern and reads the note tucked away inside.She is young when she starts to fantasize about meeting the girl who wrote it and eventually trying to reach her. As she grows older, her search continues, and her feelings begin to shift when her hopes seem fully realized. A story of a far-off future where two girls are separated by sky and land and how they slowly fall for one another— as well as rise.",
