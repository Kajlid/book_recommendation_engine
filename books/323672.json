  "title": "The Empress of Scarred Secrets",
  "description": "Long ago, war ravaged the lands of Estrana, until an agreement was set. A tentative peace is now on the verge of collapse from centuries-old prejudices. Verena never sought to conquer, nor rule, but betrayal forced her hand. To protect the forsaken, she must attend the quarter century meeting. And assume her place at the demon High Lord's table, just as her parents before. The blood in Verena's veins determined her path, but other's secrets will decide her fate. A lineage she has always denounced now weighs heavy upon her shoulders. The power of an Empress was never a weapon she wanted to wield, but for her people, she will take what is hers, by battle and blood. High Lady she was born, but an Empress she was destined to become.",
