  "description": "Supernatural private eye Cal McDonald thinks he's seen it all, at least until a couple of rampaging rednecks bust through his door hootin' about demonic possessions. Thus begins Cal's most spine-chilling (and side-splitting) case yet, as these Beverly Hellbillies take him down a trail of terror into the heart of a Southern California backwater brimming with monsters and mullets. Can Cal and his living-dead partner Mo'Lock save an entire town from the nastiest spirit this side of the river Styx? Will Cal's girlfriend Sabrina forgive him for forgetting Valentine's Day before they're overcome by a demonic horde? And just how did little Billy Ray end up with a portal to Hell in his bedroom? All will be revealed in this collection courtesy of uber-scribe Steve Niles and fantastically frightful art-meister Kelley Jones.",
