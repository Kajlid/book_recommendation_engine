The slightest hint of human activity could draw the wolves to their home, to destroy everything ... utterly. Which is how Miguel finds himself on a one-way mission with his own destructive mandate: to eliminate a passing ship, before it can bring unwanted attention down on them.Only something goes wrong.There's a lone survivor.And she knows far more about Miguel than she's letting on . . .Ranging from the depths of space to the deeps of Pattern Juggler waters, from nervous, isolated communities to the ruins of empire, this is a stealthy space opera from an author at the top of his game.Praise for Al Reynolds' Revenger'A swashbuckling thriller' The Guardian'A blindingly clever imagining of our solar system in the far flung future' The Sun'A rollicking adventure yarn with action, abduction, fights and properly scary hazards' The Daily Telegraph",
