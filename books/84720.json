  "description": "\"Early Out\" is shocking, moving and gritty. Much more than a chronicle of a life lived \"on the edge\", these stories sweep us along on the writer's journey as he sinks deeper and deeper into the underbelly of Las Vegas glitz - succumbing to the lure of hard drugs and sex. Most impressive are his crystalline insights, delivered with the raw, terse directness of a knock-out punch. Kaellis possesses a rare voice, emitting flashes of raw genius and great humanity.
