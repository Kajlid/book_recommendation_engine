  "description": "In the spirit of an age old sport of falconry, a young boy, Grant and his wild falcon, Kessy, enjoy hunting games together. Kessy wants to please Grant by bringing him all sorts of things. Even when Grant ignores Kessy, while he is too busy building his tree house, Kessy tries to help. He’s an obedient and loyal friend to Grant, who communicates by his action rather than words. The grand folks are introduced as a collective group of caring seniors who come in the night to finish Grant’s building project, but without Grant knowing. They bring with them their diverse knowledge and expertise of years past through their cavorting and humorous ways. Later, Kessy is stuck in their home, till he snatched a ribbon to take to Grant and escaped out of a window. As two grand folks journey out to track Kessy and retrieve the ribbon, Kessy watches from high above. With his keen eyes he can see danger lurking. He swoops down to help them. He gives the ribbon to them just in time for their escape from trouble. After the grand folks race away chattering, Kessy then continues his flight home to his lonely friend, Grant, with a new, and yummy (?) surprise.",
