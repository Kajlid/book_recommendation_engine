  "description": "Zibby Lloyd’s food binges and purges have gone on for months. When her bulimia becomes life-threatening, she’s sent to Hope House, a residence for kids with serious medical problems. Zibby hates it there; as far as she’s concerned, her only problem is how to get out!  When Zibby hears she’s getting a roommate, she’s furious. She’s doubly mad when Lauren Kent arrives. Lauren is a beautiful, perfect girl Zibby has known her whole life. Only now it looks as if Lauren isn’t so perfect: she’s anorexic. The two lifelong enemies are united at last—in a plan to escape from Hope House. But will the mission that brings them together as friends also endanger their lives?",
