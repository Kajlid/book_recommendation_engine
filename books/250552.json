  "description": "What is a family?Who is a family?Either a lot or a few is a family;But whether there's ten or there's two in your family,All of your family plus you is a family!There is something for everyone in this celebration of families - poems about families of all sizes and configurations, about brothers and sisters, adoptees and stepsiblings, parents and grandparents, even a special ode to the only child. Both poems and Hafner's warm expressive illustrations convey the sense of what makes family life at once so wonderful and so unpredictable. Told from a child's point of view, the poems are perfect for reading alone or in the classroom and for family story times as well.",
