  "description": "Boredom, the root of my evil.  I had it all, dream job, boyfriend, stability. So I did the unthinkable, I packed up and left everything that was dear to me. Set out on the journey of a lifetime and it was all going to plan until I met him.  Alastar O’Shea.  An enigmatic, artistic Irishman who had more sexual energy in his pinky finger than anything I had ever dreamed of. I should have stayed away from him. He was hot, toxic and the most exhilarating experience of my life.  Like a drug he entered my bloodstream. Like a drug he brought me undone. Did I meet him by chance or was it a calculated hit?  I did believe in fairy tales but he isn’t who I thought he was. Will he find me? Will it cost me my life?",
