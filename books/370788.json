  "title": "Penguins Stopped Play: Eleven Village Cricketers Take on the World",
  "description": "'Completely brilliant' Ian HislopIt seemed a simple enough idea at the to assemble a team of eleven men to play cricket on each of the seven continents of the globe.Except - hold on a minute - that's not a simple idea at all . And when you throw in incompetent airline officials, amorous Argentine Colonels' wives, cunning Bajan drug dealers, gay Australian waiters, overzealous American anti-terrorist police, idiot Welshmen dressed as Santa Claus, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and whole armies of pitch-invading Antarctic penguins, you quickly arrive at a whole lot more than you bargained for.Harry Thompson's hilarious book tells the story of one of those great idiotic enterprises that only an Englishman could have dreamed up, and only a bunch of Englishmen could possibly have wished to carry out.",
