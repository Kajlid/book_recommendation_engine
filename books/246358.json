  "description": "Cold, ruthless, vicious.\n\n\nI’m Paulo García’s monster, and I’d swallowed that bitter pill whole, learned to deal with it… until she stormed into the house like some avenging Valkyrie.\n\nBrave, stupid, beautiful.\n\n\nNicky just wants to save her brother. She showed up with an envelope full of cash and a smart mouth and found herself in a den of monsters. I wish I could say I was the best of them, I wish I could say I wanted to protect her — but I’m far from perfect and she’s so damn sweet. And all I want is a taste before this world destroys her.",
