That’s when my father informed me that the only future I had was working at his private investigation firm. Seventeen. That’s when I tried to escape the future that had been laid out for me. Tried to cut all ties that connected me to my own blood. Spoiler alert: It didn’t work. They still own me.Eighteen. That’s when I was told if I completed this one job, I’d be cut loose. Free.
