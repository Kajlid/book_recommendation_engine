  "description": "My innocence was shattered one steamy October night, when I sold my soul to the devil to pay for a week in a dirty motel room. Thinking I could rid myself of him, I fled the safety of the nomad lifestyle I had embraced my entire life for the security of a small upstate New York town, alongside my big sister Star.  What I never anticipated was a green eyed stranger that would steal my heart and never look back. And a dark eyed man on a motorcycle, who would teach me how to trust again. Both of them completely shattering every wall I ever put up to keep men out of my vulnerable world.  I am Paisley Bloom, and this is my devastating story.",
