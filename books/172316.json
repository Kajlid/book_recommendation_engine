  "title": "Three Sips of Gin - Memoirs of an African Adventure",
  "description": "In “Three Sips of Gin” the author gives a fascinating account of what it was like growing up in the decadence of colonial East Africa and then of being caught up in the turbulence of an African continent at war with itself. Later we immerse ourselves with the author in the intrigues, scandals and humor of a large corporate boardroom in South Africa where longevity of service was as fleeting as the mists on the Matabele plains.",
