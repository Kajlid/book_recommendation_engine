  "description": "Parker Hamilton - movie star! That's what the world knows about me. Oscar winner, prominent bloodline, playboy. But there is so much more to me. My friends are my real family, and they are what matters most. But I’d be lying if I said that I’m not concerned about my reputation. Everyone who lives in the spotlight is. Listen, I can play any role - drama, comedy, romance. You name it. I can act my ass off, and I have the proof on a shelf in my office. But when my agent calls me into his office to offer me the role of a lifetime, I am hesitant. Not only would I have to act opposite Chance Steele, the most egotistical schmuck I know, but we would also have to pretend to be intimate. Really intimate. As in gay lovers. Now, don’t get me wrong; I am as open-minded as they come. People can love whom they want, screw whom they want, even marry whom they want. But when you ask me to make out with a dude, pretend to roll around in a bed with him, well, that’s where I draw the line. Maybe. Sometimes lines are blurry. And sometimes lines are just meant to be crossed. Crossing the Line is book 3 of the Taboo Love series and picks up where Unmasking Charlotte left off. As withHey There, Delilah and Unmasking Charlotte, it is a standalone - so don’t worry if you haven’t read them yet - with a HEA. That means no cliffhanger! Oh, and expect to see some of your favorite characters. Contains graphic m/m scenes. Not intended for readers under 18.",
