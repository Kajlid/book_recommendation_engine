  "description": "Andrew Goodwin hears voices. They wake him in the dead of night, lingering behind the walls, growing steadily more intense until they take control.  Making him captive in his own home.  These voices are real. Andrew doesn't know who they are or what they want, but every time he approaches the door, they somehow force him back. Whenever he wakes up in the daylight, they put him right back to sleep, making him live on stolen moments in the darkness.  Desperate, he records his own movements, and discovers his entire life is a lie – Andrew is somehow leaving the flat each day as though things were perfectly normal.  So why doesn’t he remember? Who is in control? And why are there bruises and bloodstains all over his body?  Affinities is a fast-paced, mind-bending psychological thriller about a man whose very life is stolen from him. Because sometimes, you can't even trust yourself.",
