  "description": "The man landing, and skidding on a gravel driveway probably broke his body, but that wasn't enough for Edward, who charged out of the window after him, put a boot in the man's back, and ripped his arms free of his body. Edward let them drop, and the Ghasts on top of the cabin faltered, not expecting such a display of ferocity. Lucien had taken Edward's cue, and gone out the other side of the cabin. Before the Ghasts could react, Lucien was among them, a whirlwind of heavy steel, breaking bodies, and crushing skulls. Edward Black's entire family was killed in a gruesome event called The Christmas Murders. A former police officer, and war veteran, he's visited by an otherworldly being, who bestows upon him a gift of terrible responsibility. What he chooses to do with this gift, is his choice, and he chooses to always do what's right. He doesn't discriminate when choosing his enemies, whether they're of this world, or the next, it matters little. Together with his group of new friends and his mentors, he'll face foes that would render anyone else immobile. This is the first book, in The Tale of Edward Black.",
