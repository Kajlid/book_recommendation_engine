  "description": "The gods brought her back. But was it to stop Valroy, or to become his queen?Valroy will let nothing block his path to the Unseelie Crown. He was born for the crown, born in blood and death, and he is willing to stop at nothing to see both Tir n’Aill and Earth as his dominion, and crushing the self-righteous Seelie beneath his bootheels.He’d wished for Abigail to stand beside him as his queen, but that went terribly wrong when she chose death over becoming his bride. It was a setback, certainly, but not one he could not overcome.Yet despite being wrenched from the song of life, Abigail returned to Tir n’Aill, only to be hunted by both Seelie and Unseelie alike. She did not know why she was returned or for what purpose, but it was clear that two paths lay before her: to become Valroy’s enemy, or to allow him to make her his queen in chains.",
