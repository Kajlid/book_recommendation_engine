  "description": "Vibiana Morales met with a tragic death when she fell from a stripper pole on amateur night at The Jug Hut. As if that weren’t bad enough, she discovers she has to pay penance for a few uncharitable acts she committed her last days on Earth. Gideon, her intriguing supervisor, explains she is to be a guardian angel. Unfortunately, she’s to be the guardian of that prissy, job stealing, man snatching Sabrina Barrett, Vibi’s long standing nemesis and the wife of Jesse de Marco - the jerk who stood Vibiana up at the altar! Ignoring the advice and warning, (as well as the butterflies in the stomach) Gideon gives her, Vibiana seizes the opportunity to wreak havoc with Sabrina’s life by; joyfully dishing out bad hair days, stubbing fragile toes, misplacing keys and ruining every romantic moment Jesse and Sabrina try to share. But Vibi takes it too far. Sabrina’s job is in jeopardy and her marriage is on the rocks. Will Vibiana be able to set aside her own feelings and right her wrongs? Will she be able to gain back Gideon’s trust and respect…and earn his love? Her soul depends on it.",
