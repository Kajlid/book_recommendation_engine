  "description": "Kenna “All of his pain, I was always the cause of it. Even if indirectly. All roads led to Kenna, I supposed.” My Madman brings me to life—but it comes at a price. I’m the one who faces his demons when they decide to crawl out of the hell inside his head. One thing is certain: it’s not my forgiveness that is needed. Phil must forgive himself before there’s chance for us. I’m afraid he won’t be able to. What will I have then? Without him, I’m just existing.   Phil \"Looking back now, I think I wanted to scare her a little, wanted to see if she'd run screaming from the demons in me.\" My Baby Girl owns me. Always has, always will. My heart beats for her, my soul is only half without her. Then The Madman surfaces and rips into her. My demons are threatening to rip us apart. I'm going to lose her, lose my only dream, the only future I'll accept. How do I fix this? She speaks of forgiveness. Deep down, I'm afraid I'm too weak to find it. Kenna is strong enough to walk away from us. She’s giving me No Quarter.",
