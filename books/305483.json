Early in her career, at a time when women had little power in Hollywood, she starred in, directed, and produced her own shows, creating opportunities for other women and for people from marginalized groups. She has campaigned to end bullying and has stood up for the LGBTQIA+ community. And she has devoted much of her life advocating for the fair treatment of animals.This innovative picture book biography follows a young boy who is doing a class presentation about Betty White...with a little help from Betty herself! Whimsical yet fact-filled, That's Betty! tells the story of a life well-lived while celebrating Betty's many fans.A Who Did It First? Book",
