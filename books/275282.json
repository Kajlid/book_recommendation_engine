  "description": "I lived life on my terms, keeping people at a distance for a reason.I rebelled every chance I got, shutting down any sensibilities that remained. But then danger swallowed me whole, and all I wished for was a different life.A life where I listened to the concerns of those who loved me.A life that had meaning. A life where I could follow my dream of becoming a designer. Secrets would be revealed.Lies would be uncovered.But could I see beyond the deception?And could I step away from the past and emerge on the other side intact?",
