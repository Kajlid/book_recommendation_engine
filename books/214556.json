Unfortunately, his hesitancy wears heavy on Scott’s heart and now Tad risks losing him forever. Experience Tad’s journey of erotic self-discovery as, time and again, he seeks out the man who’s upended his world... and his heart. Warning: Erotic romance, containing graphic gay sex. Intended for mature audiences only.",
