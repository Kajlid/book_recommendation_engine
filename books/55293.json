  "title": "The Crab Prince: An Entertainment for Children",
  "description": "A lively retelling of a rather long Italian story that has several familiar elements. Dissatisfied with her many suitors, Rosella (a lovely peasant girl) makes friends with a giant crab in the village well. One day, curious, she follows him into the well, diving through ancient ruins to find him in his true manly form, dining with the ``ghula'' (a witch-like crone) who has enchanted him. Only the ghula's magical fish can break the enchantment; Rosella pursues the ghula over and under a stormy sea, captures the fish, and transforms her lover--who turns out, of course, to be a prince.",
