  "description": "Cubanos in Wisconsin: First they took baseball, then they took freedom. In the early 1960s, young Silvio Canto, Jr., watched Fidel Castro's revolucion smother the island of Cuba with oppression and false promises. Fidel closed down churches, took over schools and gutted the free enterprise on the island, prompting scores of Cubans to flee the land of their ancestors and pursue a better life abroad. In 1964, Silvio's family would do the same, but no step of the journey would be easy. Facing boisterous Cuban officials and exploitative private property laws, the family ventured to a far away land called Wisconsin to reclaim their lost freedom. Along the way, Silvio's Cuban life was uprooted, but his Cuban-American dream was born.",
