  "title": "The Story of a Nobody",
  "description": "Chekhovâ€™s little-known literary gem is a profound and moving work, combining the political tensions of the day with a tale of deep poignancy and sorrow. With St. Petersburg awash with extravagant, dissolute bureaucrats concerned only with increasing their vast riches, a secret movement infiltrates one of its members into one such household. Once there, the man sees for himself the profligacy that he has sworn to oppose?yet he also sees purposelessness throughout life. Determining to follow his own values, he embarks upon a new path, little knowing that this too will lead him to tragedy?a tragedy he will find impossible to bear.",
