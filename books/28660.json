  "title": "The Long Fuse: An Interpretation of the Origins of World War I",
  "description": "In analyzing the causes of World War I without concern for the question of guilt, the author places emphasis on two central first, that when statesmen and peoples took actions they knew might lead to war, they were not envisaging the catastrophe that the war became but rather a quick and limited war; and, second, that among the many conflicts that might have led to war, the one that did was the threat to the integrity of Austria-Hungary posed by Serbia and Serb nationalism. Title of related interest also available from Waveland Williamson-Van Wyk, July 1914: Soldiers, Statesmen, and the Coming of the Great Warâ€”A Documentary History (ISBN 9781478622864).",
