  "description": "Maurice Sendak greeted the publication of the first book by this unique author-and-artist team with an astonishing review in The New York Times Book Review , which \" Sid and Sol is a wonder--a picture book that heralds a hopeful, healthy flicker of life in what is becoming a creatively exhausted genre. The magic rests in teh seamless bond of Arthur Yorinks's and Richard Egielski's deft and exciting collaboration.\" Sendak concluded his review with an enthusiastic \"Welcom, Mr. Yorinks and Mr. Egielski!\" Now Louis the Fish , their second picture book, not only fulfills the promise of the first, but amply surpasses it.Louis is a butcher. He has a nice shop on Flatbush, with steady customers. He's \"always friendly, always helpful, a wonderful guy.\" But Louis is not happy. He hates meat!All his life he's been surrounded by meat.

Business begins to fail. All seems lost. Until on night, in fitful sleep, after uneasy dreams, Louis is changed in a profound and startling way and begins a happy new life.",
