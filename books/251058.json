  "title": "Developing Variations: Style and Ideology in Western Music",
  "description": "Music, even at its formal level, says Rose Rosengard Subotnik, is to be understood as an embodiment of specific cultural and social values, as defined within the interpreter’s own context. In Developing Variations, Subotnik critically employs the insights of Adorno, Kant, Hegel, and Marx to analyze the works of Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, and Schoenberg.Combines into a cohesive statement the author’s pathbreaking critical essays on Western music.\"Rose Subotnik stands out as perhaps the most interesting and provocative person to have written from a nonpositivist, nonvenerative position about music in society, rather than music as autonomous art. Her massive project on post-Kantian philosophy, as embodied in and carried forward by music, is in a class by itself. In her philological and interpretive reading of Adorno, she is, I believe, the major voice.\"— Edward W. Said, Columbia University",
