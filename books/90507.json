  "description": "Plenty of laughs are had in this crazy-ass parody of the betrayal of Jesus Christ by Judas Iscariot. John-who-imagined-there-was-no-Heaven-and-found-out-there-wasn't-one Lemon and Roy Orbi-son-of-a-gun-we’ll-have-big-fun-on-the-blue-bayou make cameo appearances in a story that starts with the birth of Jesus, ends with his crucifixion, and co-stars Poop Morning After Pill II. “Its time you knew the truth, Jesus. I . . . am your Poop.” Amen, indeed.",
