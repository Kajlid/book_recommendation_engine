Circumstances that she can avert, for Sarah is what they call an Automatic Writer.The novel begins with Sarah perched under a bridge with no idea why she’s there, except what the note said;Sit under the Elizabeth St. Bridge at 10:18am. Bring hammer.There’s a car accident on the bridge, plunging a vehicle into the river below. If Sarah wasn’t there at the right time, with the hammer to force her way into the car, people would’ve died.The novel’s intensity increases as more blackouts occur, causing her to note them down. Her next task is to avert a kidnapping. She’s done it before. Couldn’t be that hard. But on this one, the kidnappers recognize her and nab her instead of their intended victim.People are killed. Witnesses place Sarah at the scene. The police find her notebook riddled with prophecies of accidents and crimes.They want answers. They want to know how she has such information.All this happens while the eighteen-year-old star in this first novel of a trilogy suffers from trichotillomania, which means she’s a puller.Most of her hair is missing.The story has numerous twists and turns and finally ends with a massive climax and a lead in to The Warning, which is Part Two of this trilogy.Overall a great read, combining the likes of John Saul, and Dean Koontz.",
