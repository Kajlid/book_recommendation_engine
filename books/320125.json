  "description": "She got more than she bargained for.When Serena comes to Trangor to participate in the First Hunt, the last thing she expects is to find herself forced to marry an Ordosian… or be executed. She knows nothing of his people, nothing of him, except that he’s got fangs, scales, and a crazy long tail. Serena only has to play the part of being a wife for six months, and then she’ll be free to leave. But Szaro seems to have other plans. He’s big, intimidating, and definitely not human. Yet, how can she remain indifferent when he does everything to please her?From the moment he lays eyes on Serena, Szaro is fascinated by the delicate human female. Deceptively fragile in appearance, she’s a fearless and skilled hunter. The lingering taste of her scent on his tongue is intoxicating. Claiming her to save her life is no hardship for him. Overcoming their differences and convincing her to stay willingly is a challenge he relishes. But will that prove more than either of them can handle?",
