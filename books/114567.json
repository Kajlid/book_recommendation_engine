  "title": "Slave of the Sioux- The Fanny Kelly Captivity Narrative, 1864",
  "description": "Unquestionably the most vivid and horrifying account of a woman held captive by Indians is that of Fanny Kelly, who, as part of an intrepid band of emigrants on their way to Idaho in 1864 with her husband and young daughter was captured by the Sioux in a brutal and deadly massacre, spending the next 6 months enslaved by various factions of the Oglala & Brule tribes.  This is her own story in her own words, as she witnesses savagery after savagery, hoping only to stay alive to reunite with her beloved child and husband. A real-life abduction story that to our modern ears sounds almost manufactured, this edition, with illustrations & photographs never in any other edition, plus new chapters on other Sioux depravities of that time, like the macabre \"Scalp Dance\", will enlighten as well as horrify. If you only read one captivity narrative this is the one to read.",
