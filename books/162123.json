  "description": "Timing is everything, especially a bitch.Jenna Monroe never cared which side of the tracks I was from. She didn't care what my reputation was, what my face looked like, or what my body could do. She never asked for anything but me. The real me. The boxer. The orphan. The animal.  I met her my senior year when she was just a thirteen year old kid with honest eyes and fire in her veins. She was the greatest friend I'd ever known and I loved her like blood. I fought for her, I protected her, and as she grew older, I wanted her. Now my biggest worry isn't how to keep her safe from the world.  It's how the hell am I going to keep her safe from me?  *Due to language and sexual content, this book is recommended for readers 18+.  Brawler is told from Kellen's point of view with new elements of the story not covered in Knockout. Both Knockout and Brawler can be read independently of each other and in no particular order.",
