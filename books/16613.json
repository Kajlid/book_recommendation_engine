  "description": "Love is magic...Elise sells magic, charms and dreams out the back door of her brightly painted wagon. A Witch and daughter of the Maja, she believes that everything happens for a reason, but she has never quite understood why there is a hollow feeling in the place where her heart should be.One night, at the fabled Moon Market, she meets a beautiful stranger. The mysterious woman's name is Via, and Elise is drawn to her, body, heart and soul. But Elise's past and Via's secret may tear the two women apart... Is true love possible, or is it only a fairy tale?(Ed. Note: Sugar Moon: A Novella was originally published under the pen name Sarah Diemer in 2011. It was unpublished shortly thereafter. This is the new, reworked version.)",
