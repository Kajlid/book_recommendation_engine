  "description": "For Mo Collins surviving the zombie apocalypse isn’t getting any easier. Defeating blunatics, saving survivors, recovering treasure and securing Guntersville Island has been taking up Mo’s time when he would rather just make time with his girl. But he can’t avoid his scripted destiny; his personal Oracle, Smokes, won’t let him. He can still bitch about it, though. The crew of the replica pirate ship, the Viva Ancora, is growing, and the cast of characters are fulfilling their roles towards destiny. Having found his parents and assured their safety on the Island there is still someone else missing; His brother, Easy. So Mo, Smokes the pilot (Oh Dear God!) and The Expert are off to find Easy. His last known location? Birmingham, AL. Yea, it total makes sense to fly off to Alabama’s largest city which is assuredly overflowing with the naked, blue, undead cannibals. But The Hero’s gotta do what The Hero’s gotta do. Follow Mo and his crew as they try and skew fate, risk life and limb, again, and as they explore more of their new world and go in search of Mo’s lost brother. Easy. All aboard Flight Z as we fly to parts unknown. In a world where the Zombies bite… and sometimes life bites. Fasten your seat belt friend; Welcome to Zombies On A Plane!",
