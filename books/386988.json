  "description": "MIRROR, MIRROR, ON THE WALL...Men! If they aren't accusing Lady Maggie Graham of witchcraft or murder, they're marrying her off to old men who drop dead at the altar. And now she's going to have to save her unruly stepdaughter from a band of thieving, lustful street ruffians (men, again) with the help of the most infuriating man of all...Lord Jamie.WHO IS THE MOST SEDUCTIVE...Women! They conduct themselves in a completely inappropriate manner — enjoying risqué amusements in secret theatres: running about disguised in the seediest parts of the city — and then they call you vile names for coming to their rescue. And no woman is more wicked, more cunning, more intoxicating than Lady Maggie....OF THEM ALL?Amidst the pageantry, rampant desire, and very real dangers of Queen Victoria's London, a bevy of lovers is about to stumble into a spectacle of sin and scandal, where appearances are deceiving and anything can happen when desire is pulling all the strings.",
