  "description": "Humans say the eyes mirror the soul. I think most of my kind would agree. Our unique natural abilities enable us to sense what is true in humans when we look deep into their eyes. Almost instantly we see what lives in their souls. We smell it. Either fear and darkness, or courage and light. But humans also say, ‘Never look a dog in the eye.’ Do you know why? Because you will see yourself. What you feel. Your fears. And who you truly are. We saw darkness in T-Rex’s eyes, and when he looked into our eyes, he saw his own reflection. Darkness and death. Because over the centuries- measured in human years, not our years- that was what his kind had bred in us. The dark seed of their own souls. And a willingness to kill…We heard his car and the three that followed, each bringing death. T-Rex was moving fast, anxious to return to Hell. And he had a new killer with him. One of our kind. But special. Very special. And as T-Rex arrived in Hell, followed by the three cars, the smell of dust, dirt, gasoline, and death filling our nostrils, I, for one, sensed his new killer was young. Very young. I smelled his innocence. His rotting, dying innocence. He was no trained killer…yet. But he soon would be. And with a soul nearly as dark as his master’s. I had no choice. I had to escape…” Alejandro’s journey to Paradise City - to both its darkest and most mystical places - will soon begin. And once there, he will encounter all that is good and all that is evil in his search for human love. But the beast, the man known as T-Rex, will also be searching for him.",
