  "description": "Life should be charmed for sixteen-year-old Calista McCoy. But being a psychic, empathic, fire-starting witch isn't all magical fun and games, even if it does come with a snazzy new wardrobe and an awesome beach house in California. Now she is a target for the deadly Hunters who seek out new, vulnerable witches. Any exposure of her magical abilities can have disastrous consequences. And with covens all over the world constantly fighting with one another, it's hard to know who to trust. If all that weren't bad enough, now she has to go to some snooty private school for rich kids...not exactly a dream situation for a shy girl raised in the slums of the Louisiana bayou. Things look up when she meets the gorgeous and mysterious Nicholas, and she instantly falls under his captivating spell. But it soon becomes clear that not all of Calista's new friends are who they appear to be...especially Nicholas. And once the thin veil between fantasy and reality is shattered, no one is safe from the evil that has snuck into their lives. Dare to dream...",
