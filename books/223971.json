  "description": "Taryn Louden has inherited her father’s family home and more money than she ever thought she’d see in a lifetime. There are just a few problems with it all. The house is expensive to maintain, local kids entertain themselves by pulling pranks on her, and there might be a few departed Loudens still hanging around. The only real bonus is the sexy contractor Taryn’s aunt hired to restore the Louden family home back to its former glory.  According to her father, Vicky Andre goes through women like disposable razors. At thirty-seven, she’s only had one serious relationship, but even then, she’d never truly given her heart. She’s never known what it’s like to be swept off her feet, but when she meets Taryn, Vicky realizes her work boots are no longer firmly planted on the ground.  Join Taryn and Vicky on their twisted path to happily ever after in Robin Alexander’s latest romantic comedy, The Last of the Loudens.",
