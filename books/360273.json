  "description": "Dusty Zamora and her close-knit sisters were young--but far from innocent--when they abruptly left Hagerstown, Maryland ten years ago. Now, Dusty has returned. Alone. Judd McCassey spent most of his thirty-six years side-by-side with his brothers and cousins--on the wrong side of the law. His one regret--being powerless to help the only woman he ever loved when she needed it most. Judd knows they're headed for trouble when Dusty rides back into his life on a stolen outlaw biker's motorcycle, and is shocked when she refuses his help. Finally realizing that hiding her deadly secrets are harming--not helping--the man she loves, Dusty opens up to Judd, dropping a bombshell that sends him reeling, and her fleeing. Not until Dusty vanishes does Judd discover her deception was well-intended. Now, he must find her before it's too late for all of them?",
