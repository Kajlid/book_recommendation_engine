  "description": "\"Look! Ten apples up on top! We are not going to let them drop!\"Since 1961, the Dr. Seuss classic Ten Apples up on Top has been helping preschoolers learn to count and read simultaneously. Simple illustrations and even simpler rhymes make this apple-balancing competition between a dog, a tiger, and a lion a fun, easy place to practice sight words and phonics. Siblings can even take turns reading phrases like \"Seven apples up on top. I am so good they will not drop.\" The inevitable tumbling crash is a great climax for busy toddlers to enjoy, and parents will appreciate the cooperative lesson the last page offers. A beginning Beginner Book, this ingenious story uses a vocabulary of only 75 different words. Combining brief and funny stories, easy words, catchy rhythm, and lively illustrations, Beginner Book are an ideal way to introduce the joys of reading to children!With his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, Dr. Seuss has been delighting young children and helping them learn to read for over fifty years. Creator of the wonderfully anarchic 'Cat in the Hat', and ranked among the world's top children's authors, Dr. Seuss is a global best-seller, with nearly half a billion books sold worldwide.Target Audience: Preschool to early reader",
