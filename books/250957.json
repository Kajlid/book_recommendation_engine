  "description": "Maison Lane has finally found her place working at Gleam Enterprises. But when her boss’s hotter-than-hell son, Hutch Happa-Hewitt, begins to work at the office, she realizes that she may be in over her head. Keeping Hutch on a leash will be hard enough; keeping her feelings for him under wraps will be virtually impossible.  Life in the Army was everything Hutch ever wanted, but after losing his lower leg in an ambush, Hutch must now return to civilian life. War has hardened him to life and Hutch has no idea of the effect he has on Maison, but he’s starting to see more of what he likes in the curvy, sweet-as-sin secretary. Has his taste in women really changed or has his combat skills finally deserted him, leaving his heart vulnerable to Maison and her sweet ways?",
