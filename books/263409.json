  "description": "Dr. Molly Fawn’s life is surprisingly normal, considering that she spends her days running support for a man who can fly and lift city buses with one hand. But when Molly interrupts the Silhouette — the city’s most notorious thief — in a middle of a job, everything gets a bit more exciting. Suddenly, Molly sees the thief everywhere, and those leather clad curves and wicked smiles are all she can think about. The Silhouette seems determined to lure the mild-mannered Dr. Fawn out of her shell like taking a gem from a vault, but will Molly have the courage to let the beautiful thief have a shot at stealing her heart?  Silhouette is a standalone F/F romance set in a fictional Midwestern city with superpowered heroes, villains, and the sidekicks who love them.",
