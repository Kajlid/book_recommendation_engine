  "description": "I met Case Abbott when I was stepping out of the shower.I had a towel wrapped around me.He had his phone in his hand ready to call the police.I thought sneaking into my older brother’s Manhattan apartment to surprise him was a great idea. Except, I was the one who was surprised. Not only was my brother out of town, but he didn’t own the apartment. His best friend, Case, did and he had plans for the night that didn’t include me. After I packed up my things so I could check into a hotel, Case had a change of heart.He told me I could stay in his guest room until my brother came back.A week turned into two and then three and then more. I should have been hurrying back to my life in Seattle.Case was needed in California, where he lived most of the time. But our attraction was undeniable.My gorgeous temporary roommate proposed that we cross the line with the mutual understanding that when my brother returned to New York, we’d go our separate ways.We both knew that there was a risk that someone would get hurt.Neither of us could have predicted who that would be.",
