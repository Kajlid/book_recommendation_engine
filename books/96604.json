  "description": "The letter the FBI Chief signed gives Alex federal authority to work the plan, and he won’t run afoul of state laws. He’ll be acting within the limits of the medical marijuana statutes. “It’ll be fun. It’ll give me something extra to do for the next few months, and help you kick-start the investigation, okay?” With that, the third in the Alex Wright Mysteries begins…Alex, a real estate appraiser in Laguna Beach, California, creates a pot farm to benefit his pal, Zack Potrero, police detective for the Newport Beach Police Department. The excitement and compelling action build from there leading to a guaranteed shocking conclusion!",
