  "description": "This listing is for the original book, not the abridged, dramatized adaptation. On the worst birthday of my life, I come home to find my boyfriend in bed with another woman. Within hours, I’m drunk, homeless, and pledging to stay single forever. And that is when the dangerously sexy Seelie King rolls through town, looking for fae like me. Every generation, the king holds a competition for Seelie queen. But for reasons he won’t explain, Torin is looking for a charade, not a real marriage. So when I drunkenly sling insults his way, I have his attention. When Torin offers me fifty million to participate, I think, “What have I got to lose?” The answer turns out to be “my life,” because my competition will literally kill for the crown. And the more time I spend with the seductive king, the harder it becomes to remember it’s all supposed to be fake. Now, my life—and my heart—are one the line.The Graphic Audio version is a separate version, a dramatized adaptation with condensed content, and that listing is here. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...The tropes in this book include trials, fake relationships, enemies to lovers, marriage of convenience, slow burn, forced proximity, and portal fantasy.",
