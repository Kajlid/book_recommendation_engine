  "description": "\"I am a good guy. Good guys don't do bad things. Good guys understand that no means no, and so I could not have done this because I understand.\"  Keir Sarafian knows many things about himself. He is a talented football player, a loyal friend, a devoted son and brother. Most of all, he is a good guy.  And yet the love of his life thinks otherwise. Gigi says Keir has done something awful. Something unforgivable.  Keir doesn't understand. He loves Gigi. He would never do anything to hurt her. So Keir carefully recounts the events leading up to that one fateful night, in order to uncover the truth. Clearly, there has been a mistake.  But what has happened is, indeed, something inexcusable.",
