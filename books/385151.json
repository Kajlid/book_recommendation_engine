  "description": "Spellcheck Nation :Does Spellcheck have a sinister side? Can you engage it's darkness to help you strategize and gain the advantage even though society is screaming that you don't have a chance! Yes. You can. Fiftysomething Holly needs an ally to gain power in a sea of twentysomethings at a high-profile media job. Spellcheck comes through. What People Pray For: It's early morning mass. The candles are lit and the priest murmurs the liturgy. After the Offertory and before Communion, comes the spot where the congregation can call out favors they want from God. Does it work? Is a miracle possible? What do they pray for? It's not money.What I Wore For Loss: A woman reflects on the downfall of her marriage and thrashes around trying to find a way of getting up. Filled with humor and self-reflection, What I Wore For Loss, is a life affirming love song to the reclaimed middle-aged woman.The Obesity Study: OMG who is running these medical investigations? Are they serious? This is too much to bear. It is too gross. It is damaging to the psyche, the ego, the stomach. BUT. It does pay one hundred dollars. Let's do it.",
