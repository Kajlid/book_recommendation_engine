An enchanting setting for a crime mystery series.Vélez-Málaga is the principal town of La Axarquía, the region to the east of Málaga often compared with Tuscany or Switzerland. This main distribution point for fruits and vegetables is an undiscovered gem of Andalucía, full of ancient monuments and a bustling gypsy community that performs raw, impromptu Flamenco in the central bars and clubs.In this third book of the Andalusian Mystery Series, Salome Mendosa, a popular Flamenco dancer and former roommate of Amanda, receives an invitation from a lawyer in Vélez to learn about her birth family. While there are pleasant surprises, Salome is clearly not welcome by some of the locals. As Salome and Amanda dig into long slumbering legends, they rekindle smoldering jealousy and hatred going back to the Civil War.",
