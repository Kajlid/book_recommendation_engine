  "description": "Second Lieutenant Jonah Forrest is finding out that having infinite lives doesn't make war any easier. Sure, downloading into a cloned body when you die is better than the alternative, but that doesn't make a Hell-Spider's claws hurt any less. Or his General's orders for suicide missions any more sane.But when his First Lieutenant gets killed in action, really killed, and when a captured Hell-Spider offers a way to get 'kills' without taking on the enemy, Forrest and his Infinity Squad will have to decide how hard they are willing to work to take the easy way out. Especially when the General starts catching on to their schemes. And when their Hell-Spider prisoner starts suggesting more and more dangerous alternative missions. And when they start suspecting that not ALL of their consciousness is transferring into their new cloned bodies.Infinity Squad: Willing to die to free your planet from alien invaders. More than once if necessary.**Update from author 3/24/15: This book is now free for download at Amazon.com!**",
