  "description": "From Beth Kery, the national bestselling author of Explosive, comes a red-hot romance like no other — where the rules of attraction are broken with that first electrifying touch. Meet Francesca and Ian. The fantasies of what’s to come begin… Because You Are Mine, Part I \"Because You Tempt Me\" It starts with that first look, when you know you have to have him… Francesca Arno has been commissioned to create a grand centerpiece painting for the lobby of Ian Noble’s new skyscraper. It’s at a cocktail party in her honor that she first meets him — and the attraction is immediate for Francesca. It’s also bewildering. She’s not used to such a wholesale sexual response to a stranger. Enigmatic, darkly intense, with a commanding presence, Ian completely unnerves her. And she likes it. For Ian, she’s the kind of woman he can’t resist — one that comes all too a true innocent. But he can sense in her a desire to open up, to experiment, to give herself to the fantasies of a man in control. The first kiss, the first caress, the first challenge for a woman who craves what she’s never had — a man who gets what he wants. Includes a bonus excerpt of Beth Kery’s Wicked Burn, now available. More to come. Don't miss \"Because You Are Mine\", Part II, available 8/7",
