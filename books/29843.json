  "title": "Franklin's Crossing",
  "description": "Created by one of Texas's most celebrated novelists, this is the searing and sweeping epic of America's historic passage west. The Civil War has ended, and a wagon train of wildly varied settlers is making its way across the grasslands of Texas to Santa Fe. At their head is the former slave and seasoned scout, Moses Franklin, who intends to make this expedition his last. But the wagon train is thrown off course as they wander into the country of the vengeful Comanche, who bloodily stop the settlers in their tracks. Even as they battle hostile elements and Indians, the wagon train's cargo of smuggled goods threatens to pit settler against settler. Yet Moses feels that those he is closest to may also pose the greatest threat: Graham, the wagon master, who resents putting all his trust in a black man...and Aggie, the tough but beautiful horse trader's daughter, forever out of Moses' reach. Alive with history and character, this is the enthralling story of the people and passions that won America.",
