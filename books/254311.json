  "description": "A Romantic Comedy / Drama / Modern Day Fairy about a 21st century descendant of a 17th century curse. Cindyâ€™s just a college student dealing with her outrages parents and the difficulties of being socially different. Finding true love is hard enough, but her life is turned upside down when she falls for someone who is truly unique. Bombarded by the suspicions of her friends and family, can she set aside her doubts and endure the bitter sweet turmoil and impossibly ridiculous antics that follow? Will true love prevail? One thing that makes reading this book unusual is the Author's desire to surprise the reader. The main character is mysterious, not just to the other characters, but also to the reader. While it is fun to watch and laugh while the characters try to figure out the truth (which is how most stories are told). It is even more fun to join in on the confusion and even the anger. Wouldn't it be fun to dislike the hero, to become disappointed by the story, and to stop reading it, only to find out later (possible years later) that you, as the reader, were the real jerk. Or even better, to not stop reading and to discover the truth. To be delighted by an incredibly original fairytale love story, which in 100 years time (will be copies in every way shape and form), and will take its place among the classics like Snow White, Cinderella, and Beauty and the Beast.",
