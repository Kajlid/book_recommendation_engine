  "description": "Who ever tires of the zany British country house murder?\"But Lavinia, I don't want people staying here,\" said the Earl. \"After the last two house parties, we agreed no more.\" \"This wouldn't be a house party, George, it's nine guests for one night.\"\"But the last two times we've had people here it's been disastrous.\"\"This is quite different. These people are family, not spies and jewel thieves and blackmailers and film stars. And when one occupies an historic house such as Alderley, one cannot shut its doors, because of a few unfortunate incidents.\"Lord Burford's misgivings were understandable. After all, the \"unfortunate incidents\" had been murders. But these people were travelling a long way for the funeral of an elderly relative. There was nowhere else for them to stay in the village, so the Earl really had to offer them accommodations at Alderley, the Burfords' Carolean mansion.Things started to go wrong when one of guests claimed she had knowledge that would ruin the others' reputations. But nobody took that seriously.Until, that is, she was found murdered ...Lord Burford had never been so relieved as when Chief Inspector Wilkins arrived. Again!The Affair of the 39 Cuff Links, light-hearted sequel to The Affair of the Bloodstained Egg Cosy and The Affair of the Mutilated Mink, delightfully captures the atmosphere of the 1930s country-house mystery.",
