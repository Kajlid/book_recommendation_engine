  "description": "For two thousand years, the Aeons have ruled Terra with a preternatural power. Calling themselves \"servants\", they have brought about a millennium of peace, prosperity and ecological balance, but a threat is growing. A movement of heretics is gaining among the people, seeking to break from Aeon rule. Evading false charges of treason, Makiria and Volar lead a ragtag band of outcasts north to the Wood Coast of the Ãˆrin Forest in search of a safe passage. There, they stumble upon Tome and Ketri, simple Terrans caught in the first fires of the coming conflict. When their homes are destroyed and their families cruelly murdered, the two teens are rescued by the ancient Aeons, to Ketri and Tome, living gods as distant and unfathomable as the stars in the sky. Amid twists and intrigues, acts of heroism and betrayal, tragedy and heartbreak, small kindnesses and great peril, the young Terrans must elude Zemorusag's Weepers, savage warriors ravaging their forest homes; while unbeknownst to them their strange new benefactors carry with them a secret; a secret that, if revealed, threatens to shatter their most cherished beliefs.When the natural ties that bind a people are shattered and broken into shards, can these razor-sharp pieces ever be put back together again? Or is violence and death the only possibility when the gods are at war and the reckoning is coming.",
