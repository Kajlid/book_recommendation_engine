  "description": "\"This Caldecott Honor book captures the fun and freedom of a week of summer vacation spent with a best friend and their grandparents, eating, laughing, and using lots of imagination.\" - Seira Wilson, Amazon Editor When James and Eamon go to a week of Nature Camp and stay at Eamon's grandparents' house, it turns out that their free time spent staying inside, eating waffles, and playing video games is way  more interesting than nature. But sometimes things work out best when they don't go exactly as planned.   This Caldecott Honor-winning book is a moving and hilarious celebration of young boys, childhood friendships, and the power of the imagination, where Marla Frazee captures the very essence of summer vacation and what it means to be a kid.",
