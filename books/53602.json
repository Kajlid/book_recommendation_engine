  "title": "Death Of Hero",
  "description": "First published in 1929, Death of a Hero was described by its author as both a jazz novel and a memorial to a generation. The hero is George Winterbourne. Leaving the Edwardian gloom of his embattled parents behind him, George escapes to Soho, which buzzes, on the eve of war, with talk of politics, pacifism and free love. He paints, he marries, he takes a the perfect hero of his time, whose destiny -- like all those of that lost generation -- is the bloody nightmare of the trenches.",
