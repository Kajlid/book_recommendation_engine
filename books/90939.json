  "description": "You'll love this short tail-wagging tale from two pooches who've been around the block with and without a leash. Frankie and LuLu tell it like it is when it comes to reining in an owner and getting the upper paw. You'll smile, you'll cringe and you just might bark out loud as these two intuitive mutts demonstrate that you don't need a pedigree to be top dog.",
