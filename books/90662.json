  "description": "In Israel, a man clutching a backpack searches desperately for a boat. No more than a few days later, Virgil Flowers in Minnesota gets a message from Lucas Davenport, \"You're about to get a visitor.\" It's an Israeli cop, and she's chasing a man who smuggled out an extraordinary relic â€” an ancient inscribed stone which may revel startling details about the man known as King Solomon.\"Wait a minute,\" laughs Virgil. \"Is this one of those mystical movie-plot deals? The secret artifact, the blockbuster revelation, the teams of murderous bad guys? Should I be boning up on my Bible verses?\" He looks at the Israeli investigator. She's not laughing.As it turns out, there are very bad men chasing the relic, and they don't care who's in the way or what they have to do to get it. \"They're crazies,\" she says. \"What kind of crazies?\" asks Virgil. \"Palestinian crazies, Syrian crazies, Egyptian crazies, maybe a couple of Israeli crazies. Turks. Some Americans, too, I suppose. Maybe the Pope.\"Perhaps Virgil should start praying.Librarian's note: as of 2021, there are 13 volumes in the author's Virgil Flowers series. The last was published in April 2021. It is part of the \"Prey\" series but Lucas Davenport and Virgil Flowers share the billing - \"Ocean Prey.\"",
