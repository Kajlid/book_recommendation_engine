  "title": "The Beautiful Wishes of Ugly Men",
  "description": "�The men in this collection seethe with something close to rage or desperation or both while remaining recognizably and sympathetically human, and that rare combination makes the experience of reading The Beautiful Wishes of Ugly Men feel as dangerous as a knife fight.” -Michael Knight, author of The Typist�Woman can learn more from these stories than from thousands of issues of Cosmopolitan.” -Ellen Gilchrist, author of Victory Over Japan and Nora Jane�To read The Beautiful Wishes of Ugly Men is to know the power and sweep of what short stories can do. These full-bodied, full-throated stories show us men in trouble and men in love, and they show us how those are often one in the same. Prince is a profoundly gifted and muscular writer, a writer who understands the intimacy of violence and the violence of intimacy, a writer you read again and again and again.”  �Bret Anthony Johnston, author of Corpus Christi�These stories scared the hell out of me.” -Brad Watson, author of Aliens in the Prime of their Lives",
