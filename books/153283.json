  "title": "Daughters of the Grasslands: A Memoir",
  "description": "Hereis a beautifully written memoir that weaves outer and inner landscapes of family and life in South Dakota and in South Korea. \"Mary Woster Haug offers a lovely, ruminative book transcending usual boundaries of memoir and travel writing. Set in modern, bustling Korea during a teaching year abroad, but forever grounded within implicating memories from South Dakota's stark landscape, Haug's writing evokes the intoxications of boiled silkworm, blood sausage, and Korean kimchi. These appear amid wafting tugs of childhood illness, a sometimes overanxious mother, and the magic of a childhood in Lakota country....Such intricate artistry, dating back some twenty-two centuries in Korea, fashions Haug's own book where knots of writer observation and memory grow all the stronger for our efforts to unravel them.\" ~Daniel W. Lehman, Co-Editor of River Teeth: A Journal of Nonfiction Narrative",
