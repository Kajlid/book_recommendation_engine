  "description": "WE ARE THE GODS WE WORSHIPAfter so much bloodshed and sacrifice, King Edgar has finally achieved his ultimate goal—to unleash Heaven onto Earth. In mere seconds, the course of history and humanity is changed forever. The Disciples of the Deep have taken the vermillion throne and become the one, true religion.Vrana, even when faced with the irrefutable, refuses to accept Edgar’s new world. Everything that she has fought for has come to this, and while, after all her suffering, she wants nothing more than to rest with Aeson, she knows this won’t be possible, not with Heaven’s Horror haunting their every waking moment.Although she may not realize it, she does not stand alone.The Holy Order of Penance refuses to accept any religion but the one they’ve manufactured. With an army of thousands and the newly recruited insurgents of the Marrow Cabal, Felix and Justine devise a plan to show the rest of the world the Hell that King Edgar is trying to pass off as Heaven.Audra, Edgar’s sister, hasn’t forgotten what he’s done to her and her family. Always underestimated, she returns to the fold with the power to undermine everything the Disciples have spent a millennium putting into place.Then, there is the Skeleton, who, if only he can find a way to harness his Black Hour-induced insanity, has the ability to change everything, past, present, and future, for better or worse.With unlikely allies, Vrana may stand more of a chance against these insurmountable odds, but only if she is willing to truly embrace the annihilating truth of the Night Terror’s “balance.”",
