  "description": "This wasn’t supposed to be in the cards for me, yet here I am, with not one but two mates. Lady Fate has a sick sense of humor that apparently rivals my own. Looks like it’s Present Cameron’s problem now. ~ Cameron  My near constant state of mind is worry. Can you blame me when I have two beautiful and amazing mates in my life? They’re quick to reassure me and with their help, just maybe I can learn to trust that Lady Fate knew what she was doing bringing us together. ~ River  I never imagined anything being as special as meeting River, until I met Cameron. River is my gentle giant, Cameron a sassy menace, and my heart is instantly charmed. They complete me while encouraging me to be the best version of myself. It’s easy to see why Lady Fate pushed us together. ~ Jace  This 32k mpreg story is book four in A Collection of Stays series. It’s filled with magic, learning to trust yourself, true mates and eyeliner covered sarcasm.",
