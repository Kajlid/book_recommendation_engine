  "description": "A nameless character. A faceless figure. A disturbing, thought-provoking exploration of simple, yet unsettling facts of everyday life. The taboos we, as social beings, have chosen to hide under irrational, complex layers of linguistics.By taking full advantage of their author's lack of identity and extreme levels of introspection, The Unwords cut straight through the pretenses and the fallacies in our language as they unleash a full-scale attack on all fronts of cultural and social decay.Words are meant to be spoken. In a dishonest world, what remains unspoken can only be the truth. In a dishonest world... all words can go to hell.",
