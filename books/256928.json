  "title": "THE HERO'S JOURNEY",
  "description": "When we set out on a journey, it is useful to have a map so that we can plan our route, have an idea of anything that may delay us or hinder our progress, and know what supplies we need to see us through to the end. The journey of life is no different - sometimes it is useful to have a map, if for no other reason than to know that we are on track. The Hero's Journey, based on universal myths and archetypes, can provide a useful blueprint for our own lives. It can act as a map for our development and growth as well as a resource for overcoming barriers. Whatever stage we find ourselves at, understanding the process of the journey can give us valuable insights into our own psyche and those with whom we come into contact.",
