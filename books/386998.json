  "description": "Sheltered, small-town girl Gretchen Brannon was out of her element when she aligned herself with Sheikh Philippe Sabon. They came from two different worlds, yet she found a soul mate in the powerful, sensual man who'd suppressed his passions for far too long â€”and harbored a secret anguish. Nevertheless, he made Gretchen aware of her courage...and in turn, she aroused his sleeping senses as no other woman could. But now that Gretchen's heart belonged to the Lord of the Desert, danger loomed when she became the target of the sheikh's most diabolical enemy.",
