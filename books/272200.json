  "description": "My dad, a small town detective, died last month, but I stopped knowing him over a decade ago when he sent me away. So, I was surprised to learn that he left me everything—including his retired K9 dog, Remy.  Determined to claim Remy and return to my life in Nashville, I wasn’t prepared to see them again.  My best friends. My first loves.  Denver, the sweet but fierce K9 officer with guilt in his eyes. Tatum, the reclusive mountain man next door, hellbent on making me keep my father’s land. And Krew, my charismatic friend, now an unlikely member of a dangerous motorcycle club.  I assumed they forgot about me, but they haven’t. I thought I was over them, but I wasn’t.  The innocence of childhood love turns deadly when secrets are revealed. I’ve learned more about the father I thought didn’t want me, but that knowledge? It may very well get me killed. A Contemporary Reverse Harem Romance.",
