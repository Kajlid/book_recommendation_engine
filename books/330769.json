Until I discovered love is a lie, and that promise was broken.When he shows up in town with his little girl who I can’t help but adore, it’s impossible not to get swept up in the hope of a second chance. And Leo makes it clear he’s determined to break down my walls, rebuild my trust in love, and prove to me that our promise was never really broken.With years of heartache and pain between us, can I let Leo stand beside me as I face the ghosts of my past? Or will all of the hard lessons I’ve learned, only make me push him away again?Then and Now is perfect for fans of second chance romance, steamy small town love stories, swoony single dads, and close knit friend groups. This book is for readers who want a hint of angst with a lot of spice and a guaranteed HEA for soul mates who find their way back to each other against all odds. This is the fifth and final full length novel in the Dogwood Cove series and can be read as a standalone, although the series is best enjoyed if read in order.",
