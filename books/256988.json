  "description": "Sometimes the purest love can turn to the deepest hate.  I was twelve when I promised Solo that I would one day marry him. Maybe I would have if he hadn’t gotten impatient and ruined everything that summer when I was fifteen. For the last seven years I’ve replaced the love I once felt for him with anger over his almost getting me killed.  Willow, a talented Motlander dancer, goes on tour in the Northlands. What should have been a chance for a new beginning brings her face to face with her traumatic past when Solo, a mountain of a man and the fiercest warrior of his generation, is put in charge of her safety against her will. If she can’t get rid of him at least she can return the favor and make his job a nightmare too.  The Dancer is the 7th book in Elin Peer’s wildly successful Men of the North series that has readers gushing over the Nmen, unusual plotlines, and the strong set of characters.  If you like large alpha men, strong women, humor, and a lot of depth, then this romantic sci-fi is for you.  Buy it on pre-sale today and save money.",
