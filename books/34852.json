  "description": "Poetry. African American Studies. Caribbean Studies. Engaging with a broad range of human experience and concerns, REDEMPTION RAIN invites the reader into its profound epiphanies through patient revisitation and introspection. Rahim's voice weaves the explosive power of her lively Trinidadian Creole with the searching intensity of one given to appreciating memory's redemptive light. This is a book about the necessary and the unexpected; about costly arrival in the sacred spaces of realization and recognition. Always the impulse is to praise. Hers is a voice that does not shrill but invests in the finer sensibilities of justice, beauty, love, and community to bring out her poetic truth.",
