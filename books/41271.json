  "description": "The eyes only see what the mind is prepared to accept. When first-year investment banker, Sara Banski, is assigned to a high-profile IPO for a promising drug company, she must navigate her way through reality and perception, honesty and subterfuge. As a blue-collar girl tossed into a white-collar world, she finds herself questioning everything. Not only has her smarmy boss at TJ Carnegie Inc., one of New York City's prestigious investment banks, romantically wooed her, but her drunken father has somehow profited from a mysterious hedge fund and her good friend has just committed suicide. Tears are shed when she finds out they are all interconnected, and redemption is her personal battle cry.  Digging deeper into the IPO, Sara uncovers an elaborate scheme that would destroy the credibility of the stock market if ever divulged. Despite threats of personal ruin, she uses the inner-workings of the financial system to expose a tightly-knit conspiracy of manipulation, and the world is watching.",
