  "description": "The basic argument of criminality, nature versus nurture, is examined in this tale of one man’s transition from curiosity to killer. Memories of exploitation and marginalization have led to questions. By fate or fancy, death provides answers…and more questions. As the body count rises, an untested team of investigators must navigate the swirling waters of politics and battle personal demons in order to protect a public increasingly lacking in trust. Witness the evolution of killers and cops, experience life and death through their eyes, and understand the everlasting relationship between choices and consequences.",
