  "description": "A native New Yorker and die-hard skeptic offers a personal look at the development of her medical intuition while serving as a trauma nurse in this riveting memoir. Twenty-five case studies with patients suffering from heart disease, breast cancer, prostate cancer, multiple sclerosis, adult onset diabetes, and other illnesses document the emotional and physiological causes behind patients' symptoms. The interaction of a person's energy system with health and illness is discussed in detail, as are the revelations that medical intuition offers about life, death, healing, and the existence of God. Instructive strategies for increased health and well-being offer ways to increase resistance to disease and reverse the progress of illness.",
