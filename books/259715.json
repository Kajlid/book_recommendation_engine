  "description": "***A finalist for 2019 Eric Hoffer Award***Arun had given up. There was nothing else he could do. Leads had dried up, no one gave a damn about Sara anymore. Three months later with no person of interest, missing cases were cold cases, he’d been told. So when Gabriel came into his life, it was a welcome respite. He couldn’t help Sara, he could at least do something for this partially-blind teenager. The way Gabriel described it to him, it sounded more like a hallucination than a dream. What would you think if someone told you their ex-lover tortured them in their dream? Every night? He had no business getting involved in Gabriel’s life. He cursed himself for doing it anyway. After all, he’d been warned to keep his distance from him.  What’s done can’t be undone. Right now, he can only hope. Hope to hear his voice again. His hands and legs can stay tied up, but he’ll go insane if he doesn’t hear his voice again.",
