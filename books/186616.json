  "description": "A Gypsy Brothers Epilogue \nThey say a human being needs few things to exist. A purpose, Hope for the future, But most of all... Love.\n Juliette Portland had all of those things. Her purpose was simple: Seduce. Deceive. Kill. Avenge. Once Dornan Ross and his sons were dead, her future was supposed to be clear. Her life was finally going to begin. And love... Against all the odds, she had the love of a boy she never thought she'd see again. Everything should have gone according to plan. Everything should have been easy. Of course, life has a way of f*****g with even the most meticulous of plans, and calling in owed debts can have the most severe consequences. Thanks to Juliette's diabolical retribution, the Il Sangue Cartel has lost it’s Kingpin, but not for long. There’s always someone in the wings, ready to step onstage and seize power. The Gypsy Brothers Motorcycle Club might be reeling from the deaths of their President and his six patch-wearing sons, but they’ve come back swinging. Two deadly enemies, hundreds of bloodthirsty members, both sides eager to punish those that would try to topple them. Two survivors, a man and a woman, forced to flee in the night. For Juliette, vengeance is a hollow victory. It never, ever ends. The flames of incomplete vengeance are licking at her heels, and it’s only a matter of time before the Il Sangue cartel and the Gypsy Brothers catch her in their grip and crush her. Unless she crushes them first.",
