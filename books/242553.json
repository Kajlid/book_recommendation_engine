But on the morning of her 39th birthday, Jane wakes up to the reality that she is a single CPA, living alone with her dog in small town Ontario. Acutely aware that she has hit the snooze button on her biological clock one too many times, Jane gives herself a deadline of one year to find her soul mate and change the course of her life.Can Jane find the man of her dreams before its too late?With humour and sensitivity, Love Ledgers tackles the age old question - do we reach a point in our lives where we must accept the cards that fate has dealt us, or is it never too late to become who we might have been.“An engaging entry into a popular literary genre, Love Ledgers is reminiscent of Bridget Jones's Diary and Sex and the City. Believable and spirited, Lukey’s novel delivers an enjoyable read.” – BlueInk Review“Lukey excels at environmental descriptions and scene setting… her dialogue is consistently funny.” – Kirkus Reviews",
