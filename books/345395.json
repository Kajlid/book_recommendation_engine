  "description": "Fire and Ice, the first Liam Campbell mystery, was named by Library Journal as Best Mystery of 1998. Now Campbell is back to uncover the icy heart of a deadly family secret....Three relatively-quiet months have passed since Trooper Liam Campbell was assigned to the remote post of Newenham. It all changes when a local fishing boat is discovered scuttled and adrift—its crew of seven dead in circumstances that can't be accidental—and Wy stumbles into a murder scene at an archaeological dig. Cultures collide as the community must deal with too many outside distractions.",
