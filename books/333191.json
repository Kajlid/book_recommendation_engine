  "description": "“If I were a killer, would it matter?” His mouth was closer than I expected as he dipped his head. I gasped, and he ran his nose against mine. “No, it wouldn’t,” I breathed like a twisted confession.On my flight home, a handsome stranger generously upgraded my coach ticket to business class under the pretense we pretend to be married.No problem. How was I to know we were headed for the same destination - a murder mystery dinner where I'd have to make-out with someone who'd paid big bucks for seven minutes in heaven with me.Was he the guy I had to kiss?Or the killer?Maybe both?",
