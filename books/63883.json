  "title": "Dr. Seuss: The Cat Behind the Hat",
  "description": "This exquisitely produced collector’s edition redefines Dr. Seuss as an iconic American artist. Illustrator by day, surrealist by night, Dr. Seuss created a body of little-known work that he called his “Midnight Paintings.” For sixty years, this work allowed Geisel to expand his artistic boundaries outside the confines of commercial influences and deadlines.A handsome slipcase holds the cloth-covered edition of The Cat Behind the Hat, along with four lithographs ready for framing. The book exuberantly juxtaposes Geisel’s “Midnight Paintings” with his best-loved children’s books. Though he fiercely protected his “Midnight Paintings” from criticism during his lifetime, his intention all along was for these works to be seen when he was gone. This comprehensive look at the art that he created over his lifetime is an eye-opening peek behind the public persona into the real story of the man who was Dr. Seuss.",
