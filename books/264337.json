  "description": "I was reunited with Livingston Montgomery in the broad sunshine of a Carolina morning, right where she belonged; in the light.    It’d been too long since I’d seen her face. She had changed, but so had I.   I was Adam Nova, reformed bad boy.  Now, successful business man.   I had it all, except for the one person I’d always wanted, and now I was back to claim her.   She was living in the shadows, just a shell of the former girl I knew.    But it didn’t matter that she tried to hide from me in the dark. I’d follow her into the deepest depths of hell. I just wanted to be In Her Space.",
