  "description": "“People, not even knowing who I was, have called me almost every derogatory name ever thought up—some were remarkably creative, but most simply relied on “bitch”—which was perfectly fine with me. Perhaps it was because I didn’t live my life trying to wring pleasure from others as some people did. Never. My whole life was based on contingency, so I was out for myself. Out for survival.”Welcome to Lake Hollow, a town with a secret that lies within its residents.After a rough and abusive upbringing, seventeen-year-old Lanx-Australis Sumner runs away from home to hide out in a town that was supposed to be a teen paradise, only to discover it was quite the opposite. When teens begin to disappear as they had the year before, she realizes there is something wrong and somebody is also after her. Things go from bad to worse as she valiantly struggles with both inner and outer conflicts that always seem on the verge of destroying her. The boys in town take an interest in Lanx, but can she find love after what she's been through?",
