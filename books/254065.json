  "description": "Here is a new collection of Lesléa Newman's fiction at its finest. In A Stone's Throw, two butch buddies become more than buddies, though neither of them will admit it. In Mothers of Invention, one woman in a relationship wants a child, but her partner won't learn the true meaning of compromise and commitment. And in Girls Will Be Boys , a straight woman-at least she thinks she's straight-discovers a shocking fact about her \"boyfriend.\" Whether the stories are serious, as in Keeping a Breast when a woman discovers a lump in her breast while making love, or hilarious, as in Flights of Fancy when a femme surprises herself by being attracted to another femme, She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not showcases Newman's talent for portraying the lesbian community in all its glory with compassion, wit, and heart. Marketing National The Advocate, Girlfriends, Sojourner, The Lesbian Review of Books Advance Reader Copies Author Boston, Amherst, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, San Francisco, Los Angeles Lesléa Newman has written and edited more than 20 books. Four of her books have been Lambda Literary Award finalists.",
