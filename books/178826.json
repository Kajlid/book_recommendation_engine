  "description": "The second book in the series that readers call \"absolutely epic\" with a \"phenomenal plot\" that makes for a \"gripping read.\"   Book #2 in the They Who Fell Series  The tower is fallen, its residents scattered or dead. A mob of human refugees swarm the city, tossed into a world they haven’t seen in years, and one Jana knows only from distant memories as a child. The ones who tore down her home would have her flee to safety, and to abandon her need to find Rhamiel and know what became of him. But the strike against the angels has returned them to their martial ways, and an army is reforming under the banner of Uzziel with the goal of eliminating any threats to the Seraphim forever. And other castes of angels have agendas of their own, eager to fill the vacuum left by the tower’s collapse.  Scroll up and click the buy button to read more, or read for free on Kindle Unlimited.",
