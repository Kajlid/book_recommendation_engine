  "description": "Divorced Francine was a young virgin when she had met her ex husband and twenty years of a cold, controlling marriage had not awoken any arousal to sensual, naked passionâ€¦. Believing that sex is overrated, she cannot understand what all the fuss is about. Concentrating on her future, she craves a different life that will make her feel alive and set her soul on fire. Now free to pursue her dreams, an unexpected change of fortune takes her into a new world, where the last thing on her list is a man, love, or complete sexual bliss.",
