  "description": "Born to the vivid heat and unyielding sunlight of Phoenix, Ray dives into her pool and surfaces in a cold lake. There is no sun in Qol. She has no family. Ray has never existed--only Laenyn. Or so the mad scientist claims. But her younger sister, older and yet smaller than she ought to be, seems to remember their life rather differently...In the world of Rewritten, information is hoarded. Any false move or lapse of judgment could have dreadful ramifications. Each character has their own lies to tell and secrets to keep, and the struggle to cooperate despite drastic differences in their own perceptions of their world and situation sends every one of them into danger.",
