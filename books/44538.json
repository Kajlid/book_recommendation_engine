  "description": "Thanks to the prodding of sassy Manhattanite Janna Abraham, the Virtual Moms allow North Carolina stay-at-home parent and romance novelist Asheley MacDaniel, entree into their club. A recent Iraq War widow and alone with an adorable young son, Ashe proves a sympathetic figure. Although some of members initially balk, Ashe fits in easily -- perhaps too easily -- sharing valuable insights on the personal dramas of Missy and Laurel, while gaining strong rapport with Ally and Skye.Skeptical Celia is not as easily swayed as her friends. Who is this Asheley MacDaniel, and why are the VMs in virtual love with this newbie? Why is Ashe so secretive, and why won't she email photos of herself and her five-year-old? And who was the stranger who answered the phone when Celia called?Ashe has a secret, all right, one that the girls do not learn until near the end of the book. Just as Ashe lands a book deal, Celia has enlisted the services of a private investigator and the truth now lies in an envelope in her hands. But before the truth can be told, Ashe decides to make the long drive from North Carolina to New York City to bear all to Janna in person, even as the revelation could cost dearly.Includes Questions for Discussion",
