  "description": "My goals for college were pretty simple: Get an education. Meet some new friends. Enjoy the mountains of Colorado. If I was lucky, find a boyfriend. Pretty sure they did not include being stalked by a magical black market. Or having multiple boyfriends. I mean, come on. What are the odds?Unfortunately, my birth parents were mages that left me orphaned at a young age. Instead of growing up surrounded by spells and magic, I grew up with normal humans. The world might know about magic, but that didn't mean they accepted it. Mages have no rights, and my foster parents tried to stamp out the tiny bit of magic I held on to. Notice I used the word tried? I manage to sneak in a few things here and there. The perfect temperature pizza? Not a problem. And I've never had a bad hair day in my life. Don't even get me started on red lightsâ€¦But it was those little things that put me on the black market's radar. An untrained mage with little knowledge of the magical world was easy pickings. Now, the only thing standing between me and a whole lot of unpleasantness is the pack of hot werewolves that made me theirs.This book is intended for mature audiences. 18+ readers only! It contains language and sexual situations. This is a medium burn reverse harem where the girl gets all the guys. Why Choose? Harem members added as series progresses. Series will contain some mild M/M scenes.",
