However, his mother has always been stubborn, and despite his objections, she’s insistent: it’s Adelaide Samson she wants him to hire.After losing her job, Adelaide needs a new gig to continue supporting her family, even if that means working for overprotective and rude Matthias. Once she earns his trust, though, she gets to see a whole other side of him—a funny, sweet, and sensitive side. A side she might start to like.Feelings take hold, but soon, Adelaide must choose between helping Helen with a secret task or being honest with Matthias. Caught between the woman who feels like a second mother and the man she’s falling for, Adelaide must navigate the murky waters of a job that has started to feel like home.",
