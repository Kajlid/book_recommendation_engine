  "description": "CURRENTLY FREE ON AMAZON  A notorious cult has held Kate Fox captive for far too long. Wickedness resides within the pews, forcing Kate to make a mad dash from the compound and into a life of normalcy, but darkness follows even the most deceitful runaway. While Kate is able to outrun the assemblage, fate is not so easily fooled. ******I was the child who scampered across open cotton fields, sporting grass-stained knees and a wicked smirk, crossing the threshold just in time for supper. I was the granddaughter who played hangman on the back of the church program every Sunday, who snuck spoonfuls of buttercream frosting right out of the mixer when Grams wasnâ€™t paying attention. I was the frightened girl who extended her trembling hand to a stranger and never saw home again. I was the member of the notorious Blood of Christ Baptist Church who became the target for cruelty and sinister ritual. I was the daughter of the damned, the collection of ragged breaths wedged between the shadows of ancient lore and an uncertain destiny, and the possessor of a darkness more depraved than any of my enemies. I was the lethal cocktail of untapped power and willful ignorance, who untethered herself from the pious ties of Brushy Fork, Kentucky, to plunge head-first into a life of normalcy. And I was the fool who believed she could outrun fate.***Kate Fox and the Three Kings is a new adult, paranormal thriller and the first book in a three-part series****",
