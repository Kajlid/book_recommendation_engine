  "title": "Oneless Oneness: Tao as an Existential Remedy",
  "description": "The world’s shortest (but not easiest) rational guide to everyday nondual awareness.Enlightenment is the ultimate self-help because it helps you realize that the self does not exist. What looks absurd and disturbing at first can grow into inspirational insight. Oneless Oneness is a fresh look at ancient Zen philosophy—not for the dogmatic, ideological, or faint-hearted, but for rational minds willing to question deeply ingrained beliefs.•\tDo you wonder what the Zen masters mean by enlightenment?•\tWould you like to enjoy the benefits of enlightenment too?•\tDid you know that you don’t have to meditate to awaken to Tao? You only need an open mind—and a book like this.Inspired by the Zen sages and based on his own experience, the author—a trained engineer—demystifies the key insights into nonduality. In a condensed, aphoristic style, he explains how nondual awareness can help us deal with all-too-human issues: from guilt, regrets, and compulsion, to forgiveness, mindful enjoyment, and matters of the heart.Discover how Tao’s culture-transcending truth reconciles Eastern spirituality with Western rationalist philosophy. Oneless Oneness is a philosophical manifesto and guide in one. Pithy and outside the box, it connects the dots for thinkers and seekers alike.",
