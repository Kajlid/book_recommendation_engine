  "description": "Save Haley. Find Peregrine. Kill Feodor.Joshlyn Weaver has a list, and she’s going to check off every item or die trying. She needs to save Haley from the Death universe, hunt down her scheming grandfather, and force Feodor to return the souls he stole. Will would help her—if she’d let him. But since healing the broken bonds between them isn’t on her list, he’ll have to prepare to meet Peregrine on his own, and his investigation leads him to the dream-walker community’s strangest corners. When the Veil separating the Dream from the World begins breaking down, Josh and Will have to come together to stop Peregrine from destroying the balance between the three universes—and they’ll need Feodor’s help, which always comes with a price. With the three universes collapsing into one another, Josh must decide who she is and who she can trust in time to save the World, herself, and everyone she loves.",
