I hold the key to my pleasure and I'll be damned if I ever give it up again. God forsake those that stand in my way of ultimate gratification.You may regret me, but you'll never forget me. Use or Be Used, there are no other options.** Warning ** 18 years and up for adult situations, language, sexual content, and violence. * This story contains dirty words, dirty sex and an even dirtier twist. **",
