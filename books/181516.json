  "description": "What you can't say - owns you. What you hide - controls you.Scarlet knows the truth of these words all too well. As the stress of a family wedding builds, her resolve to be a #GoodDaughter wears thin and toxic truths begin to take their toll. Scarlet's epic humor carries her through everything from (more!) forbidden croquembouche, to uku infestations and melon-like wardrobe malfunctions, and more of her family's barbed idea of love. Sometimes you just have to laugh through life's pain, or else you'll cry your heart out. Right? Can Jackson be the strength that helps Scarlet break through the lies? Or will her secrets destroy them?Experience the tropical heat, humor and heartache that is Scarlet's trip home to Samoa. Do not read unless you can handle scorching scenes that contain passion (fruit) at the plantation, too much dessert and lots of (Jackson's) caramel deliciousness. For mature audiences only. Contains reference to childhood abuse and trauma, and discussion of associated topics.",
