And he, too, burns for this rare, radiant jewel who can never be his, for she is promised to his closest friend.But the bayou moon can work many strange sorceries—compelling even a rational young man to take irrational risks...as it strengthens his resolve to win an enchantress's restless heart with passion, determination, and a cup of voodoo magic.",
