  "description": "Henri Dunn was damn good at being a vampire until her immortality was forcibly ripped away from her. Six months ago, Henri was made into an unwilling test subject for serum V-504: The Immortality Cure. Now, after almost a century of being an immortal monster, Henri is human again and she’s not loving it: her body aches, she has too many mortal needs, and the other vampires shun her as a Blood Traitor. All she can do is keep her head down and bide her time until she can find a way to get her immortality back.When vials of the serum are stolen from the lab and a vampire is murdered, Henri is the first person the vampires suspect. With the help of a melodramatic vampire “king” and his mortal groupie, Henri must find the real killer to clear her name or be executed for a crime she didn’t commit. The Immortality Cure is the first book in the Henri Dunn series.",
