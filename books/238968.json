  "description": "Two things I love are the company I built from the ground up and women, and not particularly in that order.When I see something I want, I get it, whether it’s a new client or a wild night in the sack.Women flock to my stock, and ladies, that’s not all they enjoy.I’m not labeled as one of Denver’s top playboys for nothing. I’m damn good-looking, my pockets are deep, and my “endowments” leave women begging for more.Two rules I live by:* Don’t mix business with pleasure.* Never, ever date an employee.I thought I had it all in check until Zoey Campbell started working for me.All my rules? Disintegrated.Because rules are meant to be broken.And great sex is meant to be had.Easton Langley is a manwhore.I knew his reputation before I applied for the job.But none of the rumors about him mattered because my focus was on my career.And I’m smart enough not to fall for his sexy charm.Or so I thought.He’s so insanely good-looking and smooth with his words, I can’t help but be distracted whenever he’s around. Fantasizing about the boss is inappropriate.Sleeping with him would be crossing the line.One night. That’s all it took.And going back to the way it was isn’t an option.The worst part about it?I’ve fallen for him.When a late night in the office shatters every rule, Easton and Zoey find themselves breaking all the boundaries.",
