  "description": "The Witch’s Get tells the story of a healer; a woman who talks to plants, discerns illnesses by smell, and whose hands guide babies as they come into being. She lives in a time when it is not safe to be a woman, especially one who has been given the gift of healing. Mancy has hidden herself away from the world, determined to avoid the fate that has befallen so many women before her—being accused of witchcraft. But, when a wounded stranger is left in her care, she cannot suppress her nurturing instincts. As she cares for him, bringing him back to health, slowly she finds her own heart being healed as well.",
