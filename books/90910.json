  "description": "Fifteen year-old Lily shape-shifts into a boy to get THE girl. Chaos ensues from pretending to be someone she's not. While coming to terms with who she really is and what she's done, Lily learns that life as a boy is just as difficult.\"A truly thrilling graphic novel.\" - Gail Simone \"Flutter is one of the year's best LGBT graphic novels.\" - Jacob Anderson-Minshall, The Advocate \"I'm telling you all to read Flutter. This might just be the most unique comic book I have read since...well, I honestly can't remember because there's nothing to compare it to in my personal lexicon. The art by Jeff McComsey is incredible and suits the story perfectly with great color while Jennie Wood weaves one hell of a yarn.\"- Shawn Perry, Bleeding Cool",
