  "title": "The High King's Wife: Part One",
  "description": "Some people believe that if you kill yourself, you go to hell. When Joanna Messina tries to kill herself, rather than hell, she wakes up in a place that she’d have to be delusional to believe is real. In the Kingdom of Elin, wizards are a reality Joanna can’t avoid. They can use their magic to light a candle with a flick of their fingers, or just as easily summon an army of demon possessed zombies to try to kill her. All she wants is to find a way back home to where she belongs. Instead, she finds herself forced into marrying Elin’s High King, Ruarc Trevelian, an almost, but not quite wizard and third son that was never meant to be King, and who has had visions of Joanna and of her world for nearly his entire life. Surviving in this strange place is more dangerous than Joanna could ever have imagined in her worst nightmare, and the more deeply entangled she becomes in Ruarc’s life and his struggle to protect the kingdom he rules, the more desperate she is to escape from Elin. While some will never let her leave, others will stop at nothing to see her dead.",
