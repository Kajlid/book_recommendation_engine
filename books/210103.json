  "description": "Nicola was never a hero. She was an everyday single mother, Heathen witch, and herbalist. And she was happy with her quiet life until the night Joseph showed up at her door with news that her step-sister joined a cultâ€¦ and disappeared. Pressured by family loyalties, Nicola goes back to Indianapolis, dodging old enemies and calling on old friends to help her. What she finds instead are an ex with super-powers, monsters and demigods on the streets, and a detective ready to bring her in for a murder investigation or three. Can Nicola become the hero she needs to be, or will she lose everyone she cares for?",
