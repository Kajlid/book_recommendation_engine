A unique and engaging plot that is both thoughtful and evocative. It is an enjoyable read overall and is definitely recommended.\"The Future Fire Reviews, March 2014\"The background and setting of the story was amazing in itself and I really wish Naviras really existed. This book made me think, instead of just doing the thinking for me and throwing theories out all over the pages.\"Bookish Love, March 2014",
