This can be difficult for a perpetual klutz, who—even strapped in a cast—has to uphold a competent attitude at all times.Luckily, she has Dr. Colin Calaway on her side, a widower and father of a student, who is ready to give love another try. When Colin convinces Hope they should explore the connection between them, a steamy romance develops, though it could destroy them both. They must decide if their jobs—and their hearts—are worth the risk.",
