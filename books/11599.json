  "description": "They say these are the best years of your life. That you can never get them back. Well with tempting teaching fellows, b****-tastic roommates and secret societies, you might just want to survive. Enter Caspian University where school work is the least of your worries and you better hope you’re not the collateral damage in someone else's drama. In their first semester at CU, follow Beth and Judith, the made-in-hell roomie combo, as they navigate boys, school, v-cards and crazy – sometimes evil – friends. One semester: oh-so-much fun. And the best part is: it’s only just begun.Cheers! And GL!Author Note: Get your FREE Copy today at Amazon!http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AFKU1EU",
