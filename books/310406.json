In Tartarus staying hidden means protection from the violent males outside of their Wald. Ronald Günther has grand designs for the broad streets, electrical power, steel production, and efficiency of manufacture. Ronald Günther learns how Tartarus received its name in this Dystopian novel set-in North-Eastern Pennsylvania. Over the Hill and Through the Woods follows Ronald Günther 's fight toward homes' return, then his return back to Tartarus. Does he find love in the process? Maybe even his grandmother? OVER THE HILL AND THROUGH THE WOODS is a great mix of dark humor, trajedy, irony, and yes, in the end, even romance.",
