  "description": "Broken trust, broken hearts, and a twist of fate that could change everything.\nSierra McCain has her life figured out with a fabulous job in New York City and a perfect boyfriend who is the modern-day equivalent of Jane Austen's Mr. Darcy. The type of guy Sierra always wanted to find. Then, a frantic call from an old friend sends her rushing back to South Carolina where she comes face to face with the very guy she's spent the past seven years trying to forget--Dalton Chandler whose slow, Southern smile unleashes an army of butterflies in her stomach and sends her heart into flips. Under no circumstance can she fall for him again, and she certainly can't tell him her long-kept secret.\nCaught between two worlds and two very different men, Sierra must decide which love she'll choose – Mr. Perfect or Mr. Right.",
