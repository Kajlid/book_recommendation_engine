  "description": "Winning the lottery:\t$70 millionMending family relationships:\tPricelessWhen James Bay journalist Lucy Carter wins the lottery, good fortune seems guaranteed. But even $70 million in cold hard cash can’t help Lucy when it comes to dealing with some cold hard facts. No amount of money will buy back Grandma's mind nor buy Lucy a reprieve from a strained mother/daughter relationship. After a twenty year absence, Lila’s suddenly back in town. Lila says she’s moved to James Bay to keep an eye out for her daughter Lucy… or is it Lucy's money that Lila has her eye on instead? When an auto accident forces mother and daughter together to live under one roof, even a luxurious 4,000 square foot condo seems like a tiny bungalow, and Lucy suddenly has her hands full with a whole new set of problems she never expected.",
