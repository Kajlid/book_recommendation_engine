  "description": "The Scallywags are a pack of wolves. When they aren't being lazy and shiftless, they spend the day jumping around and clowning around and getting into all kinds of mischief. They make a lot of noise and throw their food around and make general nuisances of themselves. They annoy all the other animals and show the entire world that they simply don't know how to behave. But after one particularly rowdy episode, the Scallywags learn that if being rowdy means losing your friends, maybe it's time to start practicing some manners. Very funny color illustrations on every page.",
