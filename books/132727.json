But when her oddly hypnotic foe proposes a pact to kill the Siren Queen and end the War of the Sea's bloodshed, she must make a choice.

What will she choose?Captain Rylander Bordeaux, the revered royal navy captain of the Isle of Cava, has one mission—kill the Siren Queen and end the War of the Sea. The ocean is the only place Rylander calls home, but to bring peace to his beloved waves, he must defeat his past so he can reshape the future. His greatest hope is Captain Elouise, who calls to him like no siren song ever has. Too bad she's almost as bloodthirsty as the fanged heart-eaters themselves.She promises to lend her all-female crew to his war on the sirens, but can he trust a brigand—especially one who wants him dead—to uphold her end of the bargain? Or will she be his undoing?",
