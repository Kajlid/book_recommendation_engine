  "description": "He knew what it was like to be a commodity, bought and sold by those who should have protected him.  Billionaire Davis Lucas did his best to stop the people like the ones who hurt him. He had it all now, but he'd never forgotten what it was like to have nothing, and to be a victim. He'd worked for eight years to keep others from being victimized, too.  Dr. Payton Asher was the kind of woman only a worthy man dreamed about. She was good, innocent, and beautiful.  She had no business showing up at his home well past the time good girls should be in bed...  Payton stumbled right in to Luc's dark secret, leaving him no choice but to protect her at any cost. Even if the greatest cost was to his heart...  REDEEMING is Book 7 in the FBI Romantic Suspense Series. Other titles  WATCHING WANTING Second Chances (RECKONING & REUNITING) HUNTING RUNNING",
