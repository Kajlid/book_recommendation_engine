  "description": "Vengeful. Telepath. Mastermind.\n  Frederick d’Arcy is determined to uncover the truth of his mother’s untimely death, so when he finally locates his missing brother Quentin – the only potential witness – he drops everything and travels to San Diego, but Quentin is embroiled in a different mystery, and Frederick finds himself sucked into a world more dangerous than he likes.  \nDealer. Loser. Pessimist.\n  Mikey Brennan is an absentee in his own life. He always thought dealing in whatever his customers wanted to buy would make him a rich man, but instead he’s working real hard just to stay still. When he’s kidnapped by a hot British guy who only sees him as a plaything, Mikey must choose whether that’s better than going back to his own miserable existence.  \nDivided we stand.\n  With Kane Wilson threatening to out psychics across the city and endangering anyone who gets close, a deadly game of cat and mouse plays out as Frederick manipulates events toward the retribution he seeks. But in plucking Mikey off the street, he may just have found something better than revenge. Maybe even something worth fighting for…  Reeve of Veils is the fourth book in the Rainbow Award winning Inheritance series and contains mature themes and events which may be distressing to some readers. It has a medium heat rating and a cliffhanger ending.",
