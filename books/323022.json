But when that loss is compounded in each minute of every day, what do we do then? Slings and Arrows is a story about the consequences of a moment, a moment, which separates a mother and daughter in ways impossible to imagine.It charts their parallel lives, each suffering, one knowing, one not.It is brutally honest; an account filled with bewilderment, guilt, anger and pain yet it also holds the key to hope. That whatever happens, the bonds of love can never be broken.",
