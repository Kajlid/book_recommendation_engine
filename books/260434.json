  "description": "What Nazi Germany did to the Jews did not happen over night. The foundation for it was built in German culture over the centuries, arguably started by the writings and deeds of perhaps the most influential reformer of the millennium, Martin Luther. This screenplay is a journey through his life to give us insights of how a movement, no matter how pure in its intention, could go terribly wrong.",
