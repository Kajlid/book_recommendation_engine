  "description": "When architect Meredith Reed inherits her family's plantation after the devastating loss of her own family, she has to choose how to move on with her life. Keep it? Not a good idea. Sell it? Better. Turn it into a memorial park? Better yet. But can she go against her family traditions and the hunky but irate lawyer?Max Chandler needs two things to complete his life plan: become a senior partner and find his soul mate. He's due a promotion once his legislation to protect the county's historic properties is approved. The wife part he finds more challenging, having never met the right woman. If only the talented, attractive, aloof Meredith didn't want to destroy the very property he's grown to cherish.While Meredith struggles to reconcile her past and future, she learns a lesson from the spectral Lady in Blue that may save both her family and home from destruction.(Updated and revised edition; originally published in 2014 as Traces.)",
