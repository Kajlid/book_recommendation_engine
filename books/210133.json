  "description": "Combined for the first time in one volume, here are the first three books in the internationally bestselling CLOAK GAMES series - CLOAK THIEF TRAP, CLOAK FROST FEVER, and CLOAK REBEL FIST, and the bonus short story WRAITH WOLF. The High Queen of the Elves has conquered Earth, but I don't care about that. I don't care about the High Queen, or the Rebels seeking to overthrow her. All I care about is getting my baby brother the treatments he needs to recover from his potentially fatal disease…and those treatments have a steep price. Fortunately, I have magic of my own, and I'm a very, very good thief. Unfortunately, the powerful Elven lord Morvilind has a hold over me. If I don't follow his commands, my brother is going to die. Of course, given how dangerous Morvilind’s missions are, I might not live long enough to see my brother’s death…",
