The book investigates how these symbols, along with the sounds associated with them, represent more than mere writing—they are frequencies that hold spiritual and metaphysical power. The symbols of the Vinča culture, along with other ancient alphabets like Cyrillic and Ancient Greek, are explored as vibrational tools that connect humans to higher realms of consciousness.The narrative also touches on Herodotus’ accounts of the Slavs, the ancient Greek philosopher’s descriptions of the mysterious culture and language of the Slavic peoples, and how their ritualistic practices were deeply connected to the metaphysical properties of sound. Pantović further explores the Derveni Papyrus—an ancient Greek text revealing Orphic rituals that used sacred chants and symbols to invoke divine powers and bring spiritual awakening.Exploring the Interconnectedness of Ancient European Cultures Pantović’s book also explores the cultural and historical connections between various European civilizations, especially Roman, Greek, Slavic, and Balkan cultures. By examining the development of Cyrillic, Greek, and Ionic alphabets, Pantović illustrates how written symbols not only served as communication tools but also as vibrational frequencies that carried spiritual significance. These ancient scripts, with their distinct sounds and symbols, were believed to contain the essence of the divine and held the key to spiritual and metaphysical truths.\"Metaphysics of Sound in Search of the Name of God\" is an intricate and thought-provoking exploration of sound as a metaphysical force, deeply tied to spiritual awakening and the understanding of the divine. Pantović combines historical research, philosophical insights, and mystical teachings to create a narrative that reveals the profound connection between sound, vibration, and the universe’s deeper truths. Through a dialogue between ancient cultures and their sacred practices, the book provides a unique perspective on how sound has been used throughout history to elevate consciousness, connect with the divine, and ultimately, search for the Name of God.",
