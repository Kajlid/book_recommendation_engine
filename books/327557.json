  "description": "We’re going to wreck you, little one. Mercy Moseley needs to pay for messing with the wrong men. The only issue is, Mercy Moseley is dead. She took everything, and then she abandoned us. She’s left behind her frail little sister. Homeless. Heartbroken. A little sister that should be left alone to grieve her loss. But we’re impatient men, and in our world, time is money. Loulou Moseley is young, innocent, and naïve. She’s the perfect victim for our madness. We live a depraved life in front of the cameras. Our twisted world revolves around pleasure, living out the filthy fantasies of the masses. Many wish for a life like ours, the sex, the money… But at what cost? Daily, we sell our souls. We’re the best at our job, and so was Mercy Moseley. She was our leading actress, and now, she’s gone. And her innocent little sister?She’s about to replace her. \nThis is a reverse harem story. This is not a safe love story. This is dark romance. Subjects of suicide, cheating, degradation, humiliation, exhibitionism, voyeurism, parental neglect, physical abuse, sex work, and more will be touched upon.",
