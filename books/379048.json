  "description": "\"You are deluded, Romeo. Vampires do not have the capability to love. They are heartless.\"The Capulets and the Montagues have some deep and essential differences. Blood differences. Of course, the Capulets can escape their vampire fate, and the Montagues can try not to kill their undead enemies. But at the end of the day, their blood feud is unstoppable. So it's really quite a problem when Juliet, a vampire-to-be, and Romeo, the human who should be hunting her, fall desperately in love. What they don't realize is how deadly their love will turn out to beâ€”or what it will mean for their afterlives. . . .This riotous twist on the ultimate tale of forbidden romance is simply to die for.",
