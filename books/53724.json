  "description": "Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche is a meditation master in the Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. In his latest book, Traleg Rinpoche discusses the Mahamudra meditation method of self-liberation by systematically taking us through the methods of shamatha (tranquility) and vipashyana (insight) meditation. He explains how to work with discursive thoughts and conflicting emotions with shamatha meditation and gain insight into these with vipashyana meditation. This book provides a comprehensive coverage of the Mahamudra view of the nature of mind.",
