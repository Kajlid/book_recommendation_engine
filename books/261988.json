  "description": "After the Battle at the Anvil, the Riders and Dragons of Dumnonia are on the verge of extinction. It takes too long to raise and train a Dragon and too long to qualify someone to be a Rider. Even to go down fighting they need to break most of their laws and traditions.  Shashtah’s unpredictable magic has another plan. When he inadvertently channels the fertility magic of the Mother, he causes every Breeding Female Dragon and Dumnonian to become pregnant, including his Prophetess, Tphah. With no way to raise that many children and Hatchlings in the desert, Shashtah turns to the most powerful Wizard on Centuria, the White Wolf, for help.  The White Wolf uses Time Magic to give Shashtah and his fellow Dragonlord, Kashon, enough time to raise the next generation of Dumnonians and Dragons in a magical room. They quickly discover, however, that they have made yet another terrible mistake as they try to raise Children of the Desert in a landscape designed for wolves with only the Dragon voices in Shashtah’s head to guide them.",
