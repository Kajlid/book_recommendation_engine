There, a park ranger disappears in connection with the dangerous effects that now follow them wherever they go, and through a spectacular scene they are presented with a strange inscription that accelerates their search for answers. They encounter many strange characters, and discover one of three mysteriously powerful amulet pieces that seem to be the source of everything that is happening.Now, Bill, Dave, and a crazy archaeologist are also the targets of cultist zealots who seek to possess and assemble all three pieces of the amulet, and wield the power within them -- and the cultists are willing to kill to get what they want.
