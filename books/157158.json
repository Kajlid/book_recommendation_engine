  "description": "Deep in the Arctic, the US Coast Guard icebreaker Terra Nova batters its way through the frozen sea. A gaunt figure skis out of the fog on the pack ice. He says his name is Thomas Anderson, and that he's the lone survivor of a terrible accident at the research outpost Zodiac Station, located on the ice-bound island of Utgard.Ten days earlier: Tom Anderson arrives at Zodiac Station looking to resurrect a career destroyed by scientific scandal. But things quickly go wrong when the man who hired him, brilliant biochemist Martin Hagger, turns up dead at the bottom of a crevasse. The base commander insists he fell. But footprints in the snow suggest a different possibility.As Anderson tells his tale of sabotage, suspicion, and paranoia, the mystery only deepens. Then other survivors are discoveredâ€”adding their stories of human greed, jealousy, oil company trickery, Russian espionage, and global warming. But the truth is something no one on the Terra Nova could have imagined.A fast-paced, gripping thriller that marries science and adventure, Zodiac Station is as chilling and unpredictable as the fierce Arctic landscape.",
