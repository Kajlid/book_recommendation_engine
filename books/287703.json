  "description": "THEY KNOW YOUR NAME! Voices are calling us--voices without an attached form. Encounters with these disembodied voices warn us, haunt us, confuse us, inspire us . . . and scare us. For good reason . . . Explore spine-chilling, true stories from investigations and real occurrences throughout history that expose disembodied voices. Objectively and thoroughly presented, the evidence and theories shine light on possible reasons and agendas for these voices and where they might originate. Gain insight into what they are and what we may be able to learn from them. Sometimes they inspire great acts; other times they lead us astray. Are they forgotten woodland deities? Is it an ancient evil from the days of Eden? Is there a single intelligence behind them all . . . or perhaps we shouldn't look too deeply . . . or else . . . Famous reports from history as well as never-before-published reports of disembodied voices from the everyday lives of common people are discussed. But what about you? When the voices call, will you answer? Hair-raising conclusions found here will make you think twice.",
