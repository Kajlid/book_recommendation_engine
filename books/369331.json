Following the life of the duty-bound but passionless Soames Forsyte, stuck in an unhappy marriage with his quick-witted and sensitive wife Irene, his domineering uncle Old Jolyon, and his libertine cousin Young Jolyon, it exposes fully the realities of Victorian society of the day. The sympathetic and evocative picture it paints has made this trilogy.a classic.A Modern Comedy takes up where the Forsyte Saga leaves off, following the lives of the next generation of Forsytes: Jon Forsyte and Fleur Mont, living with the legacy of their parents misadventures. Written after \"the great earthquake\", as Galsworthy puts it, of World War I, the second Forsyte trilogy speaks of the changes in British society of the 1920s, depicted through the prism of the Forsyte family.The End of the Chapter is the third trilogy in the series, continuing the story of the Forsytes as the old Victorian society declines further under the onslaught of the Edwardian era.This material was NOT merely scanned from an ink-and-paper book, like many Kindle e-books are.
