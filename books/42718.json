  "description": "* This is the Adult version of the Teen personalized novel, \"Black Lace\".In Dark Embrace, our steadfast hero is a gifted Shadow Ward, responsible for tracking lost souls and leading them to their eternal rest—a peace denied them during life. His instincts fail when he’s drawn into the home of a lovely but lethal woman who immediately binds him to her with an unbreakable strand of black lace. Believing her to be a sorceress, he vows to escape before this evil creature leads him to his doom—but when his daring race for freedom nearly turns tragic, he realizes his captor’s true nature. She is a vampire of souls, destined to feed on a human’s life force. As much a victim as he, our heroine will die without him. As they accept their mutual dependence, they also slowly accept one another—and soon a sensual web of desire links them even more powerfully than the black lace itself. Despite their friends’ doubts, the couple fall in love—until their dark pasts emerge. What terrifying secret connects them? And will it lead to their salvation...or their destruction?",
