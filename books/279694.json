  "description": "College parties, beer, and one-night stands—that was my life.Now, I hunt criminals. Drinking and women are still included, though I can’t seem to forget the underage girl who almost gave me her virginity. I stopped it before it happened and kicked her out.Years later, we’re reunited. She’s no longer underage but still equally off-limits. After ignoring her relentless advances, she wears me down. I only have so much willpower when she’s around, which is all the damn time now that we’re roommates. Just when my restraint starts to crumble, my poor choices finally catch up with me, putting us both in danger. There’s no easy way to explain why I betrayed her, but I’ll do whatever it takes to keep her safe—even if it means breaking her heart.ALWAYS MINE is book 1 in the Liam & Maddie duet and must be read first.",
