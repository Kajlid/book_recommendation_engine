  "description": "\"The story of how Morag MacLeod came to be called a witch is a queer one and not at all the sort of thing you would expect to happen nowadays. It was never proved, mind you, that she was a witch. Nobody has decided that to this day--but that is because they did not know about the kelpie's pearls. And it was the pearls, of course, that were the real cause of all the trouble.\"Morag had caused some very strange thing to happen the summer she met the kelpie by the pool. When greedy Alasdair the Trapper accuses Morag of being in league with water sprite, she is forced to take refuge in long-forgotten spells.This is the tale of how the quiet woman from the hills came to be called the Witch of Abriachan. But it is also the tale of Morag's touching friendship with Torquil, a lonely boy who possesses King Solomon's Ring and who is the only one to understand the reasons behind Morag's strange behavior.The Kelpie's Pearls is one of Mollie Hunter's favorite novels and we are delighted to be reissuing a story The Horn Book called \"so enchantingly told in the gentle dialect of the Highlands that it is a spellbinder from first to last.\"",
