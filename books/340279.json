  "description": "The New York Times–bestselling author and psychic Sylvia Browne encourages readers to call upon the power of their own personal energy and spiritual candlelight to help make their dreams realities. Through a series of spiritual exercises—with themes ranging from energy, health, and physical and emotional healing to protection, wealth, and wisdom—she outlines how to jump-start a personal–spiritual routine to increase spiritual energy, personal awareness, and a connection to God. This highly visual guide also explores the symbolic meaning of color and scent combinations, groupings, and inviting the spirits of loved ones, angels, and spirit guides through the use of candle and prayer.",
