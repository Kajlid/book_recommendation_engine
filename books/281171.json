  "description": "Sugarplums. They should be dancing in my head. But they aren’t. Why? Because I’m spending my Christmas Eve under the rule of the biggest Scrooge I know. My boss. Lincoln Maverick. He’s gorgeous. He’s a billionaire. And he’s an evil workaholic who demands his assistant works even longer than he does. I’m the fifth one he’s had this year, and I’m about to make him interview for his sixth. When the clock strikes twelve, my Christmas gift to myself is a resignation letter on his desk and the intention of walking my curvy behind out the door. The last reaction I expected from him was a relieved thank you. Now, there’s nothing standing in his way. Lincoln Maverick wants one thing this Christmas. Me...  Warning: this quick read contains over-the-top declarations, insta-love and molten hot moments between a curvy girl and her billionaire boss who deserves to be in the naughty list for the filth that comes out of his mouth. Luckily, his sweet and juicy sugarplum will balance him out.",
