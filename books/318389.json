But when I enter the Church on my wedding day, the grey eyes piercing mine aren’t my fiancé’s.They’re Declan’s, the last person I expect to show up with an offer of his own. One I can’t refuse even though my heart should know better than to accept.Will my marriage to Declan heal the broken between us? Or are we destined to repeat the mistakes of our past?",
