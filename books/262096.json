  "description": "Poignant, inspirational, and deeply moving, Folded Wisdom is a testament to the depth of a father’s love for his children. In this lavishly illustrated gift book, Joanna Guest shares the beautiful and insightful notes her father gave to her and her brother every day for nearly 15 years.For her entire childhood, Joanna’s father, an artist by training, had a morning ritual: wake up early, walk the dog, and sit down at the kitchen table with two blank sheets of paper and plenty of colored markers. On those pages, every morning, he would craft a note to young Joanna and her brother Theo. Over the years, these beautifully illustrated and heartwarming notes morphed from word games and puzzles for five-year-olds to thoughtful guidance, advice, and reflections for teens approaching adulthood. Each morning, without fail, her father would have a note waiting for his two children.Now, with more than 3,500 of her father’s colorful, vibrant, touching notes in hand, Joanna has chosen the most poignant and collected them into this beautiful book. With the illustrated notes throughout, the book is organized by themes such as forgiveness, love, friendship, teamwork, and more. These notes are full of messages we all need to hear. Heartfelt and full of possibility for the future, the notes are timeless and relevant reminders of our common humanity. They hold lessons that are easily applicable to each of our lives.",
