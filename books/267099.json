  "description": "Some folks with mid-life crises purchase cars, boats or fantasy trips. Haint Blue bought an old fish camp. Sexy, huh? She spent the rest of her inheritance fixing it up. The opening weekend arrives with odd guests, wildlife, bad weather and murder. Haint assists the local sheriff while side-stepping his advances. It seems the focus of the weekend, \"Finding Inner Peace\" is as elusive as the killer. She will have to use her Buddhist tenets to keep it cool despite the crisis, hot flashes and Florida heat.",
