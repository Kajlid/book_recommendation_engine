  "description": "In the distant future, Piers Haldon is the last, best hope for the Redemption : an interplanetary ark ship bringing settlers' to their new home. As the most powerful Empath the ship can spare, he is charged with a critical scout the planet and find a way for the ark to avoid catastrophe. Arriving a thousand years behind schedule, after a failure in the ship's time-drive, the rundown and overcrowded vessel can no longer support the settlers who have called it home for generations. But, on arrival, the time-traveling colonists realize all is not as it should be on the planet's surface. The settlers expected a technologically advanced civilization, and are shocked to discover a bygone feudal society of swords, blacksmiths, and horse-drawn carriages. Missing the vital technology that they so desperately need, they have no way to land. Piers must find others on the planet who share his psionic ability while navigating a dangerous world - one ruled by rebellious noble families on the brink of war. Finding the Empaths and channeling their collective psychic force is the only chance he has of guiding the ship to a safe landing. If he fails, those on ark ship will be doomed to a fiery end. Piers knows that he can't save the ark ship on his own, but, for the sake of the passengers on the Redemption he's willing to do what it takes, or die trying.",
