  "description": "University was supposed to be a time of exploration, of learning and new discoveries...  I probably should have guessed that my problems weren't just going to vanish because I was feeling optimistic.  The Fairy peoples have cut themselves off, taking important parts of me with them. A new threat emerges, wrapped in a righteousness that serves only to conceal a dreadful rot.  Demons start to circle, Black Magic grows in power and influence, and my old enemies are starting to band together in the service of a new darkness.  And if you think all that's not enough to be going on with, an old flame turns up, just to make sure that it all hurts as much as possible.  It's going to take luck, cunning and a colossal bagful of dirty tricks to get out of this one intact, and I'm pretty sure I spent all my luck the last time something tried to eat me...  Oh well; let's give it the old college try.",
