  "description": "Cece Graves has been running from her past for 27 years, but a deadly fire and a mysterious stalker set her past on a collision course with her future. She tries to ignore the danger and focus on expanding her cake business, but darkness closes in on her life. In her greatest time of need, only one man can convince her to face her past. Her resistance to love slowly wears away in the face of his steady friendship. As their relationship blossoms, her greatest fear is that his love for her will not survive the inferno. Shane Gregory has fallen hard for the one woman he knows he can never have. Common sense is against him, but he makes a play for her heart despite the seemingly insurmountable obstacles before him. He has dealt with enough heartache and tragedy in his own life to be one of the few people who understands her pain. Her fierce independence is one of the things he admires most about her, but he longs for the chance to prove to her that love doesn't have to be painful.",
