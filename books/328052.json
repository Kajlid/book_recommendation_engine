  "title": "Enchanted: The Faerie and Fantasy Art of Linda Ravenscroft",
  "description": "“I am often asked why I chose to paint faeries. The answer is—I didn’t, they chose me!”  For artist Linda Ravenscroft, capturing the fairy world on paper is nothing less than a calling. Enchanted is her third book devoted to these fantastical creatures, and it is her finest work yet. Linda has created images rich in detail and magic, able to transport viewers into mysterious other realms. In addition to the paintings, she reveals a little about her artistic approach…but generally lets the work speak for itself. A gorgeous gift book for fairy-lovers.",
