  "description": "When Blade Forges, a young man of eighteen, becomes aware of his prophecy, the Deathmaster, an evil entity from his childhood nightmares, comes to life with the intention of destroying the world around him. It is Blade's journey to solve clues and fight the memoires of his childhood which only bring him down. He receives help from the military and the Maxxes, a family of criminals. The only way to defeat the evil entity is to collect the three Xayvourouses (magical daggers) and to discover the source(s) of his weakness. The only problem is that he doesn't know where to begin. As Blade becomes lost in his deteriorating world and inner mind, you, the Reader, might as well get trapped too.",
