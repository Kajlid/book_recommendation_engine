  "title": "Meaningful Days: Developing Our View Of God And His Ways",
  "description": "\"Meaningless! Meaningless!\" says the Teacher. \"Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless.\"-Ecclesiastes 1:2We do not need a rebuttal to the Teacher's comment about everyday life (\"life under the sun\"), but we do need the proper perspective to understand his plea. Everything we seek and achieve and possess is indeed meaningless ... without a heart and mind set on Jesus Christ.Meaningful Days is a source for developing that intricate, yet simple heart and mind-set. It offers encouragement to stop and consider God's wonders and Word in all aspects of life-to have a wholly Christian worldview. For when the Bible is our lens for viewing life's norms, the meaningless-ness of them fully transforms; we see our ordinary, everyday life under the sun for what it truly is - the prelude in our extraordinary, exultant, eternal life in the Son.Each script in this Meaningful series begins with a historic event or holiday but moves thoughts beyond the common, trivial, and blasï¿½. The goal is to both entertain and challenge a reader/believer of any stripe, and those who sow effort will reap fruits that are ripe. If you don't accept this challenge, so be it, it's your life to live-but the rewards of discipleship far outweigh the meaningless alternative.Who is wise? He will realize these things. Who is discerning? He will understand them. The ways of the LORD are right; the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them.-Hosea 14:9",
