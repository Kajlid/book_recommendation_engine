  "title": "She Bop: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop & Soul",
  "description": "Popular music grew out of ragtime, vaudeville and the blues to become global mass entertainment. Yet nearly eighty years after Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith first blazed the trail, have their female successors achieved the recognition and affirmation they deserve?The first hands-on history of women in rock, pop and soul, She Bop tells it like it is - on stage, on camera and working in a male-dominated industry. Adding a feminist perspective to her incredibly detailed knowledge of the stars and their music, and including an abundance of personal interviews, Lucy O'Brien tells these women's stories and their struggle not only for acceptance, but also for recognition and success, in a culture they are still striving to call their own. She Bop traces the different stages of women's progress in the music industry, from the early years of ragtime and the Jazz Age up to the present.",
