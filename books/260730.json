  "title": "Echoes From a Cobbled Street: Stories and Poems from the North West",
  "description": "This book is a continuation of my previous book 'What Has He Done Now? It has stories from the early sixties right up to the present day. It isn't a biography as such, but more a collection of random thoughts and feelings about life in and around the area of my birth. It is a catalogue of sentiments, both sad and funny. The fact that I was born and raised in Leigh, Lancashire is incidental. My childhood was like millions of other children's lives in Britain. Some of the words we used may differ, but the story of the streets remains the same. It was about making do with what we had. I have tried not to eulogise about life back then. Very often the good old days weren't particularly good at all! The book is not in praise of days gone by, but neither is it in condemnation of it. I have tried to make it an honest reflection of how things were - for me anyway. The book contains several reflections from my childhood, but thoughts from the present day. As the title suggests, all these tales are echoes from a cobbled street; for it was on such a street I was born.",
