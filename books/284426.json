At the age of one and twenty, Widow Isabel Barnet has returned to seek refuge in her family’s ancestral home of Scarlett Hall.

That is until one day when her mother makes a request…  Laurence Redbrook, Duke of Ludlow, feels half a man compared to others; the limp he received after a tragic accident is proof of that. Understanding that the ton whispers behind his back—and no woman would ever view him with interest—he remains alone at his estate. That is, until an important letter arrives requesting his aid.  As Isabel and Laurence are joined into a marriage of convenience, Isabel begins to search for a way to escape from both a man she does not love and the secrets in her heart that threaten to destroy her.
