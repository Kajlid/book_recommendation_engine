  "description": "They're sending Assassins now!... Really...Assassins!?!?!Up until now, attempts on my life have been a force of evil DIY project. They’ve shot at me, slashed at me, clawed at me, and fired a wide variety of death rays.SO MANY DEATH RAYS!But those were simpler times, someone just farmed my death out to a team of world class killers. I long for the day when superhuman assassins would have been my biggest problem.A city wide game of cat and mouse would be all fun and games if they were only after me, but I’m just one of their targets.Now to rescue the people I care about I have to hunt down the assassins before they all end up dead.",
