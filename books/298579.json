  "description": "Years ago, he broke me.Now he’s back with a proposition.He needs a fake fiancée, and I’m the one he’s come to.Audacious— that’s how I would describe him. He was my first love, my first kiss, and my first heartbreak, from which I never truly healed.Kane was once the man of my dreams, on paper—strong, handsome, and a complete charmer. But the problem is, he has never given a damn about anyone but himself. I’ve never witnessed a desperate man until Kane knocked on my door with literally the proposal of a lifetime. I must admit, it’s ironic he’s come to me given the way things ended between us.It’s possibly the worst idea ever, but I need the money. How do I not fall for Kane all over again and risk history repeating itself? Only time will tell.",
