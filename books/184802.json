We fled and hid and the evil passed over onto the land and into the city. Do not go back there, friends.'In her birth city of Binet, Ashil, an apprentice cartographer, meets Chandra, a nomad mapdrawer. Together with the shy Lilith, they leave the city behind, seeking independence and adventure, as demand for their maps takes them far across Tirayi. As they travel, they are joined by the mysterious tracker, Alexa, and the beautiful dancer, Carly.Bound by friendship and drawn by the novelty of the unknown, the five move from job to job. Until, in the stunning seaside city of Cynal, amid the merry calls of the merfolk and the strange attentions of their silent follower, they find romance and fun. But their adventures there also lead them into great danger, as evil closes in around them.'",
