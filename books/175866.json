  "description": "Ambitious young attorney Tina Bethel doesn’t have time for commitment, but she wouldn’t pass up some hot, no-strings sex with the right guy—like Sons of Odin officer Vincent Ramos. Six feet, five inches of solid muscle and biker masculinity, he revs Tina up like no man ever has. The trouble is, every time they get physical, Tina’s cravings are never quenched—because Vincent always pumps the brakes before the point of no return. With her sexy body packaged in a short skirt, Tina’s enough to drive any man crazy. Vincent isn’t sure how he’s resisted her shameless come-ons. He just knows that if he gives in, he won’t be able to stop—and after two failed marriages, he can’t afford any more broken promises. But when a disgruntled client of Tina’s starts stalking her, Vincent has to make up his mind about his true feelings—fast. Because if he’s willing to put his body in the line of fire, he should be able to risk his heart in the name of love.",
