  "description": "Bookstore owner Otherwise meets the beautiful Etcetera one afternoon when she comes into his store. They begin a fantastical, erotic road trip that will last 28 days. While traveling they meet characters such as The Marketer, a man who markets the most remarkable goods, and the waitress that falls into the fat fryer and is eaten by the Fat Friar. As Otherwise falls deeply in love, the mystery of Etcetera grows, until at the end of 28 days, his questions are answered, including the most important of all, Do you love me? This irreverent tale of romance and lust is filled with intriciately witty word play and appropriately offbeat illustrations.",
