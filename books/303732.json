She wades into the dating pool in a Miss Havisham-inspired line of lingerie and flunks the magic of tidying up.You're Leaving When? is for anybody who thought they had a semblance of security but wound up with a fragile economy and a blankie. Gurwitch offers stories of resilience, adaptability, low-rent redemption, and the kindness of strangers. Even in a muted Zoom.",
