  "description": "In this extraordinary and original philosophical achievement, Agamben develops the concept of community and the social implications of his philosophical thought. Agambenâ€™s exploration is, in part, a contemporary response to the work of Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Blanchot, Jean-Luc Nancy, and, more historically, Plato, Spinoza, and medieval scholars and theorists of Judeo-Christian scriptures.",
