That's just the start of his day.When a mystery lady enters his office with a load of cash to recover some stolen goods, he doesn't think twice about taking it on. After all, Mick's business is trouble. And when business is trouble, then business is good.But when the stolen goods turn out to be the property of a beautiful but deadly crime boss, Mick's problems get a lot worse. He's pulled neck-deep in a conspiracy that involves mobsters, femme fatales, an android with a murderous streak, and even the mayor of New Haven.He'll have to tackle the case with unlikely allies and a clear head because it will take more than just sarcasm and his seven-shot revolver to stay one step ahead of catching a case of the New Haven Blues.Be sure to pick up the quick-paced story that fans refer to as 'Blade Runner meets Bogart!'",
