Forced to take on a dreaded management role at Valkyrie Headquarters. Now, to keep her hormonally insane - vastly pregnant - boss happy, she must join forces with the most annoying Demon in existence. One who never stops talking, flirting, or dimpling.He’s tricky, deviously brilliant… and hiding a butt load of secrets. But surprisingly useful when it comes to dealing with peeved She-Demons and wooing snotty God clients. More importantly, the Demon knows how to throw a kickass baby shower. Still, Shaw’s life would be so much simpler if she could just kill him.Being King of the Conflict Demon Realm is a nightmare. Kaleb Chipp spends his days listening to political advisors bickering and thwarting non-stop assassination attempts. Determined to off load the monarchy, Kaleb just needs to stay alive ten more days. Forming an alliance with Shaw may be his only hope. Falling in love with a bloodthirsty snarky Valkyrie definitely wasn’t part of the plan. Frankly, he’s more likely to get dead than convince Shaw to claim him. It will take all his wily skills to prove to her that - A Demon Is Forever.",
