  "description": "Kaitlin is discovered frantically digging up her grandmother’s grave in the cemetery of a lunatic asylum. Catherine was buried there decades ago. But for some reason, Kaitlin has stubbornly refused to believe that her grandmother is actually dead. Twenty years earlier, Kaitlin’s father, sister-in-law, and nephew, all perished under bizarre circumstances. At the time, there was no rational explanation. Kaitlin and her brother Charlie are the only two people who may know how they were all killed together on the same night. Unfortunately, no one has been willing to believe their incredible story. And now it appears that Kaitlin will be locked away inside that very asylum where her grandmother supposedly died.There is one last chance to solve the mystery of those unnatural deaths. And one last chance to save Kaitlin from becoming a permanent resident of the insane asylum. If only someone could find a way to believe what she has been saying over all those years. It will require calling in Dr. Alexander Edge—since he is the only person who possess the supernatural abilities to discover the real truth. And he is most definitely the only person who would be willing to believe her incredible story. Dr. Edge must use his mystical amulet to peer inside of her mind—to finally reveal the unbelievable truth kept hidden deep within the mind’s eye.",
