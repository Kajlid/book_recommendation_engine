  "description": "This is the story of the African's continuing pain over the ages: the dismembering, dispossession and repression of the African people both by the colonialists and later their own governments. Told with pathos and vibrancy, it is still peppered with romance and sprightly humor. It is an optimistic look at the future of Africa and her people.",
