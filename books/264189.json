  "description": "They are the five dreadlords, the Cull Obsidian - once Thanos' most feared warriors and disciples...the Black Order! Ruthless villains all, the Black Order has been dispatched by the Grandmaster to destabilize a burgeoning empire, but along the way they realize that as big and as bad as they are, there is always someone bigger and badder... Isn't that always the way? You go to assassinate an emperor and he turns the tables, and suddenly a very simple mission gets a whole lot more complicated. It's a good thing the Black Order is made up of professional killers who are no strangers to cellblocks...! The bombastic writing style of novelist Derek Landy (Skulduggery Pleasant) and the electrifying artwork of Philip Tan combine for an absolutely unhinged super-villain adventure!",
