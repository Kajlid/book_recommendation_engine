  "description": "Neil Carey, a student at Cambridge, is forced to choose between King and Parliament in the turbulent days of England's Civil War.For the King or for Parliament? This is the choice that confronts young Neil Carey. His elder brother, Denzil, an ardent Royalist is already at Court, but Neil's cousin and great friend, Francis Vaughan, is a strong supporter of Parliament. Neil is reluctant to take part in the Civil War, but he follows his father in declaring his support for the King's cause, and with the fiery little soldier, Owen Price, rides off to join the Royalist army. Denzil and his fashionable friends despise Neil for his lack of inches and his quiet air, but his courage and his skill with the small-sword soon win their respect. But Neil makes enemies as well as friends and eventually finds himself sentenced to death on a false charge, based on the evidence of two men who despise him.Ronald Welch has written a really exciting tale of the Civil War, which is given special interest by his knowledge of military history",
