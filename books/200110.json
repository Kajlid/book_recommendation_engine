  "title": "Paradise Remembered",
  "description": "This is the fourth book in the series of semi-autobiographical experiences set in the fictional mountain town of Western Colorado. When asked about when I would write my autobiography, I concluded that an appreciation of such intimate experiences of my adolescence and youth would be best enjoyed in fiction. These stories are drawn from encounters with so many different people and the stories that stem from their experiences in growing up. Through these fictional stories often set in actual locations, the timeless encounters that enrich our learning, our maturation and our combined legacies offer to an unheeding world the joys and frustrations that emanate from the context of our early lives. This is the warp and woof of the fabric of the United States. It is not a reflection of the egotistical, self-centered selfish minorities who demand their agendas with political correctness. Those who may be offended by these stories can only be pitied. Destiny has its own agenda.",
