  "title": "The Bystander",
  "description": "A woman and her son prepare to start a new life…A homeless failed stockbroker walks the streets of New York City, just waiting for another chance…A C.I.A. operative lies comatose in a hospital bed…Their lives, and many more, are destined to cross when the world is struck by an incredible global phenomenon…When time itself inexplicably stops, mankind is trapped in an eternal moment, never ageing and effectively immortal. But still just as ruthlessly ambitious.As people fight to survive the perpetual evening of a new America, murderous leaders and dictatorial oppressors rise. The brutality of man is brought into focus more clearly than ever before.Thousands of miles away, on another continent, a different threat is emerging – and the connection between these distant events just might hold the answer to the mystery of time…Dystopian sci-fi fantasy on an epic scale, The Bystander is a metaphorical allegory of humanity, power-hunger and the ambiguity of war.",
