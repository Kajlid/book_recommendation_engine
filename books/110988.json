  "description": "Veronica Pendleton is just a mom. She has a happy husband and family. She has close friends. She also has secrets. Big secrets that must be kept in this small Alabama town. When a mysterious Voice begins calling her, threatening to expose both her and her friends' hidden activities, they will each have to decide how far they will go to protect those secrets. How much is too much? Can their lives be the same afterward? In this premiere novel from new author J. D. Gentry, scandalous things are afoot in suburban Alabama. You will be given an uncensored look into the lives of these friends. Be warned, this book contains explicit material and should be read only by those who are both legally-allowed and mentally-prepared for it. The good news is that there are no billionaires in here--aren't you tired of them anyway? These could be the women next door to you, behind you in the checkout line, or at the next table in the restaurant. They could be you.",
