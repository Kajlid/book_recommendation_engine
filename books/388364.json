  "description": "At the dazzling Fairy High Court―fraught with enchantments and trickery―Keelie Heartwood discovers that an imbalance in magic has created a colossal rift that can destroy the world. Keelie's mixed blood (elf, human, and fae) makes her powerful, but this sixteen-year-old L.A. girl can't fix things alone. The Grey Mantle elves aren't helping at all, even though bizarre things are happening all around their village. The more Keelie learns about the magical worlds of the Northwoods-where time is unruly, nasty goblins run amok, and an ancient (and handsome) forest god is pursuing her-the more she doesn't know just whom to trust. Don't miss the other books in the popular and critically acclaimed Faire Folk Saga! \"Summers's true strength is in creating a wide and colorful array of personalities to populate her stories, and The Quicksilver Faire is no exception.\"―RENAISSANCE MAGAZINE",
