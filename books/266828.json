  "description": "When an artist views the world, he or she sees its potential on a canvass - size, perspective, colors, and shadows. When a composer creates, the music is already resounding mentally, placing the allegro, the adagio, deciding on moments of espirando. Mom's inspirations, whatever they happened to be, were immediately being put into words in her mind - and eventually, when time allowed, written down. Through the chapters of her life, she recorded her \"poet's\" view of those moments. We hope that you will look into her \"life\" as a poet through her youth, at times her broken heart, WWII with her husband at war, kids, loss of friends and family...and her lifelong love - Ken. This first volume – THE EARLY YEARS – includes her first poems at age 11 and continues through her early twenties to the time when she met her future husband, Ken. In this, you will see how her view of things may resonate more than you might expect. What she saw is what we all see, but for her to capture it in words, to enjoy over and over again, is the gift she gave to us.We are now sharing that gift with you.",
