  "description": "Ascension is the name of the attribute of a human being with a 100 percent marriage to the Higher Self, and a 50/50 Partnering with God! It allows that human to stay on Earth--not leave it! It allows you to become so much greater than you are now that you actually become a spiritual being, with one foot in your dimension and the other in ours. It takes work, self-worth and vibrational shift to do this.",
