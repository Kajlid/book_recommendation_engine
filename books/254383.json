  "description": "Barrett  When Paul asked me to be his best man, I didn’t think we’d make it this far. He’s 0 for 3 on engagements, but he says he’s serious this time.  The moment I meet Audrey, the maid of honor, I’m conflicted. She’s recovering from an injury. She needs my help, but all I want is to help her into my bed. What we have is wild and hot as hell—but that doesn’t mean I’m looking for it to continue past this trip. I’ve worked too hard to get to where I am to let anyone drag me down—but before I know it she’s got me turned around, and chasing after what I swore I’d never want—a chance at forever.  Audrey  I’m still recovering from ankle surgery after a severe break, but I’m the maid of honor and I refuse to let pain stop me from being part my best friend’s wedding. When I overdo it, I retreat to recover and regroup.  That’s how I meet Barrett. He’s brooding and blunt, but when he picks me up and carries me as if I’m nothing then brings me ice and takes care of me—I’m ready for my first wedding hookup. He is exactly what I need to get my mojo back.  Being bad never felt this good.  When he tells me he's not ready for a relationship I believe him—after all, his best friend just left mine at the altar. Where do we go from there?  Is it wrong to hope for make up sex considering we weren't the ones who broke up?",
