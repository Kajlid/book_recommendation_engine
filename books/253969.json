They are to follow the messenger through a magical portal to find her. In this modern-day fairy tale, the twelve-year-old, telepathic twins uncover a world hidden behind an enchanted mist conjured by five sorcerers to protect all magical beings from the human world. A world that is now terrorized by a dark and destructive force sweeping across the land, threatening their very existence. The twins embark on a perilous quest to save their mother and the grandfather they never knew existed. Fantasy has turned into reality for the Archer twins, and the safety of all magical beings now rests in their hands.",
