  "description": "Taipei, 1895. James Burnaby, a down-on-his-luck, ex-barrow boy from the East End of London is trying to make a living as a tea trader in the far-off land of Formosa (Taiwan). He is faced with numerous challenges, however, chief among them navigating the tricky waters of the alien world around him and the well-heeled British trading elite who view his sudden arrival on the island ten years ago with immense suspicion.Just as it seems his fortunes are going to take a turn for the better, the new life he has created for himself is thrown into chaos as the Sino-Japanese War threatens to land directly on his doorstep.Unsure if he should stay on the island or seek refuge in the British colony of Hong Kong, the line between Burnaby's troubled past and present begins to blur ever more in this humourous and touching tale of redemption, struggle for acceptance and clash of civilisations.",
