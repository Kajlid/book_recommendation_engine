  "description": "RULED BY HIS GUNWhen Moss Tucker smelled danger he shot it, when he needed shelter he grabbed it--and when he wanted a woman's touch he bought it. Then he saw Amanda Boone's sparkling azure eyes and the tough, steely outlaw couldn't get her out of his mind. An innocent beauty like her would never get involved with a lawbreaking man like him. But the thought of never tasting her luscious lips or hearing her cries of ecstasy pierced him more sharply than a bullet from his double-barreled gun!LED BY HER HEARTChestnut-haired Amanda tried to keep her gaze on the vast frontier that flashed past her train window--but it kept straying to the buckskin-clad stranger opposite her. Every inch of him was virile and strong... and every part of her yearned for his passionate caress. She knew it was wrong to even think of his muscular arms crushing her soft curves in a fierce embrace. Yet she vowed that before the trip was through he would be the one to tame her savage desire with his wild LAWLESS LOVE",
