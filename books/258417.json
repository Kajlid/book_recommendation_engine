When Faye Morgan casts a wish into the Scottish sea one cold January morning, her call brings her to the attention of the wild and capricious faerie king Finn Beatha. Finn offers Faye an invitation – to follow him into another world or risk the eternal wrath of his people.  When Faye arrives, it’s to discover that everything in the glittering world of faerie has its price. A single misstep could mean she’s trapped forever – never to see her home again. She must have all her wits about her… but it’s difficult with Finn Beatha – passionate and dangerous – watching her every move. What secrets are hidden behind Finn’s marsh-fire eyes? Why do the faeries of the court whisper behind Faye’s back, and call her by the mysterious title: sidhe-leth? Is there something in her past connecting her to this place… and dare she find out more when every moment draws her further away from her old life – her old world?  A gorgeously sexy and enthralling read, you’ll never want to put this book down!
