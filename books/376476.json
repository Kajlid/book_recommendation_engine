  "description": "Considered a cult classic (at least that's what it says on the back cover) from the artist who went on to write and draw the highly praised Why I Hate Saturn, The Cowboy Wally Show consists of four chapters. \"The Cowboy Wally Legend\" is our introduction to this overblown mockery of a film star; \"Sands of Blood\" and \"The Making of Hamlet\" are two crazy attempts at film; and \"Cowboy Wally's Late Night Celebrity Showdown\" is his final moment of television glory. This will appeal to fans of trashy television talk shows.",
