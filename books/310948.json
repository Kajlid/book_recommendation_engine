  "description": "KobeI've built this restaurant from the ground up with nothing but my own two hands and a passion for cooking. Today Tout le Monde has the longest waitlist in all of Azure City. People travel across the world to come and taste my cuisine. As they should. It's amazing. I've always known what I've wanted since I was a boy and this is it.When I volunteered to teach a cooking class in the city for students, I didn't expect them to be so bad at it. Especially this woman who decided to wear a ballgown to a cooking class. She can't even peel carrots. What a waste of time.ClementineI was so nervous that the Chef of Tout le Monde is going to be teaching my class today. Only ten minutes in and I've already stained my dress, cut my finger, and burned a napkin. The look of disdain on his face says it all. Just like everything else, I'm not cut out for cooking either. The way he holds my hand to steady it as he shows me how to cut a carrot makes me excited for my next class. Maybe I can be good at this.We're so glad you decided to take a trip here to Azure City, home of the world's most eligible bachelors. As you visit our landmarks and try our cuisine, be sure to enjoy the nightlife as well. We have something for everyone and we're certain you'll enjoy your stay. Follow the men from Azure City as they find love where they least expect it.All books in the Men of Azure City series can be read in any order and are all standalone. Kobe is a steamy romance with no cheating and as always a guaranteed happily ever after!",
