  "title": "Equinox",
  "description": "Angel -- a lethal synthetic drug so pervasive and deadly, it has built empires and torn down worlds. Equinox Industries is a commercial monopoly which has spent decades mining the gas giant, Zeus. Now, the company is challenged by a growing faction for its dirty environmental record, and Tactical in the fantastic city of Elysium -- on the moon of Avalon in orbit around the green-faced giant world -- suspects Equinox of being the force behind the local manufacture of Angel. The super drug isn't being smuggled into the system -- Colonel Vic Duggan comprehensively shut down the Angel smuggling trade. Yet Avalon remains riddled with Angel, rotting from the inside out... Enter Jarrat and Stone, commanding the carrier NARC-Athena, the premier base ship in the paramilitary NARC force, at war with the Angel syndicates. Lovers whose minds have been bonded together. Men whose lives have been changed forever by the drug, the war, and the sacrifices both have made, and must continue to make if they will pursue a job which has long been a vocation. In this second novel, the heroes of DEATH'S HEAD need their empathic powers as well as the twenty-fourth century's technology wizardry to stay one jump ahead of their corporate enemies -- to stay alive and at liberty.",
