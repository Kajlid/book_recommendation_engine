  "description": "\"This is the best idea for a writing book that I've ever seen. It's like sitting in a room full of professional writers, and after each one delivers a riff on one aspect of writing, the others weigh in to buttress, amplify, refine, or add to what was said. It's an extended conversation with writers who know what they're talking about--and what matters in writing fiction that really communicates with readers.\"--Orson Scott Card . . . . . .
