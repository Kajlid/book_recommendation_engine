  "description": "Pip lives in a medieval abbey, surrounded by monks and miles of swamp â€” pretty boring. Until he meets Perfect, a small stone gargoyle, and the two find themselves in the middle of an assassination attempt against the king, and being chased across the fens by a man bent on killing them. Boring? Not any more.",
