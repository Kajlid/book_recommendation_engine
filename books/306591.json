But our best friends are married, so escaping him isn't exactly easy.Did I mention he's also my new roommate?You see, life hasn't exactly gone to plan recently, and I'm out of options. But just because I'm stuck with him doesn't mean I have to lay back and endue his antics. Chase doesn't know it yet, but he's just met his match.  Chase Georgia Monroe has driven me crazy for years. And not in a fun way. She's a snobby brat who I try to avoid at all costs. As luck would have it, she's also my new roommate. If this year hasn't taken enough from me, it is undoubtedly testing my sanity with her around. Forced into close quarters, I don't know who will snap first. Georgia is fire, and I'm gasoline. Soon, someone is going to explode.I'm just hoping it won't be me.",
