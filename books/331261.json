Case in point, me falling for a writer on a different continent who has no idea that I'm the star of her fictional fantasies.I can’t stop thinking about Kate Dubois even as we talk every day. I should have told her the truth of who I was before things got this far. In my defense, celebrity comes with a lot of baggage and it is nice to be seen (figuratively) for who I really am.Now, I have a chance to actually meet her in person and there’s no way I can pass that up.Just one harmless look at the woman who has changed my life and I can go back to hiding in English countryside obscurity.What’s the worst that could happen?Stranger Than Fan Fiction, is a full-length romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is the first book in the Unlucky in Love series.",
