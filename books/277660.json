  "description": "The mysterious saga of the Caskey family begins in Blackwater I: The Flood, as a devastating flood brings a strange and beautiful visitor to the small, sleepy lumber town of Perdido, Alabama. Elinor Dammert's arrival will forever change the town and the wealthy and powerful Caskey family. James, who dotes on Elinor like a second daughter... Sister, who pines for Elinor’s strength and independence... Oscar, who loves Elinor and determines to build a life with her... And matriarch Mary-Love, perhaps the only person in Perdido with an inkling of Elinor’s true power and purpose. For Elinor is more than she appears, and she brings to Perdido—and to the Caskeys—a deadly, inexplicable otherness from which no one can ever be safe.",
