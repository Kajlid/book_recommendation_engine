  "description": "Second Chance Romance Harper Whitney is officially divorced. Ever since she signed the papers, she’s found it difficult to believe a second love could even exist. At this point, she wonders if the first was ever real. Besides that, everything is just dandy. Her big sister is getting married. It’s wonderful—she knows—but if one more person reminds her that she needs a plus one, she might just scream. Enter Jensen Reed, her sister’s friend’s brother. Confusing, yeah. It’s even more confusing to Harper when he’s somehow volunteered to be her date to the wedding. The city boy lives his life far, far away from the farm that Harper calls home. The only one she’s ever known. To make things even more complicated, she’s recently decided to dip her toes in the cesspool of modern dating. And, he agrees to help her get back on the saddle, so to speak. Neither of them exactly thought it’d be his saddle she’d choose to mount. He’s risk-free in so many ways—a traveler by profession and a carefree wanderer by design. Oh, not to mention, he’s hot as hell. But after the wedding—when serious decisions need to be made—Harper must decide: Can she give love one more chance?",
