  "description": "The second book in an epic fantasy series featuring “an inspired new world where unexpected plot twists bedevil strong, clearly visualized characters, in a story that glints with intelligence and hums with life” (Publishers Weekly, starred review). Six hundred years ago, an unknown force destroyed one of the greatest fortresses in Ithelas, slaughtering its defenders so swiftly that none survived to say what befell them. Now, in the shadow of those ancient ruins, something malevolent is stirring. Kelland, a divinely blessed Knight of the Sun, is charged with the duty of confronting the felled powers of the world. But his only chance of stopping this evil may be to ally with another—even as Bitharn, his companion, betrays their faith in the name of love. Meanwhile, three young novices from the Dome of the Sun, accompanied by a scarred and taciturn swordswoman, venture bravely but unwisely into the heart of danger, seeking a holy artifact that, they pray, might end it. And when their paths converge in Carden Vale, a nightmare awaits.",
