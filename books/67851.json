  "description": "Long after the events depicted in the previous installments of the Final Colony series, a legendary high ranking officer of the Meragro (Cygn) Armada reaches a remote, backwater planet named Steper on a sensitive mission. There the ‘Skinner of Mars’ will discover a mining colony with its own set of rules, the remnants of a mythical as much as ancient alien civilization and what their holly scripts are calling the Harbinger. The last weapon of a race they’ve beaten to extinction more than a century ago.",
