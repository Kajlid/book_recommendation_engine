  "description": "Falling in love with a prisoner was against the rules.  So why was Lark allowing herself to get close to Raynor? He was domineering, cocky and much too handsome for his own good. Though her mind found him unbearable, her body was ready to endure anything he could deliver. However, inside of him lived a darkness unlike anything she’d ever witnessed. If the rumors were true, that darkness would consume any and everyone in its path. Lark was going to try her best to stay out of his way.  They called him The Destroyer.  Raynor Batiste was many things: a monster, a killer, one of the most feared creatures in the galaxy. He was a beast whose name sent shudders through his enemies. However, a prisoner he was not. He’d only allowed himself to be captured so he could get close to his mate, Lark Valdese.  That task was proving harder than he’d anticipated. Lark is afraid of what lives inside of him, and she should be. Yet, when her planet comes under attack, the evil lurking within him may be the only thing that can save her and her people. He’s willing to protect her planet, but his aid comes at a price, a price only Lark can pay.  Will Beauty give in to the Beast in order to save her world? Or will she learn that the monster inside of him is the reason her planet is being destroyed?  **This is a sensual BWWM Sci-Fi Romance for adults only.**",
