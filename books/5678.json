  "description": "New price, new look and new format for this bestselling pop psychology classic. You Can't Afford The Luxury of a Negative Thought is an upbeat, accesible book about the power of positive thought -- and about how negative thinking can wreck lives. Negative thinking is seen as a debilitating illness that will slowly kill your spirit -- and for some people lead to actual physical disease. Happily though, this is not a doom-filled book at all! The authors show how Eliminate The Negative -- spend less time thinking 'down' and negative thoughts. / Accentuate The Positive -- spend more time focussing on the positive things in your life. / Latch On To The Affirmative -- enjoy each moment! Packed full of inspirational, funny, and moving quotes. This book was written in part specially for those who have been diagnosed with severe illness. Negative thinking drags you down -- whilst a truly positive approach will have a positive effect on your whole self -- thus promoting good physical health. Though this book is a terrific inspirational read for anyone looking to recover health, it's essentially a big book about positive thinking and is certainly not limited to an 'ill' market!",
