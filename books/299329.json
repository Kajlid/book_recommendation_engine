  "description": "Aunt Blythe's house gives Andrew the creeps—full of dark rooms, creaky noises, and the sound of a woman sobbing somewhere in the shadows. Then, in the middle of the night, Andrew awakens to find a boy standing in his room... a boy who is Andrew's double, except he looks as if he's come from the grave. He wants to follow him—to a place where he will meet the spirits of long-dead ancestors... a place from which Andrew may never return.",
