  "description": "“Weetzie’s many fans will most appreciate this reunion. . . but those just meeting Block’s whimsical entourage and sparkling prose will also appreciate the book’s that magic can be found in stolen moments and, in Dirk’s words, though ‘love is a dangerous angel,’ it’s well worth the risk.”  —  Publishers Weekly  (starred review) In this installment of Francesca Lia Block’s phenomenal Weetzie Bat series, we follow Weetzie through a life-altering and magical journey, where anything is possible, even true love. Turning 40 and stuck in a relationship gone stale, Weetzie packs up one day and leaves Max, the same secret agent lover man who was once the other half of a passionate relationship. She stays at an enchanted pink hotel, where she meets an otherworldly cast of characters, among them a blue-skinned receptionist, an invisible cleaning lady, a seductive room service clerk, and a sushi-eating mermaid who gives her a kiss that sets the wheel of self-discovery in motion.",
