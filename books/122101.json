  "description": "The Food Network's newest star, Chef Kathleen Daelemans, is living proof that great-tasting food and dramatic weight loss can go hand in hand. A decade ago, she was unexpectedly chosen to become head chef of one of the world's most luxurious spas in Hawaii. One she weighed 205 pounds and was a size 22 -- not exactly an advertisement for the joys of low-fat eating.But Kathleen wasn't about to give up her love of food, and she set out to create a cuisine she could be proud of. Her ground rules were simple. Every dish had to satisfy. Pleasure must rule. No one should have to weigh or measure food. And the \"d\" word was banned -- unless the \"d\" stood for outrageously delicious.Spa guests, movie stars, recording artists, sports figures, and supermodels flocked to the restaurant's tables. Critics from the New York Times, Esquire, Food & Wine, Bon App√©tit, and the Los Angeles Times raved. Kathleen herself lost seventy-five pounds.Now, in this book, Chef Kathleen shares her sassy philosophy and the secrets of her weight-loss success story while giving you the tools to make healthy changes for yourself. Falling in love with her food is easy, with recipes like Split-Roasted Chicken and Potatoes, Buttermilk Baked Onion Rings, Sesame Ginger Shrimp, Green Beans with Lemon and Parmesan, and Dark Chocolate Cherry Cheesecake, and the book is packed with shortcut tips, comments from real people, and suggestions for transforming one meal into a second, equally delicious one. With COOKING THIN, the journey to vitality starts now.",
