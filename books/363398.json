  "title": "The Journey from Abandonment to Healing: Turn the End of a Relationship into the Beginning of a New Life",
  "description": "Like Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross 's groundbreaking On Death and Dying , Susan Anderson 's book clearly defines the five phases of a different kind of grieving--grieving over a lost relationship. An experienced professional who has specialized in helping people with loss, heartbreak, and abandonment for more than two decades, Susan Anderson gives this subject the serious attention it deserves. The Journey From Abandonment to Healing is designed to help all victims of emotional breakups--whether they are suffering from a recent loss, or a lingering wound from the past; whether they are caught up in patterns that sabotage their own relationships, or they're in a relationship where they no longer feel loved. From the first stunning blow to starting over, it provides a complete program for abandonment recovery.",
