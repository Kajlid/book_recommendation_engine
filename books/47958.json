  "description": "When everything comes apart, sometimes that's when you finally see. Signs begins with a unisex narrator who has been cruelly dumped. Suddenly, everything has a sign. They direct, advise, harass, and amuse...but are they real? And should they be followed? Signs captures the emotion and confusion of a break-up without labels of gender, sexual preference or ethnicity. Readers will relate to this desperate quest for meaning and answers in a convoluted world. The series of signs may be acute delusions, perceptive insights, or magical phenomena. How will you interpret the Signs?",
