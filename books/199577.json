  "description": "In Mistress of Dragons we were introduced to a world where political deception, greed, and avarice have led to a violation of the “hands off” rule of the Parliament of Dragons concerning the affairs of men, threatening more than policy and order—the violation threatened the freedom of the entire human race.Now, in The Dragon’s Son, anarchy threatens to disrupt the delicate order the Parliament has tried to protect. Hope lies in the twin offspring of a high priestess and a dragon, so long as the twins live to maturity. Until then, their identities must be held secret—even from each other.  It is up to the dragon emissary who passes himself off as a man, Draconas, to protect them both…before the internecine struggle destroys the Parliament of Dragons and brings an oppressive reign of fire down upon all mortal men.",
