  "description": "Secret love letters + a conspiracy + badassery = romance? Why, yes it does! Staff Sergeant Justin \"Hotten\" Hauten isn't the smartest guy in the room. He just wants to be a regular soldier but finds himself mixed up kidnappings, government secrets, and the desire to figure out his feelings for Aaron. First Lieutenant Aaron \"Texas\" Parris is in love with Justin and he isn't going to hold back anymore, even if that means getting involved in whatever mess Justin is in -- which is some pretty messed up crap. Throw in a towering, red-headed lumberjackish (and trouble-making) best friend, bomb threats, under ground bunkers, kick-ass mothers, the Texan Badlands, a marriage proposal, a dim-witted ex-girlfriend loaded with secrets, a fancy Governor's party, plenty of fist fights, government spooks, and a seedy bar called The Itchy Nail, and you've got yourself a tasty recipe for disaster, humor, badassery, and... romance. Can Justin and Aaron fall in love in the middle of all this madness? FALLING FOR HIM, which includes three novellas FALLING FOR YOU, HUNGRY FOR YOU, and READY FOR YOU, is the complete novel in Kelly Washington's M/M Military Love Story series.",
