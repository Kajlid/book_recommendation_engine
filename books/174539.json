  "description": "He fights for money... but will he fight for me?  Pierce Fletcher. He's a tattooed, foul-mouthed cage fighter. He's a sexy, panty-melting prick. He's a cocky, condescending jerk.  So why am I falling for him? I never thought the first boy I'd ever have was a boy I'd hate to want.  But things happen, right? We all make mistakes, right?  So picture this: The morning after my mistake, I get an email, and it's from my father...  ...Telling me he's going to marry Pierce's mother.  He's about to become my stepbrother... and he's still in bed next to me.  What do I do?  What would you do?  *  Pierce Her Stepbrother is a steamy, explicit standalone novella about a young couple that find lust, and must overcome hurdles to find love. It is not part of a series, and has a happy ending. It contains graphic language.  This book contains a cameo from characters Chance and Cassie, from the book Chance Her Stepbrother.",
