  "title": "The Oxford Illustrated History of Tudor & Stuart Britain",
  "description": "Two centuries of dramatic change are covered by this exciting and richly illustrated new work. Eighteen leading scholars explore the political, social, religious, and cultural history of the period when monarchs based in south-east England strove to extend their authority over the whole of the British Isles.These centuries witnessed the Reformation the civil wars, and two revolutions, in which two monarchs, two wives of a king, and two arch-bishops of Canterbury were tried and executed and hundreds of men and women tortured and burned in the name of religion. Yet in the same period and explosion of printing and literacy, transformations in landscapes and townscapes, new forms of wealth, new structures of power, and new forms of political participation freed minds and broadened horizons. These centuries marked the beginning of Britain's imperial power and is emergence as perhaps the most liberal and mature of European states.The 280 illustrations - including 45 colour pictures and 6 maps - form an essential part of the book, complementing all aspects of the text. Additional reference materials include a Chronology, Glossary, Family Tree of the monarchy, Further Reading, and extensive index.",
