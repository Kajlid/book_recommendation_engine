Now Simon has been blackmailed into a new job...with a beautiful new partner who's going to get them both killed.   Robotics expert Cassie Watson is a newbie field agent with as much sophistication as...well, a pacifist, vegan computer nerd. Now she's abruptly thrust into the cutthroat world of espionage with a partner who is as cold as he is brutally-and brutishly-handsome.   But when their mission is betrayed from the inside, Cassie will be forced to place her life in the hands of the one man who's anything but trustworthy...**** TRUE LIES              Book Untrue ColorsBook True DeceptionsBook True Peril",
