  "description": "What does commitment really mean? What would you do if you found you were married to a man on an extreme religious journey? Stomp? Cry? Laugh? Throw things at him? or Write a blog? Ilana did all the above and gained a very meaningful spiritual journey herself. A book comprised of poetry as well as stories from her Married To a Yid viral blog that will give you an honest peek into the lifestyle of Hasidic and Orthodox Judaism. You will think, laugh, and get a raw insight into what it is like to live as an Orthodox Jew and be married to an out-of-the-box Hasidic Orthodox Jew. It's a wild and crazy journey!",
