  "description": "Abandoned. Unwanted. Orphan.I was born with no past and no future. Abandoned on the steps of the Abbey of Amnestia, for nearly twenty-one years I fought the idea that I was unwanted. I was clumsy and outspoken, according to my only friend. Troublesome and worthless, according to the nuns.The only thing I knew for sure is that I wasn’t meant to stay hidden forever.Just when I was about to be cast from the only place I’d ever known, it appeared. Or rather, they appeared. The answer. My way out. A magical castle full of the one thing all humans should have feared. Fae. Not just any Fae either, but Royal Fae—the most powerful of all.Three Fae princes, each colored in the abilities of their home Courts. The crimson prince. The frost prince. And the midnight prince.And though I’d spent my whole life thinking I was human, I’d better hope they find something in my blood that marked me as one of them because if not … I might not leave the castle at all. At least, not alive.",
