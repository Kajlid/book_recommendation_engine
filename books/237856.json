  "description": "Heart’s Song is love letters in the modern age via email, text, and video chat with some live action in between. Rock & Roll meets conservative grace. A mix of wonderfully crafted words and deep layers of real-life truths. Geoff and Emily will live in the reader’s heart long after they read the last line.—Cindy Ervin Huff, blogger, reviewer and author of Secrets and CharadesEmily Amherst is grateful for Geoff Morris’s assistance in recovering from a personal disaster and rewards him by awakening a passion that has lain dormant within him since he moved to LA, away from family and friends, to pursue his career as a rock superstar.
