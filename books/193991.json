  "description": "The Gameshouse is an unusual institution.  Many know it as the place where fortunes can be made and lost though games of chess, backgammon - every game under the sun. But a select few, who are picked to compete in the higher league, know that some games are played for higher stakes - those of politics and empires, of economics and kings . . . And now, the ultimate player is about to step forward.",
