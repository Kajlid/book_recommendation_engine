  "description": "Psst, I know a secret.The same secret that the Student Council—the super-rich, super handsome elite of Adamson All-Boys Academy—knows, too.Jenica Woodruff, the only girl to ever attend the academy before I showed up, didn't commit suicide: she was murdered.Now, someone is after me, too, but no matter where I go, the killer follows. My new high school isn't safe, and turns out, neither is my old one.I'm not a member of the Student Council, but after everything we've been through together, after the horrible things we've seen, I may as well be. These ruthless boys have taken me under their wing.Church, the fearless leader (and hopeless coffee addict). Ranger, the bada** VP (and naked baker). The identical McCarthy twins (and MMA enthusiasts). And Spencer, the boy who was willing to question everything about himself to fall for me … oh, Spencer.Murder and romance are both in the air at Adamson; I'm just not sure which one will kill me first.",
