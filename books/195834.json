Unearthing the seal of William Wallace, Eva gains notoriety.

Just when certain death is eminent, brutal arms surround the lass, dragging her deeper into unknown terror.When Eva realizes she’s been hauled to the hideout of rebel William Wallace, a revelation dawns—she’s landed the story of a lifetime—if she can stay alive and find a way home to tell her tale.What she doesn’t count on is her mounting chemistry with the greatest legend Scotland has ever known…or the absolute love swelling in her heart.",
