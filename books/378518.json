  "description": "A powerful and evocative saga - the sequel to A GIRL CALLED THURSDAY. When Thursday Tilford returns to Haslar Hospital after two years serving as a VAD in Egypt, she finds many changes. With the town packed with troops waiting to leave for the Normandy beaches, and Haslar on standby for the wounded, Thursday's thoughts go to the two men who are vying for her Connor Kirkpatrick, the naval doctor she met at Haslar in 1940, and army doctor Mark Sangster, who travelled with her on the troopship to Egypt. Although she longs to keep her promise to Connor, Thursday's feelings for Mark force her to consider the nature of promises and even, in the end, the nature of love itself. It is only as the war ends and she is presented with an ultimatum that she understands the truth about love, about promises - and about herself.",
