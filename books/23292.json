  "title": "The Icarus Transformation",
  "description": "Written in 1997, fans of War Games and Space Cowboys will like this face-paced Science Fiction novella.I got an email from my best friend, Nick, that said the sky was falling. He's an eccentric mathematician who works for the spooks in Washington. It was so big that the server crashed. When I got back from lunch, the FBI was hauling away evidence. Everyone and everything that touched this mail is getting disappeared except a senator's aide. I need to figure it out before they get me, too. It has something to do with Unified Field Theory, and a new equation he called the Icarus Transformation.To be updated to 2011 and integrated into my next full-length novel, Jezebel's Ladder.",
