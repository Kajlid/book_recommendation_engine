  "description": "Jeremy Porter is a former activist turned slinger. His worldview has become increasingly bitter, jaded, and cynical due to the collapse of many of his personal relationships. He believes he has become a social outcast due to rumors spread by his sociopath first girlfriend, Selene. Jeremy begins to cling to his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend, Ximena, as they use each other as a crutch for emotional co-dependence, until she cheats on him repeatedly. Now Jeremy struggles to resolve a continuous grief cycle just as he encounters, Anna May Salda√±a, on an online web cam during her first strip tease. As soon as they realize that they run in the same circles, Jeremy begins developing incredibly strong and unrequited feelings for her. He must run a gauntlet of obstacles in order to preserve his nature that hurdles into self-destruction in order to be able to offer Anna May what she needs, a secret that requires a higher standard of emotional endurance.",
