  "description": "\"Amy stared at the portrait dancing in front of her. She reached out to grab hold of it, steadying it. Or at least making it shake in tune with the rest of her body. The image could have almost been a mirror. But more disturbing was the fact that it looked like another picture she had. A photo. The only image she had ever had of her mother not faded by time and memory. Taken by a helpful nurse at the hospital just after Amy was born, she recognized the same features as the ones she had secretly stared at for hours after sheâ€™d been orphaned. The same red hair and green eyes sparkled back at her. Even the lone dimple on her left cheek. It was her mother. Amelia Price. And she was wanted for murder.\" As far as Amy Price knew, she was just a normal girl from Los Angeles. An orphan, left alone after the death of her mother years ago. Little did she know the truth of her mother's past. Nor did she know that she would soon come face to face with it. Sent back in time to the past her mother escaped, Amy must either face what her mother couldn't, or find a way back home. Though the handsome man intent on seeing justice met isn't helping any.",
