The map leads them on a quest to discover the lost temple of the sun.To save his city, Talis must discover the power of magic locked away inside the ancient temple. And become a true fire mage.\"Fire Mage is a fast paced, action packed... I devoured it very quickly and was glued to the pages... My favourite character has to be Mara, she is fearless, speaks her mind, and would would fight to the death for her best friend Talis and vice versa. I cannot wait to read to read what is coming up next in the amazing Blacklight Chronicles.\" --Fiction Fascination\"I really enjoyed this book. It was a fast paced fantasy adventure, great for young readers. It was an easy and entertaining read. I really liked the chemistry between Talis and Mara... a really great read for pre-teens and teens.\" --Great Minds Literary Community",
