  "description": "Therapist Tomas Cleaves is many years sober from his addiction but is now losing his mind. He is sure that the addicts he treats must have infected the womb of his wife. Add to that the occasional seizure and voices in his head, he may be more unstable than any of his clients. And with clients like Jason Boston Senior, the Ancient Heroin Wizard, who moves about the cityâ€™s underground like the Merlin of smack, Tom is in desperate need of a client who can give him some hope.James White is one such client-- a newly orphaned alcoholic dead bent on drinking again until he finds himself rescuing lost strays at the next door animal shelter. It is here that he meets the mystical nurse and animal control worker Rachel. Rachel cleans cages, rescues strays, but then has the unfortunate duty of putting some to sleep with a lethal injection. Can James escape his despondent life by helping her rescue the throw-away pets of the city?Follow the cast of characters through dog fighting dens, crack houses, and abandoned farms, and experience the minds and hearts of addicts and those who would help them through a world where stray dogs and heroin addicts are killed by needles every day. Stray illustrates the universal longing in all of us as we wander through the aid stations of society looking for a place that feels like home.",
