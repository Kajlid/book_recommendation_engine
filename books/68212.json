Loud music and sex with Ronan are the only things she’s got that her feel alive, so she takes as much of both as she can get. She knows Ronan wants more, but during the darkest time of the year finding her way won’t be easy. Ronan gambles everything and challenges Thea: one night of passion with him and another man.
