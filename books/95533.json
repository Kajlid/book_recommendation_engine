  "description": "Passion Play is a grouping of poems grounded in the life cycle of a love affair -- the dizzying exuberance of an initial attraction and exploration of another person, the comforting fullness which gives way to lazy days in the company of your lover, and finally, the jagged, heart-wrenching emotions that come before the acceptance and remembrance of the end.",
