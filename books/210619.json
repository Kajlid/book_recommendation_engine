  "description": "Time gets out of hand in a witty, suspenseful fantasy from the author of  The Dragon of Lonely Island .Choose time or lose time. The inscription on his grandfather's pocket watch has always confused Alex. But now that Alex has lost the heirloom, time is all he can think about — time slipping through his fingers. That's when an encounter with a strange lady clues him in to the Blue Moon, a place where earthlings search for what they've lost. Soon Alex is in a rickety spaceship hurtling toward a topsy-turvy world of eccentric characters — from Miss Mumsley, who lost her heart to a prospector, to a medieval scholar who lost his way while calculating pi. It's a perilous journey, plagued by Time Eaters, who suck up their prey's time. How will Alex ever find the watch — and the sense of direction — he's lost? From Rebecca Rupp comes a fast-paced fantasy honoring friendship and courage.",
