  "description": "We tasked a talented global writing community to produce their best work. We provided them with 37 challenging prompts. We gave them a strict 280 character limit. From thousands of entries, we selected just 365.What can be achieved with just 280 characters? On these pages you will feel the fabric of love and depths of loss, you will explore mortality and ponder what it truly means to be alive, you will find poetry, prose, wonder, despair, humour and courage. Most of all you will find exceptional thought-provoking authors who are pushing their form to the very limits and beyond. All royalties of this anthology go directly to a children's literacy charity.",
