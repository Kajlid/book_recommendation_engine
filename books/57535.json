  "description": "We understand there are a variety of child-rearing techniques, but exposing them to wizardism, or leaving them with phylacteries, lycanthropes, and nosferatu don't seem like sound tactics. Is there a Bureau for Paranormal Children Services? They need a call about now. And tell them this collection includes every Penny Arcade strip from 2007, handcrafted creator commentary from Jerry Holkins (Tycho Brahe), mystical cover process from Mike Krahulik, and a foreward by Cliff Bleszinski.",
