  "description": "Bryan Paul is a Massachusetts author and poet. From the author's Introduction: \"‘Playground’ is the definitive collection of my poetry work, from the upbeat ones (show me the snowfall/show me flake by flake) to the downer ones (In my cell, I sit/And mourn for the loss of my spirit)... and with the concept of it being my ‘playground’ I decided to showcase as much of me ‘playing’ as an artist and even threw in some drawings.\" Playground contains poems from previous self-published poetry books by the author, including 'Felicity'.",
