  "title": "Shakespeare's Cats: The Complete Sonnets for the Literary Cat-Lover",
  "description": "Join a band of curious cats for an adorable reading of William Shakespeare’s 154 sonnets. Whether it’s friendship, beauty, love or something more saucy, the Bard of Avon has a sonnet for every occasion. Learn what the sonnets mean and read fun facts about the poet, witches, Elizabethan life, and the unfortunate hygiene habits of the 16th century. Despite being written 400 years ago, the sonnets speak to the eternal ups-and-downs of anyone in love and the struggle to fight our mortality with art. And, many centuries later, we have something else in common with Elizabethans: we find kittens to be utterly adorable.",
