  "title": "Lies, Damned Lies, and History",
  "description": "At St Mary’s Institute of Historical Research, the historians don’t just study the past, they revisit it.  Behind the strait-laced façade of a conventional academic institution, the secret of time travel is being used for ground-breaking and daring historical research, taking the historians on a rollercoaster ride through history. Meanwhile, within St Mary’s itself, there are power struggles and intrigues worthy of a book in themselves.   ‘I’ve done some stupid things in my time. I’ve been reckless. I’ve broken a few rules. But never before have I ruined so many lives or left such a trail of destruction behind me.’  As Max would be the first to admit, she’s never been one for rules. They tend to happened to other people. But this time she’s gone too far, and everyone is paying the price.  Grounded until the end of time, how can she ever put things right?   Shortlisted for the Goodreads Choice Awards for Best Sci-Fi Book 2016",
