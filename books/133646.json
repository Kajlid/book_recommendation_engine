  "title": "The One: The Tale of a Lost Romantic in Seoul",
  "description": "A middle-aged professor, disillusioned and jaded by a loveless marriage and a stale career, makes the move to South Korea in an attempt to bring excitement into his life. What he finds is more of the same: a never-ending repetition of existence without meaning. It is only when a woman much younger than himself, one of his own students, engages him intellectually and emotionally that he finally feels alive. Despite the fear of the taboo of a potential relationship, he feels himself drawing closer to this girl who has brought colour into an otherwise stale and grey life. When this girl is taken away from him, he decides to do as all romantic heroes must: whatever it takes to make her his own.",
