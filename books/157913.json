  "description": "Achieve your goals now! Do you think that finding time to train could make the difference between success and failure? Would finding time to train take you to your goals faster? Are you tired of making excuses for not finding time to train out of your work and family? You know what it’s like, right? You know you need to get in an hour of weight training every day. You know you need to get in an hour of cardio every day. Those two hours though are just killing you whenever you look at the clock. When I was training for Elbrus Race 2010 I was training 4-6 hours 6 days a week and still maintaining my work and family obligations. Now I want to share my secrets with you and help you overcome the things holding you back and preventing your success. I figured it all out for you without getting fired or getting a divorce. I know you probably can’t do that though. I mean the 4-6 hours part. Not the divorce or fired part. But I can tell you how to find that two hours that are driving you nuts right now. Let me share some secrets with you in this time managment instruction manual. Many of the skills presented here are applicable to a wide variety of skills and activities, not just training for fitness and sports goals. If you feel pressed for time, this is the answer to helping you find more time and more freedom.",
