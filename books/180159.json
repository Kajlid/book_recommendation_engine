  "title": "The Kingdom of Heaven: How to live in God's grace",
  "description": "Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven is not with observation but within you.Basically He is saying until He reigns in your heart He can never reign in your land. We have a thousand instructors in Christ but few fathers.This book will not teach you how to do step one through ten to make God give you blessings and authority. A book that makes that claim is misguided at best deceitful at worst. The purpose of this book is to strengthen and encourage the faith of my brethren to the end that we share in the Fathers life.The Fathers life is the Sons life and the same Spirit that resurrected the Son is in us by faith. The Kingdom of God is not about adding God to our lives or about adding our life to His. It is about His life living through and in us; a shared life.",
