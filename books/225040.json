  "description": "Born not in a past of corsets and bonnets but into a future of cloning and bioterror, could Jane Eyre survive? In this final book of Jane E's memoirs, Jane has finally found the love she's always wanted, but can her love for Thorne survive the deepest of betrayals? Celebrate and reexamine the continued relevance of a literary classic, as Jane E shows the Dear Reader that self-respect and honest love are worth a fight, regardless of where–or when–we live.",
