  "description": "How does a daughter convey the lifelong influence of an exceptional father, taken far too soon? How does she distil the lessons learned through joy and heartbreak, from the campground to the ocean's depths? This is my love letter to Dad. Peter Clark, R105695 served in the Royal Australian Navy for over 25 years, predominantly at the bottom of the ocean on board submarines. Peter was many a submariner, brother, father, husband, friend and mate. His incredible life, and his death at the young age of 59 years, inspired his daughter to reflect on their connection, which extends beyond his passing. This is a story of resilience, friendship, laughter and heartache; a daughter's insight into the life her father led, and the impact he had and continues to have on her life. This is a story of the power of love between a girl and her dad.",
