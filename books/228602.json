But when Emily Stanton, the one ray of light in Kell's shadowy existence, is pursued by a ruthless drug lord, the rules of the game suddenly change—and Kell will have to go deeper undercover than he ever imagined...SAVING HER IS HIS PASSION.Emily has loved Kell ever since her father, a prominent politician, rescued him from a brutal life on the streets. They were kids then, too young to act on what was growing between them…but now that Emily is ready, the handsome, headstrong SEAL has decided he's no good for her. Ever since he rescued her from Diego Fuentes' compound, Kell's only duty has been to keep Emily safe. But Fuentes isn't finished with Emily—or Kell.
