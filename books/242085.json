  "description": "A journey through time to save one life jeopardizes the lives of everyone Scarlett holds dear in this finale of the Laird for all Time series. Scarlett would do anything to save her unborn baby, even return to a time she never thought she’d see again. Not for a moment had she missed the constant scrutiny of a celebrity life. To reappear now, inexplicably pregnant in the eyes of the modern world would create a media circus, but Scarlett knows she can overcome any obstacles with Laird at her side and the help of new friends drawn together across time itself by the enigmatic Scotsman known as Auld Donell. The crafty old Scot had been busy over the years, not just meddling in Scarlett’s life but browsing through time, tweaking history and changing the fates of his other ‘projects’. They’d all received a second chance at love, but are unaware of how closely they’re connected despite the years separating them. Unaware of how their Fates are entangled. And unaware of how Auld Donell’s ‘master plan’ to right a few wrongs of his own will put all their lives in peril against an unforeseen enemy. Laird Hepburn spent years enjoying his wife’s fantastic tales of the future world, but he’d never expected—or wanted to see it for himself. Now to ensure the survival of his unborn bairn and protect his family, he must face that alien world head on. Alas, the future holds more surprises and danger than any of them had anticipated. Soon, Laird realizes that in order to avert disaster and save the lives of his loved ones, he may be forced to sacrifice his own.",
