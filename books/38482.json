  "title": "Ring of Deception",
  "description": "Kayla was the General Manager at a manufacturing company in Seattle. Never in her life would she have expected her partner, Mike, to be murdered. After a little innocent digging, all clues led to London. At the same time, her sister Anne was an Account Supervisor at one of LA's leading advertising agencies. Was it a coincidence that one of her fellow co-workers would be found dead in London at the very same time? It only seemed logical that they would decide to travel together to London the following day to investigate any possible connections for themselves. The girls had a reputation for adventure, but nothing could prepare them for what they would find this time. The beautiful London locations and the unusually strong love / hate relationships only led them deeper and deeper into mystique and trouble.Now available in Ebook format through Smashwords.",
