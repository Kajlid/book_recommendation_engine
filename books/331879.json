  "description": "A prophesy that rules me.A curse that ruins me.A wolf shifter pack who claim I am theirs.It wasn’t my choice to be sold to a powerful psychopath by my mother when I was a baby. It wasn’t my choice to be tortured for magic I don’t possess but on-one says no to Esoti and lives.Except me.There are worse things than death. Not dying for one.In a world ruled by The Six, anyone magical is put to death, shifters are slaves and I am the lowest of the low. Until alpha wolves Alerick, Jarom and Eike capture me. The thing is, I don’t want to be anyone’s mate, or toy, or plaything.They insist I’m anything but human, mastering my body and unleashing ancient magic hidden deep inside me.The magic is untameable. Unpredictable. But it just might give me the one thing I’ve always dreamed about — revenge.",
