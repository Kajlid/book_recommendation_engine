  "description": "Breakthrough indie horror author J. A. Crook delivers an immensely terrifying anthology in his first worldwide e-Book release, Amid the Recesses: A Short Story Collection of Fear. In the haunting collection, Crook will make you dread being in darkness after the tale, \"Black and White,\" invite you to witness the very core of madness in the Lovecraftian \"Memoirs of Jacob Bright, Ten Days Haunted,\" and drag you mercilessly through an undead woman's vengeance in the poetically vile, \"The Widow, I\"â€”along with twelve harrowing tales that weave into each other subtly to create a horror experience unlike any other. Violent twists and turns affect each maleficent tale, stitched together by one of the most imaginative horror authors of our time.",
