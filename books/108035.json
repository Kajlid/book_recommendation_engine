Rural ranch work is tough, but satisfying; it’s her attraction to rancher Jake McGreer that finds her in one debacle after another. Tess has always been confident and carefree, so why are her dreams eluding her? Divorced, single-dad Jake is accustomed to hard hits. He resists the allure of the talented, flirtatious new vet, but Tess fits in seamlessly with ranch life. She stitches up his favorite quarterhorse, and mends his daughter’s broken heart. His daughter adores her, his friends want a wedding, but her parent's are certain he's up to no good ~Will the vixen veterinarian decide that Jake is her one true love?",
