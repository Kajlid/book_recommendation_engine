  "description": "SIX MONTHS ON THE KINDLE BESTSELLERS LISTS! When a stray kitten romps into Lynne's life, she has no idea what she's getting into. As Lynne describes in letters to her friend Angie, Skeeter is all cat -- high-spirited, contrary, and inventive. He's so goofy that he reminds Lynne of her own nuttiest escapades; so irrepressible that even Lynne's neighbor, Mark, gets wound around his paw. And when Angie visits to see Skeeter for herself . . . . Well, no one who meets Skeeter will ever be quite the same again. ///////////////////////////////////////////////// ABOUT THE AUTHOR Anne L.
