  "description": "What a great collection. Herein you'll find all the lyrics Mike Watt penned for the Minutemen (from 1980-1985); his Black Flag/Minutemen winter of 1983 tour diary; an intro by Mike (of course); as well as introductions from Joe Carducci, Thurston Moore and Richard Meltzer. All rounded off with all the illustrations Raymond Pettibon did for the Minutemen (and there was a lot of them!). Beautifully produced, and all bilingual (in French too).",
