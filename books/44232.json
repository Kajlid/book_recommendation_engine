  "title": "CRIMES OF PASSION",
  "description": "The very term \"crimes of passion\" evokes deep-seated, atavistic responses in everyone`s heart. These are the crimes that are born in the emotional core of women and men who are pushed to do the unthinkable. There are never - well, hardly ever - any of the crass considerations of financial gain, no taint of reward; only release. These crimes are direct responses to betrayal, to broken hearts and injured pride. Jealousy, envy and the rest of the seven deadly sins enter through this door, and, like as not, end on the scaffold - except in France, however, where le crime passionnel has most often been treated as an irrational response to the sudden betrayal of a loved and trusted partner, but rarely treated in the courts as common murder. Celebrated crime archivist and writer Howard Engel leads us on a journey through the murky passages of bewildering betrayal and rage too passionate for the subtle legal mind. He explores such infamous cases as Maria Manning, Edith Thompson, Ruth Ellis, Lord Broughton, Dr. Crippin and O.J. Simpson. Their love, lovers, loss and lingering malice combine in this emotional volume, sure to thrill any crime fan or historian. (2001)",
