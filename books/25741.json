  "description": "You are cordially invited to…a hot mess. “Ice Queen” Tove Nilsen has it all: a successful career as a political consultant, beauty, a wonderful daughter who’s about to be married…and a gaslighting, selfish disaster of an ex-husband who’s just RSVP’d “yes” to the wedding. On top of that, he’s bringing wife number six with him—a woman who’s a mere five years older than their daughter. Oh, and she’s a literal supermodel. Tove’s always handled everything on her own, but now she’s out of her depth until she decides to hire a man to pose as her date for the weekend-long event. Enter Patrick Mercer, retired escort. His easy confidence soothes Tove’s ragged nerves and enables her to face her ex with her head high. Even better, he infuriates the other man, who can’t make Tove the target for his usual taunts about her single status. Everything’s going according to plan as the events surrounding the wedding unfold, but there’s a slight complication: for the first time in his career, Patrick is falling for a client. And Tove’s frozen heart is dangerously close to thawing for him.",
