  "description": "Veiled from her previous existence as a gifted Angel, Tess is now a mere mortal growing up in foster care with her autistic foster brother, Dorian, and a twisted foster sister, Agatha -- whose main goal in life is to torture them both. Tess' life has been dull and average at best; but all that changes with one look. When she inadvertently gazes into the eyes of the most popular guy in school -- Alex Preston -- Tess sees a glimpse of her previous existence. Uncomprehending, Tess wonders what those memories are and why she now feels like she knows Alex better than anyone in this world. More importantly, why is he haunting her dreams? Dreams so vivid, that they blur the lines of reality, awakening a slew of inexplicable paranormal abilities she didn't know she possessed. Frustrated and confused, Tess lives a double life ... one where Alex has a girlfriend and Tess is a normal high school girl. And another where spirits, visions, and dreams are true. Is she going crazy or is she secretly dating Alex in her dreams?",
