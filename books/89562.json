A malicious watcher stalks him, hounds his friends, aids his enemies, and inflicts distress and mayhem on the kingdom. Women raise armies. A faithless herald carries a forged will south giving Olaf’s son the kingdom. The elven seer urges Bjorn to constant prayer, but the closer he draws to Hearthing, the more his prayers for peace and blessing go unanswered.",
