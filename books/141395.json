  "description": "My mind was made up and my decision had been made, but fate felt the need to rear her ugly head and demand control. Fate is guaranteed, not to be reckoned with, and she won’t be defeated. You see, she’s the author to our stories that have already been written; there’s no editing them. Try as you might, but all you’ll do is piss her off. When you fuck with fate’s masterpiece, tragedy strikes, death occurs, and hearts get shattered. I’ve never been one to follow the rules. So instead, I stood with arms wide open and I challenged her. I knew the possibilities of her kicking my ass were high, but I refused to back down. I invited all the heat she packed, and quickly learned my lesson… You don’t fuck with her. **READ Shattered & Shaken and All for Allie prior to Shattered & Mended, as this is the last in the series**Mature Audience",
