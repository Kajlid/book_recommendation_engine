  "title": "Where Poppies Blow: The British Soldier, Nature, the Great War",
  "description": "The natural history of the Western Front during the First World War by the author of Meadowland, winner of the 2015 Wainwright Prize.Where Poppies Blow is the story of the British soldiers of the Great War and their relationship with the animals and plants around them. This relationship was of profound importance, because it goes a long way to explaining why they fought, and how they found the will to go on. And in that relationship is found some of the highest, noblest aspirations of humanity in times of war.At the most basic level, animals and birds provided interest to fill the blank hours in the trenches and billets; bird-watching, for instance, was probably the most popular single hobby among officers. But perhaps more importantly, the ability of nature to endure, despite the bullets and blood, gave men a psychological, spiritual, even religious uplift. Animals and plants were also reminders of home. Aside from bird-watching, they went fishing in village ponds and in flooded shell holes (for eels), they went bird nesting, they hunted foxes with hounds, they shot pheasants for the pot, and they planted flower gardens in the trenches and vegetable gardens in their billets.Where Poppies Blow is about the British soldier's relationship with nature, and it is also about the human condition in wartime - the soldiers' hopes, loves and need to express the finer side of being human through caring for animals and plants.",
