  "title": "Growing Amaranth",
  "description": "Deep in the heart of Sienna, the town of Autumn is bustling as the harvest season approaches, but young Amaranth knows nothing of this, since she has never been outside of her mother's walled-in cottage. It isn't until a child named William sneaks into her garden that she learns boys exist. As she awakens to the knowledge of an outside world, her mother Myrtle's jealousy is aroused. As Myrtle strives to keep Amaranth from discovering the secret to her captivity, Amaranth struggles with her growing feelings for William and the urge to leave the only home she has ever known. Before Amaranth finds the answers to her mounting curiosity, William vanishes, and she finds herself at the mercy of her mother's wrath. With nothing to rely on except her limited knowledge and the hope that she will finally be united with the life she has always been denied, she realizes the only thing in her way is Myrtle, who will stop at nothing to keep her hidden -- not even murder.",
