  "description": "Sienne, a sex slave from Sudhra, is delivered to the neighboring country of Nordan and presented to Lord Marken's hedonistic court as a diplomatic gift to entertain him over the long, harsh Nordan winter. Unbeknownst to Marken, she's been charged with the task of uncovering information about the Nordanese military. Her cruel Sudhraian keeper, Cyrus, will ensure she suffers dire consequences should she fail. Sienne has never enjoyed the sexual act and Marken vows to train her to pleasure before winter's end. He also vows to loose the chains of slavery from around her mind and free her from Cyrus. Marken captures Sienne's heart, and incites her body to lusts she's never known. How can she bring herself to betray him? How can she not when she's under Cyrus's threat?",
