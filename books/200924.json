  "description": "\"Just when I think I'm getting a better understanding of what I am, something else comes by and knocks me on my ass.\"   My morning started very eventful. A rendezvous with Adriel is more than a notion. He literally wore me out, but he also made me come to terms with a lot about myself I was still trying to deny. Truth is, I wanted Raphael-powerfully so. However, I wasn't so sure about how much of that was my own desires and what part the Agoto inside me was playing in my attraction. In reality, I don't think it mattered. On top of a complicated love life, I still have to stop a triumvirate of demons from opening a portal and letting an even bigger, more badass demon through into my world. Time was running out and I needed help if I have any hope of succeeding.  Warning: This serial contains strong adult content not meant for sensitive eyes.
