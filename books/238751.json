  "description": "Survival can be a lonely existence…or not. The reality of the situation always comes down to a simple decision: what kind of world do you want to build?  The survivors have come to settle in the mountains of Wyoming, fighting day in and day out to establish a home for themselves in a near-empty world. Things are good at first; scavenging is a workable, short term solution that seems to be providing all they need.  But they know that it’s only a matter of time before the food runs out. They need to scramble to find a sustainable solution before the clock stops and, for a little handful of people up in the mountains, the odds don’t seem very favorable.  Further south, a new band of people migrates across the map, running on fumes and searching desperately for a place to settle. All around them, as resources run thin, the world grows colder and more violent.  It’s getting worse out there, always getting worse, and it’s starting to look like survival might just depend on how violent they’re willing to get…",
