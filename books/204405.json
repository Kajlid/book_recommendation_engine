  "description": "Dana Lamb and his wife had a great idea: build a sailing canoe and voyage south along the Pacific Coast from Southern California to Panama. Warm water, gentle surf, benign beaches...a suitable way to spend the summer.This was in the 1930s, and one pictures them pounding nails into plywood and 2x4s. At last they are off on a junket that almost ends in disaster. What saved them was their intelligence, a \"can do\" sense of the possible and their cheerful courage.\"One of the great adventure stories...an improbable undertaking with people as believable and genuine as the couple next door.\" (B-O-T Editorial Review Board)",
