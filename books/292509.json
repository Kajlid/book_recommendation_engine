But can you guess who’s here? Eve. And my attraction to her is as strong as ever.As old feelings rush back, Eve and I find ourselves pulled together, whether we like it or not. Lines are crossed, secrets are kept, and we soon discover that the difference between love and friendship may not be so black and white, after all.Everyone wants that secret crush to love them back…but will I be ready when she does?",
