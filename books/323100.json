  "description": "Earth. 1996. It's not an alien invasion—it's a homecoming. Sixty-five million years ago, while titanic dinosaurs roamed the earth, the Efilu created an advanced civilization full of technological marvels. In the face of worldwide catastrophe, the Efilu fled to the stars, leaving a devastated planet behind them. As they migrated across the galaxy, Efilu civilization flourished. When disaster strikes again as a mysterious plague, the interstellar ship ReQam is sent back to their planet of origin, in search of untainted materials to create a cure. The ReQam's archaeologist, Vit Na, feels unsure of her role in the expedition. Then the Efilu discover their homeworld now thrives, dominated by mammals. Strangely, these animals have evolved to resemble the Efilu in shape and culture. As human civilization mirrors their own in odd and disturbing ways, Vit Na's archaeology training becomes vital to the mission. If this cosmic pandemic—or humanity—have been engineered, there may be dire consequences for Earth. Worse, there may be enemies among the crew. Deciding who to trust may be Vit Na's biggest challenge of all.",
