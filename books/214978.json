  "description": "Sierra Livingston knows there is someone stalking her. Watching. Waiting. Biding their time. But for what, she doesn’t want to stick around to find out. Thankfully, she knows just who to call. Blake has never been one to sit still. He’s still recovering from the gunshot he received during his last job with Soldiering On, but he’s not about to let that stop him from protecting a woman in need. Besides, he has to prove to his boss that he’s still capable, or he’ll be forced into his worst nightmare: a desk job. But neither of them count on their explosive sexual chemistry. Apart, they risk endangering Sierra’s life. But together, there might be an even deeper threat...to their hearts.",
