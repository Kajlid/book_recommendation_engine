  "description": "Since the seventh grade, Alex, a retail slave, has secretly been in love with his best friend, Morgan, a web cartoonist. Unable to overcome social awkwardness, they both find themselves in very separate lifestyles as they reach adulthood. Amidst these distanced and inhibited lives, Alex and Morgan are suddenly faced with the literal end of the world. Corpses around the globe begin to hunger for the flesh of the living, and society crumbles quickly under the shock of the attacks. With the animated dead filling the streets, Morgan has no choice but to hide in Alex's apartment, surviving on canned food, soda, and a huge supply of illegally downloaded movies. While death is waiting outside the apartment every hour of the day, the two friends force themselves to rethink every social rule and emotional response in order to keep their sanity. Both of them will ultimately decide whether they should struggle to hold onto the life that they lost, or adapt to the change. In a world where only the numb can survive, Alex and Morgan must face their true feelings for the first time. Love, blood, and the undead.",
