  "description": "They are here among us . . . Far from home, gifted with special abilities, hunted for their powers. And they are desperate to find their other, the one who completes them . . . before it's too late . . . When you least expect it, love finds you . . . Lately, Claire Edwards feels like she's floundering. A ho-hum teaching job, a string of terrible dates, nights spent with only Netflix and bizarre dreams of spaceships for company . . . life isn't working out the way she hoped. But Claire has an extraordinary secret ability-she can go anywhere at all, just by wishing it. And if the intensely attractive man who suddenly materializes in her car one day is any indication, Claire's not the only one . . . Ever since Darl James learned of his true origins, he has been searching for his partner and life mate, the one whose gift will complement and complete his own. Now that he's found Claire, he vows to never lose her again, or their soul-searing, sensual connection. But keeping her safe won't be easy when they've been marked for destruction by an evil, power-hungry race. A fierce battle is brewing, one that will test Claire and Darl's new bond to the limit, and decide the future of all their kind . . .
