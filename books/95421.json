  "description": "Wyatt Conner is a hard man. A sixth generation sheriff in his hometown of Garnet. A former MMA fighter. His life is about following the rules and making sure everyone else in Garnet follows them too.  Before life hurt him, Wyatt was a different person. Love had once blinded him to his upbringing and made him defiant against anyone who tried to separate him from the girl he loved. He easily broke laws to ensure her safety.  When she left it destroyed him.  Now she's back.  Tabitha knows coming home is a mistake, but family obligation demands it. Of course she would run smack into the love of her life the day she returns.  Despite the danger, Tabitha is powerless against the wild rush of desire that explodes between them the moment she finds herself in Wyattâ€™s arms again. They deserve a second chance, both of them, but she can't risk Wyatt finally discovering the real reason she left.  He broke the rules for her once, and now her haunted past threatens the man she loves--the man he's become--again. If he learns everything she's suffered, he'll cross the lines to take revenge. Tabitha just can't risk it. Not even for another taste of true love.",
