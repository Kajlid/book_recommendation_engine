She helps people transition to what comes next, though she has never seen it for herself. She believes that she is being kept out of the afterlife because of the secret she keeps inside her. Itâ€™s not until she runs into a man at the theater that everything changes. He can see her and that knowledge thrusts her into a part of this world, full of people just like herself. Here, she may finally be able to atone for what she has done.",
