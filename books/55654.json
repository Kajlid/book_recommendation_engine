  "title": "Seven Patients",
  "description": "This is a work of fiction. It is not intended for the faint of heart. The stories are extreme and the descriptions graphic. Patients come and go, but some leave behind a memory so intense that it cannot be erased. Third year medical student Raj Mok quickly learns that patients don’t behave like his beloved medical texts led him to believe. The seven most outrageous patients of his first year in clinical medicine teach Raj that medicine isn’t always about healing and that killing isn’t always murder.",
