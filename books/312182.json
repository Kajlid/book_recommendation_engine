  "description": "A Beautifully illustrated book about friendship and life, by International Booker Prize longlisted author Jaap Robben.What if you were thrown into existence in the middle of your life, with numbered days left ahead of you? Would you see the world in the same way? In his inimitable style, Jaap Robben answers these questions through the unexpectedly witty lens of a fly, from the moment it enters the world as a larva right up to its deathbed. Watch this humble fly throw himself into life and his unlikely friendships with gusto, however short that life may be. Irresistibly charming, funny, and sprinkled with entomological details; this is a moving tale for any stage of life, about how we are all ultimately alone, and yet also together.",
