  "title": "Have Faith...I Will Wait on You",
  "description": "What if everyone is called to wait on someone… to love an individual with a tenacity and commitment that borders supernatural? What if we cheapen love by reducing it to an emotion? Maybe love, in its purest form, is an assignment. For the courageous, loves’ commission has the power to mend the broken, stand up for the forgotten, and administer purpose. Joseph O’Dell, a retired shop keeper, is compelled to share a secret that defined the course of his life. Joseph recalls his time growing up in a rural town, working at his family’s creamery. His is a simple and colorless life, punctuated by cold and distant parents. One summer day, Meadow, a city girl with a haunted past, walks through the creamery doors and changes his life forever. She quickly becomes the center of Joseph’s narrow world, but the road ahead of them is rockier than they could possibly foresee. Joseph fights for their love amidst Meadow’s brokenness, and extends a grace and commitment to Meadow that is heaven sent. Through the pain of rejection and a traumatic loss, Joseph is tested to his very limits. Watch as Joseph takes on the assignment of love, waits on a girl, and finds his purpose.",
