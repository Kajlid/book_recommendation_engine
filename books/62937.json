  "title": "Get Happy",
  "description": "Daryl Gleason cannot remember the last time he smiled. Or why. He's recently lost his job, his business, his wife, and the estranged grandfather who raised him. Everything he held as true about his life has proven to be the opposite, and he is now a man on the verge of collapse. Completely on his own, and without any sort of guidance for the first time, Daryl has become emotionally numb - unable to adjust, or grasp the true significance of these devastating events. In fact, he's incapable of doing much more than staring out the bedroom window at the barking dog in the yard behind him, wondering to himself what the little thing is trying to say.Luckily, his court-appointed psychiatrist doesn't think he's crazy. He simply believes Daryl is going though a little stage - one that can easily be remedied with a large dose of medication, and a small dose of advice: leave the house, meet people, and most importantly, try to remember when and why you were happy.So, with his new best friend Steve, (that little dog from the house behind him), Daryl embarks on a journey to search for the happiness that has seemingly eluded him. The two of them meet a diverse group of people ~ including pirates, a nymphomaniac, an aimless philosopher, and a teen runaway ~ who all somehow have connections to various stages of Daryl's past. Together they force Daryl to reassess his previously unexamined life, and help him Get Happy!",
