  "description": "Written in 1821, \"The Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson\" is not as intimate of a look at the life of one of America's founding fathers as we might have hoped for, however it provides some interesting insights into the life of America's third President. Jefferson begins the work thusly, \"At the age of 77, I begin to make some memoranda and state some recollections of dates & facts concerning myself, for my own more ready reference & for the information of my family.\" While we gain some quick insight into his parents, his childhood, and the time before the revolution, much of the narrative focuses on his work on the Declaration of Independence and subsequently his political dealings in the newly formed republic. Jefferson was a man of the Enlightenment who, along with the other founding fathers, made a bold endeavor to create a new nation free from the British aristocracy. His lasting impact upon democracy cannot be overstated and \"The Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson\" is a compelling closer look into",
