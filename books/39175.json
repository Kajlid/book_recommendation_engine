  "description": "Part of the Elsie Edwards seriesWill Elsie be able to accept her (beautiful!) new self? â€” Elsie Edwards, star of Nothing's Fair in Fifth Grade, is back! She's a whole lot thinner, but not much happier. Sure, she's got a lot of friends now; and she's going out with Craddoc, one of the cutest guys in the whole high school. But even though Elsie looks like \"a thin Dolly Parton,\" she still can't quite believe that Craddoc really likes her. Her insecurity threatens to ruin their relationship. To make matters worse, Elsie's mother just won't realize that Elsie's growing up and doesn't need to be watched over all the time. It all adds up to make ninth grade a lot more trouble than Elsie had counted on",
