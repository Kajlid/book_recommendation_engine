  "description": "Initially, gallery manager Jane Laine isn't very impressed with \"it\" artist Ian Rhys-Fitzsimmons. Which could be kind of a problem, since she's the one who has to accompany him on a five-month international art fair tour. To get through it all, Jane figures she'll be a good sport and keep her critiques to herself. She's preoccupied enough with mending her own broken heart, re-thinking her career path, and dealing with her Schnauzer-obsessed family. But now, traveling with this alleged genius from London to Rome and beyond, she starts to understand the connection between art and love - and the fact that in both, perspective is everything.",
