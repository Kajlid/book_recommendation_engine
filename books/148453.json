  "description": "Cariad means love... discover the new Cariad Singles collection of spicy romances.  Marnie Lewis is certain that one of her friends – handsome but awkward Brandon– hates her guts. The last thing she wants to do is go on a luscious weekend away with him and a few other buddies, to a cabin in the woods. But when she catches Brandon doing something very dirty after a night spent listening to her relate some of her sexcapades to everyone, she can’t resist pushing his buttons a little harder. He might seem like a prude, but Marnie suspects he likes a little dirty talk. And Marnie has no problems inciting his long dormant desires.",
