  "description": "Clara Kozlowski is stuck, confused, and afraid that somehow she has wasted her life. After she overcomes her fears that she is undeserving of another chance, Clara declares emotional bankruptcy, leaves the middle-class nonsense behind, and sets out to follow up on the life she surrendered long ago. Nearly two days later, Clara arrives at her sister's house, grappling with both heartfelt and reckless decisions that lead her to the railroad tracks in the middle of the night. Officer Nelson Little has already had quite a week when he watches a lone woman from afar as she stands in the street at two in the morning watching a train pass. When their paths finally cross a short time later, Clara is contemplating whether it is too late to build a future that may not even exist for her while Officer Little is attempting to come to grips with his unfulfilled dreams. Finally when Clara decides all life is worth the fight, she heads toward the sea with her sister and Officer Little where everything becomes clear under an ever-changing sky. In this poignant tale, a woman races against time as she catapults herself into an uncertain future and seeks a second chance at the life within her life.",
