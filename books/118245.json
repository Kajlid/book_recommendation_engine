  "description": "CURRENTLY NOT IN PRINT.RE-RELEASE MAY 2016.When we last left the Mind Breakers there were many questions unanswered and numerous troubles looming in their midst. Denni and Jack's supposed relationship has hit the pause button due to a special friend from Jack's past. Liz has lost more than just a sense of who she is. Amos is either missing or dead, no one's quite sure. And as for Alivien, we've yet to really see what this rambunctious redhead is capable of. Now that Cox has been taken into custody, one would think this group of unique beings would have one less thing to worry about. That, however, would not be the case. There are still three other Mind Breakers whose stories have not been told and there are rumors surfacing that there is someone helping Cox from the inside. Liz seems to know the secret, but Jack is weary to hear that the double agent could very well be his best friend. There's a new threat lingering in the distance and it stinks of betrayal. But don't forget, it's not just one foe that's looking for them now.",
