  "title": "The Black Diaspora and Germany / Deutschland und die Schwarze Diaspora",
  "description": "This bilingual volume (English/German) gives insight into the experiences of the Black Diaspora in Germany and the connections of the international Black Dias­po­ra with Germany. Topics range from the 18th century to the present and from social history to literature, art and popular culture. The book includes chapters on political initiatives, theoretical issues, historical overviews and individual case studies. It offers reflections on the rela­tionships between Black German Studies and Critical Whiteness Studies to hegemonic traditions of knowl­edge production, between racism and nationhood, and between colonial history and later developments. Fur­ther topics include the intersectionality of ‘race’, class and gender; and the position of Black people in cultural production, between commodification, performativity and subversion. Chapters include academic analy­ses from History and Cultural Studies, as well as contribu­tions by and about activists, artists and historical wit­nesses, in the form of both essays and interviews.The Editors:The research network Black Diaspora and Germany (BDG, founded in 2007) connects Black and white academics from various disciplines with Black political and cultural activists and the Black Community. A special concern is the combination of academic perspectives with wider socio-political discourses and initiatives.",
