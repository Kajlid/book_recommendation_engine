  "description": "Maggie York, a convent-raised foundling, knows the Duke of Dunwoody’s sexual tastes are a shade or two darker than normal, but marries him anyway—partly because she has no other prospects and partly because, try as she might, she can’t seem to stop fantasizing about her dashing guardian. Two years ago, a voyeuristic experience involving him lured her from the garden of innocence into the orchard of forbidden fruit and she's been hungry for more ever since.Robert Armstrong, the duke, is a Roman Catholic whose extreme devotions as a child colored his desires as a man. He’s also a slave to the times in which he lives--and to his king. Everything he is, everything he holds dear, depends on staying in Charles II’s good graces.Unfortunately, Maggie isn't the king's choice of brides for the young Duke of Dunwoody. Now, to make amends, Robert must choose between the lesser of two evils: whore his wife or be reduced to a penniless commoner.Whose interests will Robert choose to serve, his own, the king’s, or the woman he loves?",
