  "title": "Dancing in the Bamboo Forest",
  "description": "After attending a yoga teacher training course in South India, Djahariah Mitra found herself unable to return to her ordinary life that had left her empty and still. She ignored her return ticket and took a leap of faith. She embarked upon a journey through ancient temples, lush mountain retreats, ashrams, and nightclubs, finding freedom while feeling lost, encountering joy within chaos, learning patience amidst paradox, and revealing the deep inner turmoil of someone seeking balance, all through the lens of yogic philosophy.This intimate memoir gives readers a remarkable perspective of a woman traveling alone, striving through challenges, embracing a vastly different culture, and ultimately finding a profound connection with her own family history, a courage to see her true self, and a passionate sweet love that rocks her heart.",
