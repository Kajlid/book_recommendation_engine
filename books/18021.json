  "title": "Surf's Up!: The Sixth Sherman's Lagoon Collection",
  "description": "In many ways, Sherman is a guy's guy. He eats everything in sight. His so-called smooth moves with his girlfriend sink like a stone. And his happy-go-lucky manner endears him to all of his friends. What makes Sherman atypical is the fact that he's a great white shark whose pals include a smart-aleck hermit crab named Hawthorne, an intellectual fish called Earnest, and a sensible sea turtle known as Fillmore. For more than a decade, the daily adventures of Sherman and his coral companions have delighted readers of Sherman's Lagoon across the globe. Now Sherman and his sea urchin buddies take us for another swim down memory lane with Surf's Up, bringing together Sherman's Lagoon strips from 1994 and 1995. Whether you are a faithful follower of the silly yet sophisticated strip or new to Sherman's underwater world, Surf's Up will be a book you can't put down. Once you've seen the world through the eyes of Sherman, you'll never look at marine life the same way again.",
