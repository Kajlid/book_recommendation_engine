He'll help her lure Russell into dreaded wedded bliss, and she'll pose as his date. Her pies are an added bonus.Except Chloe's wishes begin to go haywire -- starting with granting Nick's and turning all those fake kisses into smoking hot moments of passion. It turns out Chloe’s not as innocent as he first thought.A fake relationship, opposites attract, laugh out loud, sexy romantic comedy.",
