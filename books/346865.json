  "description": "The Cat in the Hat returns for more out-of-control fun in this wintry Beginner Book by Dr. Seuss. It’s a snowy day and Dick and Sally are stuck shovelling . . . until the Cat in the Hat arrives to liven things up (to say the least!). Featuring the Cat’s helpers Little Cat A, Little Cat B, and so on through the alphabet, and ending with a gigantic Voom, 'The Cat in the Hat Comes Back' is a riotous, fun-filled follow-up to Dr. Seuss’s classic 'The Cat in the Hat.'.",
