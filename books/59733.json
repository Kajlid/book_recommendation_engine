  "title": "Dread Souls",
  "description": "In so much of modern fiction, vampires and werewolves have been humanised, turned into anti-heroes or sympathetic characters. But in the original legends and accounts of the hungry dead and man-beasts, there is no sympathy to be found, only savagery and horror. Dread Souls seeks to redress the balance and rediscover the essence of the authentic vampire and the genuine werewolf. In this book, nineteen terrifying accounts have been plucked from the pages of history and retold in modern English, so that contemporary readers may appreciate the dark and nightmarish roots of these most persistent of horrors. This book restores the vampire and the werewolf to their true aspect, as demonic manifestations of bloodlust, cruelty and murder.",
