  "description": "Nestled between the ocean and the hills of Prince Edward Island is a road. This road leads to the house—Green Gables—where a girl named Anne grew up, and to the wonderful place called Avonlea. In this second volume of heartwarming tales by L. M. Montgomery, a Persian cat plays an astonishing part in a marriage proposal; a ghostly appearance in a garden leads a woman to the fulfillment of her youthful dreams; a young girl risks losing her mother to find the father she never knew; and a foolish lie threatens to make an unattached woman a laughingstock when an imaginary lover actually comes to town. Filled with warmth, humor, and mystery, these unforgettable stories re-create the enchanting world of Avonlea.Cover art by Ben Stahl.",
