He makes me remember.He makes me feel something I lost years ago: Safe.And he thinks he can keep me at arm’s length.Once upon a time I was a hero, until the sins of my father caught up with me, and I was forced into darkness.I should've died in that fire. Instead, I served evil men, until I risked it all by walking away.Now I'm a wanted man. At any time, I could be taken down for what I owe.What I don't expect to find in my hiding place is her—broken, beautiful, so damn tempting.I was hired to keep her safe. I shouldn't touch her with my filthy hands.But every day it gets harder, then she starts sneaking into my bed.Together, we're filthy, but together, we can find our way through the flames.(FILTHY is a stand-alone, bodyguard, romantic suspense novel. It contains a fierce, wounded protector and the damaged young woman he’s hired to save. No cheating. No cliffhangers.)",
