  "description": "Meet author Michelle Cunnah and the loveable characters she creates in this young, funny tale of husband-hunting, job-hunting, and—toughest of all—apartment-hunting in New York. A party, a promotion, and at the very least, a proposal. On her thirtieth birthday, Emma Taylor isn't asking for much. Instead, she gets passed over in every way: by her company, by her boyfriend, and even by her party-loving friends, whose idea of the perfect gift is a bottle of breast-enhancing pills. Now, kicked out of her boyfriend's apartment and stuck working for the weenie who beat her out for the job, Emma is miserable, homeless, and sleeping in the back of her car. But who knew what a great place the streets can be for meeting gorgeous men? Emma may not have much filling up her bikini top, but she does have the determination to get back on her feet, so she moves in with sexy Jack (strictly in a landlord/tenant capacity), sticks out her chin (and her chest) and gets tough at work. Maybe flat girls can have some fun . . .",
