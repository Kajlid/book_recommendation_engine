  "description": "A seventy-five year old secret waits in a lovely old portrait studio, at the end of a street in New York City's Lower East Side. It is a secret that drove to madness a renowned photographer, 'Papa' Menashe Reisman, and left him to waste and die in his own studio, haunted by every photograph he tries to take. When his great-grand daughter, Shelly, begs to have the old building for a new renovation, she awakens more than any secret that Papa kept. She also awakens something darker, more evil, across the street, under the stoop, down a foul stair; where Caraliza was kept prisoner for two years; until the horrid events of that summer, in 1919.",
