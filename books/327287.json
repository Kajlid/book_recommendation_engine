  "description": "Harlan is only in Vegas for two nights for his brother’s wedding. His parents want Harlan married, too, and not to a man. What would people say? Not that Harlan cares. He doesn’t like most people, and he enjoys making sure they dislike him in return. He can play nice long enough to finalize a contract or get laid, what more does he need? He definitely doesn’t need a date with his smart-mouthed waiter. But he wants one. Maybe more than one.Apolo doesn’t get paid enough to take crap from customers. On the other hand, he might be willing to take something else from the rude but hot whiskey snob in the expensive suit. Especially since he seems amused rather than offended by Apolo’s attitude. Apolo doesn’t have anything (or anyone) better to do tonight. But if it’s just sex, why has he somehow agreed to go to a wedding with Harlan? As Harlan’s husband?Harlan is abrasive and Apolo is prickly. They both want the last word and neither likes to lose. Is it possible that being equally stubborn is how they both win?",
