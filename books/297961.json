Peter Pan Man still struggled to look forward as regret held him captive in the shadows of his ruined career. Although The Show, his rise-and-fall inspired novel, ushered in the fresh start he craved, it would be a new manuscript, born in the newspaper pages of local business opportunities, which set him on the course he was meant to take. Handed to him in a grocery store by an old man with a meticulous beard and a smile, one advertisement was circled in red pen. It would be a small fitness center in a sleepy and dreamy beachside town that inspired him to write on. After purchasing The Gym, he continued to chase stars while masking the pain, unaware that the moments unfolding was shaping his destiny.  Love can come in the form of escape and intrigue, adventure, and misery. But, like the light that pixie dust can render, love can manifest in coincidence and magic, tenderness and certainty. With the end of a journey and the beginning of a new quest, Peter Pan Man finds the gentle strength in him he never knew existed.",
