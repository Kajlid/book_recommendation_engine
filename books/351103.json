  "title": "The Bloom County Library, Vol. 2: 1982-1984",
  "description": "Bloom County burst onto the American comic scene in December of 1980 and it soon became one of the most popular comic strips of all time. The quirky denizens of the strip included Milo Bloom, Steve Dallas, Michael Binkley, Cutter John, Bill the Cat, and Opus the penguin, along with so many others.Â Volume Two of the Bloom County Library continues right where volume one left off, with Berkeley Breathed's endearing, enchanting, and occasionally infuriating inhabitants of Bloom County treating us to their madcap adventures, cynical observations, and optimistic innocence - sometimes all at once!",
