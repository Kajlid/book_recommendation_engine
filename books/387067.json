  "description": "Sometimes we need to examine carefully the things we think we the pet shop owner in town, the teenage girl who lives next door, the people with whom we work, or the nice man who walks his dog each evening in our neighborhood.The stories in this collection will drive that point home, and perhaps give you reason to re-define the word \"inhuman.\"In this quirky and literate collection, crime comes in many forms and sometimes the mystery surrounding it is why we didn't see it before it was too late. Take wild trip through a bumpy minefield of human - and otherwise - endeavor and see what makes us tick.But read it with the lights on.\"Kate Thornton's imagination is only exceeded by her talent as a storyteller. From the sci-fi fascinations of Mare Tranquillitatus to the darkly provocative Working in the Suburbs, Thornton takes us on an impish joy ride through a mind field of criminal intents. Inhuman Condition is a rare and evocative find among story collections.\" -Darrell James, Award Winning Author of Body Count  \"In Inhuman Condition , noted short story author Kate Thornton has compiled some of her finest tales into one fun and exciting read. Whether you are a fan of science fiction, crime fiction or just good fiction, you will enjoy this diverse collection that smacks of the same juicy eeriness as found in classic Twilight Zone episodes.\"  - Sue Ann Jaffarian, best-selling author of the Odelia Grey, Ghost of Granny Apples, and Fang-in-Cheek mysteries",
