DESCRIPTION: Federation diplomat, Gloria Spencer, is delighted to be on vacation. Posted to the superfluous position of third protocol officer at the Federation embassy on the trading and entertainment planet of Bellasport, she is not even expected to show up at the office. But, almost from the first day, her dream vacation begins to fall apart. She is dismayed when the ambassador requires her to handle a trade delegation for a few days. In the weeks that follow, her heart is broken as her long sought after romance stalls. When aliens pop out of orbit to ring Bellasport, the ambassador tasks a terrified Gloria to go up and meet with them. After they turn out to be hostile, she and the crew of her courier spaceship attempt to escape, but the aliens follow them to the planet Lotusandra. Forced to make a last stand, she and the spaceship crew must figure out how to save their lives and the lives of everyone else on the planet. 16 pen and ink illustrations:a few located at the end of each chapter. 82,529 words. first contact, suspense, female protagonist, artificial intelligence, cat, spiritual, diplomacy",
