  "description": "Erica Boyd is just trying to keep her life in one piece. But a family feud and a far-too-attractive newcomer threaten to blow it to pieces.Try as she might, Erica can't quite escape the maelstrom of her mother's ambition to control every aspect of a project to honor Howard and Bridget Taylor, beloved pillars of the Whitehall, Texas, community from years gone by. Whitehall’s competition for queen of the social scene is fierce--different factions have different ideas about how to honor the Taylors. Erica's closeted relationship with Alice Goodman is hanging by a thread, and for reasons she won’t explain, Erica’s grandmother is actively resisting the whole Taylor history project, creating a generational feud with Erica caught in the middle.Everybody knows that Howard Taylor and bride Bridget emigrated from England back in 1912. When the frazzled local historian can’t confirm it, she's replaced with a professional: out and audacious Rae, who jumps into the already powder keg situation. Erica's mesmerized attraction to the dynamic Rae--and the rumor of a sealed diary--lights the fuse on this story of small town society, survival and secrets.Megan Carter (Passionate Kisses) brings her readers a lighthearted story of then and now with another cast of her unforgettable characters. Winner, Golden Crown Award for Historical Romance.",
