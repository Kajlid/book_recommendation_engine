  "description": "PaigeLonerOutcastCharity caseOrphanI was all those things.Years after my parents died, I was still being bullied, and it was all led by my cousins.They hated me for years as children, and moving into their house didn't make them change their minds about me.I was counting down the days until I could finally get away from every single person in this town.Until there was one person I wasn't so sure I wanted to leave.ReidMy life since age 7 revolved around football and what it would take for me to get into the NFL.I didn't have time for girls or parties.I had never been tempted that could take my mind away from the sport.Until I walked into my new school on my first day of senior year.It wasn't long before we both realized that someone didn't like that we had found each other.*Note from author*While this high school romance does have elements of bullying, you will find that the hero never once says a negative thing to his girl.For the safety conscious - this is guaranteed safe!Just because it is set in high school doesn't mean it doesn't have adult situations in it. Only intended for those over the age of 18.",
