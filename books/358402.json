  "title": "FoxTrot Sundaes: A FoxTrot Collection",
  "description": "Our cartoon with the broadest appeal. In January 2007, FoxTrot became a Sunday only cartoon. This is a collection of Sundays since then.FoxTrot Sundaes is a cool treat that follows the amusingly chaotic lives of the Fox family--Jason, Peter, Paige, and their parents, Roger and Andy--since FoxTrot became a Sunday-only comic strip.In this anthology, Amend gathers all the color Sunday comic strips since FoxTrot went weekly and delivers a concentrated dose of his irreverent take on teen and family life. It's a concoction so consistently fresh and funny that in 2007 the National Cartoonists Society presented Bill Amend with its prestigious Reuben Award.With FoxTrot Sundaes , fans get a full serving of the hits-close-to-home humor that is the hallmark of the strip.",
