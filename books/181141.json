  "description": "As concertmaster of the London Symphony Orchestra, Lee Allison is an expert at navigating the cutthroat, high-class world of elite musicians. A talented but mercurial violinist, he has his hopes set on a solo career -- until a shadow from his past reappears, dredging up long-forgotten memories and jeopardizing his plans.  New conductor Harry Linden represents everything Lee despises. He's young, showy, and shallow, and his brash vision for the orchestra sets Lee's teeth on edge. He's also strikingly handsome. An annoying, infuriatingly alluring distraction who is well out of Lee's league both in looks and career... or so Lee thinks.  As their clashes over the music heat up, professional jealousy begins to mix with an undeniable mutual attraction -- one that threatens to turn physical at any moment. Can Lee maintain control over the orchestra and his heart? Or will memories of their painful past unravel everything?",
