For on that foggy beach, Leah Frankel unexpectedly had demanded to be born, and Kyle, a total stranger, had helped Roberta bring her baby into the world.They hadn't met since that day, yet time and the letters they shared gave rise to an unusual and compelling intimacy, while allowing them ample room for speculation and fantasy. Now, five years to the day, they were to meet again.",
