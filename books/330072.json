  "description": "A story inspired by a doll and her world, and people and times long pastWhen young Josie Harwood is forced to stay at Miss Gordy’s gloomy old house down the road, she’s prepared for the worst – a dreary waste of the holidays with a creepy old lady. But she soon finds out that Bramstone Hall harbours things far more unpleasant than Miss Gordy.An encounter with a creature emerging from the walls is a clear sign that something is terribly wrong at the Hall and the unsolved mystery of the children who went missing over a century ago is far from dead. As Josie finds herself increasingly drawn into their lost world, she must find the courage and determination to lift the children’s curse or doom them all to a fate worse than death.Haunting and surreal, The Lost Children of Gloam's End weaves together evocative original art and antique photographs in a magical tale of loss, love and redemption.Note: This is the black and white version. A premium full-color version is also available at the author's website.",
