  "description": "Up From Slavery is the 1901 autobiography of Booker T. Washington detailing his personal experiences in working to rise from the position of a slave child during the Civil War, to the difficulties and obstacles he overcame to get an education at the new Hampton University, to his work establishing vocational schools—most notably the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama—to help black people and other disadvantaged minorities learn useful, marketable skills and work to pull themselves up.  This autobiography chronicles more than forty years of Washington's life.  This book was a best-seller and remains one of the most popular African-American autobiographies.",
