  "description": "Meet Benjamin Bunny, Peter Rabbit's cousin!Peter Rabbit's cousin, Benjamin Bunny, has been a very popular character since this book's first publication in 1904. In this tale, we hear all about his and Peter's adventures in Mr. McGregor's vegetable garden, and what happens to them when they meet a cat! And perhaps even more frightening, what happens to the two cheeky bunnies when Old Mr. Benjamin Bunny finds out what they have been up to!The world that Peter Rabbit first introduced to us in 1902 is still today one of Beatrix Potter's most popular and well-loved worlds. What started as an endearing story about a bunny rabbit would soon become the first ember for the illustrious series that is 'The World of Beatrix Potter', and a story which has endured retelling after retelling at bedtimes all over the world. \nBeatrix Potter\n (1866–1943) loved the countryside and spent much of her childhood drawing and studying animals. 'The Tale of Peter Rabbit', first published in 1902, was her first book. She later went on to publish more than twenty tales & collections of rhymes.Age Rating: 3–12+ / Preschool - 2+ / Lexile Measure 890L",
