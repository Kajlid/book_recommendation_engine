  "description": "Willow’s existence is not easy. Having narcolepsy is bad enough without her bond to an arrogant maistre, vampire extermination agents eradicating her kind, and “friends” with ulterior motives. Being undead could seem more of a hassle than being alive.But Willow has had enough.After all the betrayals and abuse—even with her sleep disorder—she refuses to take things lying down. It’ll take more than performing for necrophiliacs at a fetish club to make Willow’s existence worthwhile. Now, she’s on a mission to get her heart back. A mission that may liberate or destroy her…and everyone around her. With the help of powerful supernatural colleagues and Remi, her lover with a personality disorder, she faces danger. And she's determined to win this time.THIS IS PART TWO OF THE NARCOLEPTIC VAMPIRE SERIES. BE SURE TO READ SLEEPY WILLOW'S BONDED SOUL FIRST, AS THIS ONE PICKS UP RIGHT WHERE IT LEFT OFF.Same warning applies: This book is not for the easily offended or squeamish. Bad language, explicit scenes, and gore abounds.",
