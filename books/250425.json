Used to footloose-and-fancy-free, no-strings-attached friendships, she soon learns such a relationship is not an option.In her submission to Vance, Aubrey will discover that being single and having fun have absolutely nothing to do with Novel is a stand-alone, however, for better reader enjoyment, we recommend reading Tied and Temping first.",
