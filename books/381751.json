Former reporter Art MacKenzie and his spiritual mentor, Johanen, are desperate to try to locate it. But a fallen angel---and the organization known as the Cadre---will kill to get their hands on it.Meanwhile, escalating wars, disease, famine, and the instability of third world nations prompts a secret government think tank to move its Doomsday clock to midnight. Threatening war between a confederacy of Arab states against Israel, threads of biblical prophecy, and alien and UFO activity drive this tension-filled story to its thrilling climax.",
