  "description": "Severine McClennan, a 16-year-old runaway, finds herself down but not out on the streets of London. An urban underground subculture is just waiting to be explored. But above ground not all is on the level. Danger stalks the streets and cash rich offices of The City of London. Who can be trusted? The sinister gangs on the prowl looking for easy pickings? Max Livingstone, a rich computer geek hacker, whose father owns a bank? Playboy banker, Anton Ivanov, with a taste for the high life? Loyalties are tested and passions inflamed, as murder sets the agenda for a frantic race against time to unravel a deadly plot. Praise for The Trade - 'A roller-coaster of a read that will grip you until the last page' - Tom Kasey, best-selling author of Trade-Off",
