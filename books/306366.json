  "description": "How to Write Poetry: A Tutorial, Book 3: Advanced is intended to assist the mature poet. It is expected that such a person is familiar with most of the famous poetic works from the long-past as well as from recent history. It is also likely such a person has accomplished quite a lot of writing, may belong to a poetry club (online or in their town), and perhaps participates in open-mic readings. This book is for someone looking to hone their craft and consider ways of continuing to develop their poetic writing skills. The creative process of writing, becoming more relevant, finding inspiration, discovering and creating new forms, and overcoming writerâ€™s block are a few of the topics that are addressed in this volume.",
