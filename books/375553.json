  "description": "Caroline Clemens comes to a scandalous arrangement with Dominic Savage. Penniless and responsible for four younger siblings following the death of their debt-ridden father, she agrees to become the willing plaything of this darkly dangerous man who has saved her family from the workhouse—and in repayment, she will fulfill his every physical need. . . eagerly and without hesitation.Rather than feel shamed by her long fall from innocence, Caroline finds her new life exhilarating—for Savage is a remarkably skilled lover who knows the secret places to enter, taste, and touch that will drive a woman to new heights of ecstasy. He would never falsely promise her a wedding—unlike her faithless fiancé, who betrayed, insulted, and abandoned her. And she will repay his honesty with night after torrid night of delicious erotic games, taking their passion further than either of them ever dreamed possible.But Dominic will not be satisfied with owning Caroline's ripe and luscious body, for he secretly desires the one thing that she dares not surrender to him. Dominic wants Caroline's heart. . . and he will not rest until she succumbs.",
