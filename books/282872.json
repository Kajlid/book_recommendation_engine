  "description": "It takes a special kind of virgin to bind a unicorn. Scott would never have dreamed he was pure of body, heart and soul, but then he had no cause to believe unicorns even existed until he reluctantly drove to Del Fantasma late one night to rescue his stranded brother, Bryan. Jack may be a unicorn, but he's he avoids virgins like the plague. The chances of meeting that special type of virgin is slim-to-none in bars like Del Fantasma and he delights in every opportunity to feed his own lusty appetites while he can. After all, a unicorn may be undeniably attracted to virgins but that doesn't mean he has to be one himself. Unfortunately for Jack's plans, their bond is instantly formed when he meets Scott. Jack is now Scott's to command. He just has to convince him what he is, something that sounds a lot easier than it is. And Bryan? Well, it turns out that their meeting wasn't entirely by chance. Bryan was instructed by a group of vampires to get the two together. Now that he has, can Jack and Scott discover the threat against them and save Bryan in time?",
