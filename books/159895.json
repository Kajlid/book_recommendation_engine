Hunky tough guy Sal and his smart and sexy wife Gemma are newlyweds and enjoying peace and happiness for a change. Life is good.  Until an ambush in a bar changes everything. Allegiances are questioned. Relationships are frayed. And the Gabrini men go to war to avenge a different kind of enemy, one foolish (or cunning) enough to dare to harm their loved ones.
