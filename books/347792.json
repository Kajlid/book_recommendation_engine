  "description": "Amber Brown has come up with a fantastic costume, but it's a secret.  She won't even tell Justin, no matter what he bribes her with. But one thing worries Amber all day.  Her parents had a fight before school.  What if they don't make up before their traditional Halloween dinner (macaroni and cheese, carrots, and orange juice)?  What if they are in bad moods during trick-or-treating?  Halloween is one of Amber's favorite holidays, and of course this one turns out to be as wonderful as all the rest.",
