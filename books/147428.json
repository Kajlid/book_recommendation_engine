  "description": "Vietnamese Diaspora Vietnamese refugees who escaped by sea and land to camps throughout Southeast Asia, then came to California to begin new lives, wrote with their suffering a saga of world history that should not be forgotten. Theirs is a story of defeat, escape, and renewal. Based on anonymous interviews by the Director of a large program for Vietnamese refugees in Orange County, California, in the early 1980s, Vietnamese Diaspora is a compilation of fear and hope that is the by-product of war. The interviewees speak for themselves.",
