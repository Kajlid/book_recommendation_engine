  "description": "I will never be controlled again.  \n A manipulative dragon shifter. A sexy phaetyn prince. Me? I shouldn’t even exist.\n  With peace established in Verald, I should be free; Lord Tyrrik is liberated from his blood oath, after all. But the freedom in Verald is an illusion. If I remain, destruction will surely follow.  As soon as I come into my powers, the blood-thirsty emperor of Draecon will know. Even now, he is hunting me.  When a Phaetyn prince arrives promising safety, the solution seems perfect. A little too perfect. But is the objective of our group security or something more? Because everyone is telling me what my goals should be.  Who do you trust when everyone has lied to you?  Should I listen with my head – or my heart?  I might not get a choice.  If you love dark fantasy, you'll be riveted by The Darkest Drae Series because of the pulse-pounding action and slow-burn romance. Scoll up and one-click now!",
