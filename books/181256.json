  "description": "My name is Dewey--Inspector Dewey. I live in the big green house on Hampshire Avenue with my family: Thumper, Lily, and Anna. I am the Big Cat responsible for keeping everyone safe and in order. I do this quite well, in spite of the fact that managing my family is like, well, herding cats! Mostly our life is peaceful. But one night it wasn't. That was the night the bad guy showed up on our block. Of course, I knew exactly how to out-smart the outlaw, but--miserable mullet!--would Anna and the police understand my instructions? To find out how the adventure ended, you'll have to read my book. But I'll give you a hint: there's a reason I'm called INSPECTOR Dewey.",
