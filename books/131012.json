He even found a father figure in the famed necromancer who owns the place.Life was perfect… until a superband of overpowered do-gooders arrived bent on burglary and murder. These mercilessly righteous warriors of light cannot be beaten, or at least that’s how it looks on paper.Jack must choose between survival and the people he loves… unless he can somehow defy the stats and find an unconventional solution. If you like Terry Pratchett, J. Zachary Pike, or Nicholas Eames, you’ll love Majordomo. Buy now, before the price goes up or the murderhobos descend.",
