  "title": "Starbucks Bitches",
  "description": "In this 50 Shades of Grey rival, five very diverse women band together to form an unlikely, but unbreakable circle of friends, collaborating and scheming their way to better relationships and better lives. When one of them vanishes suspiciously, the others must work together to find her before she disappears forever. With a wide range of emotional and complicated relationships that span the highs (and lows) of life, Starbucks Bitches takes the reader on a wild ride that is deeply touching, thought provoking, and intensely romantic. One of the most erotically charged and overtly sexual novels of the century, Starbucks Bitches is an unprecedented adventure in love, lust, and unconditional friendship. Readers have referred to this novel as \"60 Shades of Grey\" in reference to the depth and intensity of content, as well as the length of the book. (Starbucks Bitches is 20% longer than \"50 Shades of Grey\").",
