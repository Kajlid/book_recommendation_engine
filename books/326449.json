  "description": "When Daphne Ferber arrives in Berlin for a fresh start in a thrilling new city, the last thing she expects is to run into more drama than she left behind.Of course, she knew she’d need to do the usual: make new friends, acquire some lovers, grapple with German and a whole new way of life. She even expected the long nights gorging alone on family-sized jars of Nutella, and the pitfalls of online dating in another language. The paranoia, the second-guessing of her every choice, the covert behaviours? Probably comes with the territory.But one night, something strange, dangerous and entirely unexpected intervenes, and life in bohemian Kreuzberg suddenly doesn’t seem so cool.Just how much trouble is Daphne in, and who – or what – is out to get her?Channelling the modern female experience with razor-sharp observation and witty flair, Berlin announces Bea Setton as an electrifying literary voice for her generation.A fresh, wry, piercingly contemporary debut about a young woman who moves to Berlin to escape her demons - and what she finds there. For fans of My Year of Rest and Relaxation and Exciting Times.",
