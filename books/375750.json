  "description": "This book attempts an assessment of the place of Lenin in history and of the revolution which was his life's work. The Bolshevik Party itself; an account of the features which differentiate it from other socialist parties; the agrarian policy of this party in a country where peasants formed 80% of the population; the political philosophy which inspired the revolution and the soviet state; Lenin's critique of imperialism and his definition of the national and international policy which the rulers of the Soviet state should pursue - these are some of the subjects considered in this study of Lenin and the Russian revolution.",
