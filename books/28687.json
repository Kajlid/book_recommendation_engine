  "title": "The New American Homestead: Sustainable, Self-Sufficient Living in the Country or in the City",
  "description": "Learn how to live sustainably in the city, the suburbs, or the country Many people are cutting back on consumerism and trying to simplify their lives, realizing that the \"\"new way\"\" isn't necessarily the best way. The sustainable living movement goes beyond a desire to protect the environment and practice green living; it's about rediscovering simple survival skills that, in an earlier time, were known and practiced by almost everyone. The New American Homestead gives you a wealth of information about homesteading—a lifestyle of simple, agrarian self-sufficiency—from raising chickens, bees, and other animals to gardening in earth-friendly ways to canning, preserving, home brewing, and cheese making. The book does not assume that you have a sizable parcel of land in the country; author John Tullock's techniques can be put to use in virtually any space, even a small urban plot. Whether you're dwelling in the country, suburbs, or the city, The New American Homestead shows you how to live a more sustainable life.",
