  "title": "Possession: A Romance",
  "description": "Winner of England's Booker Prize and a literary sensation Possession is an exhilarating novel of wit and romance, at once an intellectual mystery and a triumphant love story. As a pair of young scholars research the lives of two Victorian poets, they uncover their letters, journals, and poems, and track their movements from London to Yorkshire -- from spiritualist s√©nces to the fairy-haunted far west of Brittany. What emerges is an extraordinary counterpoint of passion and ideas.Performed by Virginia Leishman",
