  "title": "Taurus Moon: Relic Hunter",
  "description": "Taurus Moon is a relic hunter, but the artifacts he searches for arenâ€™t found in the jungles of the Yucatan or the deserts of Egypt. His quests often take him through the grittier parts of urbanized cities where even the toughest of thugs fear to tread. Forgotten relics once thought of as only myths and legends can be found, if you know where to look, and have the guts to go searching into dark and deadly places. Taurus Moon is hired by a vampire crime lord to locate ancient artifacts that would make the criminal a God. Even though Taurus is no fan of vampires, especially one aspiring to become a Deity, he does love money and despite his misgivings, he begins the treacherous hunt for the artifacts. Things become more complicated when a rival crime lord hires a ruthless relic hunter who has no qualms about killing the competition.",
