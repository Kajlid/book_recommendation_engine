Not now, not with everyone watching her, they expected her to act like a grieving widow. If she didn’t, they’d forever brand her as an unloving wife.She hated the farce, but she had no choice. No one knew her marriage had turned into a sham long before Craig died.A few minutes later, she walked outside and breathed a sigh of relief.

Spinning on her heels, she faced Hagan.At the end of the porch, one foot already positioned on the first step with a hand out to assist her, he waited. “So, Jen, since we’re done for today, why don’t we meet tomorrow night for dinner?”Jen edged backward and her butt hit the closed door. The urge to run away from his undeniable magnetism, and the problems he’d cause, sent her mind into a tail spin.What in the hell should I do now?",
