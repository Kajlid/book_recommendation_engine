  "description": "Beautiful, accomplished and a little uptight, Tracy Emerson thinks she has it all figured out, particularly when it comes to the kind of man she wants to end up with. And she knows for sure that Brendan Cole is not The One. First of all, he works in the music business, with rappers no less! His lifestyle is wholly unsuitable for a long-term partner, and not at all compatible with hers. But she can't help that she's incredibly attracted to him and also can't overlook that he's always treated her better than any man ever has. So what would be the harm in spending time with him until someone more appropriate comes along? But soon Brendan's spirit and spontaneity break down Tracy's walls and have her questioning whether her criteria for the perfect man might not be all screwed up. Then, to make matters worse, as secrets and lies from her past begin to unravel, Tracy wonders whether she might not also be a little screwed up, and not at all the kind of woman Brendan would want in his future . . .",
