  "description": "It’s been two months since Rune Leveau, aka Anna Masterson, survived the machinations of the Kodiak corporation and things have been relatively peaceful in the iconic bar, the Lucky Devil.The peace couldn’t last.The corporate entities that rule her Chicago are not through with the Finder yet and the other powers-that-be don’t intend to be left in the dust. The key is finding the Masterson Files, a computer program with the impossible ability to cast magic. Now the Magic Guild is wanting a word with her and as trouble in the form of the Faerie King converges at her bar, Rune finds herself in the center of warring factions battling it out with bullets and magic.Which is exactly the right moment for the cybernetically augmented corporate spy, St. Benedict to come back into her life. But can these two survive the lies that lay between them? More importantly, can Rune get the Saint of Liars to help her answer the one question she’s burning to where is Justin Masterson?",
