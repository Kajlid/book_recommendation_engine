  "description": "From the back cover... THE ELEMENTALS Water. The ice caps melt, the seas rise, and Kesair, a woman of Atlantis, leads a handful of surviviors on a desperate search for land- and a new beginning. Fire. All the world centers around the empire of Crete, where Meriones, a humble musician, performs before the mighty in their palaces. Until the land shakes, the volcano speaks with a voice of fire, and Meriones finds his life changed forever. Earth. Old beyond imagining, the Earth knows neither hate nor pity. And from Annie Murphy, a strong-willed New England housewife, it demands a sacrifice both unexpected and irrevocable. Air. The ozone dwindles, the forests die, and new plagues walk the world. One day just after tomorrow, another small party of surviviors comes together on a desolate Indian reservation. As the ice melts and the sea rises once more, they fight one last battle for the Earth-for mankind and hope.",
