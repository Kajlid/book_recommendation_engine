  "title": "Sky Songs II: Spiritual SF",
  "description": "This collection of 17 stories is a sequel to the original Sky Songs anthology, also edited by Stanton, and a few of the same authors are represented. Again, all the writers are Christian, and the stories cover a broad territory of what can be called speculative fiction. This time, however, most of the stories (first published mostly from 1998-2004) are taken from periodicals other than Dreams and Visions, both Christian and secular.",
