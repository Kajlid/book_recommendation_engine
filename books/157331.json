  "title": "Port Royal",
  "description": "Port Royal, the sole British port in the \"Spanish Main\" and filled with pirates, privateers, and women of easy virtue. It was known as the most sinful city in the world. No pleasure, no matter how perverse could not be purchased for the right amount of gold. Captain Harry Pierce was both trader in pirate's plunder and the captain of a fighting ship, a privateer licensed by the British Crown to sink and loot the ships of Spain. Based in Port Royal he lived like a king and bought and sold legally indentured Irish servants, including his own private harem to serve his sadistic purposes. In addition he had his choice of the high born Spanish ladies taken from captured Spanish ships. But Port Royal was also the most dangerous place in the world, and his life was under constant threat from the cutlasses of drunken pirates to the knives of the companions of his bed. But Spain had plans to deal with this pirate base, and Harry would soon find himself fighting for his life against assassins and Spanish canon, with pieces of eight, beautiful women and the very survival of Port Royal itself as the ultimate prize.",
