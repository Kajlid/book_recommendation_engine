  "description": "What would you do if you suddenly found yourself twenty-five years in the past? For the nine-billion people of the year 2042 it's no longer a question ... it is a reality. This is a hidden gem that would be a pure shame to miss. Toward Yesterday is an apocalyptic, science fiction thriller, that kept me sneaking away to read my Kindle for the entire Memorial Day weekend. Engrossing, thought-provoking, filled with lasting, vivid imagery...the story gripped me early, and didn't let go.Â If you like post-apocalyptic books, you will thoroughly enjoy this one. The scenes surrounding the \"event\" are worth the price of admission alone. Some of the best apocalyptic imagery and action I have ever read. For a first time author, this is an impressive accomplishment, and for a self-published title, it contains few, if any, grammar or typo errors. You will not regret purchasing this book.\"~ Steven Konkoly, author of The Jakarta Pandemic ~ Word 74,000When a seemingly simple experiment goes disastrously wrong, James Baston finds himself stranded alongside the rest of mankind, twenty-five years in the past.
