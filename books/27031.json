  "title": "The Penguin Book of Caribbean Short Stories",
  "description": "Spanning the history of the genre, this major anthology reflects the enormous diversity and richness of Caribbean writing. E. A. Markham's generous selection includes pre-Columbian legends and myths deriving from India and Africa, a mildly Gothic tale from Frank Collymore, updated Anancy stories from Andrew Salkey, a sermon preached by a bishop and the documented experience of Sistren in the 1970s. Many of the stories are an evocative reminder of the turbulent history of the regionenforced transportation of Africans, East Indian indenture and subsequent migration. There are stories from Eric Walrond and Claude McKay, who contributed to the Harlem Renaissance, and works of social realism by, among others, C. L. R. James and Seepersad Naipaul, part of the literary awakening in Trinidad in the late 1920s.",
