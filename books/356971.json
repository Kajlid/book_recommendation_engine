  "description": "WHIM tells the story of a very special Indian boy who has been sent to earth by his Father, Lord Chance, to find Ultimate Truth. Trying to pursue U.T. when you're a high school football star just discovering sex and love, and when you're one of the last members of an Indian tribe that tries to keep itself invisible from humans, proves to be disastrous. Whim is particularly distracted from his quest by his love for the brainy, sexy, but very moral Dawn. It's only when his Montauk mentor Grain-of-Sand tells him he must find U.T. to save the Montauk nation that Whim finally gets moving. Ater Zen-like encounters with Grain-of-Sand, with Narsufin, a great black Sufi Sage famous for his hook shot, and with the Abominable Snowman Sage of the Himilayas, Whim finally manages to find U.T., save the Montauk Nation, and win the heart and all other bodily parts of his beloved Dawn.",
