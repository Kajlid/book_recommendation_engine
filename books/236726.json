  "description": "From USA Today Bestselling author Katerina Martinez  My name is Maxine Cartwright, and as of this morning, I'm a fugitive.  New Seattle is a Shining City, one of the few remaining oases of civilization left in the world, but it isn't without it's problems. That's where I come in. I'm a hunter; a mage employed by the Faction to hunt down Fallen mages and bring them in dead or alive. It's a good gig, and one I've been doing for years. I have a reputation, or notoriety, depending on how you see things, and more enemies than I can count. Now one of those enemies is trying to frame me for a terrible crime I didn't commit, and the worst part is my own people can't look me in the eye and tell me they know I'm innocent. My only choice is to run away from the only life I've ever known, and figure out who is going out of their way to put me down.  Cut off from my friends and the people I once relied on for backup, I reluctantly accept the help of a man wanted for questioning concerning his potential ties to the Fallen. How am I supposed to trust someone who could be a terrorist? Then again, how can he trust me? Proving my innocence will be the hardest thing I've ever done, but before I can do that I'm going to have to learn the truth about the world I live in, and uncover the lies I've been told my whole life.  \nPre-order Smoke and Shadows today, and find out what the Order of Prometheus really is!",
