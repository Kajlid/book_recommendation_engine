  "description": "LAPD homicide detective Kate Delafield is summoned to a scene of savagery: a restaurant kitchen awash in the blood of a young gay man found dead from multiple stab wounds. But finding his killer is only the first of Kate's challenges. Shielding her young lover from this brutal crime with its seemingly ever-widening consequences, she contends with a homophobic partner who shows minimal interest in the case. Kate must also find clear answers to mystifying questions about the crime scene for a prosecuting attorney handling her first homicide. Meanwhile, the killer's attorney, the only man who knows the truth about Kate's sexuality, is preparing a \"homosexual panic\" defense. Can Kate testify for the prosecution and keep her integrity intact?",
