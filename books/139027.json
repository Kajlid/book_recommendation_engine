  "description": "Rumour has it that the land of King Clover, which is situated in the large country of Bavaria, has the shape of a four-leaf clover. Should you be able to fly as high as a swallow, you would see that the land consists of four equal parts.King and Queen Clover live in Northland, where you will find the high Alps.Their son Prime built his castle in Southland, where the deep lakes are filled with fish.Prince Dozen, the middle son, reigns in Eastland.Ruff Rumble, the youngest prince, built a castle of black granite in Westland. Everybody calls it Robber’s Nest, and I work there in the kitchen. . . .Oh, by the way, my name is Alex. I am only a boy. But I have had many adventures. Together with Shabby Tabby Chum, an old grey tomcat.If I start by telling you that the cat and I can talk to each other and that I am as small as he is, nobody will believe me—let alone that I claim that Shabby Tabby Chum and I have made friends with a wolpertinger. . . . Better that I tell everything from the beginning, from the moment I stood eye to eye with this giant prince Ruff Rumble of Westland!",
