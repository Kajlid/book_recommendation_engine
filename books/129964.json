A cataclysmic secret is brewing in the labs, which has the capacity to threaten the world. With Claude Van Buren by her side, she never knows whether she is in the company of family, or a lunatic on the brink of world destruction. It is a madcap journey into the lives of six unique teenagers destined for greatness...one way or another.",
