  "description": "If you have even read a book by this author, Gregory Lessing Garrett, you will know what to expect in this third book release of his: A tour de force of compelling research, empirical evidence, razor-sharp wit, and argumentation and proofs that would put Aristotle and Socrates to shame. This is that type of book, as well. If you have it in your hands, you have hit the motherload of Earth Topology and the Holy Grail of Earth and Man's deepest secrets.   Essentially, this book is an Anthology of Gregory Lessing Garrett's writings and others on the topic of Flat Earth Plane Cosmology of all types, including Enclosed Earth, Hollow Earth, Concave Earth, Infinite Plane Earth, and The Enochian Earth Model, etc. Mr. Garrett has assembled the best research on the general idea of Flat Plane Earth possible and posits various explanations, theories, observations, conjectures, and empirical facts regarding this topic. This book is book one of The Flat Earth Trilogy Book of Secrets series he is writing to encompass the full regalia of core themes of Flat Earth, as well as going into great detail into various theories otherwise not explored within the traditional cannons of Flat Earth pedagogy.   Mr. Garrett's hope is that the ideas expounded in this informative and eloquently written Flat Earth Trilogy series will provide compelling justifications for the claim that no curvature can be found on the Earth, which points to the empirical conclusion that we live on a plane and not a spinning ball in science fiction outer space. The details regarding the possible topography of the Earth are discussed in great depth in this book, but ultimately, the absolute true topography of the Earth is still under investigation.   The author has his preferences of course, but in laying out as much information and theoretical material as possible pertaining to the topic of Flat Earth, he would hope that the reader would draw his/her own conclusions and create a uniquely personal geographical preference. As Mr. Garrett has mentioned in other books he has written, it is never any ONE data point that proves the validity or non-validity of a theory like Flat Earth or any other theory. Rather, it is the summation of myriads of data points that point to the high plausibility of such a theory as an almost certainty, which is as good as science ever gets, ultimately.   For instance, the world used to subscribe to a Flat Plane Model, then it was a Geocentric Sphere Model, and then a Heliocentric Sphere Model, and now it is a Flat Plane Model, again. The data points amassed to support the Flat Plane Model of the Earth, though the details of that model are still being investigated by millions of people even as you read this, suggest a wide array of possible Earth topologies, including models such as Enclosed Cosmology, Hollow Earth Cosmology, Geo-Stationary Earth Cosmology, Infinite Plane Earth Cosmology, etc.   Lastly, Mr. Garret proposes with compelling evidence that The Vatican Jesuit Priesthood has done all they can to baffle and confound the world with extraneous and misleading mathematics to create convoluted and superfluous details to hide the true topography of the Earth, for reasons Mr. Garrett examines in this book.  The is an encyclopedic book, worth ten times its price, and sure to become a classic tome within the chronicles of Earth Topology and empirical science.",
