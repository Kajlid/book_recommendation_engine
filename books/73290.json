  "title": "Beau and the Beast",
  "description": "Inspired by the timeless tale, \"Beauty and the Beast,\" by Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont, Rick R. Reed has crafted a new fairy tale for our times that manages to be ethereal, romantic and ripped-from-the-headlines realistic.Beau is a down-on-his-luck street artist living on the streets of Seattle, drawing portraits of tourists to make enough money to live hand-to-mouth. He has a knack for capturing his subjects very souls on paper. One rainy night, he is accosted by a group of fag-bashing thugs, intent on robbing him of his art supplies and humiliating Beau for who he is. Beau is beaten into unconsciousness......And awakens in a beautiful bedroom, his head bandaged and with no memory of how he got there. Outside his window pine trees and mountain vistas beckon.Beau's tale grows even more mysterious when a large, muscular man begins bringing the injured Beau his food. The man says nothing--and wears a wolf mask. When he finally does speak, it's only to tell Beau to call him \"Beast.\"What secrets does the wolf mask hide? What do these two outsiders have in common? And will their odd circumstances bring them to the brink of love--or tear them apart? The answers lie in Rick R. Reed's haunting love story that reveals that beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder. Gay / Contemporary / Fantasy / Fairy Tale",
