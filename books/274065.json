  "description": "Kenny Long is living a new life. Blinded in an accident, he has taken control of his unexpected reality the best way he can, and it’s working out better than he hoped.  Of course Larry Boots doesn’t know any of that. All he sees is a beautiful man sitting on a park bench.  Larry has a few problems of his his mother. His job. The lack of romance in his life.  His job. In the course of that job, Larry strikes up a friendship with Kenny. The next thing he knows, he’s so head-over-heels in love, even his mother doesn’t seem so bad. Of course his career is still a problem, but he’s working on that. Hopefully he’ll have the problem resolved before the man he’s being paid to murder succeeds in murdering him first.  And before the man he loves finds out he’s a cold-blooded killer.",
