But when his world of neglect and physical abuse, youth crime and illegal drugs, collides with Anna’s parents’ high expectations for her education and show-jumping success, how long can that love survive, and what will be the cost along the way?SOMEONE DIFFERENT is a story of how teenage love struggles to survive when the realities of parents, friendships, prejudice and deprivation get firmly in its way. Set against the contrasting backdrops of an inner-city housing estate and an idyllic country estate, the book takes its readers on a dramatic, compelling and sometimes violent journey, in which the characters' only defence against all of this, is each other.",
