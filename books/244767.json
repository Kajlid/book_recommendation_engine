  "description": "Captain Logan Garcia was a very worried man. Were his suspicions true? Could Shaver, the new Indian scout, be trusted?No one could sense what was going on in the mind of scout Hiram Shaver. A loner and a newcomer to Fort Lincoln, Shaver’s duty was to lead three troops of the 10th Cavalry, Under the command of Colonel Detrick, in pursuit of the Apache band that kidnapped the colonel’s wife. The colonel, lost deep in his own personal as well as military problems, had to rely on Shaver.Was it a coincidence that he rescue party was struggling over the region’s roughest terrain, or that the scout always seemed to find water for them just before they were ready to collapse? Second in command, Captain Garcia’s stomach sank with the uneasy implications of his suspicions.If Shaver was indeed a traitor as Garcia had suspected, he was not only wearing out the men of the 10th, but also bringing them ingeniously into the waiting arms of an Apache war party. It was a daring, perhaps flawless plan. But, could Logan Garcia find a way to stop it?",
