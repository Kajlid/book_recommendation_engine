  "title": "Earwig and the Witch",
  "description": "Most orphanages are horrible, but Earwig has a surprising amount of power over everyone at St Morwaldâ€™s Home for Children, and loves it there. The last thing she wants is to be adopted by the very strange Bella Yaga, demon-attended Mandrake, and talking black cat Thomas. Earwig wants to learn magic, but will need all her ingenuity and help from a familiar to survive. Expressive big eyes, twisty mouths, on stick figures flesh out the characters, action, and ravens and spiders adorn the margins.",
