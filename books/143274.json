Now Lily’s friend is throwing his emotions all over the place and messing with his head, and not only that, but she’s the only woman to bring his libido back to life.Sabrina feels like she’s on a roller-coaster ride with Lucien. One minute he’s fuckin’ her brains out, and the next, he’s pushing her away. She just wishes she knew if he was pushing her away because of his scarred body, or because he’s in love with his brothers’ wife, Lily.Can a man who’s hurting and hides his true self from the world keep the love of a good woman? Or will he push her too far so she walks away from him for good?",
