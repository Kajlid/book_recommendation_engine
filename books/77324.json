  "description": "Fifteen original tales envision ever-more sophisticated technology-and the repercussions on humankind...  As our world and daily lives become more and more involved with and dependent on complex technology, concern over what the future holds increases. If computers develop genuine Artificial Intelligence will they still willingly serve humankind? If the machines rebel, can we shut them down? And what kind of world would we be left with if we did?  These are just a few of the questions explored in fifteen brand-new stories by some of science fiction's most visionary minds-inventive and cautionary tales about some of the futures we may be building for ourselves right now.",
