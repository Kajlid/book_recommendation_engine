  "description": "JAX  My life was simple... until Bo Brendon crashed into my lap. Shy girls aren't my thing, yet somehow, she's under my skin and in my head. It's a f*cking nightmare. Yet it's a nightmare I don't want to give up.  BOLIVIA (BO)  Jax Marshall was an accident. A really sexy, smart, incredibly smooth, hot... accident. He's the kind of guy you shouldn't fall in love with, because he could crush you with barely any effort. Especially someone like me. Either it will be the best thing to ever happen to me, or it will be the disaster that leaves me in ruins.  I guess I'll find out.***** *Romantic Comedy *Adult content *Can be read as a stand-alone *Dual POV",
