  "description": "\"Sunken in emptiness and despair, the world continues to decay. The eyes of the infected dead glared around every corner with nowhere to escape. Zombies outnumber humans. Humans are hid away in FEMA camps or have joined gangs of cannibals hoping to survive the ongoing war and the Callechio family and friends are locked away hoping to live just another day. With mega- corporations such as Cyclone Corp binding together to form a new group the Community of the Phoenix, they continue their genocide of the human population and bond with the Army of God to push the apocalyptic theme onto the surviving populace. The government hangs on by a thread but the brave men and woman who work in its ranks are not about to let the remaining society fall. No-one is more affected by the recent losses then Emma. Believing her father is dead, she plots her revenge but is he really gone? After multiple recent deaths, the Callechio's continue their struggle for survival by all the methods of science, technology, and creativity they have but in a world so destroyed, is it even worth it to live another day.\"",
