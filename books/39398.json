Smidge takes Danielle to the middle of nowhere to reveal a diagnosis of terminal cancer, followed by an unusual “After I’m gone, I want you to finish the job. Marry my husband. Raise my daughter. I’m gonna teach you to how to be Smidge 2.0.”As Danielle wrestles with this major life decision, she finds herself torn between being true to her best friend’s wishes and being honest with herself.
