  "title": "Popcorn: Fifty Years of Rock 'n' Roll Movies",
  "description": "From Quadrophenia to Mamma Mia!, the rock 'n' roll movie captures the best and worst of a music's moment in time. In Popcorn , acclaimed author Garry Mulholland takes a close look at the successes and failures of this film phenomenon by deconstructing the likes of Derek Jarman's Jubilee while considering the mass appeal of movies such as Footloose and Grease . Part serious critical appreciation, part celebration of B-movie trash, Popcorn is sure to be the first and last word on the rock movie.",
