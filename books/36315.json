  "description": "A Rollicking Tale of Horny Christian Chastity. How many consecutive times does a tale have to actually rollick before it can accurately be described as \"rollicking?\" How horny can a Christian book actually get before it is deemed downright unchristian by certified, card-carrying, Harry Potter forswearing Kristians-with-a-K everywhere? How chaste is our protagonist by the end of this tragic and sweaty tale, despite the gimlet-eyed efforts of painted Jezebels, strumpets, slatterns and trollops of the basest stripe on the one hand, and the desiccating, glacially-loined emotional dysfunction of wholesome Christian ladies on the other? Read this book and judge for yourself!",
