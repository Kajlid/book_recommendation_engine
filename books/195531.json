  "description": "How did things ever get to be so difficult?  Nearly eight years of marriage. Two kids. Hectic careers and major life choices.  Throw in sexual frustration, doubts, insecurities and one wild man not completely tamed by society, and you have a Christmas thatâ€™s bound to get out of control.  Zacharias Easton will show you just how uncivilized love can be.  ** Love: Uncivilized is a follow up novella to the book, Uncivilized. While it can be read as a stand alone, it is best appreciated after having read Uncivilized first.",
