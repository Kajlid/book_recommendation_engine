  "description": "Hi Ali, Just a quick note from your ever-loving sister. Wanted to bring you up to date on how things are going with Jazmine. After all, I am — according to the Navy — your official \"parenting plan.\"I adore Jazmine. But who knew that a nine-year-old had so many opinions? Including an opinion on my love life (or lack thereof). I'm pretty sure she's trying to set me up with that friend of yours, Adam Kennedy. Excuse me Lieutenant Commander Adam Kennedy.Yeah, yeah, I know. He's great looking and very helpful(if a little dictatorial), but I am not in the market for a Navy husband.Do me a favor — tell your daughter that, okay?Love you. Miss you.Shana",
