  "description": "IT’S TRUE BEHIND EVERY JOKE IS A VEILED SECRET.  Sergeant at Arms and resident joker, Snake was prime example. He loved the sense of pride the Renegade Souls gave him being bodyguard to his Prez. And he was never without a punchline. It was his thing. He loved his kids. But the missing piece became clear when he saw her. Could he bring a sweet librarian ...a good girl… into his murky lifestyle? Opposites don’t always attract … unless they explode in unforeseen passion. His heart was wide open to the snow queen, but could she accept all of him?  SECRETS WERE SHARED. DESIRES EXPLORED.  Happiness came at a price for Winter Deseille who only wanted to knit, be a little obsessed with Captain America’s rear end and live her life away from oppressive influences. Enter the sexiest outlaw DILF from stage left. The price was high to fall in love with a biker…  Especially when trouble comes from an unsuspecting source.  Disclaimer: This MC book contains a bad boy, a good girl .... and a belt. So it's intended for 18+ audiences.",
