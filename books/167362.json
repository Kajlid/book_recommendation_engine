Left to fend for themselves, the three races of Ein-Aral and the Immortals banded together to save the world. Part One: Shadows and Starstone Ivo, Jaeger, Jadeth, and Emaranthe must protect a desert village and its hoard of Starstone, a power source that can aid the Dro-Aconi’s plans for the dominion over Ein-Aral. Can the companions battle inner demons long enough to defeat legions of enemies and keep the enemy from seizing the Starstone?",
