  "description": "In denying his heritage, Richard Cypher, grandson of the last true Wizard, ignores the Wizard's Second Rule. It may be his undoing and the Lands'. One person holds the power to make Richard accept what he hates-Kahlan Amnell, Mother Confessor. To save her people, her world, and Richard, from the Keeper of the Underworld she must sacrifice everything she holds dear and begin a war she knows can only end in death.  This is a world where the creatures of nightmare will find you by the movement of a shallow breath and waking dreams will decide your soul's fate...Where magic is both a boon and a bane to those who use it and those who merely feel its touch.",
