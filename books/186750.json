  "title": "Le French Bread: Real-Time Reflections During a Year in Purgatory",
  "description": "Jeff has always been a creative soul, a man intent on balancing structure and flight in all facets of his life. While he was able to achieve this balance to some degree as he aged through his twenties, he realized at age thirty-three that the darkness and despair inside him were still very much alive. In this real-time collection, he pours over years of \"correctness\" and the \"right way\" in the eyes of family, society, and the Church, and ultimately challenges those notions and myths instilled in him since birth. It is a raw, chaotic, and emotional journey through his confrontation with the darkest demons--all collateral damages from the systems he always loved the most. *This second edition includes an exterior and interior design refresh, an updated introduction, and two bonus entries.",
