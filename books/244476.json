  "description": "Magic sustains the sylvan land of Tobyn-Ser. For dozens of generations the hawk-mages and owl-mages known as the children of the Amarid have protected the people and the land through their magic and their bond with their avian familiars. But the decades-long peace was shattered by an incursion from the neighbouring land of Lon-Ser, a place where magic was forsaken in favour of technology. Crowded into polluted, sordid urban warrens, the millions of poor and underfed long for the unspoiled plains of Tobyn-Ser but the Children of Amarid stand in their way. The invasion begins. Meanwhile, a new sovereign rises to power in Lon-Ser who longs to turn her land from its destructive ways, only to find treachery and peril at every turn. Only an Eagle-Sage can bring harmony, and lead the two lands through the terrible times to come.",
