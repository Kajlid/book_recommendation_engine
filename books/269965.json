  "description": "In a future when humans are believed to be extinct, what will one curious robot do when it finds a girl who needs its help? In the future, robots have eliminated humans, and 12-year-old robot XR_935 is just fine with that. Without humans around, there is no war, no pollution, no crime. Every member of society has a purpose. Everything runs smoothly and efficiently. Until the day XR discovers something impossible: a human girl named Emma. Now, Emma must embark on a dangerous voyage with XR and two other robots in search of a mysterious point on a map. But how will they survive in a place where rules are never broken and humans arenâ€™t supposed to exist? And what will they find at the end of their journey?",
