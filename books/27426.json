  "description": "SOLEDAD is a novel about love, betrayal, heartbreak, and the aftermath of an extramarital affair. Set in contemporary Metro Atlanta, SOLEDAD sheds light on taboo and often controversial issues among educated, uppity, bourgeois black folk, like Soledad Francis. Soledad gets entangled in the cross-hair of a smooth, fast talking man with more secrets than Deep Davidâ€™s mouth dripped open slowly. He stood with his heels dug into my carpet, a dashed hope, a broken dream. No amount of money could top the priceless look that gathered on his face like an unmade bed. His eyebrows crumpled and furrowed like disheveled sheets. His lips curled into an acidic smirk. Confusion and shock collided in the cornea of his dilated pupils. He was a B.B. King Song, personified. His entire body sang the blues.Through near death experiences, trauma, sadistic stalkers, loss, and friends with their own baggage and issues, Soledad finds her authentic self, and learns valuable life lessons about trust and timeless wisdom; the type of wisdom that can only be garnered through pain and loneliness.",
