  "title": "Lost Time: Chorus and Other Poems",
  "description": "Lost Time brings together a collection of poems written during the last two to three years. There are poems that relate to Place (mostly Wales), the Sea (if not the sea, then the horizon! The sea is always there), Writing, Memories and Time... and a few poems brought about by Covid and lockdown found their way in at the beginning. There are no breaks between the themes and they do not have section headings as it would be fair to say that their edges are blurred, each one blending softly into the next.Chris Armstrong has had three careers, working as a merchant seaman and navigator, a farmhand on the farm where he still lives in the mountains of mid-Wales, and as an information scientist before retiring to become a poet and writer. He has one longer collection of poems in print, Mostly Welsh (Y Lolfa, 2019) and a recent chapbook, Book of the Spirit (Curated Lines, 2022). Although initially entirely focussed on poetry, he moved on to short stories— When I Am Not Writing Poetry (Curated Lines, 2023)—while his first full length work of fiction, The Dark Trilogy (Austin Macauley, 2022) was being published . He is now working on a further novel. He has been published, for example in Storgy, Agenda and London Grip New Poetry . He writes about his writing and publishes the occasional poem on the Curated Lines blog at",
