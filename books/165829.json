  "description": "\"I like writers who believe in the word with every bone, and Jayinee Basu is one of those poets who writes with her flesh, her skin, with every hair on her body, with every single one of her bones. When I was reading Asuras, it occurred to me that I was imagining its author as a kind of double-edged one side sharpened very thin with a poisoned edge, the other a kind of mirror in which poetry made us softer, more meticulous, more sincere with our dreams. -Luna Miguel, author of Bluebird and Other Tattoos",
