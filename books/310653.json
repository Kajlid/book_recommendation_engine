  "description": "He followed me.He broke my peace, and I embraced the noise.He tore apart all I believed about myself, and I reveled in the chaos.He brought me back to life.His promise remains with me, even now.Wherever you are, I am.It began with the sensation of being watched.I thought it was my imagination or a bit of paranoia. After all, I'm not accustomed to living in the woods and my job as a true crime author makes me hypervigilant. Even the first time he called my name, I convinced myself it was only the wind.Until now.The man standing uninvited in my home is beautiful in a way thatâ€™s almost awful to look at and impossible to ignore. His intense gaze tears through me while his impassive expression gives nothing away.This should be terrifying. It is, and yet it enlivens me. He rouses something in me that's long been dormant. A desire for life.And for him.",
