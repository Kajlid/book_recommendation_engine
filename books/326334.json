  "title": "Algorithmic Reality",
  "description": "Your phone reminds you all day long that you were interested in buying those shoes. Your device knows the places where you go, the books you like, and your friends’ faces. The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data. The more they know about you, the better you can be targeted, and then, monetized. The British businessman Damian Bradfield, co-founder of WeTransfer, and the Spanish comics author David Sánchez build an ironic dystopic world, disturbingly similar to ours, to explore the addictive effects of social media, the stealthy invasion of privacy, and the dangers of data misuse. With a wry acidic sense of humor, they blur the boundaries between the online and offline worlds and spin disturbingly recognizable tales about our overconnected society.",
