A CHRISTMAS ANGEL Ten-year-old Annie, stuck in a wheelchair since a fall from the barn loft, hopes for a beautiful angel to go atop the Christmas tree, but God's answer to her prayer is completely unexpected. Annie's widower father, Mick, hated to ask his in-laws for help, but he had no other choice. He never imagined they would send his wife's stepsister, Jennifer, to care for his daughter. Nor did he foresee the love she would bring into their home. Did he and Annie dare hope that Jennifer might choose to stay? A CLOUD MOUNTAIN CHRISTMAS Take one lonely divorcee at Christmastime. Send her on business to the romantic Cloud Mountain Lodge. Add a handsome innkeeper Tony Anderson. Throw in plenty of snow, a broken bone, warm-hearted people, and mix!",
