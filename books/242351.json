  "description": "A must-read companion book for The Glare series!Even the worst bad guys have a few redeeming qualities. And everyone has a story to tell. Don’t miss this novel-length collection of short stories about many of the characters from The Glare series...because everyone is faced with hard decisions (and sometimes untimely deaths) when the glare strikes and causes the apocalypse!Pick up a copy of this fast-paced page turner today!AUTHOR INTERVIEW This book is a companion book for The Glare series. What does this book add to the series? In other words, why should readers pick up a copy? This book is a novel-length collection of short stories about many of the characters from The Glare series. Jenna has a very black-and-white view of the world and this book sheds new light on the actions and reactions of other characters in the series. These stories are mostly set at the moment the apocalypse strikes, and readers may find they feel differently about characters they once hated after they read this book! Who would enjoy this book? Anyone who’s read The Glare series will enjoy this book, as will those who are interested in observing how differently people can react to the same event. Doomsday preppers and readers who enjoy stories of the apocalypse will also enjoy the book. There’s another companion book for this series (Since the Susan’s Journal). Is there a suggested order for reading these companion books? No, not really. I usually list Since the Susan’s Journal first, in part because it was written before this book, and in part because it covers events from the entire series. But really, either book can be read immediately after The Glare Ends.",
