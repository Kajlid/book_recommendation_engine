  "description": "The bestselling author’s “signature tender but sexy lovemaking scenes make this an all-around winner” in the trilogy that began with Midnight Sun (Booklist).   It takes a certain kind of rough and tumble man to show a Sinclair girl how to ask for everything she wants . . .   For Patience Sinclair, leaving the ivy-covered halls of Boston for the wide, open spaces of Texas means a chance to stop looking over her shoulder at every turn. Traveling incognito with the Triple C Rodeo is just what she needs to free her from a past that continues to haunt her. But she can’t avoid the undeniable presence of Dallas Kingman. The champion rider has a way of letting her know he’s watching her every move that makes her feel wild and reckless. As they make their way through the heart of the southwest, a series of mysterious accidents darkens the promise of the unknown into a vortex of fear and obsession, and Patience finds herself closer to danger than she could have ever imagined . . .  Praise for Kat Martin   “Kat Martin is a fast gun when it comes to storytelling, and I love her books.” —Linda Lael Miller, #1 New York Times bestselling author   “A terrific storyteller.” —Booklist   “It doesn’t matter what Martin’s characters are up against—she dishes up romantic suspense, sizzling sex and international intrigue.” —RT Book Reviews   “[A] master of suspenseful romance.” —Publishers Weekly",
