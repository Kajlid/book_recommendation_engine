  "description": "Houston, Texas, 1965 When an accident rocks the American Space Department, threatening the race to the moon, the agency wants to eliminate distractions, including those in the bedroom. Astronaut Dean Garland, on track to become the first man to walk in space, is fine with that. Except the directive comes too late to prevent the biggest distraction of all: Vivian Muller… Garland. But now that he’s married, Dean is determined to follow the rules until the mission is complete. Vivy never expected to find herself pregnant or in a shotgun marriage, much less a sexless one. While Dean might be impenetrable, though, he’s also alluring, so she’s eager to make her new husband fall for her, even if it means bending—or breaking—the rules. Dean’s resolve to keep marriage and work separate hits another serious snag: the suit he’s supposed to wear in the killer vacuum of space isn’t reliable, and his father-in-law manufactured it. As Dean unravels the technical problem and Vivy tries to win her husband’s love, their hearts and his life hang in the balance.",
