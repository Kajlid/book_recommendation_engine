  "description": "“You go hit up grandma Myrtle if you want, but the rest of us are leaving.”  Charlene’s world starts changing one night when she overhears two men talking about her, and the changes keep coming hard and fast. After leaving her cheating husband, Charlene goes on a journey that takes her to Wilhelmine, a small town in the mountains where she decides to settle for a while. As she’s celebrating this decision with her new friend Jenny, Gibson walks in with blood running down his face.  Gibson Ward moved back to his hometown after years as a cop in Chicago, and he likes his life. He works when he wants to, dates who he wants to, and with his four childhood friends, he also protects the county they live in. Then he walks into his friend Joke’s bar Oak, takes one look at a small, blonde woman, and everything changes.  Charlene is not at all interested in getting involved with anyone, and definitely not with the man who called her a mousy grandma, but Gibson is not willing to give up, not even when bad things start to happen which threaten both of their lives.  Please note: This book contains crude words and somewhat explicit adult scenes. If this isn't your thing, then this book might not be for you.",
