  "title": "Cog: and the Steel Tower",
  "description": "Thirteen-year-old Cog loved getting her hands greasy in her Uncle's workshop and building the occasional mud-cannon before the return of her mother knocked her life completely off its rails. Before long she's stowing away on a royal airship and tricking her way into a dream apprenticeship with the Queen's master engineer by pretending to be a boy. But her situation takes a dangerous turn when she discovers a plot to assassinate the Queen and throw the kingdom into war. If she can keep her identity a secret despite her best friend developing a crush on her alter ego, unravel the deadly conspiracy, and keep the demanding master engineer happy, then maybe she can have the future she's always wanted. Keeping hidden identities and saving kingdoms may not be the same as fixing a steam wagon or an auto-mechanical potion mixer, but Cog has a set of precision screwdrivers and she isn't afraid to use them. Follow Cog's rollicking adventure as she uses her wits and ingenuity to find friendship, trust, and justice in a colorful but sometimes unforgiving steampunk world full of mechanical mayhem.",
