  "description": "There are family photos taken when I was a baby, which show Mom, Dad and me at a big house overlooking the ocean. Mom says we still own the houseâ€”it's somewhere in Australia or New Zealand or something, and they rent it out. That's why we never go there.  My best friend Mack and I just started our senior year in high school. If I'd known anything about where that year would take us, I might have bumped the renters out of our beach house in Australia and stayed there for the duration.   The moment Justin Griffin turns eighteen, his life changes completely.  He isn't human.  His best friend isn't human.  His parents are definitely not who they say they are.  What's a guy to do?",
