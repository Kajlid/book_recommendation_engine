Do they know that fire cleanses the damned soul?Rejected by her parents at birth and raised by the mad zealot in charge of the Cremona Orphanage, Chiara has always been known as the dark one. Cursed with the ability to see the future, her life has always been a waking nightmare. The future is darker than even the dark one can foretell. As the country around her becomes a battleground, Chiara’s only salvation lies in a battered old violin. As the town struggles against the death that is their destiny, Chiara must embrace her delusions to play the final requiem. The town’s fate is sealed with the haunting song of a battered old violin. Sanity shatters as music, madness and the mystical dance in a requiem to fiery chaos. The damned must die a little death for the pure to triumph. The dark one is the only one who can bring light to a fallen world.***[**Note from Author: The Firebird's Requiem Series is currently on hold while submitting another series.
