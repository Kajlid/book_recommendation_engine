  "description": "“A big, fat, happy feast of a book. . . . [Isaacs’s] most confident and appealing. . . . [She] is both funny and piercing, a highly satisfying combination.” ―New York Times Book Review Meet Lily White, Long Island criminal defense lawyer. Smart, savvy, and down-to-earth, Lee can spot a phony the way her haughty mother can spot an Armani. Enter handsome career con-man Norman Torkelson, charged with strangling his latest mark after bilking her out of her life’s savings. As the astounding twists and reverses of the Torkelson case are revealed, so too is the riveting story behind Lee’s life. Lily White is a brilliantly crafted story of con artists and true lovers, of treachery and devotion―and of one brave lawyer’s triumphant fight for justice.",
