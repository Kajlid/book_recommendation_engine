  "description": "Message in a bottle.Somewhere in the cobwebbed cellar of the decrepit antebellum mansion known as Ballineen are the legendary Lee bottles -- and Austin Gillespie is there to find them. The last thing on his mind is hot and heavy romance with handsome bad boy Jeff Brady. But Jeff has other ideas and, after one intoxicating night, so does Austin.The only problem is they have different ideas. Jeff doesn't believe in love at first sight, and even if he did, he ís buried more deeply in the closet than those famous missing bottles of vintage Madeira. Popping a cork or two is one thing. Popping the question? No way. No how.Unless Austin is ready to give up on another dream, he ís going to have to figure out how to make sure the lights go on -- and stay on -- in Georgia.(This 41K novella was previously published by Loose Id Publishing)",
