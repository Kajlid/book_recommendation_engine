  "description": "God removed all the good people from Earth and transferred them to another planet or planets. No one is sure. Then the Devil spewed all the people in Hell to the now vacant earth and went on vacation or so some say. Butcher, Cowboy, Cotton, Stripper, Nightmare and Calusa were spewed from Hell to this vacant desolate wasteland in a group. They were doing fine until Boss Lady, one of the good people working for Michael the Archangel, showed up. She made a deal with the group to look for certain people left behind. The six went in pairs, one woman and one man, trying to accomplish their mission. They found good people and evil people. All these individuals were spewed from hell. In every town and byway they had to fight for their lives with others who wanted nothing but to remove their heads.",
