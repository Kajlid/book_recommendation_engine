  "description": "Contains mature content. Not suitable for anyone under 18 years of age. Jodie Cornett’s heart holds many secrets. She’s never known life without the tragic burden that comes with love. Her world may be surrounded by shadows, but the light of her life is quite certainly the darkest of them all. \"You protect the ones you love.\" Her mantra carries her through her never-ending struggles—a haggard attempt to cope with, what is destined to be, her life. When Flynn Taylor, a banker and Jodie’s personal superhero, rescues her, Jodie feels the future isn’t as bleak as she thought…but their son will change everything. Just when you think fate has relented from delivering more misery—think again--for destiny and fate will remind you that you are not in control. Those who endure and suffer loss will clutch onto anything and all they see as good, even when it’s not the wisest decision... This is Jodie’s story—from childhood to adulthood—and definitely not for the faint of heart.",
