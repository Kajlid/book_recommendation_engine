  "description": "When Karri-Lynn O'Higgins is offered a small slice of normalcy, she goes for it. She wasn't looking for a relationship and she sure as hell wasn't looking to fall in love. Something about Riston Wallace calls to her on a level Karri can't deny. He's everything she wants in a man expect for one thing--he's a nice guy. What happened to her wish list? Tall, dark and deadly? He got the tall and dark part right. She soon learns that there's more to Riston than meets the eye. Much more. In a world where sanity is as relative as what defines evil, Karri finds herself being forced to come to terms with her past and her future. Rating: Contains graphic violence, explicit sex, and strong language. Not for the faint of heart.",
