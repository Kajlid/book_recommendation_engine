  "description": "It is the beginning of 1989 and 15 year old X has decided it’s time for a change. Tired of being a wallflower at his failing secondary school, he comes up with a plan: get the look, get rich, raise his profile and be cool- all with the aim of meeting the right girl. However, he may have just met the right girl when Rachael Williams, the latest addition to the student body, takes the seat next to him in the first English class of the year. Unfortunately, X is so obsessed with trying to be someone; he fails to see that one girl likes him for who he really is. So begins X’s big adventure, which sees him transformed from a nobody into parade of personas- entrepreneur, heartthrob, rebel, pariah, comeback kid, sporting hero and love rat. All the while, his relationship with Rachael follows a trajectory as wayward as his own. After being awarded the School Spirit trophy, X has his greatest idea yet. He will become School Spirit and lead his once great school back to glory and, in the process, prove his worth to Rachael. All he really needs to do is to wake up to himself though. The question is, will he do it before the year is out?",
