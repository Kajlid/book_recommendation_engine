  "description": "Morris introduces you to several generations of a fictional family to follow them over nearly 60 years, chronicling how they deal with growing -up in the face of loss, adversity, and tragedy, as well as with triumph. Written to look like the result of editing together numerous personal journals, Morris documents their experiences of life, love, and relationships as they struggle for acceptance, fight discrimination, and overcome the attitudes and prejudices of their times with regard to race, gender, ethnicity, sexual preference, and politics.It begins as a school assignment to a teenaged Jessie in 1965 as he makes a point of constantly complaining about how boring and backward life is in the small Florida Panhandle town he and his family live in. Jessie wants to get away, but circumstance and the reality of his family’s needs conspire against his dreams and set up obstacles, even as he endeavors to build his own life and find happiness. His daughter picks-up as the next generation to begin chronicle her life, which she then passes it on to her children as we continue to follow Jessie and his family from their teens to adulthood, to being parents, and eventually as grandparents. Each with their own unique circumstances to address.When an adult Jessie is asked whom he had been writing his journal to, he says “If not to myself, I would be writing to Morris”. Hence the title. But just who is Morris?",
