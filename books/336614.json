  "description": "At the tail end of a lifetime of violence, Joseph R. Dunn arrives in the little town of Gladback, Montana, in search of one last chance at peace. Soldier, lawman, gunfighter, bounty hunter, he has seen America grow from the wilderness, and done more than his fair share of killing to make it so. Now he meets friends old and new, and finds a long-lost love in whose arms he hopes to end his days. But the worst of the frontier has not quite disappeared. Dunn's past returns to haunt him in the shape of Red Crow, an Apache renegade with a thirst for blood. Hunting down this murderous fiend proves difficult enough, but there are forces at work that bullets cannot harm, and foes lurking in the shadows that cannot be fought with Army Colt of Henry Rifle. A living legend rides out for one last battle, in a tale by Garth Ennis (Preacher).",
