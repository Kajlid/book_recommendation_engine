  "description": "What's the recipe to the ultimate disaster week?  Three unruly friends. A wedding we shouldn't have been invited to. Two unexpected romances. A scoop of sexy. And a double scoop of chaos.  Lydia is a good girl who is above revenge. Good thing she has us. No one cheats on our best friend and rides off into the sunset with his new bride.  What was supposed to happen? Unleash hell like two badasses. It was a simple plan, but we failed to anticipate a few things. A rogue prosthetic, an accidental exorcism, and dominatrix strippers willing to take things way too far, just to name a few.  What actually happened? As usual, nothing went as planned, especially when two sexy distractions popped into the mix. We were there to avenge our friend, not to get entangled with two cocky, arrogant men, who donâ€™t like to hear the word no. I was sure we could resist.  I mean, it was only a week, right? What could happen in a week?  Not intrigued enough? There's totally a duck in this story.  Ah yeah. Now we have your undivided attention. Enjoy our chaos. #WorthIt",
