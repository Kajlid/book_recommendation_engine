  "description": "The world is a fine tapestry, ever worked and ever evolving upon the loom of spirit. The worlds of the visible and invisible mesh, and sometimes the unseen is glimpsed between the red posts of the torii on a walk in the woods, or at home. The Kami ever call for their Miko, and they are both within us all. The flower of a poem opens her petals to the sun, amidst a garden of other poems.The poetry herein is the product of a Western Woman who has been heavily influenced by the East, and particularly by her researches into Shinto spirituality and Japanese folklore. Although the poems and songs speak for themselves, brief explanations of culture have been included, with a list of resources for further reading in the back.Teresa Garcia is a mother of two living at the foot of the sacred Mount Shasta in Northern California. She has written poetry nearly all her life, and draws upon her love of nature and the intricate webs of life for inspiration.Song of the Dragon VesselI walk the earth upon two feet To be a path for earth and sky to meet. A vessel for the crystal light Shining ever with love and might. I guide the other to see The waiting dragons that patient be. I search for those of my race Though separated by time and place. A voice for their Voice I chose to be Until all finally grasp their Eternity.",
