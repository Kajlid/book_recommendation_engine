Unbeknownst to the people of Dageis, their emperor is a puppet, controlled by an outlaw kept under the strict watch of the mage council's Firekeeper.Only Rosha knows it won't last long. Her powers are slipping. To hold up her disguise, she has turned to the legacy of her fathers' the dangerous, mysterious, reviled blood magic.

But other mages have caught on to the allure of power that lay within the forbidden and the secret hidden inside the very bodies of Rosha's kin.It is now up to Rosha and her friends to save her people from a past that continues to haunt them and a future in which they have no place, even if it means treading the line between sanity and self-destruction. With her own secrets unraveling, Rosha has nowhere left to turn but deep within herself as she has to make the decision between embracing the people she has tried to run from and becoming the monster the history books warned she could be.",
