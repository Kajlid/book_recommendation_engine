  "description": "Music touches our hearts, molds our lives, strengthens our souls. For Jessica Taylor, though, life has become monotonous, a simple tune played over and over to the point of exhaustion. Then she meets Max, a gifted musician, who brings the melody back into her life. But Max is hiding his own secrets...like the fact that heâ€™s a three-hundred-year-old immortal. Itâ€™s the power of music that gives Max his eternal youth, and the power of music that draws Max and Jessica closer together. But as Jessica finds herself falling for Max, circumstances threaten to destroy their newfound happiness. Ghosts from Maxâ€™s long past return to haunt them both. Will the secrets of Maxâ€™s past drive them apart? What chance does a mortal woman have to gain the love of an immortal? Will the price of admission be more than either of them can bear?",
