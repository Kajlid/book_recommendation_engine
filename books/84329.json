  "description": "Journey, recipient of a Foreword Clarion Five Star Review, is the first book of the coming-of-age trilogy If Where You're Going Isn't Home by prize-winning short story writer and author Max Zimmer.1956. Shake Tauffler hears a line of music on the radio of a cattle truck and discovers his dream to play jazz trumpet. His family is moving one last time -- from a southern Utah ranch to a town outside Salt Lake -- on his father's quest to bring his family from Switzerland to the heartland of the Mormon church. In two months, when Shake turns twelve, he'll join his buddies on a shared journey through the ranks, rituals, lessons, and duties of his father's take-no-prisoners religion. At the same time, armed with a used trumpet and his bike, he'll start another journey, on his own, to a place whose high priests aren't his father's friends but the Negro greats of jazz, men he's been taught to believe are cursed but from whose music he learns everything he dreams of being.Shaded with Huck Finn and James Dean, Shake Tauffler is a kid anyone will recognize, a kid who responds to bigotry, abuse, repression, hypocrisy, rejection, and death with courage, humor, heartbreak, sometimes pain, always wonder. His rites of passage are keenly drawn and vividly familiar, his dream to play jazz trumpet that of most any musician. But his story of growing up Mormon in America uses the familiar territory of our own lives to take us to an altogether different place.Lyrical, rowdy, unflinching, Journey follows Shake across the first four years of a decade-long search for the clarity and flight of a trumpet line to lift him like a steel bird out from under the iron sky of his faith. It is a search that ends -- for now -- in a truce of startling tenderness.",
