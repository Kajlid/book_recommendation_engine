Liora is willing to do anything for family; it’s not very exciting—until the royal family visits the market and everything changes.Liora is just grateful that Prince Cynrik doesn't remember her. The best thing for her and her stepfamily is to stay far away from the royals. But when Prince Cynrik asks for her help, how can she say no? But if she fails to keep her identity hidden, how far will the royal family go this time?Prince Cynrik has a carefully crafted reputation, and it has never once failed him… up until it causes his brother to threaten him with an arranged marriage. The only way out of it is to prove he's capable of doing something useful; the catch is he has to do it alone.When a freak accident seems to be not-so-accidental, getting help can’t hurt as long as his brother doesn't find out about it. Besides, who would imagine that a prince would need the help of a girl who sold matches to solve a conspiracy? And… just how deep does it go?",
