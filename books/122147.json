  "title": "My Brilliant Career",
  "description": "The fierce, irreverent novel of aspiration and rebellion that is both a cornerstone of Australian literature and a feminist classicMiles Franklin began the candid, passionate, and contrary My Brilliant Career when she was only sixteen, intending it to be the Australian answer to Jane Eyre . But the book she produced-a thinly veiled autobiographical novel about a young girl hungering for life and love in the outback-so scandalized her country upon its appearance in 1901 that she insisted it not be published again until ten years after her death.",
