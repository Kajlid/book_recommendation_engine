The doctors and staff onboard project Lucy are not who Ben thinks they are, and the organization will stop at nothing to keep his emerging memories buried for good. Ben is put on a collision course that will bring him to the brink of total insanity, and perhaps even death. At the heart of it all, Ben's worst enemy is his own mind, and he must confront his past in order to save his future. \"The twists and turns of the plot will leave your head reeling and possibly questioning your own mental state for a moment.‚Äù (The San Francisco Book Review).
