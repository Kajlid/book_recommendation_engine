  "description": "Having left his secure home and future in New York at 14, ‘Stretch’ survives through his quick wit and an easy way with words and the truth. Arriving in Australia as a ships’ surgeon, he abandons his Royal Navy duties and answers the call of the gold rush. Travelling south to the very edge of civilization, he leaves a trail of unfinished business and ill will. When responsibility closes in, he once again runs, this time to the gold-fields at Kiandra in the Southern Alps.Confronted by a huge blaze as the bush becomes an inferno, he stands shoulder to shoulder with the other ‘diggers’ to fight for their lives. Uncharacteristically, he again risks his life, dashing back over the mountains in the wake of the fire to rescue a couple he knows will be caught in its path.Tragedy awaits and he races to rescue his friend’s wife, only to be thwarted at every turn by the consequences of his earlier behaviour. Driven by an emotion stronger than gold fever, he stands and faces his accusers, and in doing so, learns about respect and responsibility, trust and friendship.",
