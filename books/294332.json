  "description": "Things were looking good, until the ship's cat became a man...  I didn't mean to join a pirate ship, but now that I'm here, well. Life is pretty good. Between the sexy and intimidating Captain Tate, the mysterious First Mate, Ora the merfolk and now Zeb the ship's cat I'm well entertained.  Rumours abound that the Royal Navy are searching for me at my father's order, and between that, an eventful trip to Tortuga (the famed pirate town) and maintaining the relationships with the crew... I've certainly got my work cut out for me.  Meet the crew:  Gideon: a well bred young man who is discovering his forbidden desires aren't necessarily a problem at sea Tate: the impressive Captain with a sweet side Ezra: the controlling and alluring First Mate Ora: a genderqueer, sweet and mystical merman Zeb: a cat shifter, who's learning about being human",
