  "description": "Anorexia Nervosa...That was the doctor's diagnosis. But seventeen-year-old Rosemary Norton knew better. She wasn't sick; the doctor and her parents were only worryworts. Jason, who said he loved her, was just like the rest of the boys; all he cared about was her looks. And Trudy and her other so-called friends at school were simply jealous, because Rosemary alone had the willpower to diet and exercise to the limit.Rosemary had never looked or felt better. she was paper-thin and brimming with energy. And she was smart- smart enough to get around the doctor's threats to put her in the hospital; to trick her parents into thinking she was eating; to beat the enemies who would like to see her fat. Rosemary thought she was smart enough to beat them all...but she didn't know she was on the brink of destroying herself.",
