  "description": "\"Tom Wolfe is a groove and a gas. Everyone should send him money and other fine things. Hats off to Tom Wolfe!\" —Terry Southern \"Full of raw talent ... which has touched so many nerves and created such anger and delight ... And he did it with the most primitive of writer's weapons —language—brilliant baroque mirrors in which Wolfe has caught with his anamorphic prose the grotesque, spastic juggernaut of metropolitan life, or half-life. In a clatter of detail, a char-broil of savory observation, he captures mad memorabilia, from the neon jungle of Las Vegas (where he saw a mental patient making slot-machine motions with her hand), to the ecstatic carnage of auto-demolition derbies, to the St. Vitus's dance of teen-age pop rock culture, to the world of disk jockeys with its 'comic hysteria' and 'symbolic logic,' to the glossy, silk-slithering sadness of New York's empty young divorcees.... This is a book that will be a sheer pleasure to reread years from now, when it will bring back, like a falcon in the sky of memory, a whole world that is currently jetting and jazzing its way somewhere or other.\" —Newsweek \" ... might well be required reading in courses with names like American Studies.\" —Time Magazine",
