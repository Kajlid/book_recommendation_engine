  "description": "Maria Kendall is stunningly beautiful, impeccably mannered, effortlessly graceful--in short, a perfect candidate for marriage. Thus all of polite London society is astonished that she is the latest charge of Amy and Effy Tribble, eccentric spinsters specializing in making matches for unmarriageable misses. But when Maria's suitors--among them the roguish and exceedingly aristocratic Duke of Berham--meet her vulgar and boorish parents, proposals of marriage invariably vanish. Now the Tribbles face their greatest challenge--taking on, not only Maria, but the hopelessly common Kendalls as well.",
