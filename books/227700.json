  "description": "When Gunnar Long is transported into the first fully-immersive virtual MMORPG, he finds himself in a new world filled with magic, mystery and adventure.  No more 9-to-5 job. No more studio apartment. No more reality TV.  Finally, he's in a place where he can call home, a place with people he can call friends.  But as more people want to trade their real world lives to get inside Eden's Gate, the government of the outside world wants the \"game\" shut down at all costs.  Gunnar must learn to survive, grow in power and find a way to send a message back to his old home.  \"We're fine. We're alive. Eden's Gate is real.\"   Eden's Gate is a LitRPG adventure.",
