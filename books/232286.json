  "description": "Would you risk everything to save a stranger?  Off the coast of Venice lurks Poveglia, the world’s most haunted isle, steeped in centuries of innocent blood. A deranged doctor who took great joy in torturing his patients in life continues to rule his abandoned asylum after death.  Few go to Poveglia willingly, but medium Kate Carlsson has no choice. It’s her job.  While struggling to retrieve a young girl’s soul, Kate uncovers some shocking truths about the evil on the island that challenges her own convictions and morals—and even her life.  Is saving Lily worth making a deal with the infamous Doctor of Death, or is the price too high to pay?",
