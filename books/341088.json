  "description": "Antonia Melville was fragile and shy as an adolescent - overshadowed by a beloved and adventurous sister, she often found contentment by slipping into the \"listening valley\" of her imagination. How Antonia emerges from her private cocoon is the subject of this engaging novel, one of D. E. Stevenson's best. A companion piece to Celia's House, Listening Valley follows Antonia from sheltered childhood to the joyous serenity she attains as a young woman. The experience along the way - he marriage to sixty-year-old Robert Norman, wealthy financier, who enables her to start life afresh; her struggle with the new problems after his death in an England torn by war; her rediscovery of Listening Valley in Scotland the home of her ancestors; and finally her romance with Bay Coates, an attractive RAF pilot - make Listening Valley an absorbing and irresistible novel.",
