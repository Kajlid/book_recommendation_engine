  "title": "Rembrandt Etchings - Looking at Rembrandt's Prints",
  "description": "In his day, Rembrandt was better known as an etcher than a painter. Looking at his prints requires a little time and patience from the viewer, but the rewards are well worth the effort. Rembrandt moved expertly between genres, demonstrating his ingenuity, insight into human emotion and mastery of the medium in every image. The compositions are beautifully balanced despite a wealth of narrative detail. Every line has a purpose - nothing is accidental or left to chance. This e-book will guide you on your visual journey of discovery, and allow you to see why Rembrandt was the greatest of all seventeenth century printmakers. For the average museum visitor, prints can at first appear difficult to approach, and the techniques used to create them complicated. This book addresses the need for a clear and concise introduction to Rembrandtâ€™s etchings, giving the reader the tools to discover the richness of the prints.",
