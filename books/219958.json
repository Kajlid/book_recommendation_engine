  "description": "How can you find happiness when your very name is Loveless?  Seimei is back with a vengeance, and it's Beloved vs. Beloved as Nisei and Soubi match up for the battle of a lifetime! Soubi's past with Ritsu-sensei is finally revealed, and Ritsuka will have to decide once and for all what his true feeling about his mysterious (and malevolent?) older brother are, not to mention where his loyalties lie!  About the series... Aoyagi Ritsuka is a troubled 6th grader. Two years ago, he mysteriously lost his memory and developed an alternate personality. His mother constatly berates (and occasionally beats) him, asking what happened to the \"real\" Ritsuka, and his only defender and friend, his older brother Seimei, was recently killed. Suddenly, Seimei's apparent \"friend,\" Soubi, appears. Soubi tells him that Ritsuka's true name is \"Loveless,\" and that Soubi was assigned by Seimei to take care of Ritsuka and protect him. Ritsuka soon gets sucked into a bizzare underground society where teams of people, a \"Fighter Unit,\" and a \"Sacrifice,\" battle using elaborate and beautifully-phrased spells. He seeks both acceptance of himself, and the answer to the mystery of who killed his brother and why.",
