  "title": "Snow Sisters!",
  "description": "Two sisters enjoy a snow day in their own unique ways. The first sister’s story presents itself on the left panel of each spread, and the second sister’s story unfolds on the right. In this uniquely structured book, both sisters’ stories are told with the exact same words, only in opposite order. Kerri Kokias has created a multilayered story using deceptively simple text, with the story truly being revealed in Teagan White’s sweetly detailed illustrations.",
