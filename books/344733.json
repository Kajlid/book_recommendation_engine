  "description": "Gentle Control Brynn Paulin The Cress brothers are back and bad boy Josh Cress is ready to claim his woman. But bad boys aren't always what they're expected to be. A Dom by nature, Josh has been without a submissive for too long. He's craved the woman who once knelt to him but has been denied him for eight long years. When she returns seeking his forgiveness so she can bring closure to their relationship, he offers her a bargain instead. He wants her to be his for two weeks, under his mastery. Tempest knows she should refuse, but she can't say no. Josh might have a rough exterior, but she knows the gentle Dom who resides within. She only hopes two weeks will quench the desire that has tormented her since they parted. Time, however, is not theirs. The demons from their past won't wait.",
