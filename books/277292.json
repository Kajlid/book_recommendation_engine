  "description": "The autobiography of the son of A.A. Milne, who provided the inspiration for the Character of Christopher Robin in the classic children's tales of Winnie the Pooh.' to 'Millions of readers throughout the world have grown up with the stories and verses of A.A. Milne: 81466; have envied Christopher Robin in his enchanted world; laughed at Pooh—a bear of very little brain—and worried about Piglet and his problems. But what was it like to be the small boy with the long hair, smock and wellington boots? At the age of fifty-four Christopher Milne has recalled his early childhood, remembering 'the enchanted places' where he used to play in Sussex. The Hundred Acre Wood, Galleon's Lap and Poohsticks Bridge existed not only in the stories and poems but were part of the real world surrounding the Milne home at Crotchford Farm. With deftness and artistry Milne has drawn a memorable portrait of his father, and an evocative reconstruction of a happy childhood in London and Sussex. It is a story told with humour and modesty.",
