  "description": "For deft plotting, riotous inventiveness, unforgettable characters, and language that brilliantly captures the lively rhythms of American speech, no American writer comes close to Mark Twain. This sparkling anthology covers the entire span of Twainâ€s inimitable yarn-spinning, from his early broad comedy to the biting satire of his later years.Every one of his sixty stories is ranging from the frontier humor of â€œThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,â€ to the bitter vision of humankind in â€œThe Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg,â€ to the delightful hilarity of â€œIs He Living or Is He Dead?â€ Surging with Twainâ€s ebullient wit and penetrating insight into the follies of human nature, this volume is a vibrant summation of the career ofâ€“in the words of H. L. Menckenâ€“â€œthe father of our national literature.â€",
