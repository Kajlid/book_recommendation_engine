  "description": "From the best-selling team of Jack Prelutsky and James Stevenson, here is another collection of wondrously rich, clever, funny, and delectable poems and black-and-white drawings destined to become favorites. Discover and enjoy a dozen duhduhs, a puzzled python, and the coolest teenage hippopotamus you’ll ever meet. Meet Miss Misinformation, Swami Gourami, and Gladiola Gloppe (and her Soup Shoppe), and delight in a backwards poem, a poem that ever ends, and scores of others that will be changed, read, and loved by readers of every age. Whether you begin at the beginning or just open the book at random, you won't stop smiling. “Prelutsky’s a natural rhymester. He has a keen sense of what tickles kids.”— Kirkus Reviews",
