  "description": "Listed as a favorite self-help book for children and teens by Lifestyles, a publication by Estevan Lifestyles Publications.Libraries' and bookstores' resources on bullying are often limited to picture books and parenting books. This book is for those who deal with the worst bullying: preteens and teens.Time to Tell 'Em Off! offers advice to ridiculed/bullied kids and teens, based on the author's experience as a target. The author sympathizes with ridiculed young people, explains why certain people are harassed, and provides coping and self-defense strategies.The problem of school bullying needs to be tackled from all angles. One angle is for teachers to put a halt to bullying as soon as they witness it. Another is to change the mind-set of the student majority so that bullies feel the weight of the majority's disapproval instead of feeling encouraged to bully because the majority either ignores the bullying or finds it entertaining. Another angle is to empower the targets of bullying by giving them books like this one. Just as there are certain actions that school administrators can take, there are certain actions that the targets can take. This book gives them tools that, based on the author's personal experience, will help them address the problem as much as it is within their power to do so.",
