  "title": "Paradise Rediscovered: The Roots of Civilisation, Vol 2",
  "description": "Join Dr Cahill as he explores the origin of civilisation, using information from history, archaeology, mythology, linguistics, geology, astronomy and philosophy to learn more about who we are. Paradise Rediscovered will challenge your intellect and spur your imagination, as you journey with him to uncover secrets, solve mysteries, and consider the foundations that shaped our modern society and may yet change its face again.Note: Amazon insist on purchasing this paperback title from my publisher at 60% discount off recommended retail price. Since my publisher takes 20%, and the book costs money to print and distribute, that means, depending upon where you live, that when a copy is ordered by Amazon I either make or lose 1-2 dollars. That is clearly unacceptable to me as the author so I have instructed my publisher not to process any orders of the paperback volumes of Paradise Rediscovered placed by Amazon. I am uncertain whether Amazon can deliver the paperback volumes of this book at the price they advertise. If you have trouble finding a supplier, you can purchase the book from http://ipoz.biz/Titles/PR.htm. It will be printed at the nearest print on demand supplier to your delivery location and delivered via courier. The Kindle/eBook version of the book is still available from Amazon. I apologise for any inconvenience. Thank you. Mike Cahill.",
