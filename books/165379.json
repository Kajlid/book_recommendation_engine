  "description": "This book is a record of Caroline Larson's dreams and visions of the end times, specifically concerning the \"Enoch Colonies\" or gathering places, which are prophesied of in the Holy Bible and the Torah. It goes into detail of some of the cities, how they are built, what the government is like, how the people grow food, conduct commerce-both inside and outside the cities. She explains how people get there, and the process of rescuing those who are worthy and ask God for assistance. She explains their health care system, welfare and expectations of living inside one of these gathering places.",
