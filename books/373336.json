  "description": "It’s 1939 and Easy and Mouse are young men just setting out in life—Easy has yet to develop his skill for unraveling the secrets of others, and Mouse has yet to kill his first man. But all that will soon change.Soupspoon Wise is dying on the unforgiving streets of New York City, years and worlds away from the Mississippi delta, where he once jammed with blues legend Robert \"RL\" Johnson. It was an experience that burned indelibly into Soupspoon's soul—never mind that they said RL's gift came from the Devil himself. Now it's Soupspoon's turn to strike a deal with a stranger. An alcoholic angel of mercy, Kiki Waters isn't much better off than Soupspoon, but she too is a child of the South, and knows its pull. And she is determined to let Soupspoon ride out the final notes of his haunting blues dream, to pour out the remarkable tale of what he's seen, where he's been—and where he's going.Mosley creates a “a meditation on the history and meaning of the blues” ( Entertainment Weekly ) in R L’s Dream , which practically sings a soulful blues song itself.",
