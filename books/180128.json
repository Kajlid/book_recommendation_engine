However, with midlife fast approaching, James realised that ‘nearly’ actually meant diddly-squat; and so he vowed to actually succeed in something. Unfortunately, James decided that making a movie would be his next creative port of call – an ambition fraught with more pitfalls than a (relatively) sane man should ever have to encounter.",
