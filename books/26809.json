  "description": "\"The Hunter from the Woods\" marks the much-anticipated return of Michael Gallatin, the lycanthropic hero of Robert McCammon's 1989 classic, \"The Wolf's Hour.\" These all-new, interlinked stories offer a full measure of McCammon's trademark narrative excitement, and comprise a fascinating composite portrait of a unique fictional creation. The volume opens with a pair of brief glimpses into Michael's early life in Russia and his initial recruitment into the British Secret Service. It ends with a haunting vision of the werewolf at twilight. In between, McCammon gives us three stellar novellas depicting different phases of Michael's long, brutal war against Nazi Germany. \"Sea Chase\" is a nautical tale about the hazards of transporting a defecting German scientist to a place of sanctuary in England. \"The Wolf and the Eagle\" is the account of an unlikely friendship between rival \"men of action\" and a harrowing portrayal of a lethal forced march through the North African desert. \"The Room at the Bottom of the Stairs\" tells of an impossible, ultimately tragic love affair set in the embattled city of Berlin during the latter stages of the war.Erotic, visceral, and filled with moments of desolating horror and unexpected warmth, The Hunter from the Woods is a triumph of imaginative storytelling. Like the best of McCammon's earlier work, it offers intelligent, world-class entertainment. In the process, it shines a welcome new light on one of the most uncommon heroes in contemporary fiction.",
