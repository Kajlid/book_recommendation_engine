  "description": "Ruby Jacob’s is a modern day, urban professional, living in the heart of Toronto, Canada with roots in the rural east coast and a yearning for true profound love. When her latest lover betrays her, Ruby begins to not only wrestle with her choice of men, but all of her pragmatic ideologies, as she jealously helps plan her whimsical, younger sister’s wedding. How does a simple ‘go-with-the-flow’ and ‘live life’ mantra warrant her sister so much success in life anyway? \t\t\tBack home, in rural Nova Scotia, Ruby meets Malachi Caval, a potential love interest who is gifted with a connection to the spirit world. Ruby becomes mesmerized by Malachi’s sincerity, not to mention his rugged good looks, and though at first Ruby listens to his sage advice out of sheer politeness, it’s not too long before Malachi’s eerie description of her great grandfather’s ghost solidifies the possibility of something greater. While Malachi helps Ruby adapt to her changing reality, Ruby breathes new life into the mundane, sparking a passion he never dreamed possible. But, emotional turbulence escalates as signs and synchronicities from the universe intensify. Ruby continues to venture through a spectrum of spiritual awakening, as shocking revelations about her own true essence and place in the world emerge. A union of mind, body and spirit unfold in a time that logic rivals with intuition, and fear causes complacency. VOICE OF THE RED DRAGONFLY is a heart-warming, mixture of love, magic and awareness for what’s possible.",
