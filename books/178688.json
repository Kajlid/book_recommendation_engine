  "description": "[Siren Special Edition Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, werewolves, HEA] Quad McDaniel's life changed forever the night he was attacked by a wolf. Now, he turns furry every full moon. Avoiding red meat and anything that makes him aggressive is his prime goal in life. But when his convertible breaks down in some Podunk town, becoming the beast within is no longer a choice. It's instinctive. Gypsy Govanivinch just wants to live a quiet life in Trinity Valley, running his roadhouse tavern. He doesn't need an overly aggressive shifter coming into his town and messing with his peaceful little world, no matter how gorgeous the man looked. Life never asked Quad or Gypsy what they wanted. It simply gave them what they needed, whether they agreed or not. Fate brought them together but it's up to Quad and Gypsy to stay alive long enough to appreciate what they've been given. And when others work to prevent that, fighting together might be the only chance they have of surviving. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
