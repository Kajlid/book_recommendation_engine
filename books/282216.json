  "description": "Want to know which team has the funniest mascot? Which ballpark has the best contests for fans? Which stadiums serve loganberry juice, buck-a-bone BBQ, and buttermilk pie? And what you can do before and after the game? (How about whitewater rafting, rollercoastering, listening to live country music, or riding the steepest passenger railway in the world?) The authors cover the Baseball Hall of Fame and travel from the Cape Cod Leagues to California's Rancho Cucamonga. The fresh, lively anecdotes and compelling baseball lore that fill every chapter are sure to amuse -- even if the family favorite doesn't win. The Adams family, parents, and children tell all: How to get foul balls, collect autographs, and save money on tickets; family-friendly diners, cafeterias, and restaurants; where the visiting team stays; where to sit, where to park, what to eat; plus the best giveaways and contests.",
