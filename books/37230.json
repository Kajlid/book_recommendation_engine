  "description": "Pandora is off to Rome in search of Greed. With a little magical help, Pandy and her friends pose as servants for a Roman senator. But the hard work leaves little time to search for evils-not to mention dealing with the senator's bratty daughter. When a feud breaks out between the senator and Julius Caesar, Pandy finally gets the courage she needs to search for Greed. But there is an odd twist. The Greek gods are in town on a \"family reunion\" with their Roman counterparts. Are the double gods just a coincidence or are they here to help her?The magic and humor of Carolyn Hennesy's beloved series is back in full force. Fans will be thrilled by the new twists and turns and next year will bring us the final chapter in this exciting quest.",
