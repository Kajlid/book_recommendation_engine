Chance Phillips, Outdoor Contributor with The Tranton Times, stumbles upon more than the vast beauty of the wilderness while on her leisurely hiking assignment. When a mysterious noise leads her astray from the trail, Chance’s life would forever be changed. But, no one believes her account. Why would they? It is far from believable. With the help of a very skeptical Maine Game Warden, Tucker Johnston, Chance sets out to find the truth. And a dangerous truth it would prove to be.",
