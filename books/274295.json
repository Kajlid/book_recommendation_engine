  "description": "Every day, my cage gets smaller.\nIf I’d fought harder before, maybe we wouldn’t be in this mess now, with enemies on every side and my sugar being rationed.\nI won’t make that mistake again. From now on, it’s only badassery for me.\nFirst, I need to solve the Ringmaster’s riddles and survive the Council’s tests. Then, I have to break my Qilin free but avoid letting the monster loose.\nOur future is balancing on the tip of my horn, and I still don’t have my shift together.\nGood thing I have six sexy men to help me with that. I’ll need magic from all of them if we’re going to stop this war before it starts.\nI’m Carlyle Licorne, and I have some shanking to do.",
