Navigating through life as though power, privilege, and money don’t rule the world. I’m guilty of it. I walked around, ignorantly thinking that the PITCREW, the most popular guys in high school, was where you wanted to be or who you wanted to date. They could have any girl they wanted, but they needed a challenge. They needed something to do to make their miserable existence exciting. That’s where I came in. How was I to know that the one night I willingly gave away my innocence would set off a chain of events, turning my world upside down? Now, ten years later, it’s my turn to use sex, money, and lies to take from them all that they took from me . . . and more. But the road to retribution has its twists and turns and I don’t want to make the innocent mistake of crashing.",
