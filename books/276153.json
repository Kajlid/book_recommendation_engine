  "description": "Life was chaotic and unpredictable; made up of a series of events—a collection of firsts.First crush.First kiss.First love.Between the murky waters, I’d found salvation. And it was all because of him—the broody alpha who appeared at the time I needed him most.He promised me things, and showed me the life I could have.But all it took was one moment to destroy everything.Nothing else mattered.No one else mattered.It was him and me against the world.Until it wasn’t.I hadn’t known just how forbidden our love was.I hadn’t known I’d been tutoring his son.I hadn’t known about the family he had hidden away. I hadn’t known he was cheating—with me.I wish I could say I wanted to take it all back, but it’d be a lie.A blatant lie. He was my biggest downfall, but I’d never regret it.Choosing him was never an option, the question was whether he’d risk it all.Down Fall is book two in the Fallen Duet. The final instalment in the two-part, drama-filled, heart-felt, epic love story.",
