  "description": "Brody West never suspected that his trip to England with his father would change his life forever, that he would discover the harsh realities of 19th century London firsthand, or that he would become embroiled in a supernatural conflict spanning millennia that threatens all mankind!The Fallen Angels cast down by God have no salvation and no hope. But that doesn't mean they don't have a plan for conquering the world. The Descendants of these Fallen heavenly creatures have been with us for so long, existing upon the fringes of human society, that few regard them as anything more than myths, legends and speculation. Outcasts for so long, and sure that God will not have them, they mean to take the world by storm and claim the inheritance they have always been denied.However, some of these Descendants have seen the madness of open war with the Heavenly Realm. These desperate few are searching for true allies to help them stop the coming conflagration that threatens both the mortal and spiritual worlds they inhabit. Now, a powerful young Descendant has unwittingly stumbled into this conflict and he may hold the key to restoring order before its too late.*Bonus Preview of \"THE SERPENT KINGS\" included*",
