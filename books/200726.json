  "description": "A high-profile murder has landed at Bubbles's pretty feet. The a local steel executive. The his lovely wife. The cyanide-laced fingernails. If anyone can solve a well-manicured slaying like this, it's Bubbles. And nothing's going to stop her. Not even hunky photojournalist Steve Stiletto, who vows that this time, he's getting everything he wants from Bubbles. But how far is the amateur sleuth in spandex willing to go to get what she wants?",
