And Mr Nigel, who was unfortunately cursed with a generic pedo face. And let’s not forget Carla, who annoyingly forgot to spit in her husband’s coffee again.Laugh, cry, grit your teeth, run away—whatever you choose to do, know that this e-book was destined to be in your hands. Or, at the very least, a present for that friend of yours who needs to chill out and secretly chuckle once in a while.This e-book has been customised especially for you, dear online Kindle reader. So if you’re looking for humorous comic and picture books, funny drawings, parodies, joke books or gifts, satirical drawings or something with kind of (sort of, maybe) similar vibes to Hyperbole and a Half, Cyanide and Happiness and The Book Of Onions, but also kind of different to them altogether, then this is the e-book for you. This e-book is not for the easily offended.",
