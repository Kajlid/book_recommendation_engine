  "description": "Not a conventional biograpy, this book offers an explanation of Sylvia Plath's death in 1963. The author looks back on Plath's life in an attempt to offer an objective account of why she killed herself. It discusses her life with her husband Ted Hughes, who had control of all her copyright works, as she killed herself without making a will. This edition brings the story full circle, as it includes the publication of \"Birthday Letters\", the death of Ted Hughes and Elaine Feinstein's biography of him, along with Erica Wagner's book \"Ariel's Gift\", the Al Alvarez autobiography which includes new material and Lucas Meyers's new book \"Crow Steered Bergs Appeared\".",
