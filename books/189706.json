  "title": "The Teachings of Shirelle: Life Lessons from a Divine Knucklehead",
  "description": "“Relish the day. If you’re not in awe, you’re just not paying attention.”She hadn’t even been in the crowded pound a week, but she’d already developed a nickname, “Knucklehead.” As a puppy she destroyed property and precious clothes; as an adult she injured her owner, ruined romances… and changed the world-views of those around her.Have you ever watched an animal and wondered how it thinks, how it sees the world, how it views you? And have you ever wondered what wisdom you might learn if you could see things as that animal does?This unique book is many things: an amusing and moving memoir about a memorable dog, a poetic ode to a human-animal connection, and a serious philosophical, psychological, and spiritual inquiry into the lessons a man gleaned from the simple-minded brilliance of a teacher, a lover, a liver of life to the fullest… a Knucklehead.There has never before been a book like \"The Teachings of Shirelle.\" Take a walk with this pooch, and you might never look at life, love, or yourself the same again.",
