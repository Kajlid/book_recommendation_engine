  "description": "This is part one of a four-part prose reading course designed for beginners in Greek and other learners wishing to consolidate their reading skills. Particular attention is paid to idiomatic usage (both in Greek and English), word order and the use of particles and particle-combinations, while practical guidance is given on mastering the verbal systems and other features of the language which beginners generally find problematic. The four units may be studied in succession as part of a progressive course, but each unit is sufficiently self-contained to permit the pursuit of particular interests.",
