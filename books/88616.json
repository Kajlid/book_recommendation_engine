  "description": "Thomas Base was the kid half the world wanted to be and the other half took as a joke. As a child he was dismissed as a chubby kid with a cute face. In an urban area where few males see success, he grew tired of hearing \"try something else\" from teachers and classmates alike. Armed with a passion for music and creativity, he takes a local town by a musical storm.",
