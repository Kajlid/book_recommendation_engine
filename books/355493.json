  "description": "The Heyst family live under a shadow. The father is in prison for embezzlement and the daughter, Eleanora, has been committed to an asylum. Mrs Heyst and her son Elis live from day to day on the edge of collapse. They fear that they are on the brink of ruin, but as the snow melts and a single daffodil appears, Easter Eve brings them hope, joy and mercy.Passionate and powerful, Easter is August Strindberg's most tender play and perhaps closest to his heart. It is a play about forgiveness and the coincidences of life from one of the world's master dramatists.Strindberg was Sweden's greatest playwright, famous for his gripping and unforgettable dramas of human life and love, whose work inspired O'Neill, Williams, Beckett and Pinter.",
