  "description": "Strong. Brave. Inspiring. This is how people described her, and she embraced these compliments because she enjoyed being complimented. Even if inaccurate. Her prayers for a happy, healthy family were answered. They survived. She survived. “I lay down one day to take a short nap and didn’t get out of bed for eight months.” For eight months, she was not strong or brave or inspiring. For eight months, she couldn't breathe and couldn’t get out of bed because her heart felt broken. But why? It Will Rain is a book of essays. Dina Kucera is either a stand up comic and humor author, or the sky is black and she is doomed. She doesn’t visit the middle very often. It's black or white. Never beige. So the writings in this book are exactly that—an exact interpretation of her life. Sad, funny. Traumatic, hilarious. Writing this book made it possible for Dina to make her way toward redemption, faith, and hope. Seeking redemption is an act in itself that requires bravery. So she is strong after all.",
