  "title": "Marxism and Historical Practice, Volume I: Interpretive Essays on Class Formation and Class Struggle",
  "description": "The pieces collected here offer a stimulating, empirically grounded survey of North American collective behaviour, popular mobilizations, and social struggles. What emerges is Palmer's sustained reflection on long-standing interpretive historical problems of class formation, the dynamics of social change, and how popular social movements arise and relate to law, the state, and existing cultural contexts.",
