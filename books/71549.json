  "description": "As my editor and I worked on Advent and Balancer, she had issues with some of the scenes I had written. They didn’t add to the plot in any way, they didn’t really build character, they were written just for my sole entertainment. So she convinced me to take them out of the book. While I did see her point and agreed with her, I didn’t want these stories to sit on some hard drive collecting dust. Sure, they weren’t a vital part of the story but they were entertaining and in one particular case, it gave a great deal of backstory. One story was written purely for fans. (Fans that unfairly bribed Night with peanut butter when I wasn’t looking!)All of this gave birth to—the Compendium. Here are the stories that I give you for pure entertainment.",
