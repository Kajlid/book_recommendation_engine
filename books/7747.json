  "description": "Gentle Hearts, Valiant Spirits has been named as Finalist in the 2008 Benjamin Franklin Awards, Best New Voice (Nonfiction) category, from PMA, the Independent Book Publishers Association.Marie Mead has authored twenty uplifting stories based on actual events. Many of the stories are about rabbits originally rescued by the House Rabbit Society, Best Friends Animal Society, Brambley Hedge Rabbit Rescue, or the Rabbit Sanctuary. Despite the fact that most of the stories begin with rescues from traumatic situations, the happy endings of these true accounts will leave readers inspired. The pieces emphasize rabbits resilient nature and how their personalities flourish when coupled with compassionate human care. The book also includes personal contributions by best-selling authors Susan Chernak McElroy and Dr. Bernie Siegel, two accounts by collaborator Nancy LaRoche, a foreword by Dr. Michael W. Fox, and color photos and artist illustrations. Those who already know and appreciate rabbits will enjoy the stories about individual bunnies. Readers less familiar with rabbits will be amazed by the complexity of their the curiosity, intelligence, sociability, and courage. In addition to their presentation in the stories, these often-misunderstood creatures are further explained through short About Rabbits addendums to each chapter, containing tidbits of wisdom about the prey animals psyche, instincts, and physical attributes. Although this is not a how-to rabbit care book, it includes a few select articles written expressly for the resource section.",
