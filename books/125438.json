  "title": "The War Zone",
  "description": "THE WAR ZONE is everywhere for its young narrator Tom - on the streets of London, in the Devon countryside, but above all at the heart of his outwardly safe middle class family, and his relationship with his sister, Jessie. A tightly drawn, savagely seductive portrayal of adolescent anger and social disorder. The Times For writers, incest arguably tops the risk tables, with adolescent narrators a close second. THE WAR ZONE tackles both, with stunning success. This is a pungent shocking book, superbly written (sharp, sensuous, bitter) .... I was horrified but seduced from first to last. The writing is remarkable. Anthony Burgess",
