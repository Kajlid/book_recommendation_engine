What if you were asked to lead a magical war against a being so powerful that he once obliterated an entire race. Would you?Rose accepts this challenge, entering the Aurum Oratory - a school of magic and wizardry, where she is prepared for a dangerous, magical quest. It's aim - to destroy one of the greatest evils of all time. What readers are saying:“An epic fantasy to rival that of the great classics” “A magical fantasy adventure story, I wished it would never end”\"I loved the character of Ash - I hope he ends up getting together with Rose in the next book. It would be an awesome fantasy romance!\"\"I haven't experienced that wonderfully magical feeling since I read the first Harry Potter book when I was a child.\"If you loved Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Percy Jackson or Game of Thrones series, then you should enjoy this magical, roller coaster ride of fear, tenacity, and courage.",
