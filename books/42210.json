  "description": "Following his extraordinary debut novel, Light of Day (“An exhilarating emotional roller-coaster ride” — Washington Post ), author Jamie Saul now explores the intricate relationships between friends and siblings, husbands and wives. The First Warm Evening of the Year is a breathtakingly beautiful, wonderfully resonant, and gorgeously evocative story that demonstrates how true love can be discovered in the most unexpected places. Finely wrought, character-driven literary fiction that packs an emotional wallop, Saul’s The First Warm Evening of the Year is for anyone who has ever been powerfully affected by a novel by Chris Bohjalian, Joyce Maynard, or Scott Spencer…and for everyone who adores getting lost in a great story.",
