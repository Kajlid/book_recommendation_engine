  "description": "LONDON: a network of living symbols threatened by the digital tentacles of an alien power spreading throughout the capital. Denys and Judith, Xaos Dave, Bloody Mary and Priesty John are a ragtag team of chaos sorcerors who have determined to fight this rising power: against the backdrop of a spectral metropolis these urban mages muster their forces for a final confrontation... only drink and incompetence stand in their way. They called themselves the Invisible College and hatched plans to overthrow capitalism with magic. High weirdness in squats and patches of land by canals; rites and ceremonies under railway bridges and in underpasses; old gods called in echoing, empty warehouses. Barbaric names ululated in woods and public parks after the gates were locked. A New Science of Navigation evokes the magic of a city in a prose that is by turns poetic, scabrous and often very funny. '...the hard nut son of a marriage between Peter Ackroyd, Gerald Kersh, Michael Moorcock, William Burroughs and Guy Debord. I was agog, Magog and Gog all at the same time. London, we love you.' - Matthew Loukes, author of Goose Flesh.",
