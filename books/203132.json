  "description": "Gabby  My brother’s missing but nobody seems to care. The cops are a joke and I have no one to turn to, until sexy Sergeant Daniel Lawson steps in, promising me that he will do everything he can to find him. I’m thankful for the help, and the eye candy, but I’m not okay with just sitting around and waiting. If he can’t find my brother, I’ll do whatever it takes to find him myself–no matter how dangerous it is.  Daniel  When she comes to the station, desperate to find her missing brother, all I want to do is help. Not only has he pissed off a notoriously vicious street gang, but they both are affiliated with an MC whose reputation is just as bad. I want to help her. I have the authority. I even have the resources of the Street Crime unit I work for. What I don’t have is the willpower to keep my hands off her.  *This is a novella. It is a complete story, and can be read as a standalone.*",
