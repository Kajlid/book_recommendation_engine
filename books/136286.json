  "description": "An alternate cover edition exists here.Every girl in my building is an escort?The news was nearly as shocking as being asked to take on a client. A hot, dominant, BDSM loving client, just like the guys in her favourite books.  “All you have to do is convince him you’re an inexperienced submissive wanting to explore the lifestyle, which you are. You have plenty of mind-blowing kinky action, collect a huge fee and walk away.” Sasha made it sound so simple, but the books warned that people new to the scene shouldn’t hook up, but the customer is always right, isn’t he?This is a full-length novel in the Call girls series. It contains spanking, sensual massage, role play, rope play, a shy, body conscious submissive heroine and a seriously hot dominant hero who makes mistakes.",
