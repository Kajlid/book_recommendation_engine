How did the toughest Butcher Camp wrestler wind up pledging his life and loyalty to the refined, mystical Yarong? When you're the daughter of the most powerful shaman warrior who's ever lived, it's just the tale you want to hear before you set off to destroy those who murdered your father and have a genocidal hatred of your people. The corrupt forces of Kugai, which have sworn to destroy the shaman warriors and their bloodlines, have no idea that Batu, Yaki, and the resourceful shaman Horakaan are setting a plan in motion to kill their General. Yuda, the Death Lord who defeated Yarong, senses that his opponents are getting near, though . . . and he has some nasty surprises of his own in store for them",
