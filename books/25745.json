  "description": "In an apocalyptic future, Conway inhabits a continent caught up in a violent struggle for water control. He is on the run from the Water Board flunkies who hate him but need his water-divining skills to survive. A white man whose heart and spiritual connections are black, Conway dreams about the arrival of Europeans in Western Australiaâ€”when Captain Charles Fremantle chose to throw off the mantle of Empire and join the indigenous people. Part science fiction, part novel, this thriller discusses the effects of war, challenges ideological assumptions, and celebrates the brotherhood of men and the love for country.",
