  "description": "Atlas is a war hero caught between his wife’s love or saving the survivors of Earth which has been destroyed by unknown forces. The closest thing to organized leadership are the packs of scavengers that take what they want. To keep his wife safe, he builds an army. To give her the life she wants, he fights. To win back their home, he must go to war. But she doesn’t believe that his sacrifice is for her and his selflessness is driving them apart. As he struggles for his wife’s devotion he is caught in a war with a tyrannical dictator. To win the war and his wife's safety he must give her up and fight a war where defeat is expected. To fight a dictator he must become a warlord.Hovering over everything is the threat of an alien invasion which Atlas slowly pieces together through unreliable stories told by the survivors. He soon learns that his fight is only a small part in a war that has been raging for hundreds of years and reaches throughout the galaxy.A gritty and realistic action adventure book blends with minimal use of science fiction elements to create a rich, believable contemporary fiction story of one soldier’s heart-wrenching post apocalyptic journey to keep his family alive. \"Code Name Atlas is a very accomplished, spirited novel of depth and intelligence that grips you in a vice like hold from beginning to end. Highly recommended.\" SFBook.com",
