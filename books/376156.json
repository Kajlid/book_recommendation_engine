  "description": "Zane Mitchell is about to learn that you can’t outrun your destiny—especially not when that destiny is wrapped up in the form of one big, sexy, relentless shapeshifter, Aidan Criswell.Zane is the alpha of the Gila National Forest pack of shifters. He’s been forced to make some very bad choices—like kicking out Mika Blackwell, a gay shifter who was once Zane’s friend. The elders demanded it, and Zane gave in to them rather than stand up to them.When he and all other alphas of Southwestern packs are called to a mandatory meeting with the Dux Ducis—Aidan Criswell, the man in charge of all shifter packs in the Southwest U.S.—something happens that sends Zane fleeing in panic. He’s found his mate, the one person who can complete him—and the one person Zane knows could never want him because of his past actions.Aidan Criswell is as shocked to discover the man he’d been ordered to investigate—a man who’d had a pack member banned for being gay—is his mate. But destined mates are always exactly perfectly matched, and once Aidan accepts that fact, he believes there is more to Zane’s story than meets the eye—and as Zane is soon to discover, Aidan Criswell is one relentless son of a bitch.Reader Advisory: This book is best read in sequence as part of a series but can be read as a stand alone.",
