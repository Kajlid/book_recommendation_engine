  "description": "Every now and then there is a story that touches the hearts of all who hear it. A story that speaks to your soul and says, \"This is true!\" This is one of those stories. It is about the Punchinello in each of us--the part of you that struggles to believe that someone treasures you. Someone who doesn't judge you by what you look like, what you have, or what you do. Someone who loves you just because you are you. It's a vital message we all need to hear. A message we need to share with You are special, no matter what.",
