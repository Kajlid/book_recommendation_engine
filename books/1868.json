And, even more startling, this feisty beauty has roused his desire as no woman before.But, then, Brianna's supposedly dead husband suddenly reappears—very much alive and demanding the return of his bride. Royce will do anything to save her—except give her up. But can he convince the woman of his dreams to love him forever?",
