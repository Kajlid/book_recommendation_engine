  "description": "Special Agent Joe Cross of the Federal Bureau of Investigations scrambles to find a killer who represents his biggest failure to date. Twelve years ago, a man killed a young girl and got away with it. Now he's at it again. But this time Joe is determined not to fail. Leaving his family behind, he travels to Florida and begins the arduous task of sifting through impossible evidence in an unfamiliar environment. The killer expertly evades the local talent, leaving nothing behind as evidence, but his obsession with a woman of innocent appeal may become his inevitable ruin. As the killer slowly loses himself in the strong urges to kill, he fights for normalcy, despising that part of himself that he keeps hidden from the world, wanting what he knows he can never have. Only his victims know his identity, and they aren't speaking anymore. He's never failed, and he's convinced he never will. He is untouchable, untraceable, unstoppable. (Full Length Novel)",
