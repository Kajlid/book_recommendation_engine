  "description": "She was a lady - one of the Sinclair Jewels. And he was her father’s Hound!  \nThe Sinclair Hound doesn’t speak…\n  Hanged as a lad for stealing food, Gregor, the notorious Sinclair Hound, was spared by a merciful laird. Although emotionally damaged and forever scarred and very silent, his devotion to Clan Sinclair, and especially the laird, is unwavering... until one of the Sinclair Jewels, the youngest daughter, Pearl, challenges that devotion and forces the Hound to make a fateful choice.  Pearl is a priceless lass…  As the youngest of the Sinclair Jewels, Pearl has made a place for herself among her clan, serving her people and doing her best to care for those who need help. Unlike her sisters, she has no interest in ever leaving her family. But when she’s forced to choose between an unwanted marriage or taking holy vows, she makes a fateful mistake.  If she can’t stay with her clan, she’ll become a nun.  But once her sire tasks the Hound to escort her to the abbey, Pearl is forced to admit two things: she never really wanted to take holy vows and her fascination with the Hound can no longer be denied.  As love becomes the greatest treasure of all, can Pearl and her Hound find a way to stay together, or will violence and family secrets keep them apart forever?",
