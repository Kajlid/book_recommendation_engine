  "description": "Dear Author,This pair had a long road in becoming a couple. From the day they first met as kids they were at each other’s throats, either pulling pranks or worse on each other, before coming to blows and starting the process all over again, much to the mixed horror and delight of their friends and the despair of the adults around them. Even after high school/college/adulthood/etc., the pair still did not get along until an authority figure stepped forward to force them to work together. To make matters worse one of the pair is an alpha in waiting and should know better. What are we going to do to get this pair together, safe, sane, and happy?Photo Description: Two men embrace one another, while one leans his head against the other one’s shoulder. They’re both smiling, looking happy and content.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is an Open Road\" event.
