  "description": "Eli Hilt is a billionaire, genius and a well-known ladies’ man. Not at all the kind of guy Anna’s used to hitting on her. Then again Anna’s not used to any guys hitting on her, but after spotting Anna attending his technical lecture at her college, Eli is sure he’s found the one. Anna, on the other hand, is not so sure. She doesn’t want to end up as just another name in Eli’s little black book, but with a near infinite fortune at his disposal, the charming CEO has made it clear he’ll go to any length to claim her. But will his persistence win her heart or drive her away forever?",
