Robberies which, it turns out, always happen when the circus is nearby...In a sense, the Stainless Steel Rat has always been a high-wire performer. Now, as he infiltrates the world of the galactic big top, he's taking the role to extremes...and drawing the attention of more dangerous ringmasters and strongmen than he ever expected.Will this be his final show? Has Slippery Jim finally leapt for his last trapeze? Naah.",
