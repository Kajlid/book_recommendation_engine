By moving through the energy grids of Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Mongolia and Russia, she has to merge with the spirits of the ancients to heal the romance which never began or ended - compress/expand it as she changes her location in third dimension. Her Spirit Guide instructs her to travel backwards in the world of Buddhism by the Silk Road and bury the Himalayan crystal in a sanctuary where it shall be taken by the energies of the mystical land of Siberia, as well as a shift of ancestral information she goes through, thereby ending the loop and meeting with J. in time, where there is no present moment.A story of sacred journeys, soulmates and soul choices, recognition and purpose, energy and psychic powers, the heart chakra and the power of love. The Soul Trek II is a fascinating journey through lifetimes, cultures, and realities.Djana is currently living in Nice, France.
