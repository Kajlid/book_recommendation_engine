  "title": "The Cheerleader",
  "description": "First published in 1973 and 1974 by Putnam and Bantam, The Cheerleader was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, optioned by Twentieth Century-Fox, made into an NBC sitcom pilot, and became a best-seller beloved by generations of readers. The reprint of this classic coming-of-age novel features a foreword by English professor Ann V. Norton, who writes, \"As Snowy grows in mind and heart, she realizes she must develop her own self. That this realization happens in a small town in the 1950s to a cheerleader, symbol of a girl's simultaneous success and subordination, makes it all the more powerful. The Cheerleader transcends its setting to portray a young person's timeless yearning for a full and satisfying life.\"",
