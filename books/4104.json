  "title": "City of the Gods: Forgotten",
  "description": "Where did the Gods go after they left Earth? Some jobs feel like they last for eternity, but in D’Molay’s case they actually do. Granted longevity and trapped in a timeless city governed by all the old gods of Earth, D’Molay makes a fateful choice to assist a hapless girl. He slowly discovers she is far more than she even knows and starts to suspect she has some kind of connection to a huge beast ravaging the Olympian realm. D’Molay is torn between his duty to the eternal world and the leading of his heart. His compulsion to protect her pits the wits of a man against the guile of the gods, rekindling a faith he had long ago forgotten. In theory any of the gods of old could appear in the City of the gods. In this novel some of the deities that appear include Zeus, Eros, Zepherus, Ares, Hermes & Glaucus. Egyptian gods Set & Sekumet. Babylonian gods include Lamasthu & Namtar. And you also meet various Chinese, Norse, Indian, Mayan and African gods as the story unfolds. They are portrayed very much as they appeared in classical mythology, but given each of them their own personalities and motivations. The book has over 100 illustrations in is 428 pages, including works by Dore, Ingres, Leighton and many other classic painters from the 1600's to the late 1800's. Many of the pieces have been digitally altered to fit the story. There is also a map of the Godly Realms that is actually part of the story as the main character uses it to plot their course throughout their journey, allowing the reader to follow along.
