  "description": "\"And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,They danced by the light of the moon...\"\nIn this beautifully illustrated edition of the beloved nonsense poem by Edward Lear, the reader will delight in the enchanting voyage of the Owl and the Pussycat as they sail across the sea and into lush jungles, all by the light of the moon.Filled with rich details and breathtaking artwork, this is a glowing tribute of the power of true love.\nEdward Lear\n (1812â€“1888) was a distinguished English artist, illustrator and writer known for his literary nonsense, in poetry and prose, and especially his limericks, a form which he popularized. Beneath the absurd and playful imaginings of his poetry there lurks a melancholic streak that was to bedevil him throughout his extraordinarily creative and nomadic life. Among his most cherished works today one finds 'The Owl and the Pussycat' (1871), 'A Book of Nonsense' (1846) and 'The Complete Verse and Other Nonsense' (1894).Ages 4-9+",
