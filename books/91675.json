  "description": "My name is Yanna Everleigh. I used to think that being an old-fashioned virgin would be enough to keep gorgeous, sexy billionaires away - well, the kind who didn't do love, at least. But I was wrong. If anything, it simply made my billionaire want me even more.His name is Constantijin Kastein. He blows hot and cold, arrogant and cynical one moment and then disarmingly sweet the next. He makes me forget all about waiting for true love and just go for mind-blowingly hot sex. He makes me want to be his, even though he seems to want other women, too.But he's also Netherlands' #1 playboy, and I'm my own worst enemy. I must be on my guard.Maybe if I tell him first that I love him - maybe if I pretend that I don't see the coldness in his eyes when we talk about that word - pretend that I don't feel him putting distance between us when I ask for something he's not yet ready to give - maybe he'll finally realize that he doesn't have to seduce a woman who loves him. He just has to love her back.Or not.",
