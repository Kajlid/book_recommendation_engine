  "title": "Jonathan Unleashed",
  "description": "The first adult novel from acclaimed, bestselling author Meg Rosoff, a perfect summer read about a young New Yorker whose career and love life are turned upside down when he starts taking care of his brother's two dogs.Jonathan is a copywriter at Comrade advertising agency, working on the most lucrative and most numbingly tedious account, Broadway Depot. His best friend Max works at the next desk, keeping him sane. Jonathan's girlfriend, Julie, works for Bridal 360, an online wedding magazine. When Julie suggests they get married for a live online wedding feature, Jonathan finds himself on a conveyor belt, hurtling towards the rest of his life.     When his brother asks him to look after his dogs, Jonathan begins to see the world around him differently. Could a border collie and a cocker spaniel hold the key to his true happiness? Their sly maneuvering on daily walks and visits to Dr. Clare, the lady vet, suggest that dog sense is several notches higher than human emotional intelligence.     A contemporary romantic comedy set in Manhattan, Jonathan Unleashed is as much a love letter to the city as it is a story about tangled relationships, and dogs. Hilarious, wise and heart-warming, Meg Rosoff's novel will touch a nerve with anyone thinking about what they really want to do with their lives, and which eddy they might allow themselves to be caught in.",
