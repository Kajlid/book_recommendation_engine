  "description": "No shirt, no shoes, no … problems?Hemi Ranapia isn’t looking for love. Fun, yes. Love, not so much. But a summer fishing holiday to laid-back Russell could turn out to be more adventure than this good-time boy ever bargained for.Reka Harata hasn’t forgotten the disastrously hot rugby star she met a year ago, no matter how much she wishes she could. Too bad Hemi keeps refusing to be left in her past.Sometimes, especially in New Zealand’s Maori Northland, it really does take a village. And sometimes it just takes a little faith.NOTE: This 36,000-word (120-page) novella begins about six years before the events of JUST THIS ONCE, and yes, it gets a little steamy at times, because Reka and Hemi are just that way. It can be read as a stand-alone book, even if this is your first escape to New Zealand.",
