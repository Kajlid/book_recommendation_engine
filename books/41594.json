  "description": "Are all Enders evil? Not quite. Go inside the mind of a Marshal in Portrait of a Marshal, an exclusive ebook original short story by Lissa Price. The ebook is a perfect entryway into the world of STARTERS, and a must-read for fans who've already read the novel and the first ebook original short story, Portrait of a Starter. STARTERS is receiving rave reviews, including this from the Los Angeles Times: “The only thing better than a terrific concept is one that is as well executed as Starters. Readers who have been waiting for a worthy successor to Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games will find it here. Dystopian sci-fi at its best, Starters is a terrific series kickoff with a didn't-see-that-coming conclusion that will leave readers on the edges of their seats . . .”",
