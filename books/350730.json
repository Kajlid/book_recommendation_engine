  "description": "Born in the 1970's, Alice grew up in the impoverished backstreets of an industrial Northen town with her parents and siblings. During her teenage years and into her early twenties, she was repeatedly made pregnant by her father, primarily in an effort to secure extra state benefits. All bar one of her pregnancies failed, but her child never made it through it's first year. The death of her baby was the spur to Alice bringing her father and abuser to justice. Finally, she can tell her deeply moving story of recovery.",
