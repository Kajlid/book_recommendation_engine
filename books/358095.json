  "description": "When one of his buddies damages his brand new sports rocket dodging through a meteor field on a bet, Tor Severian and his pals are forced to land on a barbarous planet of puny men and punier women. In the crusade for more brew and entertainment, two of the men run afoul of the law, and it's up to Tor and Hauk to save them. But the crazy woman at the bank calls the law on them and gets in their way, until the only thing that Tor can do is pick her up and run. He didn't actually mean to kidnap her.\"FOUR 1/2 STARS! Fox's erotic space adventure is an irresistible mixture of humor and hot, hot sex! This short seductive romp is sure to whet readers' appetites and leave them begging for more of these delicious bad boys.\" RT Book Reviews\"Ms Fox has written INTERGALACTIC BAD BOYS as pure candy for the senses, and has given this story a very modern twist. Be advised that the build up of INTERGALACTIC BAD BOYS is two-thirds of the story. If you are looking for a story with all sex and no story this is NOT the one for you. INTERGALACTIC BAD BOYS is a graphic story with tons of feeling.\"Reviewed by Hunter McKennaCourtesy Sensual Romance Reviews",
