  "description": "KYLE WARNER'S POV This is a continuation of Melody and Kyle's story picking up from where Melody's Crush left off. Kyle and Melody are dating! Great... but one wants to let everyone know about their relationship status and the other... not so much. If you read Melody's Crush, you know which one is wanting to keep it quiet. How can they keep their relationship a secret when it's so obvious how they feel about one another. And when friends, family and Lia discover the truth, how will the lovebirds be able to handle it? On top of dealing with a blooming relationship, Kyle is having to deal with his own personal demons... like the guilt he feels toward his sister's death. For someone who is only eighteen, this young man has gone through more trials and tribulations, heartbreaks and loss than most people go through in a lifetime... and yet, he holds onto hope... and Melody.  In this story, we welcome back Jake and Max(i) who will soon be getting their own story to tell! :-)  Be advised, this contemporary Teen / Young Adult Romance story has some strong language and even stronger sexual connotation. There are no \"Sex\" scenes.  I truly hope you enjoyed this book. Please let me know what you thought about it.  Alora Dillon aloradillon@yahoo.com https://www.facebook.com/aloradillon",
