  "description": "I quit trusting anything that anyone told me. My life was skidding into darkness at high speed, and I couldn't stop it. I didn't think that there was a man anywhere in the world who could love me. I was 22 years old and dead on the vine. I want to see a thousand lonely strangers dancing happily at my party. An international literary phenomenon—now available for the first time in English translation—Candy is a blast of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll that opens up to us a modern China we've never seen before.",
