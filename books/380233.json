  "description": "...All he's asking for is her soul.That house. You know the one. It's the one that seems alive from the road with windows like eyes that see inside you, the one that seems to always be for sale, the one Anna Worthington has wanted to live in since childhood. Ghost stories be damned.But the dark being that haunts this house, is something far more sinister than a ghost. Luc is an ancient incubus, trapped by a fifty-year-old curse, and Anna is a temptation too sweet for any demon, let alone a practically starved and crazy one. Will she exorcise her house and live happily ever after with her cats, or will she fall prey to a dark lover who doesn't just want her body, but her soul as well?If the demon has his way, dying will be her best case scenario.",
