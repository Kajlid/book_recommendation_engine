  "description": "Randy Barcer lived his life the way he wanted to, joyfully slaughtering innocent women and children. But sometimes he did much worse to them and those that died would be considered the lucky ones. That is until he met Walter Brenemen, and he soon found out that this man who claimed to be his brother, was far more dangerous than Randy could ever hope to be. \"I give you a name of a woman and tell you where to find her. Then we'll see which one of us can get to her first. If you win, I'll leave you be. But if I win...well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.\" With those words, Walter changed Randy's life forever. It was a simple game. Whoever kills the most, wins; with a small town caught in the middle. Forget what you know or think you know about horror. Let go of everything you've ever been taught about serial killers. Step into the world of Tristan Slaughter and discover what it is that makes a killer. This is not your typical slasher novel. This Randy and Portrait of Two Killers. You will never look at a man the same way again. Welcome to a world of despair, desire, cruelty, punishment, pure evil and most of all...Death.",
