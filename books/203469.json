  "description": "'Solid and provocative.. a series that's a byword among alternate-history fans succeeds in avoiding fantasies and is well up to the very high standard set by earlier entries.' Publishers Weekly Based on a series of fascinating 'what ifs' posed by leading military historians, this intriguing alternate history reconstructs moments during the American Civil War which could have altered the entire course of the war and led to a Confederate victory. Commencing with real battles, actions and characters, each scenario has been carefully constructed to reveal how at points of decision a different choice or minor incident could have set in motion an entirely new train of events altering history forever. What if Sherman had been stalled outside Atlanta, and Lincoln had lost the crucial 1864 election? Or if Stuart's Cavalry at Gettysburg had arrived in time to give Lee the freedom of operation he lacked in reality? These and many more convincing scenarios are played out against the dramatic and colourful backdrop of this critical and bloody era of American history.",
