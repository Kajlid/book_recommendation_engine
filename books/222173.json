  "description": "It’s been a year since Destiny was abducted by sick demon worshipers who intended to use her as a human sacrifice. They’d already carved evil-looking symbols all over her body when she somehow managed to escape.  Tonight is Halloween — the one-year anniversary of her abduction — and she’s determined to return to the woods where she nearly lost her life. She doesn’t expect to see a white lion waiting for her. Aren’t black cats supposed to be bad luck on Halloween? Perhaps a white lion will be the opposite of evil. Or, maybe she’s finally lost her mind, because lions are not indigenous to Tennessee and Georgia.",
