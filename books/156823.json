  "description": "PAPER DOLLS is the mesmerizing follow-up to the Gothic thriller, DOLLHOUSE. After the dark despair of the Dollhouse, Cassie believes she has found the way back to her former life. But once you've ventured into the underground, the spirits will never release you. She makes the terrifying discovery of just how deep and far-reaching their hold on her is. In a dual storyline set in 1920, a clairvoyant tells 14-year-old circus performer, Jessamine, that she is soon to die an unnatural death. With her grandfather spending the last of his circus fortunes on dark magic and with Mr. Baldcott chasing her for an agreement to a marriage proposal, Jessamine doesn't know who to turn to. Then a circus train derailment changes everything... (Paper Dolls is a re-release of the original Paper Dolls. It follows on from the new version of Dollhouse (May 20 2014) only.)",
