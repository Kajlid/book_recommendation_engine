  "title": "Junkies Die Alone",
  "description": "Junkies Die Alone is a collection of transgressive narrative poetry that explores, in naked, unflinching detail, the day to day struggles of life as a drug addict. It is the attempt to chronicle the honest truth of the junkie's existence; finding the beauty in the midst of ugliness and the ugliness in beauty. This is not the glossy, sanitized, gentrified version of the truth. This is the real deal. In all it's terrifying glory.",
