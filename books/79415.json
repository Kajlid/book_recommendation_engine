  "title": "Her First Billionaire",
  "description": "From New York Times bestselling author Julia Kent comes the first in the Her Billionaires series... Could she really find the right guy on the internet? \"Hot, luscious woman who can suck a golf ball through forty feet of garden hose seeks rippling-ab'd firefighter who has a tongue that thrums like a hummingbird and enjoys painting my toenails and eating Ben & Jerry's out of the carton while watching Mad Men.\" Laura Michaels stared at the online dating site's registration screen and frowned. That's what she really wanted to write. Here was the \"Needy, insecure, overweight twenty-six year old Business Analyst with three cats, a corporate job with pension and no debt seeks Mr. Impossible for way more than friendship and lots of ice cream. I'm desperate for some physical affection and oral sex with a guy who doesn't view it as some sort of favor he's granting me, and then expects to be praised like he cleaned my toilet. One night stands are better than nothing as long as you brush your teeth. So call me, maybe!\" So when hot firefighter Dylan Stanwyck responds and asks her out, it's just too good to be true. When she searches him online and learns he offers himself up for date nights in bachelor charity auctions, she wonders if she's on the right planet. Because what could a guy like that see in a fat girl like her? Or would he not be who he seemed? This title is published by Prosaic Press and is distributed worldwide by Untreed Reads.",
