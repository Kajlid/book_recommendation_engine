  "description": "Hard To Handle is the second book in the Teach Me series, but can be enjoyed as a full-length, standalone romance.   RC Boldt’s Teach Me series gives us a closer look at just how thin the line is between love and hate…  Fifth grade social studies teacher, Laney Kavanaugh, is no stranger to being left behind – her father taught her that at a young age. That’s why she always has her eyes wide open when it comes to men. She’s determined she will never again be the one left behind. She doesn’t let sex blur what they’re really doing; it’s always just sex.  Until Zach.  Zachariah Mayson, fifth grade writing and English teacher, has been the bane of Laney’s existence from the moment they met at their shared elementary school. She can’t stand him. He gets under her skin like no other and is always utterly obnoxious in his attempts–and successes–in getting a rise out of her.  Until the wedding.  The night of their friends’ wedding, Laney gives in to a moment of melancholy, knowing she’ll never be able to let her guard down enough to let a guy close, let alone someday get married. She and Zach end up having the hottest night she’d ever experienced, showing her another side of him, a softer, sweeter one he’d hidden from her until now. Because now, he hoped she was finally ready to “see” him.  But when you’ve always guarded yourself against falling in love, can you let go of the past in order to embrace the future?",
