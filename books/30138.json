Daniel Fielding has it all: a charming wife and daughter, the respect of his co-workers, a nice house in a desirable neighbourhood. What, then, drives him to succumb to the charms of a pretty, young colleague at an overseas book fair? When a passionate indiscretion explodes into violence, Fielding must confront the ever-widening aftershocks of his actions, an uncertain future and his own inner demons.Adultery uncovers the many shadings of infidelity and the intricacies of emotion that lie just beneath the surface of ordinary life. Subtle but powerful, it proves once again that Richard B. Wright is a master storyteller and one of our finest writers.",
