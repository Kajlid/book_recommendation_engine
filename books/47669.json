He’s made a habit of collecting survivors and they’ve all become family, but the most important members have always been Jenna and Dorian.At fourteen, Ross stumbled into the basement where the nine-year-olds were hiding and the three have been together ever since. Years later, Jenna and Dorian became lovers. Now, at thirty, Ross hopes to find a love of his own on supply runs, but he suffers incredible guilt because his heart has long been snagged by his two best friends.Alone with his tangled emotions, Ross is about to discover that his friends have their own ideas about their relationship…and how it is about to change. An unfortunate stabbing leads to fortunate liaisons, including M/F/M, M/M, M/F...and whatever else these apocalyptic survivors can do with each other during those long winter months in the snowy mountains.",
