The BDSM Checklist game doesn’t scare Xavier, but he prefers leather and steel, and the submissive he's partnered with thinks silk ribbon is bondage equipment. Pushed to her limits both physically and emotionally, Mae is shock to discover how much she enjoys Xavier's touch. But in the end it isn't just Mae who will be affected by the unexpected chemistry between two seeming opposites. Xavier will have to decide if he's willing to trust the lovely sub with the truth about himself, as he proves to her that there’s a darkness in her—a darkness that just might match his own.",
