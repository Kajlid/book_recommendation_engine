  "description": "Autumn Hayes has always loved the Roaring Twenties when women danced the Charleston and wore gorgeous dresses with fringe. Though she was born in the 1980's, Autumn has always felt an affinity for her grandmother's generation. After suffering through a tragic event and moving to San Francisco, Autumn finds herself meeting an elderly woman named Marisol who changes her perspective on life, love and everything in between by teaching her how to be a real Flapper. Will Autumn find the 1920's to be all she expected or will she end up realizing that life is only what you make of it no matter what era you're born in?",
