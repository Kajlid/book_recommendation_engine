He hasn’t been home in six years, but with things starting to unravel, he feels he has no choice but to face his demons. Missing his connecting flight, a hurricane raging, and the hotels full, he’s stuck at the airport. Taking a woman’s offer to share a hotel room is the least of his problems, or so he thinks. Sometimes, the right person shows up, only to leave. Liam never understood the thrill of chasing storms, until he found one in Emma. Despite him wanting to go after her, the only way to save his future is to fix his past. Will he catch up to her before his past does?",
