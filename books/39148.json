  "description": "It is the most natural of bodily functions. In some countries it is considered a social faux pas whilst in others it is regarded as a sign of gratitude. For most men, the very act brings a sense of self-worth whilst as a comedy tool it is virtually unrivalled. Yet the majority of women regard it with disgust and despise the fact that we men laugh at it (even though they do it just as much as we do). It is, of course, farting. In The Art of Fart, bestselling author and the nation’s most eminent Fartologist, Dougie Brimson, explores the issue of flatulence in its varied and pungent detail. From the simple basic science of why we do it at all right through to the issue of ‘stealth farting’ and all points in between, no gruff related subject remains unexplored in what is quite possibly the most politically incorrect book ever!",
