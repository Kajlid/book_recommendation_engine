  "description": "A sexy category romance from Entangled's Brazen imprint... She'll teach him the art of seduction one play at a time... Publicist Aubrey Cooper never should have crossed the line. After all, pro football player Flynn Foley is her client. But something about this mouth-wateringly-hot, clean-cut athlete makes Aubrey imagine all kinds of X-rated fantasies. And it only takes one game-changing play―and one night―to turn the tables from strictly business to very, very personal… Flynn has maintained a no-sexy-distractions policy for his entire pro career. Aubrey is exactly the kind of distraction he was trying to avoid, and she's the one he can't resist. When the media catches wind of their naughty little liaison, however, Aubrey's boss steps in to make them an official couple. What Flynn doesn't know is that Aubrey is forced to fake the relationship―or lose her job. Now Aubrey must hide the truth…even as she begins to fall for Flynn.",
