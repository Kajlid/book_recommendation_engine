The city-state of Ravenwood is wealthy, powerful, and corrupt. Merchant princes and guild masters wager fortunes to outmaneuver League rivals for the king's favor and advantageous trading terms.

Their grave magic enables them to help souls pass to the After and banish vengeful spirits. Rigan's magic is unusually strong and enables him to hear the confessions of the dead, the secrets that would otherwise be taken to the grave.When the toll exacted by monsters and brutal guards hits close to home and ghosts expose the hidden sins of powerful men, Corran, Rigan, and Kell become targets in a deadly game and face a choice: obey the Guild, or fight back and risk everything.",
