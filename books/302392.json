  "title": "Fish Out of Water: A Search for the Meaning of Life",
  "description": "Fish Out of Water: A New York Times #1 bestselling author’s search for the meaning of life is a coming-of-age literary memoir (with strong elements of both a picaresque novel and a classic bildungsroman) in which our innocent hero stumbles from one bizarre fish-out-of-water episode to the next—along the way encountering a comically strange, but nonetheless quite real, cavalcade of supporting characters. Fish Out Of Water will delve into the same kind of searching and reflection as other origin tales—the kind where the traveler does not know exactly where he is going. Metaxas’ writing on his early, wandering years lands him in the ranks of Mary Karr, C.S. Lewis, Dave Eggers, Tobias Wolff, Anne Lamott, and Donald Miller.",
