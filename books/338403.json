  "description": "Winner of the 2016 Library Journal Indie E-Book Award for YA. “This series has time travel, vampires, shape shifters, but most importantly the best characters! Saira is one kick butt heroine who falls in the Katniss category. And I basically dare you not to fall in love with Ringo.” Updated with new epilogues for the 10th Anniversary editions of the series.Seventeen-year-old tagger Saira Elian can handle anything …… a mother who mysteriously disappears, a stranger who stalks her around London, and even the noble English grandmother who kicked Saira and her mother out of the family. But when an old graffiti tag in a Tube station transports Saira to the 19th century and she comes face-to-face with Jack the Ripper, she realizes she needs help after all.Saira meets Archer, a mysterious university student who helps her blend in as much as a tall, modern American teen can in Victorian England. He reveals the existence of the Immortals: Time, Fate, Nature, War, and Death, and explains to Saira that it is possible to move between centuries – if you are a Descendant of Time.Saira finds unexpected friendships at a school for Immortal Descendants and a complicated love with a young man from the past. But time is running out for her mother, and to save her, Saira must embrace her new identity as she hides from Archer a devastating secret about his future that may cost him his life.",
