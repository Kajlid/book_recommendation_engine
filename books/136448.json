  "description": "They say young love isn’t real. It’s only our bodies full of raging hormones, and our minds filled with lust that make us think we are in love. I can tell them that they’re wrong. Young love is real. It can, and it does exist, at least in my seventeen year old life.My name is Claire Montgomery, and I come from a family of snobs. Born into wealth, against my will, my family will do just about anything to uphold the perfect Montgomery name. I ruined that for them the day my car broke down on the side of the road and I met the love of my life, Sam Snow.Sam is from Santa Ana and I’m from Newport Beach. Even though, I come from a family of wealth, I want nothing to do with any of it. I like the simple things in life, like Sam. My family doesn’t approve of him and they try to keep us apart. The last thing I remember is waking up in the hospital with no memory of my life.This is my journey after my accident to figure out who I am and who I was. The road to recovery isn’t easy but the one thing that stayed with me after the accident was the soft voice and words that I’d never forget.“If your love was true and eternal, you will find your way to each other again.”",
