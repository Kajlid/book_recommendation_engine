  "title": "Un-Holy Grail",
  "description": "Two things are certain in life, death and taxes. Though you may as well say death and magic because Jonathan Cain doesn't have to pay taxes anymore. At least, not in 2068 where there's a Holy Grail hunt going on and a lot of secrets to be uncovered. Not to mention the impending doom that awaits. But hey, that's just the everyday life of Jonathan Cain.",
