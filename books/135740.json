  "title": "What Happens In The Attic",
  "description": "Short story by David L Tamarin that completely defies description. Terrifying and surreal. Terrible family secrets, reanimated possessed dolls involved in murder orgies, an evil grandfather with severe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,and a nightmarish universe. Contains elements of sex, extreme and persistent graphic violence, child abuse, incest, rape, profanity, blasphemy, adult situations, drug use, torture, necrophilia, cannibalism (including consumption of infants) and extreme cruelty. No bestiality though! Please do not purchase if you are under 21. Despite the graphic nature this tale is best described as a psychedelic nightmare rather than a gore-fest, and my goal in writing this was to mess with your head more than turn your stomach, although hopefully I will be able to do both. Please post comments, negative, positive, or random, I don't care. Post a hate letter if you want to, just let me know if the story affected you in any way. Absolutely not for minors. By purchasing this you are affirming you are 21 years or older. By purchasing this you are acknowledging you are a consenting adult and making this purchase of your own free will for your self or another adult over the age of 21. Not responsible for nightmares, psychosis, or priapism.",
