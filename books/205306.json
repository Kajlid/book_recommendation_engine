  "description": "There are times in life when darkness and shame threaten to overcome us, and it seems impossible that a chain of negative situations could ever be broken. Fatima Alexander journeys through the horror of an abusive relationship, twenty years of depression, and a seemingly endless downward spiral. When it appears she's in the bottom of her own personal abyss, she finds purpose in the task of sharing her story, realizing she can help others understand that they are not alone in their pain and there is a way out of even the worst predicament. The Faith of Hannah is the honest testimony of the author's descent into despair, as well as the inspiring tale of how she finds freedom from her guilt and low sense of self-worth. Filled with relevant scripture and practical exercises, this book is an interactive guide that will help readers discover who they really are and start believing in a life that has meaning and value. For those who are up to the challenge, this volume will be a life-changing tool that allows them to embrace both the transcendent and the devastating in the story.",
