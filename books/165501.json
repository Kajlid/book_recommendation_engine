  "description": "Snowball in Hell by Josh Lanyon It's 1943 and the world is at war. Reporter Nathan Doyle is just back from the European Theater when he's asked to cover the murder of a society blackmailer--a man who, Homicide Detective Matthew Spain believes, Nathan had every reason to want dead. Death of a Blues Angel by Sarah Black. It's Christmas, 1966. Deacon Davis is a veteran black reporter of the Mississippi Civil Rights Movement. But he doesn't know what to expect when three old men, legends of the Blues, bring a new Blues guitar out of Mississipi, and he's so white he glows. Rafael Hurt is hiding a dangerous secret, and the old men are trying to keep him safe. Then a young girl is murdered during Rafe's first gig at the Blues Angel. Rafe and Deke try to find the killer before the secrets around them lead more bloodshed to their door, and destroy any chance for the love growing between them.",
