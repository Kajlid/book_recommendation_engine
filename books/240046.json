  "description": "Working graveyards in a stop & rob seemed a small price for Cory to pay in order to get her degree and get the hell out of Nor-Cal. She was terrified of disappearing into the aimless vortex that awaited the lost and the young that haunted her neck of the woods. Until the night she actually stopped looking at her books and looked up. What awaited her was a world she had only read about one filled with fantastical creatures that she was sure she could never be.And then Adrian walked in and she discovered that risking your life was nothing compared to facing who you really were. And then falling in love.",
