Currently screwing his boss’ ex and with a big problem for authority, Danny is sent to professional development coaching. He hates the idea – he’s got determination in spades to do what it takes in his job and personal life, and thrashes against it until he meets Laura, the sexy motivator who shows him he is worth more than what he believes.
