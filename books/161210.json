  "description": "Sian has been watching Rob for a while...as he plays rugby for Harford Park RFC, the club she follows. However, she’d also love to get down and dirty with the hot and hunky prop in more intimate surroundings. A chance mishap in a crowded nightclub may mean her wish is fulfilled, going by her intense reaction when their bodies entangle.Rob is intrigued by Sian, and her sizzling response whenever he lays his hands on her curves. He’s attracted to her also, but will they take it any further? Will she have the chance to play up with him?'Playing Up has more sex packed into its three short chapters than there are bits of popping candy in a bar of Cadbury's Marvelous Creations...Toria Lyons is a smoooooth writer, who sets the scene well...with nice touches of regional dialect and accent. There is plenty of action, too.'- Naoko Smith, Feminist Erotica*This is a prologue for the Harford Scarlet Series but it does NOT contain cliffhangers.*",
