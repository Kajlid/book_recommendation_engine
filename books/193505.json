  "title": "My Cruel Invention: A Contemporary Poetry Anthology",
  "description": "An outstanding collection of poetry about inventions and inventors, real and imagined, assembled by editor and poet, Bernadette Geyer, author of The Scabbard of Her Throat and a chapbook, What Remains.\"I was awed by the seemingly endless number of ways that poets approached the subject. Naturally, there are poems about real inventions--from clocks to pantyhose to chemotherapy drugs--as well as poems that conjure fantastical inventions--such as a contraption for kissing and a happy marriage machine.While some of the poems in this anthology provide searing commentary on the dreadfulness of some of the creations birthed by inventors, other poems offer us a view into the stories behind inventions, as well as the lives of real and imagined inventors.Whether invoking humor, irony, historic research, or imagination, the poems in this anthology converse not only with each other, but also with their readers and the world at large, in service to the continued human drive to create solutions--even to problems we didn't know we had.\"-Bernadette GeyerPoems by:Alex Dreppec, Brett Foster, Clare Louise Harmon, Daniel Hales, David Mook, Donald Illich, Dorene O'Brien, F.
