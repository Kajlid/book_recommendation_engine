  "description": "Patrick Kaye thinks he's taking a harmless Caribbean cruise, a well-earned escape from his day-to-day life as an addictions counsellor. What he gets instead is a near-death experience that lands him in the belly of a mythological beast——the very same creature that swallowed Jonah. Inside, he encounters a confounding world populated by a host of colourful residents: a 19th-century British gentleman, a pre-Christian Icelandic shaman, a survivor of the biblical flood, a Ukrainian prostitute, an Asian American stock market analyst, a Maori warrior and a sadistic little girl, to list a few. The Fish explores currents of contemporary existence in a realm where the brutality of history is ever-present and the will to exist is the only thing keeping a person from fading into nothingness. Can Patrick accept this new reality? Can he right the wrongs he sees around him? Or will the call of the outside world offer enough hope to send him searching for a way home?*with illustrations by Erik Volet",
