His oldest friend, and his oldest enemy: it's time for the Bloody-Nine to come home.With too many masters and too little time, Superior Glokta is fighting a different kind of war. A secret struggle in which no-one is safe, and no-one can be trusted.

There is no risk more terrible, after all, than to break the First Law...",
