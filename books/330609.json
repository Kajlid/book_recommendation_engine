  "title": "Our Lady of the Artilects",
  "description": "It's bad enough that some artilects--next generation androids--have been reporting a strange, apocalyptic vision of a beautiful Lady in white. Now, one belonging to the wealthiest man in Africa has shown up at a basilica claiming to be possessed.The Vatican sends Father Gabriel Serafian, an exorcist who left behind a brilliant career as a neuroscientist, to Benin City to investigate...and to figure out who is behind what must surely be a hack. The timing couldn't be worse. Rome is on the verge of reconciliation with China after a 50 year cold war, and the Chinese are particularly sensitive about the so-called Apparition.But Serafian quickly finds himself caught up in a conspiracy of global--and possibly supernatural--dimensions.To discover the truth and save not only humanity but the Artilects themselves, Serafian enlists the aid of a tough-as-nails Imperial Praetor named Namono Mbambu. Serafian and Mbambu are helped on the sly by a guilt-wracked Filipino Emperor, a taciturn Caliph, and a Uyghur Sufi named Ilham Tiliwadi as they race against time to stop a centuries-old plot that could end humanity as we know it.",
