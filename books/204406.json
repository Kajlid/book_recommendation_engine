  "description": "With her singular brand of gorgeous dark humor, Joy Williams explores the various ways–comic, tragic, and unnerving—we seek to accommodate diminishment and loss. A masseuse breaks her rich client's wrist bone, a friend visits at the hospital long after she is welcome, and a woman surrenders her husband to a creepily adoring student. From one of our most acclaimed writers, Honored Guest is a rich examination of our capacity for transformation and salvation.Contents:Honored GuestCongressMarabouThe Visiting PrivilegeSubstanceAnodyneThe Other WeekClaroCharityACKHammerFortune",
