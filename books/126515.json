  "description": "Emotions will destroy a man. And they nearly did when Mike found out his son Tommy died. But he didn't believe it. He couldn't believe it. And if he hadn't gone to the hospital that night and taken his son from those who said he was dead, his son would have been buried six feet under the ground while still breathing. But when you have a son that is both dead and alive, how do you put his body and his life back together?",
