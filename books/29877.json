  "description": "As a rodeo star, Trent Riddell learned to expect the unexpected—like the injury that knocked him out of competition and back onto his father's Texas ranch. Trent's years on the road—building a reputation in and out of the arena—left little time for a serious relationship. So when Jolene Arnold shows up with an infant in tow, claiming the baby is his… Well, let's just say Trent's been thrown off a bull more times than he can count, but he never had the wind knocked out of him like the day he met his daughter!Once childhood friends, Trent and Jolene discover that as adults, their connection goes beyond raw physical attraction—even if they're both too scared to admit it. Can they let go of the past mistakes holding them back in time to embrace this Christmas present?",
