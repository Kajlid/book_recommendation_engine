  "description": "SethI never realized getting adopted at thirty-two years old was a thing, then I met the Westbrooks. They’re a family that grows every time a wayward soul crosses their path, and now I’m an honorary member. A former spy, I was married at twenty-two—a father at twenty-six and a widow by thirty. To say my life is in transition would be an understatement. Winding up in small-town Vermont was a curveball I didn’t see coming, but I’m learning that the Westbrooks take their motto of Welcome to the Chaos seriously, and I’m in over my head. Having taken down one of the most notorious crime families of our generation, I thought it prepared me for anything. Then I met Ari, and Ari met the Westbrooks, and their chaos consumed us. My daughter will always come first, but when Ari gets under my skin, will I find the courage to love again? Or will the lure and danger of my old profession prove to be the only commitment I’m able to make?",
