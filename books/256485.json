  "description": "Bailey Wulfe has her blinders on, her focus straight forward, tromping through life to the future that has been planned for her since she was Turned. She’s been promised to a high-ranking wolf in her Clan, but one chance encounter with a familiar face and she’s questioning everything she’s ever wanted. The boy she knew as a child has turned into a monstrous man. And from the looks of Rike, his bloodline will be the death of him and everyone he encounters. Maybe she can stop his freefall…if only she can get him to remember her.  Rike Blackwood needs one thing to go right. His brother is a traitor and has run off, his Alpha is in transition after losing half his Clan, and Rike’s own last name is poisoning him from the inside out. One steady day is all he needs, but while his Clan is coming out to the public that they are shifters, a sassy little she-wolf claims they’ve been married before. Nice try, Little Wolf. He would’ve remembered being married, but she does look familiar. And now he can’t seem to stop hunting her. They say curiosity killed the cat, but this time, it just might kill a crow, too.   Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.",
