  "description": "Nearly drowned at birth, left for dead in a garbage dump, and hounded by dog catchers. No question: Dog's puppyhood is tough. Alone in the world, he decides it's time to find himself an owner, someone he can love and, of course, train. But human beings can be fickle, unpredictable creatures, and who would take in an ugly, scruffy little stray like him? Then, suddenly, a headstrong girl named Plum bursts into his life. Could she be the mistress he's hunting for? Or will Dog find himself back on the streets again?Excerpt:Dog was seized by an enormous hand, lifted to a dizzy height, and dunked in a bucket of very cold water. He began to wriggle and groan and cry and choke. . . .",
