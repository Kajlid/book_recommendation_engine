  "description": "Charlie is a teenage loner. His parents are gone, and except for his older brother, he doesn't need anyone, especially friends. But when Charlie ends up suspended after a school fight, he meets Brandon, and things begin to change. Even though Brandon hangs with the rich kids, Charlie discovers a real person underneath the phony exterior.  He and Brandon shoot hoops, cruise around in Brandon's silver Corvette, check out girls, and have serious discussions about life.  But just as they begin to open up to each other, Brandon learns something about Charlie's family...something that makes them both question what they believe in and what friendship really means.",
