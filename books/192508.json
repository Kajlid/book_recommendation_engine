  "description": "ASIN moved to  this editionGrant Legate had a good life. Eventually, Murphy’s Law kicked him in the teeth. Just once was enough to set him back for almost three years. He lost his fiancee, was fired from his prior job, and is only now stable enough to stand on his own two feet. Meanwhile the rest of the world moved on, growing enamored of a virtual reality game that allowed its players to completely submerge in a fantasy land.  This alternate world has helped many others see to the core of who they are. By giving them an outlet to be the hero, play the villain, explore a new world and innovate its setting. Grant Legate will get a chance to play, and see who he really is when push comes to shove. Learning rules for a new world isn’t easy, especially when nothing is as straightforward as it seems. The machine has a plan, and Grant’s just one of the many cogs turning the wheels.",
