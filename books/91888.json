  "description": "How far would one man go to protect a family secret? Detective Murphy is about to find out. The Photograph begins with a case of mistaken identity in which the wrong man is viciously beaten, stripped of his valuables and identification, and left for dead in a rain-soaked parking lot. The only clue to his identity is an old black and white photograph tucked inside the breast pocket of his jacket--a photograph of a man, woman and young boy with the inscription \"Dillon-1939\" on the back. The circumstances surrounding the attack on the man known only as 'John Doe' are suspicious and Detective Murphy has a hunch the crime has more far-reaching implications than just a random Vegas robbery. With the photograph as his only lead, Detective Murphy teams up with journalist Lauren McArthur to discover the man's identity as well as the motive behind his assault before it's too late. As the complex investigation gradually unfolds, a shocking trail of greed, murder and deception is exposed that spans more than half a century and leads straight to the front steps of the governor's office.",
