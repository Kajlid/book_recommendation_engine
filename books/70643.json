  "description": "Looking for the new cover? See here!Every year in America, thousands of women disappear never to be seen again, and one man has dedicated his life to finding them...Humble Walker has an amazing gift rooted deep in an ancient Navajo legend. It's a power that may be as limitless as his imagination, if he could only learn how to control it. Waging a clandestine war in the shadows of the New York City underground, Humble has taken on an unassuming drug research facility, abducting women for nefarious mind control experiments. They're powerful, corrupt, and have perfected a brain-altering narcotic like the world has never seen. Beautiful and spunky Kat Carson is the latest victim. Taken from her comfortable suburban life, she represents a tipping point in the ongoing battle, but all she wants is her life back. With the help of Humble and a small band of refugees, she has a fighting chance. Even with the best plans, things can go horribly wrong. Unthinkable betrayal derails their efforts and backs them into a corner. But, that is the one place you don't want to put Humble Walker.",
