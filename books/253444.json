  "title": "Poison Apple",
  "description": "Love, lust, longing and loss, captured vividly through short bursts of poetry, prose and quotes – \"Poison Apple\" is a journey through the tumultuous courtship of soul mates who were never meant to be. The collection is sectioned into four parts that take the reader through the befores’, durings’ and afters’ of a wildly passionate relationship, likened to taking a bite of the forbidden fruit. The writing is simple and short, yet painfully emotive and explores how men and women view each other, approaching their thoughts, desires and passions differently.The Dark & gritty writing style seems appropriate, given that after that initial bite from the ‘Poison Apple’, the way that men and women viewed each other changed full of lust and desire above all. Each poem touches on a slightly different aspect of human desire or pain and pays attention to even the smallest of feelings, magnifying them and creating images in our minds that are darkly vivid.",
