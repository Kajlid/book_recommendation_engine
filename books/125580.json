  "description": "Thomas loves the outdoors. He doesn’t love battling the unforgiving elements and relentless deprivation in a minute-to-minute struggle for survival. What teen would? But when the United States collapses suddenly and regional authoritarian powers establish their rule, he is forced to make a terrible decision for his future, and more importantly, that of his younger sister. Nature and the wilderness aren’t his only enemies though, as the ruthless Commission, an unlikely pair of companions, and Thomas himself, all work against his ultimate pursuit of life and liberty. What follows is an unimaginable near-future journey laced with extreme hardship, impossible choices, and bare emotion that ultimately examines what it means to grow up free. Free of worries, free of oppression, free of fear. What will Thomas do, how far will he go, and just how much of himself will he give to protect the only person left in his life?https://www.facebook.com/fewliveslost",
