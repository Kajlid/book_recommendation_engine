  "description": "Lorelei\nWhen an injury forces me off the ice, I reluctantly agree to swap places with my twin sister, Cara. It’s a trick we haven’t pulled since we were children, but she’s desperate, and I’m bored. I’ve always been a whiz at math, so how hard could her calculus exam really be? But the moment I step into her class, I realize it isn’t the exam I need to worry about…it’s the professor.\nGabriel\nI’m well aware of my reputation as one of the meanest professors on campus. Usually, it doesn’t bother me, but lately, I’ve been wondering if my expectations are too high. So, in a rare moment of compassion, I agree to let one of my worst students retake her exam. But the moment she enters my office, I regret my kindness. I’ve never paid much attention to Cara in class before, but I can’t look away from her now.",
