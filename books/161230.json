  "description": "The Clash of CivilizationsIn her part heart-rending memoir, part expose of fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, finance expert Janet Tavakoli bears witness to the incompatibility of Western values and fundamentalist Islam. In 1978, Janet Tavakoli moved to Tehran with her Iranian husband and witnessed the overthrow of the progressive Shan and the birth of the fundamentalist Islamic Republic of Iran. After fleeing Iran, she followed the expansion of fundamentalist Islam and the spread of terrorism promoted by religious leaders at the highest echelons in the Middle East. In 1993, she worked in the World Trade Center complex when terrorists detonated a bomb in the parking garage of the North Tower. On 9/11, she watched the news from London as terrorist plane hijackers destroyed the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in New York on 9/11. She has followed multiple acts of terrorism by multiple fundamentalist Muslim terrorist organizations.Sharia law, embraced by fundamentalists, allows forced \"marriages\" of female children, oppresses women, suppresses dissent, destroys freedom of speech, and promotes intolerance of other religions. Tavakoli explains why the insistence of fundamentalist Muslims that sharia law is supreme over Western laws, including the United States Constitution, requires a response from those who believe in, and are willing to defend, the values of Western civilization.Print edition: 144 pages including front and back matter, references, and 120 pages of text.",
