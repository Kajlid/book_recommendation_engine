  "description": "I'm an adventurer, not a girl-dad. When you grow up with a single mum and quadruplet baby sisters, you find out two things. You can change two diapers at once, and you don't want to. Anyway, my job was finding gold, and however much I liked New Zealand, it had already been explored.Rescuing a woman dressed in a nightdress at a costume ball? That worked for me. And holding her up against the wall to shield her from the cops was pure enjoyment.Driving with her to a barbecue, a fruit salad in my lap and her twins--her girl twins--in the back seat? Out of my comfort zone.And that was before she started asking me for dating lessons and wondering how to explain that she couldnâ€™t have sex before marriage.I had it under control, though. I was coping. Until those four sisters of mine decided to go looking for their sperm donor.",
