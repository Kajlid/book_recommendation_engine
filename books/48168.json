  "description": "The life and death of Benjamin Brash by Egle Skei Harry Potter, Twilight, Lord of the Rings and Avatar have all shown our fascination in exploring other worlds. Now Egle Skei takes us into the spirit world to meet ghosts, angels and demons. We meet cheeky, intelligent poltergeists, mournful white ladies, forgetful gengangers and many more spiritual characters, not in a scary, horror story but in an age-old story of love across a divide. From the feuding families of Romeo and Juliet to love between races, cultures, and religions, love's capacity to unite and to divide has long intrigued authors and readers. Now Ms Skei, thoughtfully and humorously, explores potentially the greatest divide love must try to span, that between life and death. But as love grows so does hate and fear, threatening both the spiritual and physical worlds.",
