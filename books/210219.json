  "description": "The world as we know it is dull, lifeless and unimaginative. What would happen if people suddenly woke up with special powers? Powers that could make them fight against entire armies. What would you do if you had such powers? The power to create and manipulate fire, the power to control wind, the power to make invisible fists fight on your behalf? Would you become a hero of justice? Find others like you? Use your powers to make a name for yourself? Or simply acquire what you want? Would you do it all just to get out of that boredom you live through each and every day? Set in the modern day, the Legion of Colours series follows the story of Tom Adams as he wakes up with powers he has no memory attaining. Soon he finds others like him, and together they form the Legion of Colours, a group of young individuals set on finding out how to act like a superhero team, or at least the team they think they can be.",
