  "description": "Monsters are real. They have always been here, even when we choose not to see them. Now, for the residents of Hunter's Grove, the choice is no longer theirs. As a power-hungry varcolac-a Greater-tries to break through the magic holding him back and lead his army of monsters to vengeance against human-kind, there are five who unknowingly possess the power to finish what centuries of humans before them have been unable to do. Charlie Sullivan and his band of new friends will be tested as they attempt to strengthen the magic that can lock the monsters and their evil prince away for good-even if the cost is their lives. This is the story of five unlikely friends who uncover the sinister past buried under their sleepy hometown of Hunter's Grove. This is a story about looking past differences, overcoming fears, and rediscovering what is truly important in this life. This is the story of Charlie Sullivan and the Monster Hunters of Hunter's Grove.",
