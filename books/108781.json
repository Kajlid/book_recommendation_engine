  "description": "You are about to embark on a journey that will take you from the beginning of time to its very end. Reality will be warped, wormholes and rifts will pull you into strange and terrifying futures, maroon you in distant, hostile pasts and threaten – beware the Butterfly Effect! – to transform the era from whence you came forever.The Time Traveller's Almanac is the largest, most definitive collection of time travel stories ever assembled. Gathered into one volume by intrepid chrononauts and world-renowned anthologists Ann and Jeff VanderMeer, here is over a century's worth of literary travels into both past and future.Including stories from Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, William Gibson, George R.R. Martin, Ursula K. Le Guin, Michael Moorcock and, of course, H.G. Wells, here are beloved classics and cutting-edge contemporary examples of the genre.Because, the truth is, fiction is the most effective time travel machine in the universe and always has been.",
