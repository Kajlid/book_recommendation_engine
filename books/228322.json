  "description": "What if a 70-year-old letter from World War II changed the course of your life? While attending Valor of the ’40s, art director Stephanie Britain stumbles upon a flea market selling letters from the war. She buys a handful, hoping they’ll inspire the redesign for a client’s website at her branding and design firm. She’s at first drawn by the lost art of penmanship, but discovers a hidden treasure nestled inside declarations of love from homesick soldiers. Stephanie enlists a coworker to translate one and realizes it’s not a love letter after all. When a shocking discovery about a client causes Stephanie to question her principles and dedication to her firm’s business, she’s forced to make a difficult decision—one that could give her peace of mind, yet ruin her career in the process.Contemporary fiction with historical elements, Among the Branded explores loss and the human spirit, an unexpected friendship, and moral conflicts that make us wonder what’s more important: our livelihood or our beliefs.“This is a beautiful and fascinating novel that will keep readers hooked.\" San Francisco Book Review",
