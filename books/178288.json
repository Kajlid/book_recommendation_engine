  "title": "The New Decameron: More Tales from the Saragossa Manuscript",
  "description": "In 1960, the first portion of a previously little known collection of weird and supernatural tales, divided into Days like the DECAMERON, and written in the eighteenth century by a somewhat mysterious Polish count, was published to enormous critical acclaim. \"A unique and fascinating work which should never have been neglected,\" Anthony Boucher, New York Times Book Review; \"A sequence of fantastic interlocking narratives, fabulous and supernatural, romantic and erotic, at times appalling, and, of course, resistlessly readable,\" Vincent Starrett, Chicago Tribune; \"Indisputably a classic in the Gothic mode,\" Leo Lerman, Saturday Review.But the enthusiastic critics also complained. Boucher wrote: \"Readers should besiege the publishers with requests for the promptest possible release of the remaining Days.\" Starrett said, \"At this moment, one is waiting a little breathlessly . . . Surely Miss Abbott and the Orion Press are not going to let us down now,\" and Lerman asked, \"When, Orion Press, are we to have the remaining Days?\"This volume contains the remaining tales from THE SARAGOSSA MANUSCRIPT, a marvelous collection of stories--witty, erotic and often terrifying. Peopled with sheiks, hermits, cabalists, brigands, knights and voluptuous ladies, they make fascinating reading.",
