  "description": "Nick Sagan’s Idlewild, described by Neil Gaiman as a “roller-coaster ride of fusion fiction,” began a brilliant trilogy. Now fans of Idlewild and its sequel, Edenborn, will rejoice to see the saga brought to a conclusion as original and as stylish as its beginning, in Everfree.A small group of humans has survived the apocalyptic epidemic called Black Ep, a disease that ravaged the world and left them alone on Earth. The survivors gradually awaken others, who had been put into a state of frozen sleep to await a future when the disease might be cured. At first, everyone agrees on the basics: We’re lucky to be alive. We’re all in this together. Let’s look out for each other and build a better world.But inevitably, as more sleepers are roused, there are those who disagree. People who remember power are waking up to a new world, and they do not intend to wait their turn politely. And from very far off indeed, one more surprise awaits the survivors—a shock that will transform the future for everyone in this post-plague, perhaps even post-human, world.",
