  "description": "From the Pubiishrs Weekly Review: Built in 1905, six years before the area's first film studio began operations, Hollywood High was nicknamed ``The Star Hatchery'' in 1936, the year Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, Lana Turner, Marge Champion, Nanette Fabray and Alexis Smith were all on campus at the same time. A student publication, The Hollywood High School News , was launched in 1918, and the author taps into its rich mine of forgotten filmland trivia. In 1950-51 the News was edited by Carol Burnett who also contributed a sophomoric humor column: ``ETIKUT: Its sorta considered good taste when you sorta bump sumone in the hall to go back and pick 'em up.'' Burnett introduced a series of interviews with alumni-turned-movie stars, which was discontinued when it was discovered she was writing the pieces on class time. Along with numerous appealing anecdotes, Blumenthal ( The Tinseltown Murders ) gathers recent reminiscences from celebrities who look back on their high school days with nostalgia and embarrassment. ``I just wanted to blend in with the wall,'' recalls a once-shy Linda Evans. ``I didn't want anyone to notice me too much because I was very shy.'' Yvette Mimieux: ``I hated it. Classrooms are prisons.'' Blumenthal's profile of the late Rick Nelson suggests he is unaware that Nelson was famous as a child radio actor prior to his TV debut, but this is a minor oversight. This carefully researched, amusing chronicle also has value as an historical record of the 20th century as viewed through the eyes of American teenagers. Illustrated with yearbook photos.",
