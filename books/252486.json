  "description": "From the multi-award-winning author Christopher Artinian, comes the the third part of the post-apocalyptic zombie series people are calling, \"Gripping\", \"fast paced and full of action\", \"very realistic\", \"captivating\", \"inventive\", and \"emotional\".  Safe Haven - Reap of the Righteous  Civilisation has crumbled in a matter of months. Now, fast-moving zombies and merciless raiders wreak havoc over the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Nowhere is safe. Death and terror lurk in shadow and daylight. The weak will fall, and only the strongest will survive.  Mike Fletcher and his family have battled through this dystopian wilderness to try and find sanctuary in the northwest region of Scotland. They thought they had succeeded. But now, a new horror has found them.  When the odds are insurmountable...when the fear is uncontrollable...when the pain of loss is unbearable, there are just two choices: fall to your knees or stand taller than you ever have before.  This war will decide the future. This war will decide everything.",
