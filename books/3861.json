  "description": "You met him first in I WANT IT ALL – Bill Thorne, the mechanic from the local gas station: “tall, muscular, dark-haired, and hung like a small stallion” – out in the dark alley behind Red’s Bar and Billiards, in Gorman, Colorado, where he and 12 other drunken ranch-hands and cowboys raped a hitch-hiking Queer. As a result of the rape he lost his best friend, and discovered something about himself that he’d never suspected.",
