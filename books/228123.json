In this practice-based audio companion to his new book Leopard Warrior, John offers teachings, exercises, and music for awakening the power of your body and soul. With The Way of the Leopard, you'll learn to tap into all your senses, including your sense of spiritual connection and dream realization; practice listening as a form of deep mindfulness; dance and shake your way to greater vitality, health, and joy; and create a life rich in meaning and supported by spirit.",
