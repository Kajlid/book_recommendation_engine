  "description": "From a USA Today bestselling author comes a laugh out loud friends to enemies to lovers romantic comedy!KimberSome people view nosiness as a character flaw. I prefer to think of it as a useful skill. Like a sixth sense or intuition. It’s my super power. And since I became a reporter for my small town newspaper, I like to think my super power puts bagels on my table.A tiny (quite big, actually) mistake has me eagerly accepting a contract job investigating a resort being built in a small Colorado town.But there’s one small problem. (6’4” according to his license—maybe my nosiness does go too far sometimes.)What I didn’t count on was being double-booked in a cabin with Mack Boone.Our families have known each other since high school, so it feels wrong to kick him out of my cabin.Besides...he’s kind, he’s protective, and a great kisser.Three qualities I admire in a man.But when I find out why he is in town, I realize I’ve made yet another mistake.No more kissing, Kimber. He’s the enemy.Lines are drawn. (Literally.)Wars fought.Hills sledded.Lips kissed. Oh right, I wasn't going to do that one anymore. Maybe I'll call it research…The more I investigate the resort, the more time I spend with Mack...the more I wonder what I'm really fighting against. The more I wonder if I can take a chance on love.What if the villain is really the hero in this story?*Vacations Like This is a standalone sexy, closed door romantic comedy in a series of connected characters.",
