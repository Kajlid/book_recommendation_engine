  "description": "He has a record that commands respect and a temper that should never be challenged. In the ring, on the streets, and in jail, men who have dared to challenge him find they have made a mistakeâ€”a grave one. Malcolm Price was born to fight. As a child his father made him go and box in the gym. At first he didn't want to, but he soon found he knew how to punch and it wasn't long before Pricey had become a feared and respected figure. He became a professional boxer but a misunderstanding led to him leveling a pub full of people as well as the pub itself. He lost his boxing licenze and landed in jail for a six month stretch. And that's just the beginning.",
