  "description": "Most professionals are overloaded and don't have enough hours in the day to finish everything they need to complete. All the prioritizing in the world won't fix that problem. The only viable option is to push things off their plates! That's where \"One Tech Action\" comes into play! In addition to finding that perfect time allotment between our professional and personal lives, the line separating our home and work time is both fuzzy and curvy, often having no clear demarcation. When busy people feel as though they're not checking items off their to-do list at home, it becomes challenging to concentrate on completing tasks at work. And vice-versa when projects at the office are not properly executed, they have difficulty being attentive in their home lives. There is a solution--it's called technology. Just as the invention of the washing machine and car saved past generations' time, so can mobile-device technology save us time. This book provides practical solutions that allow readers to better leverage the devices they already carry with them to increase their efficiency at home, work, and all the places in-between. This book is written in a conversational tone, free from overuse of tech jargon. It's easily accessible and presents pragmatic solutions to challenges busy professionals face daily. The chapters contain real-life illustrations of how apps can be used to automate chores at home, present solutions in a work crisis, build deeper relationships, and assist with self-care. The book also offers online safety solutions from a cyber security expert and FBI computer scientist.",
