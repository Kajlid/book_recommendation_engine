  "description": "Book 2 in the Cowboy Fairytales series: a reverse-Cinderella story  If the boot fits…  There’s nothing glamorous about Ethan Townsend’s life. At twenty-five, he’s given up his college education and pretty much everything else to run the family dairy farm in north Texas and provide for his two spoiled stepbrothers. When he meets a real-life princess, he can’t help but be attracted to her beauty—even though he knows she’s way out of his league.  Princess Mia of Glorvaird is visiting the States to help manage her sister’s upcoming engagement ball. Bonus: she can escape the media blitz over her last—very public—breakup back home. When she meets hard-working Ethan, she realizes she’s been looking for love in all the wrong places.  Even though attraction sparks, how can Ethan expect to build a real relationship with a princess? Especially when his stepbrothers sabotage him at every turn?  Cowboy Charming is a contemporary western retelling of the Cinderella fairytale and Book 2 in the Cowboy Fairytales series.",
