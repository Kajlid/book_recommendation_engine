  "description": "Astarti’s master controls her through a Leash, a bond of energy anchored deep within her. Despite being one of the few remaining Drifters, able to manipulate the energy world, she cannot break free. She knows her fate: she will serve until she dies, at which point her master will harvest her energy to augment his own. Oh, yes, she’s done some bad things in her master’s name. She’s not asking for forgiveness. She expects you to hate her. What she doesn't expect is Logan, a man meant to be her sworn enemy. A man with secrets as dark as her own.Author's note: Katherine Buel formerly wrote as Katherine Hurley.",
