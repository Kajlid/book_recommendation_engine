  "description": "THIS IS A FULL-LENGTH, STAND-ALONE, ADULT ROMANCE I have been staring at her for three months. Watching her. Memorizing her. For ninety-two days, I’ve looked into those lifeless green eyes. And for ninety-two days she has inspired me in ways I never knew possible. A muse, unbeknownst to her. Motivating me. Encouraging my darkest desires. I’m a man who knows what he wants. And what I want is the beautiful and broken Holland Howard. My name is Jensen Payne—photographer, autocrat, lecher, Scopophiliac. I am who I am and I will not—cannot—change.  THIS BOOK CONTAINS POSSIBLE EMOTIONAL TRIGGERS FOR SOME READERS. PLEASE TAKE THIS WARNING SERIOUSLY. Recommended for readers 18+ ONLY.",
