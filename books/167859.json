  "title": "A Requiem Dawn",
  "description": "Five thousand years ago, the Atreianii transcended humankind, reducing men and women to slaves and pets. These post-human demigods reigned for centuries across their world and throughout the solar system, and for a time they created their paradise. Yet it could not last; they warred amongst themselves, reduced the globe to dust and ash, and fled beneath the ground, awaiting better days. An E’cwn huntress, Nyahri, has awakened one such demigod, one still determined to destroy her own kind, to right old wrongs, and to avenge a long-dead beloved. Dormant powers, older than Nyahri can imagine, draw her from her tribal life into the service of a goddess— Whose heart beats like anyone’s, longing for her lost companion, a love who may one day live again through Nyahri herself. A Requiem Dawn explores identity, sexuality, ecology, and the depths to which we might go to save ourselves or our world. It is a cerebral action adventure which is one part science fiction, one part western, and one part something you've never seen before.",
