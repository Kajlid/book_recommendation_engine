Now the town's businesses are crumbling, its citizens bitter and disaffected. Anne and Lewis refuse to succumb to the fate of the older generation as they discover - together - the secrets of their hometown and their own families. Bad Houses is a coming-of-age tale about love, trust, hoarding, and dead people's stuff from award-winning creators Sara Ryan (Empress of the World) and Carla Speed McNeil (Finder).",
