  "description": "A Big Cold Dry Explanation For Getting High (ABCDEFGH) is a collection of 30 poems, which depict the Authorâ€™s personal experiences through happy, troubled, pensive times and those in denial and in escape. Experimenting with different styles, rhyme schemes and genres, the poems display a variety of moods and ideas each different from the other, unique. ABCDEFGH is also a journey of the Author through the times and how poetry was a pivot around which reality and obscurity revolved, often overlapping. The ideas expressed are blunt and at times visceral and objective, but keeping true to the emotions felt and the swarm of words within the cacophonous self. It is, as the Author says, to the continuing journey; from the end of all innocence, to the beginning of all truth. Poems range from self-questioning, self-deprecating, romantic, motivating, to complete fiction, but somehow retaining the nakedness of thought and the purity of essence.",
