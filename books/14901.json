  "description": "This Edition is no longer for Sale. See 2nd Edition.Forbidden doesn't mean never.Shannon Sullivan is an outcast. In 1920’s Ireland, love like his is forbidden and men like him face prosecution and even death. But it’s not his fault, really. If his male teacher hadn’t turned him into the monster he is today by doing those sordid things to him, then maybe the priest of their town wouldn’t have forced the confessions that led him to harden his heart against the world, even his best friend and the one person he loves, the person he’s always loved.Ciaran O’Kelly’s mother just up and died. Ciaran is beside himself with grief and needs his best friend’s comfort. But Shannon’s not one to give comfort. In fact, Shannon doesn’t like to be touched at all. It won’t stop Ciaran. In fact, a hasty embrace in the barn uncovers confusing feelings he’s not sure he can ignore. When his father asks Shannon to accompany him on a journey to Dublin to bring a family heirloom to his Aunt, he’s more than happy to go. Along the way, a drunken night in a shared hotel room shatters all boundaries between them. Neither one can turn back. As their love grows, they face the obstacles of Irish society and the Catholic church among political unrest.",
