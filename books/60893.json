  "description": "When leatherman Mason—the Fancy Man—discovered lipstick lesbian Katie out in the Cockpit Bar’s parking lot, weeping for her lost lover, he was all sympathy. Given how perfumed and delicate she was, however, he wasn’t at all sure how to get the bar’s tough leatherdykes to take her seriously. Then it came to he’d star her in a whipping scene at the bar. The problem? The best with a whip was leatherman Burke, and Burke was not only aggressively gay, but adverse to anything remotely feminine. Could Mason and his submissive, Charles, get these two to work together? More, could he get them to connect? This one looked to be beyond even the Fancy Man’s magic. (M/M, Novella - 11,700 words)",
