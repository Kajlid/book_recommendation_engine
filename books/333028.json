  "description": "Desperate times call for desperate measures…Saddled with insurmountable debt, Tessa is desperate for a way out. When she’s referred to an agency that pairs vampires with blood donors as a quick way to make some cash, she has no choice but to accept an arrangement. She expects pain. She expects fear. She expects a predator. But what she gets is something entirely different. Her vampire match is... sweet. Kind. Protective. And the way he makes her feel is anything but painful.Can the ends justify the means…?Amos has long since given up on the idea of ever finding a blood mate. Accepting that the only live blood he’ll ever enjoy will be from paid donors, he finally gives in and enlists a blood-matching service. But when he finally meets his match, she’s everything he could have asked for in a mate—kind, funny, beautiful. He knows right away that he wants her for keeps, but it’s a huge leap from temporary donor to eternal blood mate. If Amos is going to keep Tessa forever, he’ll have to win her heart first.",
