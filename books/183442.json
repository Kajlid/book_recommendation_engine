  "description": "Jack McCoy has gambled away all but his last few dollars. He owes his bookie a fortune, and he's out of options.  Jack's buddy Vic leads him to an opportunity that will get him square: a $300 daily paycheck, in exchange for participation in an off-the-grid government drug trial where he will become Subject 15.  What should have been the solution to his problems quickly twists into a nightmare that bankrupts not only his body and mind, but possibly his soul.  A drug that seems to make the unreal real. Agents in suits. Doctors with fading morals. A love affair. A deranged killer.  All he wanted to do was start over, but now Jack will be lucky to claw his way out alive.",
