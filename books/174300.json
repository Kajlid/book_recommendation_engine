  "description": "Cable TV personality Ricky Gold has problems. He's on the run from a bad relationship, hasn't shown up for work in a week, and his iPhone is at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. And now his life is about to be turned upside down...It starts when he meets Kada--as in Cicada-- in the middle of West Texas, and finds himself intrigued by her name, her tattoo, and the way an angry redneck chases her out of a bar. When someone close to Kada turns up dead their flight begins, first from an assassin...then two...then from every law enforcement officer in a five-state area.Thoroughly unequipped for a life on the run, they must depend on each other while struggling against their own mutual attraction - a factor that could prove fatal. Drawing Down the Moon  is equal parts Hitchcockian thriller and romantic comedy, filled with memorable characters.  It's a witty screwball noir thriller that follows Ricky and Kada as they fight to survive - and hope to find some really great Chinese food.",
