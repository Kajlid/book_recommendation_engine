  "description": "A tyrant, a dreamer, a warrior princess... and a dragon. Dragon Fire is the story of a farm boy yearning for something more out of life; a rebellious princess who wants to be seen as more than just a girl; and a wizard who is determined to change the course of a kingdom ruled by a ruthless king. Throw in secret pasts, power hungry knights, and a little romance and you find yourself in the middle of a coming-of-age tale set in a world where the young have no hope and the old no longer believe in magic. With compelling characters and vivid language, it is an action-packed story of romance, hope, sacrifice, and the most unlikely of heroes. * Finalist - 2018 UNO Press Publishing Lab Prize",
