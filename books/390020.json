Mostly written on the island paradise of Capri (the idyllic setting of the Oscar-winning movie Il Postino), Love Poems embraces the seascapes surrounding the poet, and his love Matilde Urrutia, their waves and shores saturated with a new, yearning eroticism.And when you appearall the rivers soundin my body, bellsshake the sky,and a hymn fills the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Â© 1973 by Neruda &amp; Walsh",
