  "description": "From the Seminole uprisings to the Civil War, they fought for their beloved plantation, their family, and their faith. . .Margaret Seton had loved the handsome young widower long before she become Lewis Fleming's bride. Together they would rebuild Hibernia on the St. Johns River in northern Florida, and fill it to overflowing with laughter and tears of their large, close-knit family. But nothing could have prepared them for the ravages ofwar, the rampaging Seminoles, then the victorious Yankees plundering their cherished South, calling Margaret's husband and sons to battle, and her daughters to frightening new times. And above all, calling upon Margaret herself in this hour of need to become their wellspring of hope and faith.",
