  "description": "Through her tireless efforts in the lab, Dr. Janna Delany has discovered an important antidote. Receiving an award at The Science Summit in Bern, Switzerland, her confidence shatters when she sees Sean O’Sullivan in the crowd. His presence reduces her to the bumbling, awkward teen she’d been on their last meeting – when he’d gladly accepted her innocence and then vanished without a trace.Secret Service Agent O’Sullivan’s past comes rushing back when he sees Janna – across an ocean no less. After his parent’s funeral, his tomboy neighbor tried to comfort him in a way he wasn’t prepared for. Now, seventeen years later, the tomboy is a successful siren. Sean must remain professional and distant with Janna to maintain his self-control.Their worlds collide when both are captured during a high-stakes kidnapping. Goran Kustovic plans to use Janna’s antidote to save himself while infecting those who oppose his ‘cause’. Sean and Janna escape the underground tunnels of Germany’s Black Forest and are forced to work together while running for their lives…and into each other’s arms.",
