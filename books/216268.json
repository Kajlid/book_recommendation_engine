  "description": "For as long as I’ve lived, Dark Walkers have been hunting Plaguers, seeking them for their magic. But there’s one Plaguer they want most of all. Me.  Since the fall of civilization, the human race has been barely surviving. Another outbreak of the Bloody Death could be our final straw and there’s only one way to ensure that doesn't happen. I need to kill the leader of the Dark Walkers.  I’m stronger than ever but with more to lose than I ever thought possible. For the first time, I feel like I’ve got a family, a home…Dax.  So here I am; ready to fight. Winner take all.",
