  "description": "\"The Story of Teddy and Eddie is not a mystery book, and yet a quiet sense of mystery pervades every page from the very beginning.\" - (Amazon) ã€€The Story of Teddy and Eddie introduces Nino, an atypical child who grows up in a conventional New Jersey suburb in the 1960s and 1970s. In the way peculiar to adolescents, Nino settles into a quietly detached existence, the bottle of whisky he keeps in his backpack always within reach.One day, at the age of 20, his day to day existence is upended in the university library, sending Nino off on a frantic search for a place that isn't on any map. With the help of his friends Teddy and Eddie he embarks on a breathless journey that, in the end, drops Nino off at his destination.Compelling, sexually charged, and awash in anxious uncertainty, The Story of Teddy and Eddie follows Nino on his intimate journey, illuminating the indelible impact of childhood and memory on matters of the heart.",
