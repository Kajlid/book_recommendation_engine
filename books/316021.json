  "description": "\"I stand tall in the face of armageddon and pluck my guitar.The words just come to me like drippings of melted sugar.\"Songs Voices Never Share chronicles the tale of a lonely bird as he embarks on an epic journey of self-discovery through the heart of music, filled with references to the Greek Mythos. He meets a string of interesting characters on his way, each with their own unique stories to tell, as they all help him understand his true place in the world. A modern-day parable to the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice - Songs Voices Never Share is about all those thoughts and memories that remain unsaid or somewhere lost in time. The poems in this collection make the reader question the true meaning of dreams, hope, love, and the price that artists pay to sing the songs.",
