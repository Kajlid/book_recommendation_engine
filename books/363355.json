His fascination with her quickly turns to obsession until he stalks her both online and off.Leah is bright and bubbly and popular, and there’s no way he’ll ever be able to get close to her. A beauty like her doesn’t belong with a nerd like him.But when Leah starts failing college algebra, Oliver can be her tutor—if nothing more.",
