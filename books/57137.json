  "description": "Black Lace -- the leading erotic imprint for women.     When bookstore owner Kate comes home from work to find her two male flatmates in bed -- together -- she is surprised. And even more so when they ask her to join in.Up until now, Kate has hidden her fantasies of her superhot flatmates, but realising that pleasure is a reciprocal thing, she sets her inhibitions aside and embarks on a ménage à trois with the untamable duo. She becomes hooked on this different kind of loving -- even though she knows it cannot last. And the interest that the more conservative men show her is just not enough to tear her away from those wild nights of carnal pleasure.",
