  "description": "(Spin-off of Planning on Forever)College. Parties, sororities and getting drunk. Oh, yeah. And learning.  This may be true for most college students, but not for Leah Bennett. College life for her includes studying, working, and excelling in school. When it comes to the social ladder, Leah is at the bottom. Popular girls, hot guys and star athletes are of no importance to her, except for one. Matthew Jacobs. Matt is the starting wide receiver at SUNY Cortland, the most wanted guy on campus and Leah’s best friend. Although Leah’s feelings toward Matt run deeper than just a friendship, it is something she would never let be seen because the odds of someone like Matthew Jacobs going for someone like Leah Bennett are slim to none.  When Matt starts showing an interest in Leah that goes beyond friendship, she is dumbfounded and doesn’t believe it is possible – until one weekend that changes everything.  Will Matt and Leah’s popularity status get in the way of having a chance at a real relationship? Or does status mean nothing when it comes to true love?",
