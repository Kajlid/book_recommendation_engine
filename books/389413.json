  "title": "The Teaching Of Little Crow",
  "description": "Few mortals have not dreamed of, or longed for, the Divine Love of their soul's true mate - that one being created as their pure counterpart. Our history, legends, myths, and spiritual traditions have told the tale of Twin Flames, or soul mates, and the soul growth required in order for them to responsibly reunite. The Teaching of Little Crow is the story of a movie mogul and rock star, a man who has risen to the pinnacle of worldly success with all its accompanying symbols. In his heart of hearts, however, he aches with an incompleteness he can neither define, nor remedy.",
