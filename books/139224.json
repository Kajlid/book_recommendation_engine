Who would have known after everything they'd been through together Father McDermott, a Catholic priest he has secretly been dating would do something like that to him?  Then he meets Hunter, a slightly older, slow-talking, smart but simple country boy who takes him in and teaches Casey to believe in himself, what true love is, and how to please a real man in bed (or on his knees).",
