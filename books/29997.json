  "description": "Lust. Anger. Hate. Desire. Love. Happiness. Joy. iFeel.  What happens when an unknowing empath meets a pixie who wears leather, a snitch who is repulsive and a fiery angel who can literally set your soul on fire? A whole lot of emotional turmoil and one love story ignited.  Liv Christianni is isolated, alone, tortured and withdrawn, saddled with the torrential downpour of the worldâ€™s emotions. Accepting of her providence Liv has lost all hope, until one day fate steps in and spins the course of her life like a spiraling top. Hunted by a Spirit Stalker, Liv is forced to gain control of herself and her surroundings, threatened by the touch of her immortal love; she must find a way to survive both physically and emotionally. Can she find the courage to accept her true self? Can she love unconditionally cognizant of the condemning consequences? Can she rise from the ashes to become the person she was always meant to be?  Funny, witty, real, and poignant, iFeel rips into your soul, and sets your emotions on fire.",
