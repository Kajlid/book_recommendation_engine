  "title": "The Demeter Flower",
  "description": "Like Charlotte Gilman's Herland or Joanna Russ's The Female Man, The Demeter Flower is the story of a female utopia. Singer imagines an entire society created and governed by women who have survived the violent collapse of late-twentieth-century patriarchal society by withdrawing to their own village and guarding their newly-discovered secret of parthenogenesis. The peace is shattered when a pair of outsiders, a man and woman from the medieval patriarchal culture that has developed in the world outside, arrive at the village. A probing, thoughtful story of conflict and survival, love and the reality of change and struggle.",
