  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ISBN 014044369X.'He would stand for all time while the whole room was filled with the green and gold of the sun's mid-day rays and mid-day shadows, and his heart overflowed with the sweet languor of idleness and carefree youth - carefree first youth.'Returning to Russia from a tour in Italy, twenty-three-year-old Dimitry Sanin breaks his journey at Frankfurt, and for the first time falls deeply, deliriously in love. Convinced that nothing can come in the way of everlasting happiness between him and his fianc√©e, he impetuously decides to sell his Russian estates and start a new life, not knowing that his youthful vulnerability makes him potential prey for a darker, destructive passion.Composed thirty years after the events it describes Spring Torrents is an exquisitely written, partly autobiographical treatment of one of Turgenev's favourite themes - man's inability to learn about love without losing his innocence. This translation by Professor Schapiro is accompanied by detailed notes and a critical essay on the story's place and significance in its author's life and works.",
