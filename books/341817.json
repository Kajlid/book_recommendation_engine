  "title": "Animal Dreaming : The Symbolic and Spiritual Language of the Australasian Animals",
  "description": "Ancient teachings suggest that we are capable of communing with the forces of nature and to speak readily to the animals, birds, reptiles, fish and even the insects. If we listen carefully to what they have to say and take time to learn their symbolic language, the teachings say that everything is equal and that nature speaks to those who listen. The animals each have a lesson to share.Animal Dreaming can be seen as a unique opportunity to broaden one's ability to interpret the symbolic language of the animal kingdom. It brings to the People, possibly for the first time, a comprehensive list of over 200 Australasian animals -- introducting them to its readers as totems, teachers, healers and spiritual allies.Provides ample guidelines for partaking in your own medicine totem by means of a guided meditative journey, and how to honor your totem once found. It illustrates quite concisely Australia's seasonal wheel of the year, introduces its readers to what it means to be a \"feral\" Australian, while expansively listing the spiritual and symbolic interpretations of over 200 native, domesticated and introduced animals, birds, reptiles and fish. An Australian first and a must have for anyone interested in Earth Wisdom and rudimentary Shamanic Lore.",
