  "description": "Just when she thinks she’s gotten her life pieced back together, Kristine Stone wakes to a searing kiss from someone rather unexpected. This dark angel is determined to win her heart, and he refuses to play fair. This doesn’t sit well with her former lover, Kadyn Rand, who yanks the rug out from under her when he confesses that he wants to be more than just friends. She refuses to choose and gets roped into an impossible dating agreement, that she is quite certain will land her a one way ticket to hell. Amidst all this insanity, a new friend presents an exciting opportunity to work for an international organization devoted to peace-building. When Kristine joins her friend in Sevastopol to train university students in conflict resolution, she finds herself accused of being a spy by two security agencies deeply entrenched in the former KGB. A chance run-in with the Russian Mafia proves beneficial as three men from her past are forced to work together in an effort to save her life.",
