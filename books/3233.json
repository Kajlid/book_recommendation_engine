And in The Little Book of Letting Go, he offers a simple three-step process for shedding prejudices, preconceptions, and prejudgments and facing each moment with openness and enthusiasm. Prather first explains why it is essential to learn to let go and then outlines a 30-day plan for spiritual renewal. Finally, he offers specific techniques for getting a grip on habitual reactions, the need to control, and the addiction to conflict.",
