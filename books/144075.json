  "title": "Cruelty of Thirst",
  "description": "Cruelty of Thirst is the first prequel to the Messengers and Thieves Where the Garden Begins, A Leaf of Faith, and Roots and Branches.The oldest and most read book of all time speaks of spiritual forces in high places, unseen by the naked eye. In these high places, evil forces are waging an ongoing battle to destroy and kill all of humanity. Suppose you were offered a chance to see how and where one such battle for your soul is taking place. Would you dare to look? Cruelty of Thirst is an origin story of just such a battle. Evil rulers and authorities influence the innocent and transform a once peaceful realm to one of chaos and death. The written word is banned, natural resources are exploited, and freedom is traded for addiction. Will those in this other realm seek the lifesaving springs of hope or will they suffer the unquenchable cruelty of thirst? There are answers in the prophetic writings of the Five Realms of Here, but there are only a few remaining souls that believe the prophecies and even fewer that can interpret them. Courage and hope come from the most surprising heroes; Willow the ancient tree, Zorian the gentle giant, and Beely, a young uncompromising woman of God. Do not suppose this is mere fantasy, but rather imagine the grand spectacle of all that transpires unseen around us.",
