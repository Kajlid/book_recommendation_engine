  "description": "My alien overlord is green, feral, and determined to keep me.  All of us girls growing up on New Terrhan know that when we become of age, we must submit to our overlords in a special ceremony. To my surprise, though, the alien warrior who hunts me down gifts me with hours of bliss...and a beautiful little girl who becomes my only happiness in life after he’s gone.  I’ve never forgotten him, even after surviving an abusive relationship. But when we meet again, he’s different. An unrecognizable beast.  So I run. Of course, I run. There’s no way I’m letting another violent male near me or our daughter.  But...  My alien overlord is green, feral, and determined to keep me.  And if you think you know what’s coming next, believe me, you have no clue. This is the kind of epic story, that has to be read to be believed.  DEAREST READERS, PLEASE NOTE: This is an alien encounter story with situations outside of our human laws and boundaries. If you can’t stand punishment, submission, and all sorts of dark matter, DO NOT one-click this crazy hot romance. These alien overlords aren’t the kind of guys you can take home to meet your parents.",
