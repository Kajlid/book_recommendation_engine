Although there are only eight students in Emman’s creative writing class, one of these is classically autistic and another has Asperger syndrome. Also present in the class is an undercover agent, one of three who enrolled at Coltsfoot District High at the beginning of the fall term. Surprising secrets are revealed through journaling projects assigned to the diverse eight who call themselves Enigma Club.Genre: literary, mysteryiBook: USA https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/enig... and Canada https://itunes.apple.com/ca/book/enig...",
