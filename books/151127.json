Unknown to the Valendrans and their hybrid females, he’d been able to build an empire on Earth and more importantly; he even had their own working for him.  Now they had the one thing he needed more than anything, and he would initiate a plan that he’d spent hundreds of years preparing for in order to get it.  An empire will crumble.  Two rulers will rise and one will die.  A new species will be unleashed on the planet and another will retake its rightful place.  An innocent child’s life will rest in the hands of an enemy.  And that’s just the beginning of, Grai’s Game.  NOTE: THIS BOOK IS NOT RECOMMENDED AS A STAND ALONE. THIS BOOK SHOULD NOT BE READ WITHOUT READING CHASING DARE FIRST.",
