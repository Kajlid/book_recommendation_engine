The survivors in Frankfort, Kentucky have battled the undead, thrown off attacks from human oppressors, and finally managed to achieve something like peace. Keeping the tenuous alliances and friendships with other distant settlements strong has become vitally important. Though many colonies of living people have been created from the ashes of civilization, the land between is deadly. In this volume, travel along dangerous roads to new locations, meet others who have made their stand against the end of the world. See an America destroyed by chaos, but populated with a people defiant in the face of the end of all they knew.",
