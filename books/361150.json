  "description": "WANTED: Wife for God-fearing farmer with two children. Hard work. Frontier life.Desperate to escape her abusive father and Boston's brutal waterfront for a respectable life, Delia McQuaid answered an advertisement to become a stranger's wife. But when she applied in person to Dr. Ty Savitch, the ruggedly handsome physician admitted he had merely placed the ad for a neighbor, a widower with two children. One look and Delia knew she would follow the devastating doctor anywhere—even into the Maine wilderness as a mail-order bride for another man.Raised by Indians, educated abroad, Dr. Ty Savitch was an outsider in both worlds, eager to escape to the only home he knew—the small Maine community where he was bringing the ravishing Miss McQuaid. The woman was a revelation of character, courage and brains, a conquest no man could resist—a challenge to his divided soul. Recklessly, he followed his passions, trying to deny his heart—until he delivered her to her promised groom, and then tried to reclaim the beauty who compelled him to embrace his true identity...and taught him the power of love.",
