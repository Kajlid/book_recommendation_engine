  "description": "The story of Milton Mezzrowâ€”a white kid who fell in love with black culture. First published in 1946, Really the Blues was a rousing wake-up call to alienated young whites to explore the world of jazz, the first music America could call its own. Told in the jive lingo of the underground's inner circle, this classic is an unforgettable chronicle of street life, smoky clubs, and roadhouse dances.",
