  "description": "Here, Have a Husband tells a story of the prospect of marriage in a society plagued by a strict, government matchmaking program that pairs and binds applicants to the perfect partner from a simple questionnaire. Told from the sarcastic point-of-view of strong-willed Rainy Clarke, the story begins when the fresh-out-of-college heroine receives the news of her government-assigned engagement to one of the most eligible bachelors in the country. Caught up in a high-profile engagement turned government publicity stunt, Rainy begins to realize that love and marriage are not always the same things, especially in the eyes of the government. The fight to reverse the strict marriage matchmaking system, that seems to be a thorn in the lives of not only her but those around her, falls on Rainyâ€™s shoulders. Filled with relationships that shape every part of existence, Here, Have a Husband triumphantly proves that the right to happiness is something worth fighting even the most formidable opponent for.",
