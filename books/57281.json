  "description": "They say only time will heal a broken heart but Frankie Spencer proves that theory wrong. Music was her guide, and a job at a legendary Hollywood recording studio was her gateway. Bravely fighting her way out of a suffocating relationship, Frankie began working at Cherokee Studios with a cast of characters fit for a royal tabloid court. From the Amazon blonde drummer to the son of a rock legend, she danced, pranced, and sang with rock stars and strippers alike. Every strum of the guitar was a beat of her heart, bringing her back from the edge into a new world of mayhem, romance and stuff books are made of. Frankie stepped into the Hollywood dream and made it her own. The first volume of the Frankie Spencer Series, \"This Rock In My Heart,\" will lead you through the start of her Rock-n-Roll awakening and may even inspire a journey of your own.",
