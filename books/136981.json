  "description": "Hailed by the Washington Post as \"a spontaneous act of generosity,\" The Road Less Traveled has already given more than two million grateful readers an inspirational framework for achieving profound personal growth and satisfaction. Now Dr. Peck, a practicing psychiatrist, reads from his extraordinary work in the first of a series of audio programs drawn from the book. Dr. Peck's crucial premise---that life is hard---is challenging for even the strongest among us, but his art lies in his ability to lead us to accept, and ultimately transcend, this idea. The key is discipline, and with Dr. Peck's assistance, you will learn to master the four principles of discipline needed for every healthy, life-affirming act: Delaying Gratification Accepting Responsibility Dedication to Reality Balancing The Road Less Traveled is a landmark. Never before have psychological and spiritual guidance come together so powerfully. It's not the easiest road---but it is the only one worth taking. Let Dr. Peck's remarkable achievement help you find your way as you journey today, and every day of your life.",
