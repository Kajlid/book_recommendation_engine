  "description": "Precious Ramotswe, traditionally built owner of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, feels that her tiny white van, which has carried her about her business with such steadfastness and reliability, should be replaced by a more modern vehicle. Precious's usually loyal husband, the wonderful Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, takes a different view. Alongside day-to-day matters - such as Mma Makutsi's dowry negotiations - there are more difficult problems for Mma Ramotswe to solve. A client, who was adopted, asks her to trace her biological family. But will Mma Ramotswe's searches bring happiness or something rather different, something rather frightening?",
