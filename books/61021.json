When British NYU professor Daniel Gardner's career-obsessed wife convinces him to move to the suburbs, he hopes it's a first step toward starting the family he longs to have.

When new neighbors move in and the two couples start sharing weekly meals together, everything changes.A penchant for good books, bad movies, and Marienne's to-die-for brownies sparks a powerful bond between Daniel and Marienne. As their marriages unravel and their lives take unimaginable turns, their friendship helps them weather every hardship, leaving them both single and wondering. Were they destined to meet? And are they meant to be friends or much, much more?",
