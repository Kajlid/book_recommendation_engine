  "description": "When Anne learns that her 19-year-old is a transgender man, she struggles to understand her son’s new identity. A new landmark in nonfiction comics, Transitions is a sympathetic, informative, and moving story of a family’s journey to acceptance.\"I thought I was open-minded… The news of my child’s transition hit me like a tidal wave, sweeping away all my preconceived notions. Sweeping away the comfort of my tidy little life.\"When university biologist Anne Marbot learns that the 19-year-old she raised as \"Lucie\" is a transgender man named Alex, she’s overwhelmed by questions. How can this be? Who put these ideas in your head? What if you regret it? Am I overreacting? How will your grandparents react? Why didn’t I see it coming? Why is this so easy for others? Am I a bigot? What does gender really mean, anyway? How can I be the parent my child needs?It soon becomes clear that Alex is not the only one embarking on a journey of self-discovery. The road is not easy, and sometimes their relationship is bitterly strained. But Alex is sure of himself, and Anne is determined to be strong for his sake. With time, she too will be transformed, rediscovering her identity as a mother in profound new ways.With grace and sensitivity, award-winning graphic novelist Élodie Durand ( Parenthesis ) captures the unique journey of well-meaning loved ones who struggle to reconcile new gender identities with their old assumptions. Deeply researched and drawn from true experience, Transitions is a must-read companion for allies and families navigating trans issues and a compassionate roadmap to acceptance.",
