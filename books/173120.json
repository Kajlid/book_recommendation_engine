  "description": "Set in contemporary Italy, each of these ten stories focuses on the disorientation that ensues when you tumble down the rabbit hole of identity where everything is topsy-turvy. Common sense, decency and good manners are about as useful as a lantern in the Sahara. This second edition of A House of Cards contains two new stories and is confirmation of a special talent at work.",
