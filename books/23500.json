  "title": "Wanderer of the Wasteland",
  "description": "Here is a story of a young man of eighteen who wandered for years after an accidental shooting of his brother. He felt as though he was a counterpart of the Biblical killing by Cain of his brother Abel. It was written by Zane Grey, one of the greatest western novelists. It came out about a dozen years after Grey's Riders of the Purple Sage, one of the most successful western novels ever written. It takes us through a lonely land of prospectors and hermits as it tells of surviving searing Death Valley heat, an area that many consider the deadliest land in the world. Listen now and hear a highly surprising finish.",
