  "description": "Embrace the cold.When World War III ends with a nuclear clash of apocalyptic proportions, Amy must use a set of recently-discovered abilities to help her friends and family survive their new, chaotic world and its ensuing nuclear winter—an indefinite period of time in which the earth, covered by lingering smoke and ash, receives little to no sunlight and undergoes dramatic climate changes. But cooler temperatures are the least of Amy’s worries.With the United States and its government all but obliterated, a seemingly well-intentioned military general takes the helm as the chancellor of the New Republic of America while offering the promise of a better future for the small number of the nation’s survivors. Amy quickly discovers, however, that her abilities—and her less than ideal method of using them—are the key to protecting the hopeless survivors around her from the chancellor’s true, sinister intentions.From action/suspense novelist Guy Harrison, author of the unique and action-packed Agents of Change Trilogy, comes his young adult fiction debut set in the year 2031. Offering flashes of action and romance with surprises at every turn, Nuclear Winter will appeal to fans of Harrison’s signature series and new readers alike.",
