  "title": "Mockery",
  "description": "Mockery (Waters' ninth collection of humorous essays) was designed to mirror a stand up comedy act in terms of pacing and content with themes centering around the institution of marriage, the inescapable heredity of family and the aggravation of dealing with any and all human beings on a day to day basis. When read in the proper order, the book may cause a brain aneurysm. If read at random, Mockery may cause scurvy, flop sweats, excessive whiskey drinking, 'the vapors', permanent and irreparable agitation and terminal anti-social tendencies. Waters' has devoted his life to grumbling and moaning about whatever strikes him as funny while making others laugh at the same time. He often makes fun of others at their expense or resorts to being goofy when all else fails.",
