  "title": "The Greater Good",
  "description": "The news reports spoke of a virus sweeping across South America. Entire villages were wiped out, yet events soon turned the media attention elsewhere.  Then a video hit the Internet and quickly went viral. A video showing a woman, attacked, bitten and dying. Then she rose again.  Experts confirmed the video as a fake and prank. It was widely condemned as fear-mongering.  But all the expert denials counted for nothing when the virus reached the UK.  Chloe finds herself left behind, abandoned by Steve who rejoins the army to fight the new enemy. She does not know if she can survive without him.  Sam, arrogant and selfish in his immaturity, is miles from home, alone and scared. He knows he must change, must become a man, to endure this strange new world.  They must all make sacrifices to do what is right.  To do what is right for the greater good.",
