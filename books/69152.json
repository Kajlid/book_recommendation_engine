  "description": "Annie Reid and Perky Whittier are two girls just trying to make their own ways in a post-apocalyptic world where technology and big cities have been destroyed by global war, called; The War of the East and West. In the aftermath of war the smaller communities and the age of steam and Edwardian social mores have made a big comeback; creating a place where being an independent girl can be difficult. Annie is twenty-four years old; an aviator, a mechanic, and a steam-car racer. Perky is seventeen and Annieâ€™s assistant mechanic, an athlete, and a proud cadet in the Gem City Home Guard. They have happy lives in their modern world; but their happiness is shattered when the city comes under attack by a heavily armed brigade of clone soldiers designed for combat and serving egomaniacal former General; Maxwell Orson. Making a daring escape from the onslaught, the girls flee to an unknown land to enlist the help of militia units from other cities because these girls fight back.  In an early 20th century/WW1 setting with horses and carriages, steam cars, motorbikes, biplanes and dirigibles, there are also war-walkers, occubots, warbots, nomads, rovers and combat model Y chromosome clone soldiers called Cyclones. When all hell breaks loose, two girls must find a way to strike back, to fight for the people they love and the lives they have come to know. Given the opportunity, a host of leftover technology from before The War of the East and West, and a wealth of human spirit, the two girls and the people they come to know make their stand against tyranny.",
