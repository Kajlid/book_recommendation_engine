  "title": "The kings depart: The tragedy of Germany : Versailles and the German revolution",
  "description": "Richard M Watt's book unfolds the story of 1918-19, the fateful year that saw the tragedy of Germany, soon to become the tragedy of Europe. In 1918 came the brief moment when the victorious Allies at the Versailles Conference had the opportunity - by means of a peace with justice - to set up democracy in central Europe. The Kings Depart tells of their failure; of the Allies' rapacity which drove a ruined Germany to seek vengeance; of Germany's terrible collapse into anarchy and Red revolution and her even more frightful salvation at the hands of the army and the Freikorps; of the appearance of the swastika banner and right-wing terrorists and adventurers awaiting their Fuhrer.",
