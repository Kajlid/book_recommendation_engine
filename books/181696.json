  "description": "Too Late… I Love You is the new novel from best-selling, award-winning author Kiki Archer.  Connie Parker isn’t convinced by this falling in love lark. Falling hurts, you end up with bruises and scars.  She has the perfect answer: she’ll write about love instead. But what happens when the novel-in-progress describes more about Connie’s own dull existence than she wants to admit? And when will she realise that her hero is beginning to resemble her new best friend Maria—a woman who seems to turn every simple outing with their 3-year-olds into a fun-filled adventure for them all?  In trying to make sense of the puzzle of her life, Connie learns there is no perfect person. Just that person who'll fit you perfectly.",
