  "description": "The discovery of an ancient artefact sends Keris of the Kelanni and the human Alexander McCann spinning back into the distant past to uncover a threat more terrible than either of them could conceive. Five planetary turns have passed since Humans were driven from the planet Kelanni. Keris learns of an ancient record that purports to tell the true origins of her people, and of a being named Ash that has manipulated their development for his own purposes. But is the record true, or merely another cynical attempt by Humans to exploit the power of Lodestone?",
