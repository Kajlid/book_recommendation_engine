  "description": "Malaysia 3290 Four raises and no promotions, Roslan is sick of playing corporate monkey boy at Raincorp. As luck would have it, his boss takes care of that by firing Roslan the same morning the secretary meets Faye, the new girl at the Peach House Cafe. Small problem he's also told the city of Sibu is set to burn in a major chemical fire in less than a week.Along with his severance package, Roslan's been given the 72 sheets of paper that can leak or stop the Fire Blooms of Sibu. But he was only told to run, not fight. The twenty-two year old naturally decides his first order of business is to rescue the human-trafficked barista.When Faye starts talking, the white-knight paradigm breaks down, and Roslan must navigate the conspiracy, his Islamic faith, and his feelings for Faye, all while trying to keep two-hundred-thousand people from burning to death. From fish dinners to the activist's Dethism religion, Faye has a lot to share with her would-be hero, including the dusty secrets under his farmhouse silo.",
