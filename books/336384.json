Her thoughtlessness leads her into having accept an offer of marriage from the strict and disapproving Lukas. The world as she knows it seems about to fall apart.But then there's Juno, Lukas's old hunting dog, who is very good at match-making. She unerringly points everyone in the right direction.If you've read other Regencies by GL Robinson you will recognise the style: a charming story with a hint of seriousness at its core. If you haven't read her before, this is a good place to start!",
