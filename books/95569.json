  "description": "When art student Seraphina Jones leaves her bag behind on a London tube train, little does she know this will change the course of her life. She initially brushes off the cute guy who comes to her rescue, but when he suggests a seemingly perfect solution to her problems, she decides to take him up on his offer.﻿​For L​ondon School of Economics student Jamie Starr, returning the bag he discovers the gorgeous babe sitting opposite him on the train has left behind gives him the perfect excuse to get to know her better. Jamie is not used to rejection from girls, but despite his best attempts, Sera remains intriguingly unreceptive to his efforts.﻿Cynical wealthy businessman Liam Starr is certain Jamie's good nature has been taken advantage of by a hard up art student. Liam doesn't believe in any of that love or romance rubbish, and he’s determined that a pretty face is not going to take his gullible baby brother for a ride.﻿But first impressions aren't always correct, and people aren’t always what they seem.﻿﻿Recommended for readers 18+ due to explicit sexual content and language",
