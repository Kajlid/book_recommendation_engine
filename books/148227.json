  "description": "Without warning, the world comes to an end. The sky looms frigid white. The electricity falters. Airplanes everywhere crash to the ground.Within moments, the sky comes down in a crushing sheet of light, and everything and everyone are gone—except for Hannah and Amanda Given. Saved from destruction by three fearsome and powerful beings, the Given sisters suddenly find themselves elsewhere: a strange new Earth where restaurants move through the air like flying saucers and the fabric of time is manipulated by common household appliances. Soon Hannah and Amanda are joined by four other survivors from their world--a mordant cartoonist, a shy teenage girl, a brilliant young Australian, and a troubled ex-prodigy. Hunted by enemies they never knew they had and afflicted with temporal abilities they never wanted, the sisters and their companions begin a cross-country journey to find the one man who can save them—before time runs out.“Highly recommended for fans of apocalyptic and dystopian fiction.”—Library Journal (starred review)“An absorbing adventure with a fresh take on both the parallel-universe and the paranormal subgenres.”—Kirkus (starred review)",
