  "description": "The connections women make through scrapbooking inspire a novel full of \"the twists and turns that keep readers turning pages.\"When frazzled mother of four Ashley joins a local scrapbook club, she's amazed at the way old photos and mementos can bring color to sepia-toned memories. Among the diverse group is Tara, a single grad student whose search for love, like her relationship with her absentee father, has only brought her heartache--and some funny dating stories. Then there's Libby, a semi-retired teacher who thought she'd spend her golden years taking classes--not as a town pariah after her son is charged in a corporate scandal. But all three find comfort and inspiration in the scrapbooking group, where they learn that only together can they face earth-shattering revelations and emotionally unavailable men--and figure out their futures while artfully commemorating their pasts.",
