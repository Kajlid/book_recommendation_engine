  "description": "Heartland is a horse farm nestled in the hills of Virginia, but it's much more than that. Heartland is like no other place - it's a place where the scars of the past can be healed, a place where frightened and abused horses learn to trust again.When Ashley Grant shows up uninvited at Heartland, Amy is suspicious. Ashley has been anything but nice in the past, and now she is asking for a favor. She wants Amy to help train Bright Magic, a showy European jumper recently purchased by Ashley's mom. Despite Amy's cloudy relationship with the Grants, she accepts the challenge, knowing that helping horses is her first priority. And as Amy starts to work with Ashley, she begins to see her bitter old rival in a whole new way.",
