  "description": "Not all romances are fairytales. The von Strassenbergs' saga begins in 1877, when Katherine Demure, brimming over with discontentment, is swept into the arms of the mysterious Viktor von Strassenberg who is newly arrived from Europe with dark rumors preceding him. Hoping to find love and adventure, she instead becomes the centerpiece of a mystery that will take generations to unravel. The responsibility falls into the hands of her granddaughter, five times removed, who has no inkling as to the origins of her strange name or the reason she has no connection to her family. All that changes and begins to unravel when she makes the mistake of being found.",
