  "title": "Managing Softly: Learning From Buddha, Gandhi, Gracie",
  "description": "Looking at the history of the world, violence principle emerges as a key driver.It’s all the same in the economic world : companies run to win market shares, employees jockey to gain better position, CEO struggle to convince Wall Street that their strategic orientations are the best and so on.But a closer look at the history of the world reveals three excep-tional men who have been involved in immense battles and have been winning amazing victories using Non-Violence Principle.Buddha succeeded in the spiritual era at a worldwide level. He invented an alternative religion, softer than the existing religions of his time, because he considered its too hard for people. Twenty five centuries later, nearly half the people on earth are declaring them-selves Buddhists. Non Violence Principle is inherent to Buddhism from the religion itself to the way people came to it.Gandhi succeeded in the political sphere on a continental scale. He gave battle to English colonialism in the 20th century. He obtained independence of India following Non Violence Principle in the way he politically struggled against his opponents.Rickson Gracie succeed in sports at martial arts level. He demonstrated the superiority of his martial art: Gracie jiu jitsu, versus any other martial arts, with an historic undefeated record of 450 fights between two men. Non Violence Principle is part of his martial art and is the way he followed to defeat all his oppo-nents.The purpose of the book is to draw the lesson from those three exceptional men and to establish Non Violence Principle as key success factor for tomorrow’s management.",
