  "description": "An ancient peopleâ€™s right to call themselves the fathers of mankind lies tied up in what is known about their DNA. Proud, industrious and inventive, the Basques stand alone and unique among humanity.And then two scientists decide to put their claims to the test, unleashing an instant and murderous response from shadowy forces for whom the answers would threaten their very sense of nationhood.As their laboratories lie smouldering on the Bilbao quaysides Anna Heuston is sent to make sense of it all. Drawn in to a murderous chase to protect the research findings and the last scientist who can explain their significance, she watches in horror as MI6 cynically manipulate proceedings. That is, until she plays them at their own game.",
