Jade Lewis’s night out soon turns in to so much more than expected. A one-night stand with Chance Colt becomes more than she ever bargained for. His determined pursuit of Jade and her resolute dismissal of his charms leaves Jade at odds with her inner hussy.  Confident she has managed to dodge the attraction she has for Chance, she lets down her guard, only to be taken by surprise by Chance’s ploy to win her over and convince her that they’re perfect for one another. Enter Dane, Chance’s best friend. Jade quickly realises all the fight in her was useless, especially when things are left to Chance.",
