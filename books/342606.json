  "description": "You're at your computer. Tickets are a tense, electrifying few seconds from going on sale. Eyeing the time, you're hitting \"Refresh,\" and elsewhere, all your friends are doing the exact same thing. That's Paul Siegell's jambandbootleg. A widespread, high-spirited head rush. Desperation, fretfulnessâ€”all out life-leaping. \"The party starts in the parking lot,\" indeed. With poems shaped like a guitar, the American flag, even a Golgi apparatus, Paul's monumental artworks could easily transform into posters. His is a poetry of exploration, heart and astonishment. Simply put: read Paul Siegell's music. Read it as if listening to the most banging bootleg.",
