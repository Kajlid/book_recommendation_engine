  "description": "The epic, heart-wrenching conclusion to the Court of Pain duology. Spanning four courts, devious and doomed royals, and the most unlikely of loves between a prince and his fool. Spoilers for Book #1 below. They say in the darkest of times, the brightest star has no choice but to shine. I’m no star, nor am I a hero. But I could be the villain. To protect Arin from Razak’s scheming, I’ll have to be. He’s my shaft of sunlight through the storm, my hope in the darkest of times, but Prince Arin is also my weakness. And Razak knows it. The shatterlands are under threat, the crowns are missing, and as the pieces of Razak’s puzzle begin to fall into place, its picture becomes clear. It was never about the crowns, or the courts. It was never about vengeance, or spite. It was always about love. And Razak will not stop until he’s destroyed mine, and all the shatterlands with it.",
