  "description": "The Taskforce sends Special Agent Tobias Burke into a West Virginia militia to inform against its leader. Captain Dylan Connelly is beautiful, damaged, and possibly deadly. Her contempt toward the government’s civil rights violations is apparent, but did she kill the secretary of defense by bombing his car? All the evidence says yes.Tobias and his bomb-sniffing dog are tasked with strengthening the FBI’s case. Yet, the more Tobias discovers of Dylan’s darkest secrets, and the closer they become in mind and body, the less assured he is of her guilt—or is their irresistible attraction coloring his usually clear judgment? When a second killing takes place and once again all evidence points to Dylan, Tobias must race the clock . . . and the FBI . . . to determine whether her nightmarish past has turned Dylan into a terrorist. Or could there be a more horrifying reason why the evidence is mounting against her? Caught between betrayal and justice, Tobias Burke is The Enforcer.",
