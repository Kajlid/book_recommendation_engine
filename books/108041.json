It seems like a simple enough mission---find a missing pocket watch and bring it back to the present. The only problem is, they're not the only ones looking.With danger lurking around every corner, Simon and Elizabeth race against a shadowy foe who is after far more than just a watch. The price for success this time just might be their lives.",
