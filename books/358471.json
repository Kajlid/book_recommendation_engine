  "description": "Quintus Midnight rescues Catriona from a brothel after her relatives sell her. He offers her sanctuary at Midnight Manor, and more than that, he offers her his heart. For him, Catriona's blindness is a blessing, because she can't see the scars that mar his face. But when she learns what Quintus is and wants to be like him, he's faced with a difficult decision: keep her as she is and risk losing her forever, or heal her and risk losing her forever.",
