  "description": "Chase, a good looking, street-wise boy of seventeen lives in a world on the run. Using his wits, looks and skills to get by day to day, he thinks he has a good idea what the world is all about, but does he? Orphaned at the age of thirteen, he has seen his share of trouble, the cruel streets and all the shady things that go with it. He has experienced being on the wrong side of the law but it's nothing compared to what's going on in the real, much bigger world and he's about to find out. A chance encounter leads him to cross paths with The Organization, a group of highly trained youth specialists on a mission to uncover the source of an underground, international ring of kidnappers abducting America's children as a source of labor in a drug and money laundering operation. Little did Chase know that this chance encounter would lead to what would become his destiny.",
