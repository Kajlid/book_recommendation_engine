  "description": "The story of Michelle Montagne is not for the faint-hearted. Rather than a feel-good living happily together ever after novel, this is a deeply emotional experience. The story has strong sexual undertones with some explicit scenes.  Michelle Montagne’s genes held the potential for greatness and success - she was both brilliant and beautiful. Fate had dealt her a good hand, but kept all the aces. Her destiny was determined by external events from a very early age, and her life became a continuous battle between doubt and trust. When fate was not kind to her, she fought it like a tiger.Despite all our wishes and dreams of happiness and everlasting love, nothing in life is really free, and nothing lasts forever.This novel transcends the limitations of genres – it is about the realities of life and a very unique woman’s quest for love and recognition.",
