  "description": "\"Everything epic fantasy should be: rich, cruel, gorgeous, brilliant, enthralling and deeply, deeply satisfying. I loved it.\"--Lev Grossman on \nThe Ruin of Kings\nYou can have everything you want if you sacrifice everything you believe. Kihrin D'Mon is a wanted man.Since he destroyed the Stone of Shackles and set demons free across Quur, he has been on the run from the wrath of an entire empire. His attempt to escape brings him into the path of Janel Theranon, a mysterious Joratese woman who claims to know Kihrin.Janel's plea for help pits Kihrin against all manner of dangers: a secret rebellion, a dragon capable of destroying an entire city, and Kihrin's old enemy, the wizard Relos Var.Janel believes that Relos Var possesses one of the most powerful artifacts in the world--the Cornerstone called the Name of All Things. And if Janel is right, then there may be nothing in the world that can stop Relos Var from getting what he wants.And what he wants is Kihrin D'Mon.Jenn Lyons continues the Chorus of Dragons series with The Name of All Things, the epic sequel to The Ruin of Kings\n\nA Chorus of Dragons1: The Ruin of Kings2: The Name of All Things",
