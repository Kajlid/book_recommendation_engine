  "description": "Although Stephen Leacock may well be remembered as a father of Canadian culture, he was a humorist of the school of Dickens and Mark Twain, exuding a universal quality that knew no borders. He taught the world, and perhaps more importantly Canada itself, that Canadians could laugh heartily and without reserve at themselves. This collection of his works—including several Sunshine Sketches and witticisms such as \"How to Introduce Two People to One Another,\"\"The Perfect Optimist,\"and \"How to Borrow Money\"—demonstrates a warmth and wit that during his lifetime permeated his casual speech and possessed a timeless quality that lives on today.",
