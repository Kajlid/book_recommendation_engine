  "description": "From the New York Times bestselling author of The Only Plane in the Sky and Pulitzer Prize finalist for Watergate comes the most up-to-date and complete account of D-Day—the largest seaborne invasion in history and the moment that secured the Allied victory in World War II.D-Day is one of history’s greatest and most unbelievable military and human triumphs. Though the full campaign lasted just over a month, the surprise landing of over 150,000 Allied troops on the morning of June 6, 1944, is understood to be the moment that turned the tide for the Allied forces and ultimately led to the defeat of the Axis powers in World War II. Like September 11th, it is a human drama that fundamentally changed the trajectory of history—and now, When the Sea Came Alive covers it all, exploring the full impact of this world-changing event.From the secret creation of landing plans by top government and military officials and organization of troops, to the moment the boat doors opened to reveal the beach where men fought for their lives and the future of the free world, historian and bestselling author Garrett M. Graff recounts the dramatic moments and heroic acts of bravery that led the Allies to victory in World War II.Fascinating, action-packed, and filled with impressive detail, When the Sea Came Alive captures the true essence of D-Day and is both an important work of military history and a fitting tribute to the soldiers of the Greatest Generation.",
