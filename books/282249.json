  "description": "No one said being a medium would be easy.Rain Christiansen, former FBI agent and current cold case detective, is starting to think it's the hardest job he's ever hadâ€”and the most important. He's determined to accept all the changes in his formerly well-ordered life, but that means embracing a whole lot of weird. There's no instruction manual for meshing his work with his medium duties, and he's painfully aware that he's flubbing the job. So are the ghosts, who are becoming increasingly impatient. And stronger.To complicate matters, he's not sure what these spooktacular developments mean for his relationship. It certainly seems like Daniel McKenna, his partner in work and life, is in it for the long haul. But Rain can't help but wonder how long that patience will last...and what he'll do if Danny decides the intrusive ghosts are just too much.Rain thought accepting his supernatural gifts would be the solution to his troubles. But he's starting to realize his problems are just getting started.",
