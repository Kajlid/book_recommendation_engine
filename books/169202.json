  "description": "Meet Penelope Caruso-Byrne. You may not have heard of her, but you’ve probably heard her voice. That scene from your favorite TV show that made you ugly cry? Yep, that was her on the soundtrack. She’s living the dream. Intelligent, gorgeous and making a living doing what she loves in an indie folk duo with her rock of a hipster husband, Seth. So when she’s offered the most ridiculous sell out opportunity of a lifetime by the world’s biggest pop star, Marc Justin, the answer is easy. Right? Set in the never dull music industry THE BIG IF takes a deeper look at that gray space in love where compromise crosses the line. Can Penelope have her dreams and desires satisfied without shattering culturally created boundaries? She does call herself an adventuress, after all. If choosing her own path means losing stability and comfort, not to mention love, will this adventuress have the courage to throw expectations aside and follow her heart?",
