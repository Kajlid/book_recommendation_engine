But two years ago, Michael ran from the unconventional relationship growing between the three of them. When Michael returns from America, things have changed drastically for all of them. Rushing headlong into a scorching, passionate reunion may be a bad idea. Michael’s secrets have the power to keep them apart forever, but Very and Wolf have secrets of their own.
