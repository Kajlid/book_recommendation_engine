  "description": "Will bad blood keep them apart?  After finding strange tracks from a huge unknown breed of wolf near their home, Blaine, the alpha of the gray wolves, must investigate. Alone by a nearby stream, the shifter is surprised to discover who the tracks and the scent belong to.  The Dire Wolves, an ancient pack the grays thought extinct, came spoiling for a fight. Led by Kerrick, the northern pack of huge wolves had traveled south looking for two things in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountainsâ€”to take over and to find mates.  When Blaine is taken by surprise by Kerrick, he finds himself strangely attracted to the huge male. But then Blaine accidentally almost kills Kerrick, escalating tension between the packs. Will the two alphas be able to resolve the conflict between them and merge their packs or will they lose each other forever?",
