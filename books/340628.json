  "title": "Chasing the Avatar: Descent Book 1 (Descent",
  "description": "A novel dangerously close to evil and too close to reality... dabbling in things not of God. Maya is a young woman with extraordinary prospects who is drowning in intense discontent. In the midst of her anguish, she meets Cha Ma, a Hindu guru. Immediately she believes that Cha Ma is an avatar—a human incarnation—of the goddess Kali, the most malevolent and destructive of all Hindu deities. Spellbound, Maya leaves behind her parents, faith, career, life, and moves to India to live in Cha Ma's ashram as a Hindu. Her choice hurls her parents into emotional, physical, and spiritual battles far beyond their wildest imaginations, for they must fight for their daughter's life and soul as she teeters on the edge of her very existence. Spirits supernaturally collide as they battle for the lives and souls of Maya, her parents, and the people attached to them. As Maya seeks truth, she finds the dabbling in things not of God makes way for the insidiousness and slipperiness of evil and the danger of sliding deeper and deeper into its darkness.",
