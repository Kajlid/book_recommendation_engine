  "description": "There's something about our new landlord, Alec.Something that I can't quite place.He seems familiar, but not. Like maybe I've seen him before.And sure, he's attractive, strictly objectively speaking. I'm not into dudes.But he has this intense, piercing stare that I can't look away from.Eyes that make me feel like they can see right through me.Like he knows all my secrets.And I wish he would share them with me because sometimes I feel like I don't even really know myself.But I do know one thing.I take my responsibilities to my family and friends very seriously.And when your best friend is gay, you learn to be the best straight wingman at the gay bar you can be.And if you happen to hook up with a guy once in a while... well, it doesn't really mean anything.It's just a good way to relax and unwind.But when it's Alec who turns up, ready and willing to help me \"relax\", I know it's a bad idea but I just can't resist.I tell myself just this once. It won't ever happen again.Well, maybe just one more time...",
