  "description": "Just over a year ago, my father plucked me up like a weed and took me and all our belongings (no, that is not true—he did not bring the chestnut tree or the willow or the maple or the hayloft or the swimming hole or any of those things which belong to me) and we drove three hundred miles straight north and stopped in front of a house in Euclid, Ohio.There, Samantha Hiddle begins to unravel the mystery that surrounds her world—a world from which her mother has suddenly, and without warning, disappeared.",
