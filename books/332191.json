  "title": "Ike's Journey: A Novel of World War II",
  "description": "Ike Eisenhower is charged by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill with leading an alliance to liberate the subjugated people of Europe from Hitler’s iron grip. The US Army is humiliated in its first battle with the Germans. Prima donna generals Patton and Montgomery create crises that threaten to rip apart the alliance. Fractured French politics and Charles de Gaulle cause Eisenhower more headaches than the Nazis. In the tunnels of Gibraltar and Malta, he makes monumental decisions involving the lives of his soldiers. Under enormous stress, he finds comfort and camaraderie with his beautiful English driver, Kay Summersby. A wartime romance could help him cope with the crushing burdens of command, but the thought of betraying his loving wife, Mamie, offends his deep sense of morality.From Pearl Harbor to Washington, London, North Africa, and Italy, Ike’s Journey follows Eisenhower’s odyssey in the early years of World War II—one that tests the strength of his convictions, challenges his leadership, and prepares him to lead the greatest invasion in world history.",
