  "description": "A battle is coming… …and the immortal knights aren’t ready. Will an orphan be the key? For fifteen hundred years Lucan has waged war with the greatest enemy the world has ever known …and fought the ancient curse that means loving someone with all his heart and soul might be the reason they die. Tom wasn’t supposed to be born… twice. How, as a young child, had he even heard the monsters at all? How, as an adult, is he caught up in a deadly battle to fight evil, but cannot get one stubborn man to even acknowledge he exists? Time is running out, not just to unravel the secrets of Tom’s destiny, but for Tom to show Lucan that loving someone with all that they have doesn’t mean breaking their heart. Or does it?",
