  "description": "Madi is counting on Paris’s reputation as the City of Love. Now she just needs to figure out if it’s old love or new love...MadiAfter two years and zero proposals, my relationship could use a little spark. Paris during the holidays seems like just the ticket—one perfect, final opportunity for my boyfriend to take things to the next level.The fact that he’s rented me the tiny servant quarters in the apartment of a very good-looking Frenchman is . . . puzzling. And when he asks that Frenchman to take me around the city while he’s busy at work trainings? Color me confused.Is this some sort of pre-engagement test? If so, I’m not sure I’m doing too hot.RémyOffering to host my friend’s vacation rental means making sure the first review is five solid, sparkling stars. When the guest who shows up is a beautiful American woman, I’m thinking my task might be more enjoyable than I thought. Until I find out she has a boyfriend. Madi deserves to have an amazing time in Paris, though, so I’m more than happy to oblige when the guy asks me to show her the city.It’s cool. I’m cool. This is all for that five-star review…◆ Host for the Holidays is a closed door romance full of fun, chemistry, and a generous dash of the magic of Paris",
