  "description": "A Regency Inspirational Love Story set in the scenic Cotswolds of England: She was a mail order bride... He, a strong willed man of morals and faith... a titled Duke, the heir to a vast fortune and land holdings....he was looking for his Duchess... looking for a virtuous bride and a true love. He was running out of time. Was there anyone in the kingdom, in all of England, worthy of his devotion? When William decides to find a wife through a mail order bride advertisement in Regency England, he is hoping to find true love with someone who shares his faith. Although his relationship with his mail order bride begins as a business arrangement between himself and the lovely vicar's daughter, The Honorable Miss Alexandra Benningham, he has great hope and faith that in time, they will both find love and happiness as they share a life built on the same foundation of Christ-centered living. This is also his last resort to meet the requirements of his father's will in order to retain his full inheritance. He's had more than enough of England's finest debutantes trying to marry him for social status and wealth. He promises Miss Benningham an annulment if the marriage doesn't work out and decides not to tell her about his title as a means of testing her motive and character. Will she be able to love him first as a mere farmer? When Lady Catherine Duncan shows up on the scene, things really get complicated. She seems to know a lot more about William than Alexandra does, to Alexandra's great concern. Lady Catherine claims the Duke violated a marriage contract with her and threatens to contest his marriage. Will he lose Alexandra forever because of Lady Catherine? Or will his lack of trust drive her away first?",
