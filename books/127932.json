He sets forth on an epic voyage that will take him halfway around the world -- defying storm and monster, betrayal and despair -- to the heart of the greatest battle of the age, and to the discovery at last of his true purpose upon the high seas.The War of the Four Isles is the third volume in Andrew McGahan's momentous Ship Kings series.",
