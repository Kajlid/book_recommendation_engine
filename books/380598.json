  "description": "A thundering epic about Bucephalus, young Alexander the Great's fierce, fiery, battle-scarred stallion--straight from the horse's mouth.\"I am the dark horse, Bucephalus. I am no black beauty. I am a stallion trained for war.\" From the moment they dare sit on his back, the fates of Alexander, 12-year-old heir to the Macedonian throne, and Charm, a kind stable girl, are bound to the battle-ready steed. When the boy becomes king, Bucephalus helps his young master transform into a conquering hero. In a hard-won, nearly blind blaze of glory, they gallop from Greece to the golden sands of Persia to the edge of the known world. At their side, as ever, is Charm. This is their epic. Through the eyes of a horse, history unfolds.",
