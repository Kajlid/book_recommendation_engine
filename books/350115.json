  "description": "Since Sandy Shortt's childhood classmate disappeared twenty years ago, Sandy has been obsessed with missing things. Finding what is lost becomes her single-minded goal. It's no surprise, then, that Sandy's life's work becomes finding people who have vanished from their loved ones. Sandy's family is baffled and concerned by her increasing preoccupation. Her parents can't understand her compulsion, and she pushes them away further by losing herself in the work of tracking down these missing people. Jack Ruttle is one of those devastated people. It's been a year since his brother Donal vanished into thin air, and he has enlisted Sandy Shortt to find him. But before she is able to offer Jack the information he so desperately needs, Sandy goes missing too . . . and Jack now finds himself searching for both his brother and the one woman who understood his pain. One minute Sandy is jogging through the park; the next, she can't figure out where she is. A clearing up ahead reveals a campsite, where Sandy discovers the impossible: She has inadvertently stumbled upon the place-and people-she's been looking for all her life, a land where all the missing people go. A world away from her loved ones and the home she ran from for so long, Sandy soon resorts to her old habit again-searching-though this time, she is desperately trying to find her way home. . . .",
