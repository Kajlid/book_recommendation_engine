  "description": "Mirra Mantle knows there is something better in the world than what she sees. She and her twin brother, Burrow, battle to survive in a harsh dystopian existence. Like many teens they deal with the everyday pressures of school and work, a widowed parent, and relationships. In their lives, however, work is forced hard labor, education is painful indoctrination, their father is a sacrificial addict, and their mother may have been murdered. There is also a little problem with a zombie plague that has destroyed most of their world. The Mantles are part of the Freerunners, a group of eclectic, like-minded young adults. On the streets brimming with horror, the Freerunners yearn for a normal life and fight to protect themselves from the vicious undead and a totalitarian government. Skilled at parkour and the use of archaic weapons the Freerunners prepare to make their stand. Mirra is madly in love with the leader of the Freerunners, Poe. Their relationship struggles to bloom in this barren world. Where will they run?",
