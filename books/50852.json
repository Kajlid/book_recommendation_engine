  "description": "It's a dark and stormy afternoon when Sasspants, PI(G), leaves Mr. Venezi's pet shop to live with a new owner. Soon there's a mystery afoot back at the shop: the cat from the bookstore next door has disappeared. All the pet shop animals are putting on their detective hats, but their fluffy-but-faraway guinea pig detective can't help them follow the clues! Can Hamisher the hamster solve this cat-napping without Sasspants? He's going to try his furry best not only to crack the case, but to reunite with his best friend and fellow sleuth too. (by Colleen AF Venable; from Lerner Publishing Group website)",
