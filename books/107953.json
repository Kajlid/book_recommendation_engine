  "description": "\"You think maybe Breanne is somewhere else, now, deciding whether it's worth it to come back?\"\"It's possible,\" Ashe said, rubbing his forehead. He hadn't had a headache this bad in almost a decade. He'd had this one for four days.\"She may not want to stay here if she wakes up,\" Trajan sounded troubled.\"I know. Sometimes I want to kick my own ass over that.\"\"I'll do it for you.\"\"Look, you're still the better fighter, so no, thanks,\" Ashe held up a hand.*****The rogue gods, sure that the Mighty Heart is dead, have stepped up their game. Bill, Hank and the others are concentrating on tracking a human known to have ties with the rogues—Vernon Clark.Vernon has manipulated many things in the past from his website. He was the first to claim that Breanne was a lie created by Rome Enterprises to destroy Joyce Christian's reputation after her death. He has many nefarious contacts, and not just with rogue gods and Sirenali.Hoping to get information and locations on the enemy from their quarry, Bill and his team travel to New Mexico, where Vernon Clark was last seen. Their search for the enemy then leads to other states, where things are beginning to heat up. Wildrif, the quarter-blood Elemaiyan seer, has become an unreliable source of information as he can't see past shields surrounding Bill's group, so Acrimus and Calhoun bring in another seer—one so dangerous even those who resurrect him fail to understand their peril.The God Wars continue.",
