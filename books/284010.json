  "description": "There was only room for one Queen Bee at Blossom High, and she hated me the first time she laid eyes on me.  I was the new girl. A charity case who needed the scholarship at Blossom High to keep me out of juvenile hall.  From the moment I saw my new school I knew I would never fit in. My plan was to survive my senior year and escape after graduation, unnoticed.  But the elites at Blossom High had different plans for me. Sugar Royale decided I was her new target. She wanted to break me and watch me crumble until I ran from them, shattered with no place to go.  What she didn't count on was how hard I'd been fighting my whole life.  None of them imagined I would hit back twice as hard, and if I went down, I would go down swinging.  Even if it meant losing myself in the arms of her brutal brother.  Even if it meant stealing her arrogant, bullying boyfriends one by one until she was left with nothing.  I'd do whatever it took to get even...even if it meant falling in love with cruelest boy of all.",
