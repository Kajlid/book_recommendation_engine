  "description": "Exiled - it's not always a punishment... Never one to really follow the rules, Nadia has finally pushed too far, and now her master has exiled her from the safety of the coven. Determined to survive, but unsure how, she heads to San Francisco, hoping to find help and a sexy offering of blood. What she finds is Daniel, an unexpected treat that makes her realize life on the outside is more delicious than she ever imagined. Daniel Rebiero is not looking for a life-long commitment, not when he's having too much fun enjoying the perks of being an exotic dancer, but Nadia is unlike any woman he's ever encountered and only a fool would toss her aside. When things get out of hand and he somehow becomes her \"blood servant,‚Äù he realizes the future he didn't think he wanted is now worth fighting for.",
