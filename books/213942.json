  "title": "Doctor Pascal",
  "description": "Doctor Pascal is the twentieth and final novel of the Rougon-Macquart series by Émile Zola. This volume serves in many respects as an epilogue to the series -- but it's also a fine tale in its own right. Doctor Pascal, approaching old age, looks back on his life and finds himself asking whether he has made the right choices . . . and the answers he finds aren't always what you'd expect. Those who enjoy Zola's better-known novels will find much to appreciate here as well.",
