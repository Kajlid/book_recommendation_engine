She thinks the creature that terrorises her while asleep isn't real, but when she's abducted and taken to a reform school meant to contain creatures too dangerous to function in society, she starts to wonder whether she isn't some monster.She turns to an underground fight club full of vampires, werewolves and witches established by the students to control her urges, and who is she kidding, she loves to fight.When fighters begin to disappear, turning Scar into the prime suspect, she must race to prove her innocence before her true nature is exposed.The only problem is that she's not entirely sure she's innocent.",
