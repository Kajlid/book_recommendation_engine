  "description": "Two billionaire brothers enjoy twisted games where women are the sport. They find a female, date her, and compete to see who can bed her first. Too bad they picked the wrong one this time. Dawn's too smart for their verbal play and too quick to get trapped by clever ploys. The more the brothers work to capture her heart, the more they discover she might not be theirs to play.",
