  "title": "In Praise of Older Women: The Amorous Recollections of András Vajda",
  "description": "\"A cool, comic survey of the sexual education of a young Hungarian, from his first encounter, as a twelve-year-old refugee with the American forces, to his unsatisfactory liaison with a reporter's wife in Canada at the belated end of his youth, when he was twenty-three . . . elegantly erotic, with masses of that indefinable quality, style . . . this has the real stuff of immortality.\"—B. A. Young, Punch\"A pleasure. Vizinczey writes of women beautifully, with sympathy, tact and delight, and he writes about sex with more lucidity and grace than most writers ever acquire.\"—Larry McMurtry, Houston Post\"Like James Joyce, who was as far from being a writer of erotica as Dostoevsky, Vizinczey has a refreshing message to Life is not about sex, sex is about life.\"—John Podhoretz, Washington Times\"The gracefully written story of a young man growing up among older women . . . although some passages may well arouse the reader, this novel brims with what the courts have termed \"redeeming literary merit.\"—Clarence Petersen, Chicago Tribune\"A funny novel about sex, or rather (which is rarer) a novel which is funny as well as touching about sex . . . elegant, exact and melodious—has style, presence and individuality.\"—Isabel Quigly, Sunday Telegraph\"The delicious adventures of a young Casanova who appreciates maturity while acquiring it himself. In turn naive, sophisticated, arrogant, disarming, the narrator woos his women and his tale wins the reader.\"—Polly Devlin, Vogue",
