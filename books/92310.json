  "description": "All Jack wanted to do was find the healing herbs of Spirifil and get back to his dying mother. After getting stuck on the side of a mountain, he receives help from an Indian tribe called the Cherokins. It's soon discovered that fate brought Jack to their camp. Nearly twenty years earlier, an old man prophesied that a child would be born who would stop the evil wizard, Willard, from his rule of terror. Could it be that the child of promise was now in their midst? Jack discovered more than a cure for his mother that day; he found out the truth about his life, the kingdom he lived in, and his destiny to save it. This fast-paced adventure is filled with interesting characters and intriguing twists! Readers of all ages will fall in love with Jack's lovable entourage. There's the pirate, Zack the Ripper; his nickname isn't from cutting people but from ripping them off. Jack also meets John Brown who was turned into a bear by Willard. Well, it was suppose to be a boar, but the wrong spell was cast. Then there's Abe and Gabe, two Indian brothers that will help Jack in any way they can. If only their older brother, Kendel, felt the same. He's angry, because he was next in line to be chief before Jack showed up. Meanwhile, the wicked Lu tribe has vowed to get revenge from when the Cherokins defeated them years ago. Can Jack live up to the hype and become the hero the kingdom needs him to be?",
