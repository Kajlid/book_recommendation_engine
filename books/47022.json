  "title": "Darkness Calls: A Collection of Short Stories - Volume One",
  "description": "\"Darkness Calls - Volume One\" is the first in a series of three short story collections. Comprising themes of fear, madness, isolation, violence and the supernatural, \"Darkness Calls\" builds into a chilling collection of modern horror works. In volume opener \"Dark Rain\", a mysterious storm brings about a terrifying change in the residents of a sleepy country village. Taking cues from the works of Edgar Allan Poe, \"The Patio\" is a dream-like journey into a mysterious world... and the horrific revelation it contains. \"An Open Letter...\" is a short but powerful, thought-provoking piece of prose; a pointless cry to an ignorant society. The oldest story in this collection, the violent \"Face Value\" presents a shocking tale of revenge from beyond the grave. A dystopian future provides a terrifying backdrop to the symbolic existence of five leviathans: the forgotten, the needing, the homeless, the corporation, and Death in \"Fallen Angel\". The final story in the volume, \"Trapped\", takes us into the claustrophobic hell of a mother and daughter, imprisoned in their overturned vehicle along an isolated highway.Featuring a foreword by the author and individual notes on each story contained within, this opening volume serves as the perfect introduction to the works of this exciting new British horror talent.",
