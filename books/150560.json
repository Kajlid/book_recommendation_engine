  "title": "Moth at the Window: Poetry of Grover W. Clayton and Recollections of Indiana",
  "description": "For more than sixty years a handwritten poetry journal languished in an attic. It was rescued before the estate sale by the granddaughter who opened the text and journeyed into an enthralling past. The poems painted a portrait of the American heartland and its people from the 1920s to 1940s. The poetry collection is combined with intimate stories by the author of her travels to Indiana. Moth at the Window re-creates the charm and simplicity of an amazing era and brings to life the story of a small town dentist and his family.",
