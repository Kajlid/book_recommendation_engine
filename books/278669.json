  "description": "\"The smart guy\"--Sebastian Keller's lived with that label most of his life. Though he hasn't always appreciated it, and it hasn't exactly made him a man magnet, he's put his intelligence to work building his store, Great Escapes Travel Book Shop, to the point it's now the favorite recommendation of travel agents in the St. Louis area. His customers--especially the jet-setting senior citizens--love him for his amiable personality.  He doesn't feel very amiable, however, when Rad Tattoos moves in next door to Great Escapes. Its owner, Dylan Radamacher, rubs Sebastian the wrong way from the get-go. The man's insufferable, stubborn, and, worse, a bad boy. Everything Sebastian loathes. To add insult to injury, Sebastian's certain the loud music, the congested parking lot, and the constant colorful parade of the counterculture in and out of the tattoo studio are scaring away his loyal, conservative customers.  And yet, much to his annoyance, the teasing sparkle in Dylan's eyes, his hot, inked body, and come-hither voice set Sebastian's libido on fire. Sebastian's \"been there, done that\" with the bad-boy type before, though, and almost lost everything because of it. There's no way he's going down that road again.  But when Dylan sets his sights on Sebastian and is determined to take him for a walk on the wild side, Sebastian knows he's in big trouble. It's going to take all his smarts and a whole lot of willpower to resist the sexy tattoo artist before the man finds a way to burrow deeper under his skin...
