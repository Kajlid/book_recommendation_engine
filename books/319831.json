As a child, it was her favourite time of year, but ever since the tragic death of her mother, it has completely lost its magic.But when she gets an unexpected phone call from her eccentric estranged father, she’s forced to dust off her snow boots.He has been running a Lapland style Christmas village in Norway and after suffering a heart attack, he is on strict doctor’s orders to slow down. Eager to reconnect with her dad, Sasha books the next flight out there. Only she has never actually been on a plane before, let alone to the Arctic Circle.Met at the runway by drop-dead-gorgeous Taavi Salvesen, they sleigh ride through the snow with the Northern Lights guiding their way.When Sasha uncovers sacks of unopened Santa mail – letters that children and adults from all over the world write to Santa every year – she realises that she can send a little bit of magic out into the world by replying to some of them.With Taavi on hand to help, will Sasha rediscover her own excitement for Christmas and find love among the letters?",
