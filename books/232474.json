  "description": "The frigid winter months are mighty slow in the PI biz for Julie Collins and her partner, Kevin Wells—until the duo is hired by a young woman to investigate problems at her grandfather’s assisted living facility, where they encounter lax security, unqualified healthcare personnel, and a shady senior volunteer organization. Julie barely has time to delve deeper into the puzzling case before she reluctantly finds herself in an isolated cattle shelter on the Collins ranch with her father during a raging blizzard. There is no escape from her father or from the biting cold and bitter memories.A missing hired ranch hand found dead on the ranch only complicates matters further. In trying to uncover the truth about the man'’s death, Julie is forced to wrestle with issues that make her question old wounds and new family loyalties. Kevin'’s reckless involvement with their new client tests the bounds of professionalism, and Julie’'s relationship with Tony Martinez is strained, as he deals with power struggles within the Hombres organization, putting them both in jeopardy. When the bodies and the snow pile up, Julie seems at odds with everyone, leaving her to wonder if she’s being blinded to the cold, hard truths in her life by love . . . or by hate.",
