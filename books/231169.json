  "description": "A roughneck, redneck, and a brawler, Jeb Shaw had a wild streak wide as a country mile, and he left home happy to have a war to fight. Now, battle scarred and weary, he's returned to the girl of his dreams, and the small East Texas town he grew up. Anxious to start the real life he'd promised himself in the desert, the new demands of being a college student, husband, and provider, prove a heavy burden. Making ends meet as muscle for bondsmen, a handout of a job from an old friend, he's frayed and running on empty. Swarming in debt, consumed by his failures, staring his own demons in the face, and drowning in the ever widening gulf he's created between him and the woman he loves so dearly, he knows he's going to lose it all. And then someone with too much money throws him a life preserver. In exchange for a simple task, one of the few he's qualified for, he can be back on his feet. He takes it without question, knowing full well it can't be that simple. Because in East Texas, a land on the rugged edge of the Old South, where Gothic mysticism collides violently with the rugged individualism of the Old West, nothing is ever quite what it seems, nothing is ever easy, and when it rains, it pours.",
