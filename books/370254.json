  "description": "Laura Ingalls Wilder was a writer long before she ever recorded the adventures of her pioneer childhood in the beloved Little House books. As a young girl she wrote poetry, and after marrying Almanzo and moving to the Ozark Mountains, she became a journalist, publishing articles on farming and the life of a farmwife. This moving collection pieces together a unique medley of Laura's writings from the time before her Little House books. These writings, culled mostly from fragile and yellowed pieces of paper, offer a window into Laura's day-to-day life and experiences, giving us a richer understanding of the woman and writer famed for her Little House books.",
