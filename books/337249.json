And soon I'll have two arrogant, attractive stepbrothers to avoid-Royce and Dalzell, and their sullen, mysterious cousin, Layne. Jock kings of Addington University. Perfect sons. Handsome devils who can do no wrong. That's what my mom says anyway.The plan was to come for the ceremony and fly back home the following day.
