  "title": "Time of the Druids",
  "description": "Deirdre grew up in the 14th Century knowing about time travel. Her parents' friends Tavish and Kelsey were from the 21st Century. Now she was on her first time travel assignment for the Druids. It was challenging. Sure, she had her magic dagger, but he wasn't cooperating.Talorac felt anxious about this meeting. A summons to the sacred grove had always meant the druids would perform their woad magic to prepare him for battle. So he was in no way prepared to make the acquaintance of the woman he found there with them. Deirdre was beautiful, and a warrior, and from the way she was flitting around the grove, she was the most powerful druid he had ever heard of in his life.",
