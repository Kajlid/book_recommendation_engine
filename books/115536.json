When given a choice to follow their orders or follow her heart which will she choose?Medusa has long since made peace with her exile, and the endless heroes sent to ensure that her island is no paradise. However, when a band of rebels come offering a glimpse of freedom, Medusa must put aside her distrust of Gods and Goddesses to seek revenge against the ones who cursed her. Join our Heroines as they decide if they will sacrifice what's necessary to eliminate the evil that has corrupted Olympus.",
