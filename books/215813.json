  "description": "It appeared beyond the orbit of Neptune. An alien space station, a threat to the Sol System and a gateway to the galactic civilization.  For the last hundred years, humanity has sent a champion to fight for our future. Every one has lost.  Now, monstrous aliens have designs on the Sol System itself. The winner of a single bout of deadly combat inside the Orb Station will be granted the rights to conquer Earth and all of her fledgling colonies. This is the final chance for victory before humanity is destroyed.  Rama Seti is a professional gamer, a hero of the virtual world. He has not left his apartment in years, he is morbidly obese and has no real world combat experience. But, when the tactical surgeon from the United Nations Orb Project breaks into his home and cuts off his head, Rama is transplanted onto a giant, genetically engineered body designed to be the perfect weapon.  Success in this mission means humanity will finally take its place as a member of the galactic network of alien empires. Failure will mean our destruction.  If you enjoyed Ender's Game, Starship Troopers, The Forever War, and Old Man's War, you'll love Orb Station Zero, the first in a new military science fiction series.",
