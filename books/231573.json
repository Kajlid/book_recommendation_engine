Publishers Weekly says of the story, \"love and dark secrets abound.\" Acclaimed fantasy author Anne Bishop calls the novel \"wonderful,\" and Library Journal describes Alice At Heart as \"a compelling, intricately plotted story of love and acceptance.\" Alice At Heart is simply this: a rich, whimsical, intelligent and romantic launch for Deborah's WaterLilies series about the lives, loves, and dramas of a secret society of people endowed with supernatural traits in the water and a solemn mythology that insists they're descended from ancient (and notstereotypical) \"mermaids.\" An earlier e-book edition from TimeWarner's iPublish division was published in Spring 2001; however, the BelleBooks collector's edition of Alice At Heart includes extensive new material added by the author, as well as original artwork and a classic 1920's Maxfield Parrish painting as the cover art.With 1.5 million copies of her romantic Southern novels in print, Deborah has been named a top all-time author by Romantic Times. Her past and current titles include A Place To Call Home, On Bear Mountain, and Stone Flower Garden.",
