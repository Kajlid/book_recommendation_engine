  "description": "The unthinkable has been done and Lucifer’s reign has finally come to an end. The world is back to the way God imagined it to be and with that, true peace, above and below has been achieved.  There’s only one problem.  If everything is the way it’s meant to be, why do things still appear broken?  With the undertaking behind them, as well as the losses they have suffered, the wedding day is fast approaching. Serenity, Ryan, Michael and Graham have seemingly been through the worst and should be ready to live their lives the way the Almighty intended. Except there is a darkness under the surface that none of them have seen coming. This time, it is not one of Lucifer’s creation, but one of their design.  Will they be able to face what is before them? Each moving on to the destiny that awaits them, or will they be lost, not only to the world, but each other, forever?",
