  "description": "A blonde, a brunette, and a red-head walk into a bank… And rob it.  As Lacey waits for Baby Luzzi to make his or her appearance, she’s decided to cool her jets on the whole “chasing criminals” lifestyle at her husband’s insistence. She’s settled in comfortably as part-time help at her best friend’s bar and, though the work might be a tad boring after years of explosions and car chases, it’s a safe job, relatively sanitary, and uneventful—for most people.  Lacey isn’t most people.  Caught in the middle of a bank heist, Lacey’s priceless wedding ring is now in the hands of three ladies known to the media as the Femme Fatale. The thieves might have gotten away with three heists across the Twin Cities to date, but one hitch they didn’t count on was a pregnant lady scorned. Lacey Luzzi’s hormones are on the fritz, her sugar habits are out of control, and her tears are flowing freely. This time, the robbers picked on the wrong gal.  With a due date approaching rapidly, Lacey and Meg are bound and determined to recover Lacey’s ring and put this case behind them...before she’s delivering more than guilty criminals on the job.",
