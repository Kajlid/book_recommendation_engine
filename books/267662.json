  "description": "According to my thirteen-year-old son, every superhero has an origin. My origin is a little embarrassing. I wasn’t put into a rocket and sent to Earth by my parents. I wasn’t bitten by a radioactive spider. No, I was merely the innocent victim of a Horrible Swiffer Accident.… Strange things are happening to divorced mother of two Birdie Lee since the Horrible Swiffer Accident. She can sense danger (for example, a carload of speeding teenagers not wearing their seat belts) and spring into action with superhuman speed. She can find out what her daughter is up to on the Internet without even having to snoop. And she’s got cleaning powers ordinary women can only dream of.… Warm, witty, and full of heart, Confessions of Super Mom is the tale of a woman who dares to take a stand against everything from stubborn stains to smug exs to corporate CEOs—and winds up defeating evil in some very unexpected ways.",
