Shawn, the Chronicler of The Gold Eagle, narrates as Mitch, who died by the hands of Duce's Wolf gang at the tender age of fifteen, awakens in a hospital bed in Louisiana with a bullet lodged in his brain, a different personality, a fresh goal, and a new name-Rex. It is 1987 and Lord Rex, fueled by his own madness, promptly declares war on the Wolf gang, envisioning the fierce battles yet to come. After he returns to school at Vandyland Catholic High, Rex begins recruiting members to a new gang whose only goal is to destroy Duce, the leader of the Wolf gang, along with his elite band of assassins. As the power of The Gold Eagle grows, the Wolf gang is put on the defensive for the first time as The Gang Wars begin to spiral out of control. As the story twists and turns around a new adventure, dark comedy, and intense drama, Rex leads The Gold Eagle through a bloodbath of insanity in an attempt to end The Gang Wars and destroy the Wolf gang once and for all.",
