  "description": "A necromancer's fear. A family's fate. An ancient spirit with a new alliance. I shouldn't have told myself things couldn't get any worse. They did. As Nixie struggles to unite the water witches, the Fae king discovers a spy in his ranks. We're forced to split our focus and our powers between the unrest in Faerie and the rising tensions in Falias. When Nudd's latest gambit puts humanityâ€™s most dangerous weapons into his hands, we can't let anything stand in our way. We'll need help from new contacts and trusted allies if we hope to stop the Fae king's madness. But the award for worst timing in history goes to an old friend: Vicky.",
