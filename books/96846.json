  "title": "Fortune Made His Sword",
  "description": "A recreation of the life and times of a man whose charm and military genius - and concern for his subjects - made him one of the most popular kings in English history. This story brings to life not only the man, but one of the most fantastic periods of the fifteenth century.Among the last of the great medieval rulers and the first of the ardent nation builders, Henry V is seen from several perspectives: his queen; his beautiful Welsh mistress, Morgan; his court jester, the fool; a comrade-in-arms; and his own point of view as both boy and man.As actors in this drama, they illuminate the many sides of Henry V's personality - the devil-may-care prince portrayed by Shakespeare, the bold hero of Agincourt, the husband of Katharine of Valois, and the warrior-peacemaker who welded England, Wales, and France into a single kingdom.",
