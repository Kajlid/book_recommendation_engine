  "description": "Shiny Blades. Scorching Fire. Falling Feathers. A demon army is rising... An anomaly must bring it down. But can she handle a drunk, knife-wielding goat and four hunters? That’s me, Everly Banks, the original supernatural. After being betrayed by The Council and given to a madman, I burned it all to the ground. Now all I want is to stay hidden, protecting those who need it from the shadows. When four hunters show up on my doorstep asking for my help and trying to drag me back into the light, I send them and their secrets packing. Did I mention they work for The Council? I may not have a choice. An army of demons is amassing and innocents are getting caught up in its net. My only friend may be next. Trusting them may burn me, but I’ve always played with fire. ********* Twisted Flames is an Urban Fantasy with a Reverse Harem romance.
