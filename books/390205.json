  "title": "Born Under a Lucky Moon",
  "description": "Smart, touching, and utterly engaging, Born Under a Lucky Moon is a polished gem of contemporary women’s fiction—and it boldly announces the arrival of author Dana Precious, who immediately takes her place at the winner’s table beside Rebecca York, Jennifer Weiner, and Rebecca Wells. Not unlike Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood and other beloved works of southern women’s fiction—except set in the American Midwest— Born Under a Lucky Moon is a story of family, love, murder, sex scandals, and new beginnings that is, at once, intelligent, endearing, and delightfully quirky.",
