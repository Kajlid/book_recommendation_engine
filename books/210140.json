  "description": "The narcissist is a force to be reckoned with. He is the reason that the courts are filled with nasty custody and divorce battles. He is passive aggressive, fatalistic, negativistic, critical and stubborn. The narcissist uses many tactics to alienate the children from others in their life. He is one of the reasons that Parental Alienation exists. This ebook seeks to discuss the various tools that are launched against the children of the narcissist. If the children are not cared for adequately by others due to the narcissist’s immature behaviors, the deprivation of their needs by the narcissist will ultimately cause the children to also grow up being narcissistic or emotionally immature in their relations with the world around them. They will view the world as a hostile place with little forgiveness. Our goal is to educate those who work with or live with children. Many parents who are up against a narcissist in a custody battle or in a divorce tend to give up custody to the narcissist. Or they might lose custody to the narcissist. One doesn’t have to be the victim of a narcissistic parent or of the parental alienation that happens due to Narcissistic Personality Disorder. A person can learn about Parental Alienation, the tools involved, and better prepare for handling the immature narcissist in court and in life.Download now to fix your future with your child!
