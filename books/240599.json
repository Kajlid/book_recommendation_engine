  "description": "Billy crossed the hall into his bedroom where Kate was plugging in the last of the electric candles she’d set in each window.She flicked it on. “I guess that’s that.” His hand covered hers. “Do me a favor and don’t turn this one off. I want to know there’s a light burning in our bedroom window until I come home.” When a world tour opening for a major band suddenly falls through, Billy McDonald is forced to take the only gig available, even if it means he’ll be spending the holidays on the other side of the country. Christmas has always been Kate’s favorite holiday. But this year, she just can’t get into the spirit. With Billy on tour, her best friend on vacation in Hawaii, two young children to wrangle, a Santa’s Workshop to run, and an extended visit from her estranged mother looming, Kate needs a Christmas miracle.Set in 1995, “You’re All I Want for Christmas” is a holiday novella from the “Of Love and Madness” series.",
