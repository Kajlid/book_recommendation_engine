  "title": "The Fall of Innocence",
  "description": "When an angel falls from Heaven to be trapped by the weight of evil, the Earth shakes in fear of the night as humankind struggles to turn to the light and the lost have no way to be found. Salvation is at the very brink of collapse as the remaining beacon of hope is doused in the flames of Hell leading the worlds to the edge of war. And yet in Hell the passage to power is smeared in deceit with creatures deserting their master as mysterious new arrivals present themselves and what had been sure appears blurred in the unravelling lies. The delight in the pain of the innocent blinds the Devil to the depths of betrayal which quietly eats into the heart of Hell where feigned stability is crumbling to chaos as control of the Earth is becoming a higher prize to take at a heavier cost. The third in a five part story which forces you to confront the darkest monsters that will drag you into the shadow",
