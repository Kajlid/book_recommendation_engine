  "description": "Hilary Knight imbues the story of Cinderella with characters of the same humor, zest, and personality that have made generations of children and grown-ups fall in love with his most famous Eloise. A pair of pet cats, a blue fairy godmother, and an endearing, if somewhat overweight, Prince Charming are just a few of the delightful details that dance across these pages—right into readers’ hearts—in this thoroughly charming, sometimes surprising, and always original version of the classic fairy tale.",
