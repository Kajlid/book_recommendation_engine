Unfortunately, no one knows the answer, and no one questions the verdict of Justice.Accepting her fate, Amara begins her training to join the battle of good against evil which she learns isn’t quite as black and white as she’d assumed. However, as training begins, a light in her soul and a set of powers that have never been seen before start to surface, gaining the attention of gods and demons alike.The only problem? If she can’t blend in, she’ll be weeded out.Getting used to her new life only brings more uncertainty when she finds out she's been used as a pawn between a pair of gods for a wager with a catastrophic outcome.
