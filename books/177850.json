  "description": "The feudal strife of the Sengoku Jidai has soaked Japan in blood. Despite the perils, an ambitious young musketeer is chosen to guide a group of Jesuit priests deep into the Japanese hinterlands in search of an ancient and terrifying artifact. Alas, they are not the only ones pursuing it. A fanatical enemy willing to devastate the country in its wake has already launched its own campaign to seize it.  Villages vanish beneath the marching feet of bloodthirsty marauders.  Cauldrons of intolerant faith scorch the populace.  Lust for vengeance boils beneath the surface.  An eternity of pain hangs in the balance.  Unfathomable horrors grate the musketeer and his pious patrons. Blood will stain them. Grief will besiege them. But can they defy the odds and safeguard the artifact before this savage enemy unleashes a cataclysm on the country? This is the first of a 4-book set.",
