  "description": "by Roberta GregoryNaughty Bits , the longest-running solo comic by a female alternative cartoonist, came to an end in 2004 after a 14-year, 40-issue run. This extra-thick, very reasonably priced volume collects the entire first half of the \"Bitchy Bitch\" saga, and it ranges widely in her eventful life. The book will also feature a brand new full-length story that chronicles the (never-before-revealed) death of Bitchy's tempestuous father, as Gregory once again finds the humor in even the grimmest situation.",
