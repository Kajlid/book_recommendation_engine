  "title": "Seer",
  "description": "Ten years ago, seers across the globe were wiped out, thrusting the supernatural world into figurative darkness.  When word spreads that the first new seer in a decade has been found, powerful forces will hunt her.  The dead will unite to defend her.  And a repressed sadist werelock will abandon his century-long vow of celibacy to claim her as his own.  Note: Seer is a full-length novel, but it is NOT A STANDALONE. While Seer may be enjoyed as a first read in the series, for maximum entertainment, it is recommended that you read the books that precede it.",
