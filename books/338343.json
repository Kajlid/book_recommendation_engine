  "description": "In the romance novel When I Remember Love , a beautiful young woman grieving the sudden death of her mother is invited to stay with her favorite aunt in California. As she arrives in Los Angeles, Jenna Holden has no idea that her life is about to change forever. Jenna's aunt, Vanessa, a music agent, has just signed Aidan Price, a gifted and promising new performer who bears a striking resemblance to a young Johnny Depp. Aidan has come to Hollywood to compete on American Star, a very popular televised singing competition. Vanessa arranges for Jenna to meet Aidan at lunch, and their connection is instantaneous and electric. From there they begin a sizzling courtship that leads them on a whirlwind journey through the demanding music business and media scrutiny that accompanies Aidan's newfound fame. Despite all the intrusions which result inevitably from success in the entertainment world, Aidan and Jenna create a passionate and loving life together-a life, though, that is soon to become much more complicated than the \"easy\" life we so often assume comes with fame and fortune. As they are forced to deal with the pressures of international fame, a devastating illness, and an unspeakable traumatic event, Aidan and Jenna's relationship and commitment to each other are tested in many unpredictable ways as they attempt to prevail over the seemingly insurmountable challenges that come with their own personal and intimate experience of stardom.",
