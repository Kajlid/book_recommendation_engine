Lock. “When I tell you to beg me, you’d f--king better follow the direction the first time. As of right now, you haven’t earned my cock.”  “No. No. NO!” I shout. He’s right. I’m on the edge and hungry for him.  “That’s enough,” he whispers a warning, arching his brow. I swallow as he palms both of my breasts, strumming his thumbs across my nipples that pebble, ache for his mouth. “Please.” “You’re wild and undisciplined.” “I’m tortured and teased!” “Christ, do you remember anything from Boston?” “Lots.
