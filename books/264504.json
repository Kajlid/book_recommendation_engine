  "description": "A rotten thief. A stubborn knight. Only together can they save a broken kingdom. Self-proclaimed \"World's Greatest Thief\", Whitney Fierstown, has yet to find a trinket or treasure he couldn't steal. He nearly pulls off the heist of the century by snatching the Glass Crown off the dying king's head until rotten luck throws him into the path of Torsten Unger, a steadfast knight determined to save his vulnerable kingdom. Torsten offers this ultimatum: rot and die in a dank cell or join him on a dangerous expedition and put his skills to good use. The Queen's treasonous brother has cursed the Crown Prince by taking a piece of his soul and hiding it in the haunted Webbed Woods. Only a master thief can steal it back. Rebellion building in the south. Madness seated upon the throne. Famine and death spreading throughout the land. The kingdom is in peril. If this unlikely pair is to thwart their devious target, save the prince, and survive the horrifying monster lurking in the darkness, they must first put aside their differences...or die trying. Check out the exciting first book in an Epic Fantasy Adventure Series perfect for fans of R.A Salvatore, Brandon Sanderson, and Nicholas Eames. You can also listen to Web of Eyes on audible, performed by award-winning narrator Luke Daniels.",
