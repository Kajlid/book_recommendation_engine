  "description": "Kaia's life was entirely normal before her seventeenth birthday. But like twin lightning strikes, two occurrences struck under the full Capricorn moon shattering her world. Kaia discovers her hands brim with potent, unholy magic, and before she could tell anyone about it, her mother vanishes without a trace. Her life in tatters, Kaia is visited by a disfigured witch who entreats her to join 'The Fraternity': A magical school where her abilities would be honed and harnessed. But something is very wrong. She realizes her family is not only well known within the Fraternity's walls but much hated due to something that happened before she was even born. As if she wasn't already in danger, Kaia must also contend with the perennial enemies of the witches: Vampires and Lycans, who get wind of the unique magic raging inside her. It turns out every supernatural being knows about Kaia centuries in advance, referring to her as \"The Scarlet Incantatrix\".",
