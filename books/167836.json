Support worker Sarah Scott learns this the hard way when, soon after being transferred to Tranquility's dementia unit, she uncovers a sinister secret. Doing the right thing could mean losing her job, and unemployment is not an option for the young, single mom.Meanwhile, Sarah begins to question whether her newest resident, Edie, belongs in the nursing home's locked unit.
