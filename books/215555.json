  "description": "Ambrose Bierce (1842 – circa 1914) was an American editorialist, journalist, short story writer, fabulist, and satirist. Bierce's works often highlight the inscrutability of the universe and the absurdity of death. As a young man he served in the Federal army during the American Civil War, participating in some of the most horrific battles, and this closeness to the horrors and excitement of war informed both his famed cynicism and his fiction. Bierce wrote realistically of the terrible things he had seen in the war. This collection of stories is made up of twelve original and imaginative tales by Bierce including his masterpiece \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\", as well as \"A Horseman in the Sky\", \"An Heiress from Redhorse”, “The Man and The Snake”, and others.",
