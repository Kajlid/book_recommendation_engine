All the while, Daniel harbored a secret crush on his friend. To hear Max speak of current and past conquests that left him heart broken left Daniel broken and saddened as well. They were a perfect match. He loved Max and would treat him the way he should be treated. Since Max clearly didn't know what was best for him, as his best friend, Daniel had no choice but to step in. When Max breaks up with his lover again just before Valentine's Day, Daniel puts a plan in place to capture his best friend's heart and keep Max safe from harm.",
