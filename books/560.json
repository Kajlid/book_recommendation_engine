Still, he doesn’t hesitate to protect an outcast witch, thinking it will help him rediscover his own inner strength. Wounded in body and spirit, Sasha Wallace found refuge with the Red Rock pack. Yet her willingness to lend her powers to the battle makes her an object of suspicion.

Unless they do it together.   Sanctuary Unbound After eighty years of solitude, a life debt owed to the Red Rock alpha forces Adam Dubois to leave his retreat—where he encounters a woman who challenges and tempts him on every level. Cindy Shepherd isn’t concerned that her interest in the mystery-shrouded new vampire in town seems mutual. After all, it’s only sex—there’s no danger he’ll dig deep enough to unleash her demons. Casual flirtation turns deadly serious when Adam discovers an evil has followed his tracks to Red Rock. To survive, Adam and Cindy must trust each other with more than just their lives…  Contains epic werewolf battles, binding spells, paranormal road-trip hijinks, unexpected sex on a kitchen floor, and a vampire lumberjack.",
