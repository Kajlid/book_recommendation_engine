  "title": "Working Hot",
  "description": "\"Working Hot - with its uncompromising, street-wise vision of love, passion, lust - carves out a new space for women's writing in Australian literature. Nothing like it has been published here before. It is an erotic, pornographic, cynical, sad and witty representation of life in the raw; a book whose rhythms follow those of lovemaking, a meandering through naked bodies and raw words, bringing with it the pleasure of exploration and movement. Toto, Freda, Peach, One Iota, Kitty Trinkets are ourselves and women we all know. At the same time they are exotic and bizarre exploreres of the outer regions of women's experience, fringe dwellers on the edges of public, social life.\" - Elizabeth Grosz",
