Now, Jag must endure grueling human holidays like Christmas and pretend to be a nice human boyfriend to the man who summoned him.The fake boyfriend role has been very trying.But along with the upcoming Halloween party and fuss over finding the perfect ghoulish decorations, not to mention the very odd feelings he’s developing for Ethan, there’s that little matter of the impending Armageddon to deal with.Jag is not pleased.***\nThis book includes short story Demon All the Way and continues Ethan & Jag's adventure.",
