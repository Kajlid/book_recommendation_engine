  "description": "Shannon and Rohan Scott have retreated to their family's cabin in the Australian bush to escape a virus-ravaged world. After months of isolation, Shannon imagines there's nothing he doesn't know about his older brother, or himself â€“ until a stranger slips under their late-night watch and past their loaded guns.Reluctantly the brothers take the young woman into their fold, and the dynamic within the cabin shifts. Possessiveness takes hold, loyalties are split, and trust is shattered. Before long, all three find themselves locked into a very different battle for survival.Daring, stylish and sexy, Red Queen is a psychological thriller that will leave you breathless.'...a taut psychological thriller ... the most filmic of stories.' The Sun-Herald'HM Brown's Red Queen is a cracker of a thriller involving a peculiar menage a trois camped out in the bush. There's a good chance you may miss your train or bus stop, or show up to work with Vuitton-like bags beneath your eyes from a sleepless night trying to race to the last page.' Vogue",
