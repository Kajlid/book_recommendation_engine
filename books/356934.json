If you fail, then my fourth and worst wife, Lola, gets everything. May the best man win. Your Pa, Joe RoarkNeither Freddy Roark nor her pampered, high-strung half-sisters had even been on a horse! And they despised each other almost as much as their Pa, who wanted only sons. An actress, Freddy especially felt her sisters' cold disdain. Now a fortune depended on the three working together—and finding a trail boss to teach them to rope, ride, and herd cattle across seven hundred miles of open plains.He'd have to be one desperate man.Dal Frisco needed the job bad enough to deal with the devil—or the Roark sisters. But before their dangerous journey began, he found himself blindsided with desire as searing as a red-hot brand.
