  "title": "Praying Today's Psalms: Yearning for God in Times of Despair",
  "description": "Jesus said, He who abides in Me bears much fruit. The key to a vital Christian life is progressing in to a deeper spiritual walk with God, and praying the Psalms is the way ascetics around the world have been doing it for centuries. By merging Old and New Testament scriptures, this devotional can remove the roadblocks of the old, and revive this ancient practice for the Christian who desires a deeper, more abiding relationship with God. The Psalms uniquely invite us in to the quest of men to find the heart of God. They run the gambit of emotion, draw us in to a deeper communion with our Creator, and provide a prayer experience like no other. In this: the first of four volumes that will include Praise, Renewal, and Application, [P-R-A-Y] the desperate Yearning cries of the Psalmists provide a guide through the most difficult times of life, helping us stay near to God when life tries to tear us from Him. Praise for Praying Today's Psalms Mike Wolff has spent years reading and meditating on the biblical psalms. In the process, he has gained insights related to peace, judgment, restoration, devotion, and righteousness. With wit and passion, he now shares with readers what God has revealed to him. Open this book and listen to Mike s joyous words. ~ Dr. Dennis E. Hensley, author Surprises and Miracles of the Season I no longer seek knowledge, for knowledge is too easily gained. I seek revelation, for that is a gift of God that transforms me. When I pray the Psalms in Mike s devotional, I get revelation. ~ Michael Wells, Director, Abiding Life Ministries International",
