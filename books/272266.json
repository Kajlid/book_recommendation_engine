  "description": "It's the summer of 1942. Bombs are falling on Britain, daylight saving time has given way to wartime, and radio is in its prime. In Regina Beach, on the New Jersey coast, a troupe of gallant artists explores the promise of this exhilarating medium for WHAR, creating programming to entertain and inspire a nation in its dark hour. Enter Jack Dulaney, writer, and Holly Carnahan, singer, determined to find Holly's missing father. As Jack discovers his talent for creating radio dramas, he also begins to suspect that a Nazi spy is operating at the station, and that Carnahan's fate may be linked to an English actor who walked out of the radio station six years ago and was never seen again. It is a link some will do anything to hide â€“ including commit murder.",
