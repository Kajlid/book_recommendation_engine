  "description": "The majority of life's innumerable lessons can be explained in any given restroom. Take some time and contemplate the yin and yang of the potty experience. This encapsulated approach can tell a lot about the world that surrounds us. It's a world author Amy Goodridge-Bakst was introduced to early in life. Her mother taught her some important lessons, including the all-important bathroom etiquette. She learned not all bathrooms are created equal, and depending on the situation, one must be able to adapt midstream. In Potty Theory, Goodridge-Bakst shares her experiences, observations, and priceless lessons on bathroom etiquette, better known as potty theory. It involves the observation of toilets, restrooms, and all things pertaining to women relieving themselves-sort of a combination of civil engineering and logistics. With empathy and honesty, Potty Theory takes a humorous look at the bathroom advice and etiquette her mother taught throughout the years. Goodridge-Bakst shows it takes patience, compassion, honesty, caring, humility, hope, love, and faith to ensure a successful potty experience.",
