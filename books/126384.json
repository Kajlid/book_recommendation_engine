  "description": "Finding out you're the reincarnation of an unhinged assassin—caught in a deadly love triangle between two of your targets—would be bad news for anyone. It’s especially bad for Chen Mu when he realizes history is repeating itself.In the land of Xuanyu, Yao—demons—are creatures of nightmares who burn villages and gobble up children. Without the protection of the highly esteemed and virtuous Spirit Sect, the world would be doomed. Or something like that.Despite having no memories of his past—and his questionably death-cursed hands, Chen Mu knows the whole demon-hunting assassin thing isn’t for him.But changing his Fate means facing the very two people he betrayed: Xiu Rong, the immortal fox spirit who trusted him with her life, and Bai Yang, his soulmate, who cursed Chen Mu on his dying breath.Turns out, the sins of his past are no longer just nightmares–they’re catching up to him.He can only hope karma forgot to write down his name.And even that might not belong to him.",
