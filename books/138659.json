  "title": "The Phantasist",
  "description": "When the tutor of a Fantasy Writing group goes missing his students find themselves unwittingly writing about a world of his making. But what can the history of such a place tell them of the plight of their mentor? Taking the form of a secret bibliography, a series of biographical sketches, the journals of two conflict historians, an ethnographic study, a reflection on a siege and the archaeological account of the discovery of a necropolis, The Phantasist never wanted to be an ordinary fantasy novel from the outset - and it certainly isn't one now.",
