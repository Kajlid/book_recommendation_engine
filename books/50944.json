  "description": "It had reached the point where she couldn't go more than five minutes without grinding up a pill and snorting it. Despite the worldwide success of her memoir, Prozac Nation - and the fame and accolades that accompanied it - nothing had changed inside Elizabeth Wurtzel. She saw herself as a terrible failure. She couldn't maintain a relationship. She was fired from every job she held. Exhausted from trying to make sense of a world she saw as increasingly phony, she left New York and headed for Florida. But not before securing from her psychiatrist a prescription for Ritalin (the drug prescribed to treat hyperactivity in children). This memoir is about the search for happiness, about depravity and the will to survive even the most breathtaking self-abuse.",
