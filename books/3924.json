  "description": "Cray's orderly life is tossed upside down when his foster sister asks him to take in her ex-husband's son. Seth is angry, rude, and just not what Cray wants to deal with right now. His software business is just taking off, and he needs to spend all of his time working. But when the two feel an undeniable attraction for one another, Cray can't ignore the pull Seth has on him. He's never wanted another man like he wants Seth, never even considered being gay, but he can't deny how his body comes alive every time Seth gets close.Seth is angry with the world, pissed at his dad, pissed at Suzie who was nice enough to take him in even though she's not his mother and she's not married to his father anymore. But she too dumped him on a man he doesn't know. What's worse is he can't stop looking at Seth, can't stop wanting him. He's young, but he's had plenty of sexual experience with women. Men never even entered the picture. One accidental kiss is all it takes to make him rethink what he desires most.The two men are stuck in the house together, alone. How can the inevitable not happen? But Cray's not ready to jeopardize what he's gained after growing up in a foster home. When the time comes for Seth to leave, will Cray ask him to stay and risk it all by revealing their little secret?",
