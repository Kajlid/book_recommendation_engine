  "title": "Blood of Heaven",
  "description": "Mysterious blood has been discovered on the remains of an ancient religious artifact. Some believe it is the blood of Christ. And experiments with specific genes from the blood have brought surprising findings. Now it's time to introduce those genes into a human. Enter Michael multiple killer, death-row resident . . . and, if he is willing, human guinea pig. There are no promises. The effects may kill Coleman or completely destroy his sanity. He agrees to the experiment, with results so astonishing that the research must continue--but not in prison. Given a new identity and new employer, Katherine Lyon, Coleman reenters society. And that's when a plot far darker than science alone could construct begins to emerge. A carefully researched science and psychological thriller, Blood of Heaven is a nonstop page turner that looks deep into the heart of man, examining the nature of good and evil, flesh versus spirit, and the ever-growing controversy over genetically determined behavior.",
