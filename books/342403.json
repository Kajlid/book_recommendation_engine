  "title": "Trucker Fags in Denial",
  "description": "by Jim Goad & Jim BlanchardFrom the twisted minds behind such notorious publications as Answer Me! , The Redneck Manifesto , Shit Magnet , Bad Meat , and Glam Warp comes the sordidly hilarious tale of Butch and Petey, two aging, obese truckers so steeped in denial of their homosexuality, they're about to burst! Follow these two lovable losers as they trek across the USA in their battered eighteen-wheeler, doling out misdirected hatred to all they encounter, and eventually succumbing to their long-repressed lust for each other! Trucker Fags in Denial marks writer Jim Goad's first crack at writing a feature-length comic book since his recent three-year bid in an Oregon prison. Artist Jim Blanchard, perhaps best known in the comic world as the Harvey-nominated inker for the final 15 issues of Peter Bagge's HATE comics, has never been to prison. Don't miss this sleazy, lovingly-crafted underground comic opus!MATURE READERSb&w, 32pg",
