  "title": "Catching Trick",
  "description": "Having loved Trick desperately for four years, Katie Mathews wants nothing more than his touch. Only Trick thinks he’s too old for her. Deciding that she’s waited long enough, she plans to find a man who isn’t afraid to admit that he wants her. Only an old enemy has surfaced, and it could end in a deadly confrontation.  Derick “Trick” Tannon burns with desire every time he sees Katie. Only he knows that he’s too old and too hard for a young woman like her. Thinking that he’ll never be what she wants or needs, he forces himself to stay away. Only she’s being threatened, and he isn’t going to stand by and watch it happen. He will take out any threat to her with single minded precision. Nobody who threatens Katie will be breathing when he’s through with them.  Warning : This title contains light bondage and an alpha hottie... This is a stand alone title, but the most enjoyment will be gotten from reading first two novels in series to help with character introduction.",
