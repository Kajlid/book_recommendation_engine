  "title": "The Arabian Nights",
  "description": "This book is a selection by Andrew Lang of the most relevant tales found in the one thousand and one nights, some of which became classics of literature and inspired animated films. There are numerous high definition illustrations beautifully drawn by H. J. Ford. (Preface) The stories in the Fairy Books have generally been such as old women in country places tell to their grandchildren. Nobody knows how old they are, or who told them first. The children of Ham, Shem and Japhet may have listened to them in the Ark, on wet days. Hector's little boy may have heard them in Troy Town, for it is certain that Homer knew them, and that some of them were written down in Egypt about the time of Moses. (Preface)",
