Bracing danger, adventure, and unknown threats, Fred is instead asked to take on an entirely different role than anticipated.Acting as interim professor at one of the few universities for supernatural entities, Fred will have to navigate a strange environment, eccentric co-workers, and unenthusiastic students. Yet that alone wonâ€™t be enough, for this college has more history than the tales in its tomes.Remnants of the past that could put Fred, and his students, in mortal peril.",
