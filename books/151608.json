Inexplicitly drawn to one of the young men in particular, an impossible romance develops.

She may be one of the few champions willing to make a stand for all of mankind as the rapture approaches and the end of days begin.Embers is the first novel in the dark and gritty YA paranormal romance series, The Wings of War.",
