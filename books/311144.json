  "description": "Hi, my name’s Annie Clark, and I’ve managed to flip my quiet, nerdy, single life completely upside down. First, I recently figured out that I’m bisexual. Second, Eve Frederick, star softball player and my ultimate crush, asked me out on a date. Third, she rocked my world, and now I can’t stop thinking I want more… even though Eve is not into relationships. And to top it all off, someone took a private video of us and is threatening to make it public. It’s enough to make me want to go back to hiding out in my dorm room—but only if I can take Eve with me.",
