  "title": "Truth Shift: One Scared Girlâ€™s Guide to Creating Mindful Change",
  "description": "It's scary to know that we have no control over anything except ourselves, and yet, this truth is our greatest strength. You see, everything changes as we change. We see, hear, understand and experience differently through new beginnings. When we choose knowing truth over illusions, we naturally accelerate our growth through the unconditional loving support which has been with us always. There is so much that our Universe wants us to know about who we really are and what we can achieve! Perhaps we have misunderstood the purpose of our pain and the many injustices we have experienced already. Truth easily brings correction and supports a natural balance. As our perspectives shift through what is truth, the love, compassion, empathy and patience within us expands outwards, creating new loving beginnings for our relationships and experiences.",
