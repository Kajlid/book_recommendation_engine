  "description": "For beautiful Morgan Wakefield, that land lay west of the bluegrass splendor of her Kentucky home...and within the powerful embrace of Seth Colter--the handsome rancher with whom she had struck a bargain that would change her life. Beneath the star-studded New Mexico skies Colter awakened in Morgan a womans passion, stoking the sensuous fires of a bold tempestuous romance. Though fate would make them enemies, theirs was a love that would endure, never to be forsaken.",
