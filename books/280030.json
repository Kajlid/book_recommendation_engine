  "description": "When bored newsfeed editor, Jo Mack, decides to go back to her roots, the Queen of Clickbait sniffs out a scoop that will change her life forever. She hopes that it will get her back to the investigative journalism she longs to do again. After talking with some victims of human trafficking she is determined to find out more, not realising that her professional curiosity could well cost her her life.  A one-minute phone call changes everything. It’s impossible for her to return to London. With the help of friends, she finds her a place to stay in Freshwater Bay on the West Wales coast. And how hard can it be living on a farm, spending the summer by the sea, milking cows and looking after a small boy?  Three years on, and Madog, the youngest of the Morgan brothers, is still struggling to cope with the loss of his girlfriend. When his parents decide to take an overseas trip of a lifetime, he’s landed with single-handedly running the farm and caring for his young son. Any extra help around the place would be welcome but will a rude, ballsy city-slicker like Jo Mack cope with the rigours of farm work and Welsh country life? And how will he cope living with her?  As Jo begins to see the glimmer of a new possible future ahead of her, her past comes slamming into her again. It was meant to be a rural escape, but is there really anywhere safe left for her to hide?",
