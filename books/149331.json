  "description": "Schizophrenia is challenging disorder often characterized by abnormal social behaviour and a significantly altered perception of reality. Its treatment largely depends on medications and psychosocial interventions but no single approach is widely considered effective for all patients. Through this book I offer my readers a glimpse into the multifaceted world of schizophrenia in the form of fictitious storyline revolving around two characters Monty (the psychotic part) and Virginia (the non psychotic part). The boundary between the two is permeable. Monty conjures up ‘Gulabi’, following his abrupt separation from his long time partner, while Virginia, having suffered from a personal loss sets out to follow her lifelong aspiration to travel the world.There are some books that speak more than the ratings. So if you are in hurry to read a masala novel, you will be disappointed and end up feeling \"this is not my taste\".For those, who are not just seeking emotional journey but keeps their consciousness along, this book is for you.This book requires that you do not leave your mind away and escape from reality to enter the fiction world. But this book will bring fiction closest to reality. Reality as it as, it can be disturbing, confusing, meaningful and eccentric as well.",
