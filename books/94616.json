This New York Times Bestseller and ALA-ALSC Notable Children’s Book stars two unforgettable characters and is filled with humor that young children will appreciate—and recognize!Duck and Goose have to work at getting along. You see, Duck doesn’t much care for Goose at first, and Goose isn’t fond of Duck. But both want the egg that each claims to be his. As the two tend to their egg, and make plans for the future, they come to appreciate one another’s strengths. And when a bluebird points out that it isn’t really an egg—it’s a polka dot ball—the two are not dismayed. After all, it is a lovely ball. . . .“Duck and Goose have taken their places alongside Frog and Toad and George and Martha as fine examples of friendship, curiosity and problem-solving.” —Kirkus Reviews",
