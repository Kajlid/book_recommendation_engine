  "description": "From pompous to vain, the most unsuitable suitors courted Anne Fairchild. Tolerant of all foibles, unschooled in flirtation, Anne was the despair of her family. Worst of all, only Chas Prestwick, the outrageous younger brother of an earl, could bring a blush to her cheek. He made Anne long to trade in a life of propriety -- for one that promised a love filled with unpredictable delight.",
