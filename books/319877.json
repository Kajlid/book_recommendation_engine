  "description": "Vampires are coming!Excerpt from Written in Blood:“It haunted me from a distance. Swathed in a thick veil of fog, with but a few old trees looming above, the island appeared desolated and dead.An overwhelming sense of despair crept behind my neck as we reached the shore. Thousands of men, women, and children had been condemned to live the last of their days here, infected by the plague. Dragged away from their homes, here, they suffered their agonizing illness, shunned by society, exiled from everything they knew and held dear.”Fans of Anne Rice and Cassandra Clare will love The Unnatural Brethren series!",
