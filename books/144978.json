Yet despite her love for the game and her dreams of becoming a baseball scout--her father holds one, ironclad rule: No baseball for Olivia.Her one loophole? Playing sports reporter for Texas State Tech.Chasing similar dreams, Liv attempts to befriend Breslin. But the amazingly talented, pain in her aperture has only two words to say whenever she's around: “No comment.”When a lapse in judgment catches Breslin in a real-world rundown, jeopardizing his probation and scholarship, his only choice may be to rely on Liv--the aggravating, attractive, relentless reporter, chasing her latest headline.[Book one of a series, Chasing Headlines ends with a HFN, no cliffhanger, but lingering / unresolved issues waiting to bite them in the butt in Book 2]",
