  "description": "My life has taken a hairy twist.\nI’ve studied the Grimm Effect and am prepared to be the one who finally breaks it. The others who came before me failed, but I have an advantage they didn’t. I escaped my unhappily-ever-after.The one thing I don’t have? Jet-setting money. Good thing a prince I saved while working at the Fairytale Bureau has deep pockets. He’s offered to help me end the jinxing once and for all.What I didn’t count on was the curse fighting back.In an annoying twist, I am now the beast. From dusk ‘til dawn, I’m a hairy monster, and do you know what tames me when I’m tempted to eat annoying people? A certain sarcastic prince.However, I don’t have time for romance because I’m on a quest to save myself, and the world. A quest being thwarted at every turn by the evil magic that keeps spreading.Will I find the answer before everyone in the world is merely a character in a story?Admit defeat and take up residence in a dreary castle where I can roar at trespassers?Or should I take a page from a book and give true love a try?",
