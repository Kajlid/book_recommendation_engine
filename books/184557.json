It challenges both the major religions and modern science, and you may be forced to scrutinize yourself and your own values. We live in a time where a lot of people leave the old beliefs behind and at the same time feel that the materialist worldview feels cold and soulless.In his lifelong search for answers, the author has explored places most of us never dared to visit by throwing himself into the unknown. What he have to say may shake up society and our most fundamental notions about reality, revealing a bridge between the spiritual and the physical world.With the knowledge gained from his own spiritual experiences and his spiritual studies, he explains what consciousness is all about, how we ought to live our lives, where we come from and where we are heading. Above all, he shows that you don’t need to believe in any ideology. You can for yourself understand and experience the solution to the mystery of life.“Every time you feel something painful it’s because you created a separation between yourself and something else. If you return to become one with what you meet, the suffering will go away. The meaning of life in the physical world is to understand that as long as you are two, you will experience various forms of pain.”–Magnus Ahlberg",
