  "description": "ANNIKACheating husband. On-air meltdown. Public humiliation.Lucky me, I’ve experienced them all. Oh, and the implosion of my career as an up-and-coming designer and renovation television darling.That was then.Now, I’m in the TV studio, more determined than ever to prove to myself (and the few fans I have left), that I’m back for good. Nothing from my past—no man, no mistake—is going to knock me down again. If only fate—and Grayson Hesse—had gotten the memo. GRAYSONWoodworker. Stone house restoration guru. And the new host of Hesse and a Hard Place. This is what I know: If this show’s a success, I’ll finally be able to give my family the financial stability they need. My chances of success go way up if I have the best designer in the business working by my side. And the best in the business (despite the lingering rumors) is Annika Hale. She’s the triple threat: brilliant designer, restoration maven, and the woman who stole my heart six years ago…and hasn’t looked back since.But that was then.Now… Well, what is it they say? After all, 425 Madison is the perfect place to fall in love.",
