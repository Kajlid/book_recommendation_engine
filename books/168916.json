  "title": "Zeus: Unbound",
  "description": "Is he doomed to loneliness after growing as dark as the demons he hunts in the BDSM clubs around the globe? Or will submissive acceptance from the strongest woman he has ever met be enough to save him from a solitary life forever condemned? Zeus Cavanaugh Whitehawk can’t afford to relinquish control. Publicly or personally. His body holds powers that can kill, and after years of hunting demons, he feels tainted with the growing darkness in his soul. Sabia Ilie lost her promised mate and her Lycanthrope pack to the mystical Cavanaugh clan several months earlier, and now the oldest of their sons has taken over her life. He’s a bossy brute, a dark and dangerous demon hunter, but beneath the hard surface, she’s sure there is just a man who struggles to remember his humanity. The question is… Just how much of her life is she willing to risk losing, to save his?",
