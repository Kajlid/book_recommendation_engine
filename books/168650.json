Born with a rusty-coloured rune on her hand - what the villagers call a ruinmark - she is scarred by this symbol of the old gods, a sign of magic.And everyone knows that magic is dangerous. Except of Maddy, who actually thinks it's rather fun. Until now. For suddenly her friend One-Eye, a rascally Outlander, wants her to open Red Horse Hill and descend into World Below - a world filled with goblins and far worse - to retrieve a relic of the old gods...Full of trickery, magic and the enchantment of the Norse myths, Runemarks is an epic fantasy adventure - richly inventive and superbly imaginative.",
