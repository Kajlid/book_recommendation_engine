  "description": "It is 1869, and a fourteen-year-old orphaned boy named David Burnie, usually called Davey, lives on Grassy Plantation near Hanksville, KY, with his Aunts Effie and Lou and Uncle Jim, who had been in the Mexican War and then a captain in the Civil War. Uncle Jim joined the Ku Klux Klan when it was supposed to be just a “social club,” but after the members begin assaulting Negroes, he turns against it. He and Davey stop a K.K.K. raid on a neighbor, killing a couple of Klansmen, so they have to flee. Jim has a map showing the location of a treasure on Matecumbe in the Florida Keys that he obtained during the Mexican War, and along with their former slave Zeb, the two head down the Mississippi River towards Florida.Followed by a couple of Klan members, Jim and Davey pick up a medicine show “doctor,” Ewing T. Snodgrass, and his daughter Millicent (Millie). Next, they visit Belle Mead, the Mississippi plantation of Jim’s Civil War buddy Paxton Farrow, only to find out that it is being run by his twin brother Rex Farrow who is impersonating Paxton and is a Klan sympathizer. When they leave, they are joined by Lauriette Paxton who wants to escape her brother’s iron rule. Then they must face hostile Seminoles in the Everglades. Do they ever make it to Matecumbe? Will they find the treasure? And what happens when they are caught in a hurricane?",
