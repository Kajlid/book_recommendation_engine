  "description": "Thrill, suspense, conspiracy, mystery, corporate corruption, and more clash in this new brand of thriller by New York Times bestselling author Craig Hickman. Untainted by political, journalistic, or legal manipulation and uncorrupted by fear or threat of retribution, The Insiders enthralls you with an alarming tale of how corrupt CEOs, secret societies, corporate deceit, domestic espionage, murder for hire, and cunning manipulation are destroying the American dream, influencing our daily lives, and reshaping global society. Wilson's father, Charles Fielder, one of the richest men in the world, has just murdered two women and tried to kill himself. Or did he? Lying in a coma, Charles cannot help his only son understand the mysteries of his life nor his role in founding an exclusive club of the world's most powerful CEOs--the ultimate insiders club with unparalleled perks. Wilson must face this cutthroat world of concealed machinations, corporate espionage, international finance, and economic conspiracy on his own--in order to uncover his father's real agenda, expose the secret society of insiders, and fight to change the face of capitalism. That is, if he can stay alive. Take a plunge into this dangerous and deceitful world of the rich, the famous, and the powerful. Witness the unholy alliances between business and government and the real forces behind our recent financial crisis. The Insiders is a heart-pounding tale full of twists and turns and eye-opening revelations that will make your adrenaline rush last until the very end. Sometimes, the truth can only be told through fiction...",
