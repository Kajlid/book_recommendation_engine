She especially hates the cocky and arrogant Keith, a top notch paramedic, but in too many ways, an arrogant cock-of-the-walk sort. That man stars in her dreams far too many times to be safe. In her position, she can’t afford a schoolgirl crush, let alone the dark and twisted things she wants him to do.Keith Evans is a paramedic, a former Navy corpsman, combat-decorated, cocksure and arrogant, but also lonely with only his demons to keep him company. The ice queen, Laura Peters, MD has caught his eye. He acknowledges her beauty, and admires her medical skills, but dislikes her frostiness, finding her heartless and cold, even robotic, not at all likeable. But her appeal as a woman keeps drawing him back, and he imagines all kinds of dark and delicious things he wants to do.He can’t stand her, and she sure as hell hates him. One thing’s for the fur is about to fly when these two are off-duty. Can they move beyond the hate and anger to explore the passions they can no longer deny?",
