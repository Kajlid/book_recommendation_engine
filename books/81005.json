As a seris Nephilim, his inner fire comes in handy in battle, but not in love.

It's all Dante can do to keep his hands off the alluring, stubborn woman. A single glance from her gray eyes, and Dante goes up in flames.Beth suspects Dante is one of the Nephilim, angelic warriors bound to hunt down the evil Shemyaza who haunt the night and feed off the innocent. If the murderer she's tracking is a Shem, then keeping a Nephilim close would be only logical. She agrees to work with the hunky detective, unaware of his growing feelings for her.When Beth gets too close to finding out the truth behind the Shem kills, her life is put in danger, forcing Dante to protect her the only way he can: with fire.",
