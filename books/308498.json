  "description": "The Archbishop is troubled and eager to avoid a scandal. So is the King. It is December, 1907 and there has been a theft at the Temple Church, London. The theft must have occurred while the Church was under strong and constant guard by the Metropolitan Police. There is no question that all this makes it necessary to call upon Gerard de Montclaire for a solution. But can even Montclaire explain an \"impossible crime\"?",
