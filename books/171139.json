That is, until the death of a Reaper brings Detective David Foster back to town and their paths cross once again. With more and more of the soul-eating Reapers passing through town in search of the Chosen One, who happens to be her sister Lucy, the Estmond family has been busy enough. Now, they rally together in hopes of keeping Hannah out of prison. With all the trouble lately, being a Keeper, a protector of souls, has never been more difficult for Hannah. Will she forgive David and rekindle their relationship? More importantly, will he find out she is the one responsible for the murder he is investigating? Sparks fly in more ways than one in the second installment of the Graveyard Guardians.",
