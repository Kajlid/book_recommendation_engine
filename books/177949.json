  "description": "Deirdre Tombs has lived most her life as the weakest of shapeshifters — an Omega who can’t turn into any animal. Now the terrorist known as Everton Stark has made her his Beta. He wants her by his side when he defeats the Office of Preternatural Affairs, kills Rylie Gresham, and becomes Alpha of all shifters.  The faeries from the Winter Court have an offer to make Stark’s domination easier. They know where to find a cursed sword that can kill anything, and they’ll give it to him… for a price.  Deirdre’s the only one who can keep Stark from getting this powerful weapon — if she wants to. But as brutal as Stark may be, he’s also the only one who can give Deirdre what she wants.  Vengeance.  And Deirdre doesn’t know where her loyalties lie anymore.",
