  "description": "Cindy Eller just wants to get her life back. Instead of focusing her energy on her bakery and her relationship, she keeps getting distracted by the hubbub surrounding the upcoming case-- where she and her family will be put on trial for contact with Faerie. When Cindy is condemned to have her Magic stripped-- a process that could kill her-- who should arrive to save the day but her elusive and very godlike father, Lenus. When worlds collide, innocent people get caught in the crossfires. And sometimes love is its own worst enemy. So much for Cindy's Fairytale ending.",
