  "title": "Thunder at Noon",
  "description": "A riveting description of the events and people involved in one of the major events shaping Western history down to this very day - the Battle of Waterloo. Blending fictional characters and those who really were there that day, Thunder at Noon captures the drama of every moment in the struggle between the two major protagonists - Napoleon Bonaparte, and the Duke of Wellington - as seen through the eyes of the men - and women - who played critical roles in the events not only of the battle itself, but of what is known to history as \"The Hundred Days\" preceding it. This is no dry, academic treatment of a battle. Rather, it is a study in the passions and emotions that make men and women rise beyond what would be considered humanly possible, to achieve the impossible. Thunder at Noon skillfully weaves drama, intrigue, romance and raw courage into a tapestry richly embossed with historical fact and the feel of a time period that was one of the most fascinating ever known. Its characters virtually leap off each page, and the reader will be challenged to refrain from cheering, laughing or crying as he or she follows their crisscrossing paths to an appointment with destiny.",
