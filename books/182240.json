SEE CITY OF SHAME (FIELDS OF ELYSIUM, #2)We do anything for the ones we love….Since Molly Elizabeth Bennett has been living in exile bereft of all memory of her past, she only knows the world to be an unfair and brutal place. Inside Terraka City, where control, violence and humiliation keep people in abject fear, her faith in humanity has faltered. But just like the forest after a fire, she also rises from the ashes. Meanwhile, Victor Sorren embarks on a hazardous rescue mission with Little Pete and Annabella to find his beloved Molly, unaware that she doesn’t remember him. For a mixed-blood Motley Terraka City, where only purebred species have the right to live, is a dangerous place to be. Yet the three friends follow Molly’s footsteps even though they jeopardize their own lives with each step. Four friends. Scattered in four different places. All of their lives in peril. The Imperial Guards hunting them. The Emperor wanting them dead. They just want to find each other and leave this city of shame. But with the stakes so high, wishful thinking may not be enough to save them. Will they all be strong enough to survive this deadly mission into Terraka territory?",
