  "description": "When Carlos' parents died he thought things couldn't get any worse, but then he found himself at the Embry Estate Orphanage. Three years later he narrowly escapes, finding himself lost at sea. When he finally awakens, he realizes that he's landed ashore a strange island, and stumbles across a massive castle in the middle of it. Things begin to get strange when he comes to realize that there are nothing but children, with a single adult they refer to as Father, watching over them. Very quickly he realizes that things are not just lazy days in the sun and endless feasts. There is something sinister hiding in the forest beyond the castle, something that stalks the night, a mass of black fur and teeth. Carlos befriends a young girl named Isabella, and they band together to find out the truth behind the isle, and the monster that hunts the woods after dark.",
