  "description": "Krew doesn’t need a daddy or a guy twice his age. Yet, somehow, he ended up with both.  Free-spirited Krew likes his men willing and disposable. One night stands are all he’s looking for. Love has only ever hurt him. The last thing he needs is Max, a man over twenty-years his senior, and a widowed Daddy Dom. Krew is not a boy. He doesn’t like spankings or kink. And he most certainly doesn’t date. But one night of fun won’t hurt anyone, right? It’s just a game. Until emotions and feelings sneak in where they don’t belong.If the walls around Krew’s hearts crumble, Max will see the broken man at his core. Will he be able to handle all Krew hides from the world and teach him there is nothing to fear about love? Fearless is a hurt comfort, age gap, mild Daddy/boy theme MM romance with mild angst. It is part of the Trials of Fear series but can be read as a standalone. It was originally marked as a companion novel but has been integrated into the series as Book 4. There is no new content.",
