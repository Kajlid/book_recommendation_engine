  "description": "In the small, western town of Thunder Creek, Emma Marchant leads a simple life, her days spent by picking wildflowers, dodging the unwanted advances of the town drunk, and running her family-owned inn with her brother and his wife. Though ever-cheerful on the outside, Emma can’t help but long for something more. Finally, a promise of change comes when cowboy Thatcher Deakon rides into town in search of a room at the Marchant Inn. After an awkward first encounter with the handsome man teasing a blushing Emma, their lives become intertwined with horse rides, barn raisings, and peach cobbler. When others threaten their budding relationship, including a banker’s daughter with golden hair, the two must come together for their love to survive. Will Emma fall prey to her timid nature, or will Thatcher manage to surmount his own fears in order for them both to overcome the uncertainty surrounding their love?",
