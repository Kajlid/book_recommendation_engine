The greatest problem on Earth . . . solved. Saving the world is never easy, and for Heller, it turns out to be a tricky—and risky—business. He’ll have to blast a gang of space pirates in a lethal laser firefight. He’ll have to find a way to capture and control a black hole. He’ll have to undertake a perilous journey to Saturn and back and transport a titanic chunk of ice across the solar system. Then comes the hard part . . . because Heller is headed back to Voltar, where he’s about to uncover the identity of the powerful figure behind the conspiracy to end all conspiracies. He’s facing his deadliest nemesis yet, and before the intergalactic battle is over, the entire mission could end in DISASTER “Features rich inventiveness, brisk pacing and a large cast of appealing characters.” —Booklist",
