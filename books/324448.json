  "title": "Steel Wolf",
  "description": "This divorcee has always loved collecting random stuff, so owning a junkyard is a dream come true--until the robbery. My unlikely rescuer? An old motorcycle. I repay my debt to the trashed bike by rebuilding it with sweat, blood, and cursing. Because I'm done with the tears. As a member of the don't-give-a-damn forties club, I refuse to be a victim. With my steel wolf between my thighs, I'm taking back the night. And who do I happen to meet on my first ride? The scum who robbed and beat me. I'll teach them a lesson they won't soon forget. Unfortunately, my antics draw the attention of the detective currently investigating a string of murders. He can bite my forty-seven-year-old ass if he thinks I'm confessing to anything but an interest in what's under his button-down shirt. Turns out, there's more to the killings than meets the eye. Apparently, it isn't just cars that sometimes come to life. Impossible as it seems, my ride appears to have bloodthirsty tendencies. But is it evil or trying to right a wrong? I'd better figure it out--and soon--or I might be its next victim. Contains mature themes.",
