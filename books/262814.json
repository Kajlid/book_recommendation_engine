Turns out it wasn’t curiosity that killed the cat—it was mortification.I’m almost ready to quit my lunch delivery job, but then my roommate tosses me a copy of The Max Hilton Playbook: Ten Golden Rules for Picking up the Hottest Girl in the Room. It’s the book that catapulted him to stardom. And it’s my new bible. I’m going to use his own techniques against him.

He hasthis smile he shows only to me, and it melts my heart. His touch sends shiversdown my spine.
