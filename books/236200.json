  "description": "The Age of Heroes Begins...  More than anything, August Dillon wants to be a hero. Standing in his way is Randall Coburn, a man who sees August as an adopted son, and the heir to his destructive legacy at Phoenix Paramilitary. August languishes as a mercenary for Phoenix until he meets Meryn, a woman with incredible power who promises to give him the gifts he needs to be the world's first superhero, if only he'll pledge himself to her side in the coming war.  Meryn introduces August to a universe full of life, none more powerful than the Circle, an order of immortals on the verge of civil war. Too powerful to fight for themselves, the Circle chooses champions to fight their battles for them, and August is Meryn's hope to win the peace.",
