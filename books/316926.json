  "description": "Close quarters, hot sand, and forbidden love in this sexy new military stepbrother romance.To me Star Cove means love and heartbreak indissolubly tied together. When my father was assigned as base commander in Star Cove, I couldn’t say no to his offer to move in with him. I couldn’t wait for the beach and the sand and my first real job out of college.Only dad doesn’t tell me about his new wife and her deliciously sexy military sons and the house we all now call home. The house is big, but the base is small, and everyone talks.If I give in to our attraction, I could ruin my new stepbrothers’ careers and my dad’s. If I don’t, I might lose the only chance at a love that could heal my broken heart for good.Warning: this book is part of a trilogy and ends on a cliffhanger. This is a why choose, military stepbrother story where the heroine won’t have to choose between her different love interests. It has sexual scenes, dub-con, swearing, danger and mild violence.
