  "description": "A sex starved pacifist accidentally invents a time machine. When an evil genius finds it, she must save the world. Without killing anybody. Also, she shouldn’t have sex with hypno-robots. Again.A flawed politician wears a bodycam 24/7 to prove he's incorruptible. Governing is hard when everyone is watching. So is masturbating. A drugged out physicist has an inter-dimensional teleporter and a super hot laser. He'd like a word with God. A game playing A.I. doesn't know why she must play games. They're getting boring. She makes her own game.A billionaire would like to colonize Mars, but space monkeys beat him to it. He blames the government. Now he's got to fight a space monkey war. God damn government. Let’s get down to it. I’ve had a couple beer. This may be the most meaningful connection we’ll ever have. Super-intelligences exist. It shouldn't be a problem, but we have super-stupid stuff too. We’re gonna attack the wrong dudes, and they’re gonna retaliate with an artificially intelligent super weapon. Can't we make \"be a better friend\" our foreign policy? We spend $5 billion on cancer research and $600 billion on obsolete weaponry. We should switch that around. A cure for cancer is better than a couple aircraft carriers. I’m gonna get another beer.",
