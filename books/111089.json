  "description": "Successful but shy, Seattle art dealer Mattie Sharpe fell hard for handsome, outspoken, professional adventurer Hugh Abbott. When he broke her heart and returned to his South Sea island home, Mattie vowed she’d only meet him again over her—or better, his—dead body. When they do meet again, it’s over someone else’s dead body—and now they’re running for their lives through a tropical paradise. Hugh’s talking fast to make up for his mistake. Mattie’s not listening…until his gentle touch ignites a white-hot fusion, and she gives in. But Hugh’s past is catching up with them, and Mattie must stake her very survival on the man she loves—the only man who ever let her down! If there is a silver lining to a broken heart, Mattie’s about to discover it—when love storms back into her life and sweeps her off her feet! Passion is an adventure—and seduction an art—in Silver Linings, from beloved New York Times bestselling author Jayne Ann Krentz!",
