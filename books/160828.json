  "description": "The poor economy has forced Dallin to return to his old way of life to avoid homelessness, but when his former associate hooks him up with a wealthy Dom, Dallin figures it’s too good to be true. William is older, wealthy, experienced, and a complete dominant. He’s the sort of man who can go to a club and pick up a dozen subs, and yet he wants to hire Dallin.William knows how to succeed in finance and the bedroom, but trying to keep a relationship going is a far more difficult proposition. Instead of dealing with the messy reality of the club scene or dating, he decides to hire a sub. While William would like to have a long-term relationship develop, he’s not expecting anything. However the longer he plays with Dallin, the more he realizes that he wants more.Dallin is willing to give his body to William--he enjoys the bondage, the games, and ropes and toys. He’s more wary about trusting William with his heart. William is a master of domination, but for Dallin, he wants to learn to love.",
