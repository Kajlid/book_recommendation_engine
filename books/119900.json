She has an aspirational flat, a job of international significance and a very good pair of legs, thanks to a rigorous health and fitness regime. Best of all, her boss has asked her out after seven years' hard flirting and a covert fumble in a cleaning cupboard. Then she breaks her leg in three places, watches her boss propose to someone else and - horror - is forced to hand over her job to her nasty deputy. Charley, a certified workaholic, fears that she will go mad.  Dangerously bored, she starts helping people who are talentless at internet dating. Then William arrives in her inbox and rocks her world. Helpless, she watches herself fall in love with him and discovers she's not who she thought she was. But can she turn her back on her old life - all for a total stranger?Laugh out loud and fall in love with Lucy Robinson's A Passionate Love Affair with a Total StrangerReviews'Cute, funny and totally adorable’ Fabulous Magazine‘Poignant and relatable’Chicklit Central‘Bags of romance and laughter’Closer‘If you're looking for a funny, romantic comedy to lift your spirits, this is the one for you.’Chicklit Club",
