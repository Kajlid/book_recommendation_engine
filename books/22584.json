  "description": "Leola Williams was a strong-willed, independent woman who only wanted to provide for her children. Growing up in Boston with her parents and eight siblings, she had a good life and never wanted for anything. At least that's what she told her six children. But Leola kept a secret; and a code of silence that reigned supreme throughout the family held that secret close. Following Leola's death, her youngest daughter embarks on a journey through her mother's past-a journey that takes her back more than sixty years to the discovery that Leola's life took a dramatic turn when she married handsome WWII solider, James Williams. Determined to break the code of silence, she uncovers the truth of her mother's compelling and shocking past.",
