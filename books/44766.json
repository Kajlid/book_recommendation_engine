  "description": "Available at http://www.flipreads.com/book/cyphili...“Note: This book has content considered unsuitable for individuals below 18 years old and content that some people of any age may find offensive.”Almost five years ago, the author Marvin fell in love with a lovely boy called Cyrill. Thus this was a start of a temptestuous love affair which lasted only two weeks officially but has continued to haunt Marvin all his life with memories of glorious sex and unending torrents of love. After breaking up, Marvin and Cyrill, both writers and poets, became best friends. But deep in his heart, Marvin would never forget the silent sighs of Cyrill, the addictive cyanide of this cyanotic psychosis. He would forever write poems for his first boyfriend although it hurts so much that Cyrill does not care at all to read any of it. But like he said, this was the curse of falling in love with someone more beautiful than you could ever be. This is the first book of Marvin Enore, a collection of love stories dedicated to a love lost but never forgotten.",
