  "description": "First comes marriage. Then comes murder… Lauren Burke waited fifteen months and twenty-three days for her divorce to be finalized. Instead, her ex-husband went one step further—he turned up dead. And the detective working on the case is none other than Kane Hollister—the man who ran off over three years ago and shattered Lauren’s heart into a zillion pieces… It looks like Lauren, but she’s no longer the carefree girl Kane once knew. And yet he can’t deny the awareness that heats his blood at the sight of her. But when the death threats begin, Kane realizes that the killer has a new target…and it’s Lauren. Now he must protect the woman he’s always loved—and always hurt—from a vicious murderer. And when the sparks between them ignite, Lauren will have to make a choice between her life… or her heart!",
