Told through the engaging voice of Eleanor, One Last Look takes the reader to the heart of nineteenth-century India. Surrounded by a constant entourage of servants and aides, overwhelmed by the suffocating heat and her own physical vulnerability, Elenanor begins to realize that nothing is as it seems. Will her brother's politicall ambitions lead them inexorably to disaster? Is her sister's sanity under threat? As fragile boundaries begin to dissolve, and desire and horror overcome her, it is clear that Eleanor's vision of this land and herself will be irrevocably transformed.",
