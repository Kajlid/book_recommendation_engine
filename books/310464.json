  "description": "Salvation is at hand. All it takes is a leap of faith.My father called himself a spiritual leader, but behind closed doors, he was the Devil incarnate. I never told anyone about the horrors he subjected me to…until my oldest friend, Brendan, guessed the truth and promised me that I wasn’t alone anymore. But when my happiness and hope was all wrapped up in one person, it was easy to forget that the real world was still there outside the safe bubble that Brendan and I had created for ourselves. Just when we thought the worst of our troubles were behind us, we found ourselves faced with something both beautiful and terrifying. Something that would change our lives forever…if we survived the fallout.Trigger Warning: This book contains graphic scenes depicting child abuse with heavy religious overtones, including one scene that borders on sexual abuse.Note: This book is a prequel story to the Sealed With a Kiss series about the parents of one of the characters, but it may be read as a standalone.",
