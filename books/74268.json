  "title": "Mirrors of the Unseen: Journeys in Iran",
  "description": "In our current climate of war and suspicion, Iran is depicted as the \"next\" rogue nation that America and the world must \"deal with.\" But the rhetoric about nuclear weapons and jihad obscures the real an ancient nation and culture, both sophisticated and isolated, which still exists clandestinely in major cities as well as the country's remote mountains and deserts.Jason Elliot has spent the last four years traveling in Iran, and in this remarkable book he reveals the many sides of the culture, art, architecture, and people that Westerners cannot see or conveniently ignore. Part close reading of symbols and images, part history, and part intimate interviews with Iranians of many different kinds--from wealthy aristocrats at forbidden parties to tribal horsemen in the most remote mountain villages, who have never seen a Westerner-- Mirrors of the Unseen is a beautiful and thought-provoking book by one of the world's most acclaimed adventurers and authors.",
