My socialite circle abandons me. I’m lost, alone, but my dark knight doesn’t forsake me in my hour of need.I never believed in soul mates. Not until him. Not until he rode into my life; blood on his fists, rage in his eyes, and vengeance in his heart.I never knew my Prince Charming would ride a hog. I’ll take that over a castle any day…SIN is the third book in the eleven-book ‘A Dark & Dirty Sinners’ MC’ series. It is not a standalone.",
