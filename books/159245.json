  "description": "FIVE AGAINST AN EMPIRE They travel to the past to save the future. To fix a man-made paradox that threatens to alter mankind’s destiny forever, the Rangers must defy the legions of Rome at the height of their power. Their mission is to rescue one man from slavery in order to free the world. An adventure that spans two millennia takes them from the days of the Caesars to the siege of a city in the path of total war to a nightmare world of a possible future in which civilization is reduced to an anthill. It all comes down to them as they become Avenging Angels. The third entry in Chuck Dixon's celebrated time travel adventure series Bad Times! The Rangers travel back in time through the Tauber Tube to Roman era Judea to save a man who will change the world for the better with his presence and for the worse with his absence! Their most intense, bloodiest and momentous adventure yet!   “Chuck is a damn good writer who is really good at hooking you, giving you fun characters, and telling you one hell of an adventure story.”  Larry Correia, Monster Hunters International, the Grimoir Chronicles  “An intelligent and well thought-out high action time travel story.”  Noah Mullette-Gillman, Luminous and Ominous  “Dixon excels at putting down action, of introducing larger-than-life heroes, kicking them through the door into a big mess, and having them sort out a situation in a flurry of martial arts moves and big guns.”  Mel Odom, The Rover series.",
