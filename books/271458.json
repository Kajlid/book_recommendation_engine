  "title": "Three Presidents and Their Books: The Reading of Jefferson, Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt",
  "description": "These three essays assess the effects of certain books on the intellectual development of three selected leaders, Jefferson, Lincoln, and F. D. Roosevelt. All three were known to have been bookmen, though in varying degrees and in different fashion. The authors were well-suited to the task. Arthur E. Bestor, Jr., at the time professor of history at the University of Illinois, had established his reputation as an authority on American communitarian experiments; ahead of him was his recognition as one of the eminent constitutional scholars of his generation. David C. Mearns, as the time, could look back on a 35-year career at the Library of Congress. When the papers of Robert Todd Lincoln were unsealed in 1947, he was entrusted with bringing them to publication. Jonathan Daniels, in addition to a long career as newspaperman, first met Franklin Roosevelt as a youth, and served in a number of capacities in the Roosevelt administration. All three papers were presented as the fifth set of Windsor Lectures in Librarianship at the University of Illinois in 1953, but their interest far transcends library science.",
