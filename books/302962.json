  "description": "“Hi, I’m Lacey Winters. Are you single?”The woman at the island resort had one thing in mind: making her cheating ex-boyfriend jealous. And Drew Mitchell was all too happy to oblige. But in a million years he never could have imagined that one kiss with a beautiful stranger would change the remainder of his vacation—and the rest of his life.Drew knew he’d done Lacey a favor. Ill fortune had her facing the prospect of a week alone and in full sight of her ex frolicking with the woman he’d jilted her for. So agreeing to be her fake boyfriend seemed like the least Drew could do. But he hadn’t anticipated being so taken with her. And he never could have predicted falling in love.Now Drew had questions of his own: Can he prove to Lacey that what they have is real? Can he convince her to trust in her heart again? Drew didn’t have any answers. It seemed that what happened once upon a kiss was anything but predictable.",
