  "description": "Dily's life is perfect. Apart from the envy of her less contented sister, she has everything she could possibly want - a loving husband, a beautiful home, a privileged lifestyle - and she's proud that she has achieved so much when she began with so little.But then one day her illusion of perfection is shattered when she meets a man at a train station. As she hurtles towards either her destruction or her liberation, she discovers that life isn't as simple as thought, and that the right choice, like truth, is rarely pure and never simple.",
