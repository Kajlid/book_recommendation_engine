  "description": "Born in the thick of the Southwest, C. Dean Quackenbush takes us through the ins and outs of growing up in Colorado as a tomboy, surrounded by men while developing into a woman. Through poetry and prose, My Lady Southwest weaves in and out of losing innocence, learning magic in mountain prairies, heartbreak, getting tough, keeping up with the boys, loss in darker forms, and re-imaging our men today, and a few tidbits of good wisdom. Women have grit, the Southwest is a lady, and gentlemen still exist.",
