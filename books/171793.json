  "description": "This volume, the twelfth project of the English Translation Committee of the Nichirenshu Overseas Propagation Promotion Association (NOPPA), constitutes all twenty-seven writings of Buddhist reformer Nichiren Shō nin (1222-1282) included in the Nichiren Shō nin Zenshū (Complete Writings of Nichiren Shō nin), Volume IV: Faith and Practice, published in Tokyo in 1993. The Nichiren Shō nin Zenshū is a modern Japanese version of Nichiren's original writings, translated and edited with annotations by modern scholars of Nichiren Buddhism. Despite its all-inclusive titles, the Zenshū is highly selective in that it takes into account only writings considered bibliographically authentic (i.e., attested to by original manuscripts). Among such texts, those included in the Shō wa Teihon Nichiren Shō nin Ibun (Writings of Nichiren Shō nin Standardized in the Shō wa Period) are considered the most authoritative, and they provide the basic texts for this volume.",
