Not relationships. Not life. And certainly not the connection that simmers between himself and his new assistant.As the pair work together, their undeniable attraction draws them closer, bringing a realization that sometimes life and the people in it are worth slowing down for. But when Elle is presented with a plot twist she never saw coming, she quickly learns that crafting her own story may be much harder than she initially thought.Faced with a difficult decision, she has two choices: write the truth or deliver an alternate ending she knows they both deserve.",
