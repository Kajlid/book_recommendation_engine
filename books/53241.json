  "description": "Lights. Camera. Murder. The Dexter series continues with a wild ride through Hollywood. Mega-star Robert Chase is famous for losing himself in his characters. When he and a group of fellow actors descend on the Miami Police Department for \"research,\" Chase becomes fixated on Dexter Morgan, the blood-spatter analyst with a sweet tooth and seemingly average life. Chase shadows Dexter's every move, trying to learn what makes him tick. However, Dexter's favorite pastime of hunting down the worst killers who've escaped legal prosecution—and introducing them to his special brand of justice—presents, well, a bit of a problem. It's a secret best kept out of the spotlight if Dexter wants to stay out of the electric chair, but even Dexter isn't immune to the call of fame. . . .",
