  "description": "I’m a sucker for pretty things. Give me a roaring engine in a souped-up vintage muscle car with cherry red paint and brand-new leather interior, and that’s about as pretty as anything I could ask for. I’m a simple man, who doesn’t need or want the kind of wild celebrity that my father has. I restore one-of-a-kind vehicles and sell them to the highest bidder. Usually, that bidder just also happens to be a celebrity.But no matter how often my cars steal the spotlight, staying out of it is my number one priority.Which is why Sydney Sterling is absolutely out of the question.She’s a country music superstar. She’s in the spotlight. People can’t get enough of her.It doesn’t matter that our one night together was hotter than a full throttle muscle car, or that she’s the most incredible woman I’ve ever met.I. Need. To. Stay. Away.And I was doing a great job of just that until our friends set us up on a blind date, and now here I am, sitting across from the only woman who made me want more. How am I going to handle the fact that the rest of the world wants her almost as much as I do?And do I even have a choice in the matter?",
