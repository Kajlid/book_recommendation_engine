  "description": "A retelling of The Frog Prince fairy tale Princess Cordelia is used to being overshadowed by her many brothers and sisters. So when she’s offered the chance to attend her brother’s wedding in a faraway kingdom, she leaps at it. In Northhelm, she’ll finally have the chance to stand alone. And maybe, just maybe, she’ll even find romance. But not everything in the Northhelmian court is as it appears. With her brother distracted by the wedding, only Ferdinand, the ugliest man at court, will listen to Cordelia’s concerns. A beautiful princess and a strangely amphibious soldier may be the only thing standing between all Four Kingdoms and disaster. Cordelia will have to overcome prejudice, deceit and danger if she wants to save the day and find romance at A Midwinter’s Wedding.",
