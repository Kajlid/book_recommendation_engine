  "description": "April 1st: Aries: Light a candle and watch as the flames slowly burn. The fire is a symbol of the transformation and passion within you. A passion that could destroy the same love you're hoping to protect. If you don't want this flame to start to catch on new tinder, you're going to have to finally make a move.Jasper Monte is sick and tired of being kept in the dark, but no matter how much he tries to pry information out of Professor Chase King, the elusive Zodiac Shifter, he's always left with more questions (and frustration) than answers. But if his teacher won't help him, maybe the library can.And if the library can't help him, maybe the cute upper classmen with an affinity for mythology can.But the Aries can be an aggressive and very jealous star sign, and Chase might have to give in to instinct if he doesn't want to risk losing his mate to the curious new contender.The werewolves of the legends were nothing like this.When every month threatens a different transformation, will Jasper be willing to accept the risks that being with the professor entails?This is a sexy and dark story of a once innocent college boy and his dangerous shifter alpha professor. Each installment features a different Zodiac Sign transformation and creative ways to use it! If you enjoyed the steam of Fifty Shades of Grey, the hot and dangerous Werewolves of The Vampire Diaries, and love Male Male Romance, you'll love the Zodiac Werewolf!",
