  "description": "?Percy? Peach and Lucy Blake find themselves bewitched . . . In an area famous for the Lancashire Witches four centuries earlier, it seems that witchcraft still flourishes. A body is discovered in a derelict farmhouse, partly mummified and dreadfully damaged. But why did no one close to the murdered girl report her missing? Why was her flatmate so sure she was never coming back? And what was her connection to a modern day coven of both male and female witches?",
