  "description": "Molly is a lively, lovable schemer and dreamer growing up in 1944. Her stories describe her life on the home front during World War Two. Molly doesn't like many of the changes the war has brought, and she especially misses her father, who is away caring for wounded soldiers. But Molly learns the importance of getting along and pulling together -- just as her country has to do to win the war Molly plans a secret project to win her school's Lend-a-Hand Contest. But the project tums out to be harder than Molly had thought.",
