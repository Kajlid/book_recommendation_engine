  "description": "An anthology of contemporary shorts reflecting the malaise of the modern psyche. Contributors: Adam Blampied, Rachel Clutterbuck, Hannah Coneys, Ruth Cornish, Robert Frimston, Ramman Gautam, Abigail Gregory, Peter Huntley, Simon James, Kylie Jensen, Lucy Kaufman, Alison Kenward, Martha Loader, Adam Martin, Greg Meritt, Bill Rayburn, Dani Redd, Fiona Scoble, Michael Springford, Mark Triller and James Troughton.This anthology has emerged from an open writing competition which publishers mardibooks ran in conjunction with IdeasTap. The resulting several hundred entries were astounding in both their quality and variety. It was a tough task whittling them down to a final few winners.The compilation and editing of the collection was nevertheless a joy. We have tried to create the collection as a whole without compromising the authentic individuality of the stories. Where American spelling has been used by native writers, this has been maintained.This selection of stories reflects a sense of the immediacy and urgency of life; the choices people make and the circumstances they find themselves in, showing vanity and fragility on each page. The protagonists and antagonists in these stories have few moral qualms, as you will see.The Mardibooks Team",
