  "title": "Dead Brides: Vampire Tales",
  "description": "Dead Brides contains the vampire cycle of live stories, written between 1835 and 1842, which in many ways forms the nucleaus of Poe's prose work: Berenic, Montella, The Fall of the House of Usher and The Oval Portrait. In these classic tales, Poe investigates the vampiric nature of human relationships, including love and lust both normal and incestuous, and develops his theme to observe the vampiric qualities inherent in the creative or artistic process.  Vampirism, with its terrible energy exchanges and lesions, is ultimately Poe s analogy for a love that persists beyond the graveÂ—an all-consuming passion that knows no peace until an undead reconciliation is effected.  With a preface by Jeremy Reed, Dead Brides is illustrated by the lithographs of the Symbolist Odilon Redon, who was compelled to reproduce the most insane images from his unconcious through the inspiration of Baudelaire, Huysmans, and other dangerous writers of his age.",
