  "description": "Alternate Cover Edition can be found here. In a distant solar system, a war breaks between the Webbur Union, its ally the Kingdom of Torrance, and their rival, the Axx Republic. Byllard Iddo is a young man who accidently killed his father in a martial arts training session. He left to join the Space Navy. Now a lieutenant in the powerful Webbur Navy, Byl will serve in different ships and face danger as the war grows in violence. Refusing to disappoint his new family, the Navy, he embarks in a desperate mission to diminish a ruthless threat: the invisible Silent Boats that prey on the convoys that cross the void Dark Sea space between Webbur and Torrance. He is sure of only one thing: many will die in the battles ahead and he will do whatever it takes to bring the war closer to an end. As he walks this path, through tales of love, pain and sacrifice, he becomes the youngest and most decorated Captain in Webbur Space Navy’s history. Award-winning author Bruno Martins Soares comes back with a new scifi novel that will bring you to a dark hard world at war. What if WWII’s Battle of the Atlantic happened in Space, thousands of light-years from Earth?",
