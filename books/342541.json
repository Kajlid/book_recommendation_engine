  "description": "Death comes for the cast and crew of the hit comedy TV Show Chocolate City, impacting not only their personal lives but the prospect of their show's continued success. As each member sinks into their own past, and the spirits of those that came before, the tragedies continue. Maurice Broaddus weaves a tale of intimate nightmare and dark discovery in a compelling exploration of humanity's relation not only to his own mind and soul, but also to the ghosts of days gone by-personal and ancient. When your terror comes to claim you, who will it be? Nobody.",
