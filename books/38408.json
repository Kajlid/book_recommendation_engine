  "description": "After breaking up with her boyfriend, seventeen-year old Aleria “Ali” Hayes finally feels liberated. Unfortunately, her ex’s buddies are not making it easy on her. When his friends harass her one night, a mysterious stranger, Bowen, steps in to rescue her. But just as this new relationship seems to be taking off, Ali is attacked by something far worse than spiteful high school boys. When she awakes, her eyes are opened to a world where gods still walk the earth, where vampires and other immortals fight for supremacy— and where fate may be stronger than free will. Now, Ali must decide who she can trust, and whether the world of mortals is worth saving at all.Missing Twilight but want more than a love story? This simple beginning evolves into an epic journey through the shadow world of vampires, fallen angels, and the watchers. This series is great for anyone who loves the romance of Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight Saga, the world-building of Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments Series, and the high stakes of Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games. When you get to book two, fasten your seatbelt, each book is faster, darker, and sexier.",
