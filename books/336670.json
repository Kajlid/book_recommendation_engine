And I’m tempting her to do things she never thought she’d do…Shaw won’t stop hunting her.When the time comes to act, will Mara be ready?The Lark Notes:I was so pleased how many women identified with Mara’s character - with her sensory issues and history of trauma. It sounds crazy to call this an “inspirational story of murder”, but at the end of part two, I hope you will indeed feel inspired by Mara’s journey. — Sophie\"There Is No Devil” is the second half of the Sinners Duet.
