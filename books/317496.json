  "description": "Forty-two year old Rebecca Cleaver has lost her fire. Actually, she lost it seven years ago, the moment she lost her husband Jack. After his death, her grief, combined with deteriorating mental and physical health, led her to shrink her world down to dimensions that can only be described as pocket-sized. Now, Rebecca is starting to wake up to the world around her, realizing she's been living little more than a half-life. She decides to kick off her new life with a mini bucket list to get her up off her couch, a list that leads her to Rhys. Rhys, the first man to light her fire since Jack, he thrills her and terrifies her in equal measure. Rhys is just as enthralled with Rebecca, and keen to be an integral part of the changes she's making. Unfortunately for Rhys, meeting a man is not on her bucket list. Fortunately for Rebecca, he's good at editing. The question that remains is whether Rebecca is willing to risk loving, and losing, again.",
