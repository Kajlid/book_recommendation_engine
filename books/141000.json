  "description": "I thought I had life all figured out. We live. We suffer pain. We die. Death never bothered me much. It is love that scares the hell out of me, because love makes you weak, and in my line of work there is no room for that. My name is Gianna Botticelli. I am the daughter and only female employee of a Los Angeles mafia boss. Today was supposed to be like any other day, and then Caleb walked into my life. He is sexy and mysterious and knows things he shouldn’t. I don’t like it at all, but I can’t help the way he makes me feel inside. There is something different about him. What is he? All I know is that after meeting Caleb, things will never be the same as he introduces me into his world, an unknown world where the battle of good versus evil rages on. Sacrifices will be made, hearts will break and lives will be taken. How far am I willing to take this journey, I keep asking myself? If I have to sacrifice myself to save everyone and everything then the answer is easy. All the way.(less)",
