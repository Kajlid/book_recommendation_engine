Now she's all grown up and returning home with a better understanding of the BDSM lifestyle.

They'd been heartbroken after her departure and had turned to each other, embracing the BDSM lifestyle without her. Katie's homecoming sparks hope and worry. Ry isn’t sure he can keep his dominant side under control, and Jed fears Katie will see him as less of a man by being a switch and Ry’s submissive.Having Katie back could mean the beginning of everything they've ever wanted or the end to the only family they've ever known.",
