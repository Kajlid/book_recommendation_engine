Colton Banks is a cocky lawyer with a mean streak a country mile wide. Colton prefers order to chaos. He believes there’s a time and place for everything, so when a lilac-haired hottie sends him a flirtatious wink while she’s on the job, he’s less than impressed. When she shows up at his office a week later asking for legal help, his first instinct is to send her packing. But day after day, she returns, finding new elaborate ways to break him down.  It’s not until a life-altering surprise shows up on Colton’s doorstep that things start to change. Ironically, the answer to his problem may be his incredibly annoying, free-spirited new “friend.” Complications. Lust. Attraction. Love. As their tenuous friendship grows, the chemistry between them becomes a raging inferno, and everyone knows you can’t deny your rebel desires.",
