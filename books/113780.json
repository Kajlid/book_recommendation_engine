  "description": "Although Katherine Mansfield was closely associated with D.H. Lawrence and something of a rival of Virginia Woolf, her stories suggest someone writing in a different era and in a vastly different English. Her language is as transparent as clean glass, yet hovers on the edge of poetry. Her characters are passionate men and women swaddled in English reserve -- and sometimes briefly breaking through. And her genius is to pinpoint those unacknowledged and almost imperceptible moments in which those people's relationships -- with one another and themselves -- change forever. This collection [of 28 stories] includes such masterpieces as \"Prelude,\" \"At the Bay\" \"Bliss,\" \"The Man Without a Temperament\" and \"The Garden Party\" and has a new introduction by Jeffrey Meyers.Introduction / Jeffrey Meyers --Tiredness of Rosabell (written 1908; published 1924) --Baron (1910) --Modern (1911) --Woman at the store (1912) --Ole underwood (1913) --Little governess (1915) --Prelude (1918) --At the bay (1922) --Psychology (1920) --Bliss (1918) --Je ne Parle Pas Francais (1920) --Sun and moon (1920) --This flower (1924) --Man with a temperament (1920) --Revelations (1920) --Young girl (1920) --Stranger (1921) --Daughters of the late Colonel (1921) --Life of Ma parker 91921) --Singing lesson (1921) --Voyage(1921) --Garden-party (1922) --Miss Brill(1920) --Marriage a la mode (1921) --Doll's house (1922) --Doves' nest t(1923) --Six years after (1923) --Fly (1923).",
