  "description": "They say that behind every great man is a great woman...But what if that woman is a Werewolf?\"Serenity and Clint Eastwood fans saddle up! This is a straight shooting futuristic story that celebrates honor and survival with a little paranormal on the side.\"Settled into their new home of North Chicago, Terry and Char find more enemies than they suspected. Faced with their greatest threat, they put the FDG into action against a Forsaken who's surrounded himself with a small army of loyal humans. With Akio's aid, they go to war.\"I swear this series just gets better and better. \"\"The saga of TH and Char continues as they protect the innocent and attempt to return civilization to the people. The characters and story are great as usual. I found myself more and more engrossed as I devoured the book.\"",
