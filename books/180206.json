  "description": "MARGARET. She was young, blonde and ravishingly beautiful and desired by men and women. Their quarry had been chosen and like a pair of hungry predators they stalked her. Two men from different worlds and cultures who’ve never met. One black, the other whiter in his own mind than a fresh snowdrift. Each would sooner put a bullet in his own head than admit he had something in common with the other, but here they were, within a whisper and unknown to each other, with the single putrid intention to possess Margaret’s body by any means.",
