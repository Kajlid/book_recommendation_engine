  "title": "Moody's Tale: The Story of Corporal Horrie",
  "description": "James Moody of the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion found an Egyptian dog in 1940, who became Horrie, the Battalion's mascot. He wrote it first as a simple tale, augmented by his own photographs of Horrie and his mates in action in Greece, Crete and Palestine. This was sent to Ion Idriess, who developed the book with a series of questions, to finally develop the classic tale of man's best friend: Horrie the Wog Dog.Published for the first time is Moody's original tale, and extended response to Idriess' questions, which gives a much stronger picture of members of the Battalion itself, the Rebels, written and lived in that Australian larrikin manner.",
