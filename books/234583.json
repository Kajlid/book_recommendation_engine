  "description": "I was raised to believe in things you can't see.It is the foundation of everything. I am taught to accept the unacceptable. To embrace the terrifying.To give everything to my family.To my church.To my god.Because I have a purpose. I have been trained for my calling for as long as I can remember. As an acolyte for the Gathering of the Sun, I am taught that my life isn't my own. I worship. I serve. And when the time comes, I will greet my fate with open arms and a sin free heart.People call us a cult.We are judged. We are ridiculed and reviled. Pastor Carter tells me they will be lost when the end comes. So we hide ourselves away from their sick and dangerous world. And my soul is safe because I follow the path.I am the perfect disciple. I am confident in my devotion.Until doubt arrives wearing the face of a boy I never expected to love.Bastian doesn't follow the path. His destiny is his own. He paints me a picture of a beautiful world. His words contradict everything I have been told.He invites me to live when I have been prepared to die.He gives me something new to believe in.Love becomes the ultimate crisis of faith and now I am torn between two futures. One that saves my soul.And one that saves my heart.",
