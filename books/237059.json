  "description": "Molly is back from the dead. And now even more capable. But the transformation is not without more serious issues.\n\nProblems that not even ADAM can help with.\nFeeling cursed, she undergoes a Vision Quest.  The rest of the team prepare for the General's clandestine assignment back at the base.  \nBut with the fate of the Federation hanging in the balance, a question arises.\n\nCan Molly handle this next mission?\n\n\n\n\n--- PLEASE NOTE ---\n\nInside this book is cursing, amusing cursing, but cursing nonetheless. If bad language offends you, perhaps this book is not for you.​\n\n​Set on the foundation laid by the Kurtherian Gambit Series, Awakening tells an entirely new story in the Age of Expansion--when the Etheric Empire is fast becoming the Etheric Federation with all of the trials and tribulations that come with bringing together different peoples, systems, and ideals.",
