  "description": "*Winner 2011 White Pine AwardPhilip Skyler learned early in his life that his face would get him into trouble and there was nothing he could do about it. Born with an extreme facial deformity, he became the object of attention. Though medical scientists named his condition Van der Woude syndrome, his classmates, especially the bullies, just called him \"Monkeyface.\" Monkeyface Chronicles is his sweet story of revenge. Philip's aphorism-toting grandfather used to say, \"Shallow men believe in luck. Strong men believe in cause and effect,\" and Philip is about to embark on a life journey of payback that has everything to do with cause and effect. While riding his father's motorcycle to Toronto to escape the dregs of Faireville, Philip has a life-changing experience that transforms him from the dupe he was as a kid into a conquering hero in his twenties.",
