  "description": "The final book in the bestselling Wolf Queen series by Linsey Hall.I'm a hero. And I'm locked in a cell. Fantastic.A week ago, it took everything I had to save the werewolves from the Dark Moon curse, but I did it. Unfotunately, it left me with a nasty case of the curse myself. To make matters worse, I'm the most powerful werewolf who ever lived. And I'm apparently a goddess. Combine that with the fact that I'm also cursed to madness and a loss of my shifter loyalty, and you've got a recipe for disaster.Even though I don't want to be locked up, I know its the best thing for everyone. If I were to get out and succumb to the curse, I could destroy us all. The only way to save myself is to find a cure for the curse, something that I still haven't managed to figure out. My fated mate Lachlan is determined to help me, but we we're still haunted by our own curse. If I fall for him, I'm dead. According to our most powerful seer, at least.So yeah, let's just say things are complicated.",
