  "description": "Kate was raised in the Holy Divine Church. It influenced everything from her homeschooling to her handmade clothes. But ever since her unbelieving father's death last year, she has suspected that there's more to life than memorizing scripture.Taking advantage of their move to a new town, Kate to her devout mother's horror quits Holy Divine. She joins the cross-country team, wears shorts to public school, and even tries a traditional Christian church. As she struggles to come to terms with her father's death and her mother's unquestioning beliefs, Kate discovers there's a big difference between religion and faithâ€”and that the two don't always go hand in hand.",
