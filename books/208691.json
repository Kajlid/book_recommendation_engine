  "description": "A work so thoughtful and entertaining, engaging and richly satisfying. When Everything Good Comes follows the life of Molebi, a child who lives with her two older sisters and their mother in Ketu, a lower class settlement in Lagos, Nigeria. It's a coming of age story of Molebi who narrates the discovery of herself and the struggles of an all-female household in patriarchal Nigeria. Molebi grew up without her father who left the family in want of a male child and in search of another woman who could bear him one. His abandonment of his wife and daughters threw them into squalor and misery. But Molebi's mother, proud and strong was determined to walk through walls to fend for her three daughters and pay for their education. Soon, everything good begins to come for the family. As the pain of the struggles begin to wear off, and as the family begins to sigh in relief, the long absent father walks in through the door.",
