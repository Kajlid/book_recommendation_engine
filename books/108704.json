No, not nearly. As women we’ve learned to persevere, regardless of the circumstance. We’ve faced off with the thorns of life and overcome. And now, it is with the utmost humility that we bare our souls to women of the world. Please take our lessons of depression, abuse, overwork, misuse, uncertainty and loss – use them to encourage and grow.",
