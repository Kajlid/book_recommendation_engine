  "description": "From the moment Andreas Nikandros looked into the silver eyes of Titus Antonius Calidus, his life was destined to change. They’ve faced challenges and dangers together, but all those did was make his love for Titus grow and strengthen his resolve to spend eternity at the side of his vampire lover. Titus has seen centuries come and go, losing more hope with each one of ever finding love again, until Andreas entered his life. He’s found his eternal partner in Andreas, and is ready to make him so in every sense. As they follow their loving instincts, Andreas knows he’s going to have to make sacrifices, but he also knows what he’ll gain will be so much greater; Titus – forever. What he doesn’t foresee is Titus’s enemies becoming his own and how difficult simply surviving is when he becomes the hunted.",
