Sent from the Heavens to prevent a war from happening, Declan’s mission is to find the prophecy child and ensure he/she doesn’t fulfill their destiny. Working on a farm in Pine Mountain, Georgia, Declan works his way not only through the land but finds his way into the heart of a small town girl. Not just any small town girl, but what could only be described as the land owner’s niece. No matter how hard he tried to avoid her and deny what he felt as they touch, Declan finally allowed himself to feel what he never knew…Love. Still hunting for the prophecy child, Declan finds that he is not the only supernatural creature there with the same agenda. The Darkness has sent their own minions to look as well. Time is of the essence and Declan can no longer put off the most important decision of his existence. Does he choose love and take the fall or does choose his honor instead?",
