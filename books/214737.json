  "description": "The United States has fallen. Millions have died, and millions more have fled to the refugee-swamped central states. A month after the infection arrived the east is now a dead zone, populated only by the infected and those dumb or crazy enough to stay behind and fight.  Tom Freeman is among the last to remain, and he's quickly learning that there are worse things to fear than the infected. Dark forces work to use the tragedy for their own ends, and the greatest danger may not be from those hungry to feed... but those hungry for power.  Trust no one...  Watch your back...  Don't fall asleep...  They're here.  CORDYCEPS is the second book in the terrifying post-apocalyptic Last Man Standing series.",
