  "description": "She can’t explain it, but Anna seems to have a connection with her new boss. What starts out as intimate work conversation slowly erupts into a gateway of a life in which Anna takes on the persona of Leila; an escort who travels from country to country, pleasuring any and all she meets, as long as they pay for her price. DIARY OF AN INTERNATIONAL CALL GIRL is an intimate look at the life and times of an international escort, as she travels from country to country, building up a client list and finally allowing herself to experience an exploratory sex-life which she’d only seen in the movies.",
