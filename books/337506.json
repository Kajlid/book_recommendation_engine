  "description": "“It’s nothing against you, Nora,” my fated mate says, “but you’re not good enough.”I was a werewolf who was rejected by her fated mate. It’s an act that’s usually saved for the worst kinds of people—criminals, abusers, murderers.Not eighteen-year-old girls celebrating their birthday with their family.I was betrayed by those closest to me. My family were mortified that I had embarrassed them, and my Alpha and Luna were angry their son had been matched to me in the first place.In a brutal move, I was banished from our pack with nothing but the clothes on my back and a grieving wolf…Until six years later, when my billionaire boss, and the most powerful Alpha lion shifter, Atticus Phoenix, walks into my life. He calls me his, but I don’t believe it. I can’t trust it.Especially not when every man in his inner circle adds to the claim.They’re strong and powerful, and I’m… not good enough.But when the man who broke me comes to Atticus for help, mated to my sister, of all people, and these powerful men offer me revenge… can I accept it, even if I can’t accept them?",
