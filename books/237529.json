It left him with one hard limit he’ll never budge on, the same hard limit that’s tanked every relationship he’s had, and resulted in his trust being repeatedly shattered. When he meets Joel courtesy of matchmaking friends, he senses something different in the Top and wonders if he’s the real deal. Especially when Joel receives the Snoobug seal of approval from Fen’s young niece.Joel’s first impression of the fricking adorable side is that he’ll break if Joel so much as looks at him wrong, much less plays with him. Fen’s limit isn’t a problem for Joel, because the Sephora-loving, Broadway-musical-singing, essential-oil-diffusing subby slid right past all of Joel’s emotional defenses like no other. And looks can be deceiving—Fen is much tougher than people assume.After a family tragedy, when Joel’s past returns to strike where he’s most vulnerable, can Fen step up, swing hard, and save them with his cast-iron will?Related Books: Court and Spark, Searching for a Heart",
