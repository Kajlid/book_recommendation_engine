  "title": "The Man Who Ran from God",
  "description": "In a dream, the voice of God commands Jonah to go to Nineveh, capital of the mighty Assyrian Empire. Instead, he books passage to the other end of the world. A storm and a hungry whale are the least of his worries, as Jonah confronts deluded fishermen, befuddled peasants and crooked priests. At the end of it all, Jonah must face the hardest decision of his life: stand and preach to the fervently pagan crowds in Ninevehâ€™s main square or flee back home to Judea. This modern, secular retelling of the Jonah tale unwinds fact from fiction. The narrative imagines Jonah as a real man who felt compelled to spread his monotheistic belief at a time when paganism was almost universal. Loosely based on the Biblical narratives of Jonah and The Book of Kings, the narrative draws on recent research on the Neo-Assyrian empire to paint a lush picture of its forgotten people, cults and customs as seen through the eyes of its determined, cantankerous hero.",
