Just five games into the new season following a Stanley Cup win, the sports world can't fathom why the number one enforcer would willingly step aside. He further throws the world into a tailspin with part of his reasoning behind he wants to get out of the spotlight, start a private practice as a physical therapist, find a wife, buy a house, get a dog, and just settle down.A year later, he runs into Olivia Casey—quite literally—and one hospital trip, a concussion and a shifting of the moon and the stars later, finally lets out the collective breath he's been holding his whole life. For Olivia, a hotshot young architect taking the world by storm with her revolutionary yet simple designs, fate could not have been more obvious. She awakens to find the Goliath man who knocked her down, and out, checking her body for damage; her good friends standing close by are no soothing balm to the primitive struggle of fight or flight she's experiencing. But fate can be brutally honest, whether it's expected or not, and Justin and Olivia both wonder if they can relax their guard enough to let fate take its course and wind up lucky in love... or in the penalty box.",
