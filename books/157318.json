  "description": "Seventeen year old Quincy learns she is the heir to a royal kingdom. To claim her place in the Thalassic, she must allow the ocean to claim her, as a mermaid. Thalassa means of the sea. Every single important moment in Quincy’s life has to do with water. She sits now at the bottom of the pool at her new school, drowning. Feeling like someone was holding her there. She was about to die in the same way her parents did three years ago. Quincy is about to gulp down the water when two strong arms grab her and rip her from the water. Her last fleeting thought before breaking the surface was “If I would have taken a breath underwater, it would have felt like coming home.”",
