  "description": "Stefanie Wilder-Taylor has never been one to take the conventional route. Whether financing a move to L.A. with only a best friend’s bat mitzvah savings, accidentally free-basing cocaine, or disproving her mother’s \"cars aren’t free\" refrain by winning one on Hollywood Squares , Stefanie is living proof that the unlikely can happen—usually to her. In this hilariously irreverent collection of true-life essays, she shares her triumphs, missteps, and the many lessons learned en route from life as a nice Jewish girl in Queens to life as a Hollywood producer, writer, and mother of three. Self-skewering, hopeful, and wise, It’s Not Me, It’s You is personal storytelling at its funniest, bravest, and most irresistible.",
