  "description": "Emily Writing hot romance novels is so much fun. And to think this is my job makes it even better! But, now I have a deadline to meet and my editor is on my case. So when I'm asked out on a date, it's a welcome distraction. He’s handsome, witty, charming, and chivalrous. Just like the heroes in my stories, he seems to be the perfect man! After all the asshats I've had before, am I wrong to think he’s Mr. Right? Ryan My brother's a lying, cheating jerk. We couldn't be more different. He screwed me over, so I stay out of his business, and he stays out of mine. Then I see him out with a beautiful redhead. A gorgeous hottie with curves in all the right places. I should warn her. Tell her how he really is. One look in her sparkly blue eyes and my mind's made up. I'm going to claim her and make her mine. Short, hot, and over the top! If you love possessive alpha males, totally unrealistic insta-love romance, this one’s for you! No cliffhanger, no cheating, and a guaranteed HEA!",
