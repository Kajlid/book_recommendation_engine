  "description": "Jesse Sullivan isn't afraid of any thing, any man, or any bull. But when he decides to take a chance and carve out a life outside his rodeo career, he feels like he's walking on shaky ground. In typical Jesse style, he jumps at a chance to purchase Main Street Gallery, a Boise tradition in the art world. Taylor DeMarco has two goals for the next year. Getting the gallery on sound financial ground to prove to her parents that she can keep her grandfather's legacy alive is number one. The second is moving out of the house and into her own condo by the Boise River. When she finds her folks are selling the gallery to Jesse, she vows to stop the sale, no holds barred. When sparks fly between Jesse and Taylor, family gets in the way of reason, and they have to decide what is more important: their desires or keeping Main Street Gallery open and successful. If you love strong family connections, cozy community settings, and characters to root for, you need to read the Shawnee Valley series.",
