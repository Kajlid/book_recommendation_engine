  "description": "Shy Brookes is in a world of hurt. Attempting to rescue the handsome man she discovered her fellow scientists were hoping to use as a live specimen, Shy finds herself locked up and tortured in a cell of her own. When a team of mercenaries tears through the facility and effectively rescues her, Shy assumes her problems are over. Wrong! The team of Skin Walkers insist that she belongs to the handsome prisoner she’d attempted to free. Claiming she carries the man’s scent, the Walkers are determined to return her to her mate. Leto Reigns doesn’t know who’s to blame for his captivity at the Megalya labs, but he’s certain Shy has played a role. She’s admitted to being an employee of the facility that hunts and experiments on his kind…Skin Walkers. His plan is to snap her pretty little neck the first chance he gets, but first he’s determined to find out why she carries his scent. He’ll have to control his temper and his disconcerting attraction to the auburn haired beauty to get his answers, if she’d stop running from him long enough to allow him to get close.",
