But following a senseless act of violence, one man travels north, toward forgotten lands. Is it possible for a loving husband and father, surrounded by reminders of mankind's impending extinction, to reclaim what he lost?A Different Alchemy is the tale of a man realizing that everyone has their own pain and their own way of dealing with it. It is the story of how one father's loss can mirror an entire society's sorrow. It is also a lesson about the importance of forgiveness.",
