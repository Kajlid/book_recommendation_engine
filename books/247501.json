  "description": "The seer says I'm destined for a wolf shifter called Darius… Personally, I think Ebony has had too much vodka again. She says I've now started a Were war due to my date with a shifter from a different pack. Just as I admit to myself that I like Darius, I find my Red Riding Hood fantasies are going to have to wait — because he's not talking to me. Am I only interested because he's playing hard to get? Do I like the chase? To take my mind off things, I start dating a cute human guy — and then there were three. Of Darius, Jett, and Seth. Who will I hate, date, or mate? Welcome to Withernsea and the Supernatural Dating Agency, for readers of Michelle Rowen, Gerry Bartlett and Michele Bardsley who like their humour to have them howling.",
