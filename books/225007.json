  "description": "'Past events can be changed but one must be careful of how one does it because it'll impact on the rest of one's life.'--DÃ¡ire Quin, Modify your Destiny if you Must, 2003The shimmering man stood in front of me all celestial-like. Heatless sparks illuminated the area around, but strangely not his face. I couldn't see his face. He came forwards--no, he floated forwards--as I, still clutching the steering wheel of my crashed car, watched. Julie Compton has her whole life ahead of her. Flourishing business and now a new boyfriend. Life is good. Really, really good. But on a dank winter's evening, on the way to a business meeting her car came off the road and plunged into a tree--its branch pierced the window screen and impaled her to her seat. Julie should be dead. But destiny had been travelling in the wrong direction for Julie. She doesn't know it yet, but she must relive monumental moments from her past to knock it back on course. If she doesn't succeed, as the celestial body said she must, she will die.Grab your copy of this brand new novel while it's still only 99c and start reading this electrifying time travel book!
