  "description": "GHOST WHISPERER MEETS MEDIUM.THE ONLY WAY FOR ANGELA TO FIND PEACE IS TO FIND IT FOR THE GHOSTS WHO HAUNT HER.I have a secret. I see dead people. And they're everywhere.When my mother died, I wished for just five more minutes with her, but I meant her ALIVE , not her GHOST . Apparently, the Universe has a sense of humor.As if I don't already have enough going on in my life. Teenage daughter drama. Hot flashes. Maybe a mood swing or two which can be bad news with a teenage daughter.Speaking of the drama queen, I'm not sure what's worse, her, or the fact that when my mother died, she opened a portal between me and the other side, and now I see my mom's spirit and the spirits of just about everyone else .Maybe actually everyone else.These ghosts aren't your run of the mill, harmless, light-flickering, chair-moving kind. Nope, they're here because they're stuck earthbound, and guess what? It''s my job to unstick them and cross them over to the other side. As if I know how to do that.I'm totally out of my comfort zone.Don't get me wrong, I'm glad my mother's still here, but I know she's got unfinished business too. She's as much as said so. Sure, I'd love her to stick around forever, but that's not fair to her. But that unfinished business? She can't cross over until I help her with it.Only she won't tell me what's going on. So, here I am, ghost whispering my way through the start of menopause while trying to solve the puzzle of my mom's unfinished business. If that's even possible.",
