  "description": "Wilhelm Busch (1832-1908), endowed with an equipotent facility with sketch-pad and rhyming dictionary, created some of the most arresting sketches and drollest verses the world has yet seen.In addition to the title piece, this book reprints “Ker and Plunk” (Plisch und Plum), “The Egghead and the Two Cut-ups of Corinth” (Diogenes and die bösen Buben von Korinth), “The Raven-robbin’ Rascals” (Das Rabennest), “Deceitful Henry” (Der hinterlistige Heinrich), “The Boy and the Popgun” (Das Pusterrohr), “Ice-Peter” (Der Eispeter), “The Boy and the Pipe” (Krischan mit der Piepe), “Firm Faith” (Fester Glauben), “The Two Ducks and the Frog” (Die beiden Enten und der Frosch), and “Cat and Mouse” (Katze und Maus).By turns malevolent, jovial, sardonic, diabolical, and bloodthirsty, these verses tellingly castigate hypocrisy, stodginess, stupidity, egotism, drunkenness, and other human foibles. The English translations, printed opposite the original German, are ingenious and faithful, with spice and sense both intact.",
