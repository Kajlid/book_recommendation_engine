Alan fell to his knees.And after that surprise, another followed.

Before they set out Prince Charlie took a small silver dirk from the cuff of his coat and handed it to Alan. “A remembrance from me.”Guiding the Prince to safety was only the first of many unexpected and sometimes terrifying events that led Alan Macrae far from home. Across the Scottish and English countryside and finally to London, he associated with criminals and royalty, noblemen and spies.Great historical fiction for young adults from Beebliome Books! www.beebliome.com",
