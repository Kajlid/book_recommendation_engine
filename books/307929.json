  "description": "Erotic, edifying, and divinely inspired, FOUR FUN, is anything but a typical polyamorous romance. As the sexually versed Gavin and Natalie plan to move south in their built-out Mercedes Sprinter for the winter, they realize their fickle lifestyle is burning them and their relationship out. On the flip side of town, the empty-nesters, Scott and Carrie, are struggling to make their love-making fulfilling despite near perfection in every other aspect of their lives. When the two couples meet, they realize they have more than enough to offer one another both in and out of the bedroom.",
