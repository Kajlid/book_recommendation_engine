  "description": "Symone Holmes is an 18-year-old high school graduate about to embark on a new life venture as a college freshman. Being a successful entrepreneur and a gifted athlete, one would think her transition would be smoother than most. However, when it is revealed that she is a lesbian, the path she had chosen to walk becomes littered with obstacles she had not anticipated. Now, standing alone, Symone turns to her faith to help unmask the truth in allowing all to see that love, in any form, is love. \"I am Your Sister\" also depicts the fractured relationship between Symone and her parents and how her loss of an old love gives way to her finding her true love.",
