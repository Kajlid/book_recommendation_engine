When Miranda Cotton gets home from work to find her new boyfriend, Brendan, reading her diary, she breaks off the relationship and throws him out of her flat. Getting Brendan out of her life, however, is not as easy. Two weeks later, her sister, Kerry, phones her in ecstasy—she's in love. Her new boyfriend is named Brendan. Brendan is back in Miranda's life—with a vengeance. But why has he done this? And what does he want from her?
