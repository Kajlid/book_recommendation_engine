  "description": "British badboy billionaire, Callum Kensington’s best friend was dying. Richard von Berg’s last wish was for Callum to take care and marry his sister to protect her from money-grabbing men. Willingly, Callum agreed to marry secretly and become Stella’s conservator until she was at the age of twenty-six. Heiress Stella von Berg moved to London and started her new life at the age of twenty-one. For years, she harbored a crush on Callum, but he kept his distance and treated her like a child. For three years, she and her fake husband see each other once or twice a year. He lived his life and she did hers. But when his family started to demand Callum take a wife, he had no choice but to present Stella as his scapegoat. After a week together in his family estate, will Callum see his wife in a different light?",
