  "description": "(Though part of the Enduring Kiss Series, this book can be read by itself.) Lonely and more than a little depressed, Sean finds himself in a small town bar, drinking his sorrows away, knowing the woman he loves will be married the next day to her true mate. When he meets Sarah, they are both surprised at the intense attraction they share. The night is filled with a passion neither can forget, and Sean becomes confused as to why he's falling for another woman he cannot have. Sarah is human after all, and it's impossible for her to be his mate. One night is all they'll have. Rogue wolves threaten the small ocean-side town Sean loves, and it's his job to fix the problem. Things don't work as planned, and he's summoned home only to find his worst nightmare. A death of a loved one, brings Sean to his lowest, but when Sarah shows up, he's surprised to find she's not as human as he thought. Grief and betrayal bring the two lovers back together, though their secretive pasts follow, trying to push them further apart. Sarah must learn to trust Sean, and embrace her true spirit, or Sean may not win the fight against his own demons.",
