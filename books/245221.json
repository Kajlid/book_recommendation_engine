  "description": "I swore off women years ago. I’m better off alone. Until the gorgeous single mom walks into my bar and changes everything. Everyone thought I was next in line to lead The Untouchables MC. That is, until a tragic accident takes my heart out of the game. I decided life was simpler on my own. Well, other than the strays I take in. I have a scruffy dog and two cats. I even had a teenage runaway under my roof before she up and married an FBI agent. But that’s another story. Now I’m all alone, running the biker bar I own and love. Hell, if the Mason Jar was a person, I’d marry it. When the gorgeous girl walks into my bar looking for a job, I’m inclined to say no. Not because I don’t want her around. \nBecause I do.\n She’s been hurt but she’s still kind. She’s a good mom even though they’ve been through hard times. And she’s so beautiful she takes my breath away. She’s not put off by my gruff exterior either. She doesn’t judge me or the leather I wear. And her kid has me wrapped around her little finger. But is that enough to get her into my bed? After years alone, I’m ready to dust myself off and try again. But it’s more than just sex. She makes me believe in miracles. Now I’m just praying for the biggest miracle of all.",
