  "description": "In the decades following the Conflagration of 2058, the seed-cities of Granite and Haven are locked in constant conflict for power and resources amid the wastes of former Washington State.Granite, which is ruled by a fanatical Pontifex, is the home of fierce religious warriors who crucify their enemies, who practice bloody public rituals, and who eat their own dead.In the technocratic dystopia of Haven, Director Enslann’s control is absolute. Its citizens are slaves in all but name, and those without sufficient merit are summarily recycled in the city’s reclamation tanks.Haven is also the home of Sethric Chun. Having lived his life in a city where even his thoughts are monitored, he yearns for dignity and freedom.With a single attempt at sabotage, Sethric defies a dictator and begins an adventure that leads him into the irradiated ruins of Seattle. There, where nightmarish storms rage, he meets two siblings who offer him a better life in an obscure settlement called Summerhill. But Enslann, also, has learned of Summerhill. He covets its geothermal energy and his armies are close behind.Sethric must join with this new community against apparently impossible odds. Even if Summerhill survives, the struggle for liberty must lead Sethric back to Haven to meet the full onslaught of Enslann’s power in a final battle for the region’s future.",
