  "description": "An Elder ArchAngel of the Host was given a Mission. Changing the world, while changing the lives of those who could do the impossible. But the rub: the ArchAngel Chamuel could only use Choice to fail or succeed. The world desperately needed clean, renewable energy. Benjamin Reeves created a way to achieve this feat, but with him, it was only fiction. On the opposite side of the country, Gwendolyn Murphy saw a way for this impossibility to become reality as well. For her, it was a matter of Theoretical Physics, which she was the foremost expert in the world. Two people, worlds apart, both with pasts rife with loss and pain, are given Choices to change the world, or to change their own lives. And had they not Chosen the way that they had, the Earth's future would have suffered for it. As would their own lives. And so begins the seemingly separate stories that will make up \"The ArchAngel Missions.\"",
