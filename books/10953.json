  "description": "The setting of Anne Morrow Lindbergh's most widely praised book is the seashore; the time, a brief vacation which had lifted her from the distractions of everyday existence into the sphere of meditation. As the sea tosses up its gifts- shells rare and perfect- so the mind, left to its own ponderings, brings up its own treasures of the deep. Read this wonderful book and find your own treasures!",
