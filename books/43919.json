  "description": "One sexy wolf is determined to show a grouchy kitty just how perfect they are for each other.Oscar Travis has always been different, and not just because he’s a snow leopard shifter. Petite and pretty in a family where even the women are bigger and stronger than he is, Oscar has been protected by them except the times when no one could keep him safe. When he had to take another shifter’s life to protect his own family, Oscar’s world became a scarier place, at least in his head, not that he’s going to let his family know that. He will, however, help his dad Henry hunt down the cougar shifter who is trying to destroy one of Oscar’s own, his brother in law, Lyndon.Which is why Oscar finds himself in San Antonio. Curiosity-always Oscar’s potential downfall-is the reason he’s in one of the city’s biggest gay nightclubs. And it’s his bad luck that he is cornered by four obnoxious shifters who are out to ruin his night. Josiah Baker has other plans for Oscar, plans of mates and forever, but once he makes sure his kitten is safe, he’s ditched like a two dollar whore. Good thing he’s a shifter too, and a determined one who doesn’t shy away from Oscar’s attitude. He sees the hurting man behind the pretty façade, and no one is going to keep him and Oscar from the happy ending they deserve.Unless the cougar shifter Oscar was hunting has anything to say about it. Then Oscar and Josiah’s ending will be painful and in the immediate future.Reader Advisory: This book is part of a series and is best read in sequence.",
