  "title": "Betty Bee's Attitude: With Mortimer, Millie and Maude Mouse",
  "description": "Betty Bee makes her home in sunny meadows of black-eyed susans and daisies—not too far from the clear blue pond and frogs with the lazies. Betty is filled with joy, love, and kindness and lots of gratitude. Betty has the perfect “Bee Attitude.” She considers this special Bee Attitude a gift from God above. She is ever mindful of those around her who need some extra love. Follow Betty Bee as she encourages those she meets along the way and how they too can have a “Bee Attitude” and then in turn share that with others. In this first book in a series of eight, Betty Bee encounters three little church mice—Mortimer, Millie, and Maude—who are poor in spirit. Read along to see what has caused this to happen and if Betty can help them get their spirit back! This is the first book in the Betty Bee’s Attitude series.",
