  "description": "Solomon Alexander is a tortured soul. Since being forced to drink from Avery Ferrand, a blood jewel, all he can do is think of her. He’s addicted to this girl he helped rescue but not in a way anyone would anticipate. He lies to everyone around him–denying his desire for her–so he may prevent his family from learning the truth. He loves her. But the feeling isn’t mutual. Avery fears and despises Sol so he makes the ultimate sacrifice–to walk away from everything. Including Avery. He wants to give her the peace she deserves after the horror she’s experienced so he couldn’t be more shocked by her proposal after he announces his departure. Will he do the right thing and proceed with his plan or will he give in to his desires and accept her offer?",
