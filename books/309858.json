  "description": "Lucius Bedeau existed and served because of his dedication to duty and honor. He had once served a King of France, but now he served mankind. He used the skills he had once acquired as place guard to assist his Sire with whatever was needed. When his Sire makes a request, Lucius does as he is asked. Unfortunately, doing so pulls Lucius and the Brethren into the mysterious disappearance of the local mayor. Now, it’s up to Lucius to meet the detective on the case and steer her away from discovering the connection between the Brethren and the case she’s attempting to solve. What he discovers upon seeing her for the first time is that she is his promised mate. How was he to make this work with so much between them? Cindy Parker came from a family that had dedicated themselves to law enforcement. She saw it as her duty to serve and protect the citizenry of Caddo Parish. When she is given the lead detective role on the case of the missing mayor, she is justifiably excited. As she investigates, she comes across a puzzling inconsistency involving one Lucius Bedeau. From the first time she meets him, she is drawn to him. As they get to know each other, Lucius tells her an unbelievable story; however, she knows it’s true as she can sense lies. He tells her she is his promised mate and that it is her choice in being with him. Will she choose him . . . after all he said it “if it takes forever, I’ll wait forever.”",
