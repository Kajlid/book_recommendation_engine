  "description": "One little party turned my world upside down.After I challenged the Blood Council's four shifter heirs at a college party, the last thing I expected was to receive a full scholarship and an admittance letter from the exclusive Wolf Moon Academy.Despite never desiring to be an alpha, this was an opportunity of a lifetime… or so I thought.I soon learned that there was more behind my admission to the Academy than my education. I was there to be a lesson to the heirs -- in particular, the sexiest and strongest one, Liam Hale.As if that wasn’t bad enough, it turns out that he is my true mate. A fact that should be treasured, but he makes it clear that we will never be together.However, things aren’t always what they seem, and we all have secrets— some bigger than others. When the truth comes out it’ll either set me free or set me up for disaster.",
