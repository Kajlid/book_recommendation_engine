  "description": "Cursed or Blessed? A Man of God Must Make a Choice…Father Greg, a Catholic priest and recovering alcoholic, took a vow of obedience at his ordination—but thirty years later, that Roman collar chafes his neck. His love for God is not in doubt, but the same can’t be said for his faith in the church. After a young interracial couple joins his parish in the small exclusive resort community of James Bay, Michigan, Father Greg finds himself waging a fierce battle fighting parishioners’ prejudices. When an attractive widow from the parish joins hands with him to befriend the young couple, the problems only escalate—and so do the rumors about a romance. Caught up in a war with church leaders and his own guilty conscience, Father Greg is trapped. He’s good at standing up for others, but now he needs to learn how to stand up for himself. It’s the only way he’ll become the man he was always meant to be—with or without the Roman collar.",
