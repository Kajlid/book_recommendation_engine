If they can just keep from killing each other first.Shalini Boland at Goodreads Beautiful writing and great atmosphere make up this wonderful young adult tale. The sibling relationship between Becca and Timmy is superb and the pacing is excellent. For anyone who's into anime/martial arts, there's a treat in store here, but even if you don't know your Kendo from your Jiu jitsu, this is a gem of a story.",
