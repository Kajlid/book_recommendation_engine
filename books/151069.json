  "description": "Lies have the ability to destroy. Deep down, I knew my secret would come out. But I never imagined the damage it would cause. The love of my life, Victoria, suffered from my betrayal, nearly losing our second child. The reality of what I did nearly killed me. Maybe I deserved to go through hell for hiding my secret, but she didn’t. Now she pushes me away, determined not to forgive me for slipping back into my old ways. Little does she know, I’m not letting her go. She loves me. Not only can I see it by the way she looks at me, but I feel it in my soul. We're meant to be and THIS DOM will stop at nothing to prove it. This is book 3 and picks up where book 2 leaves off so be sure to read Dom Fever before reading this book!",
