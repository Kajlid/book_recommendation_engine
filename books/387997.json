  "description": "FIRST AVON BOOKS PRINTING. Dec. 1989 MASS MARKET PAPERBACK, Reginald Hill (Bones and Silence). In “Bring Back the Cat,” a missing feline leads British PI Joe Sixsmith to a shocking discovery in the suburbs. A freak death at a sadistic French military training camp ignites revenge in “The Bull Ring.” In “Auteur Theory,” a marvelous meta-fictional story, author Reginald Hill unleashes his rage when one of his Dalziel and Pascoe mysteries is made into a less-than-stellar movie. “Poor Emma” dashes the expectations of Jane Austen’s heroine after her marriage to Mr. Knightley. A home invasion takes an unexpected twist in “Crowded Hour.” And in the title tale, a Russian inspector turns ghost hunter to solve a puzzling fifty-year-old mystery. - Amazon",
