  "description": "The trouble with riding off into the sunset is that it very quickly goes dark.In this, the second and final part of 'The Written World', Myrah and her only-sometimes-intrepid friends discover that averting wars, surviving demonic encounters and evading the clutches of determinedly genocidal relatives is no guarantee of a simpler, easier life.Ahead of our three reluctant adventurers lie barbarians, pirates and the dark, ineffable power of the Incubus Beast. In pursuit are a rebel army, a great war fleet and a rival horde of murderous wizards. All in all, then, the future looks unlikely to be dull. There will be fire, there will brimstone and there will be occasional bouts of seasickness.Nevertheless, if Myrah, Nev and the mighty Alaethar are ever to uncover the truth about their worryingly obscured histories, then they must press on and find their way to the remote and suitably mysterious Diegesis Gate. But seeking the truth can be a dangerous business; in a world of fantasy, there is only one Ultimate Truth and discovering it can spell the end of everything.'The Endless Land' is the sequel to Rob Gregson's first comic novel, 'Unreliable Histories'.",
