  "title": "The Masks of Odin: Wisdom of the Ancient Norse",
  "description": "Herein the Norse Edda is scrutinized and its tales of gods and heroes, elves and dwarfs are decoded, using theosophical keys, to yield an overview of cosmic cycles of life on the many levels of the World Tree. The myths contain ribald humor as well as grand inspiration. Elsa-Brita Titchenell's commentary and her fresh translation of the principal lays of the Poetic or Elder Edda provide a key to understanding the timeless wisdom of the bards of every land.",
