  "title": "Taming Sheila",
  "description": "Sheila is a woman who knows what she wants, and what she wants is her boyfriend, Tom. In. Every. Way. Possible. The problem is, Tom's late hours at work and seeming lack of interest in her have her questioning everything. Is he committed to her, or is he preparing to jump ship? With her friends getting married and starting families, Sheila can't help feeling left behind. So when Tom won't give her the answers she desperately needs, she launches her own internal investigation. Will she find the peace-of-mind she's been looking for, or will her digging ruin everything they've worked so hard to build?",
