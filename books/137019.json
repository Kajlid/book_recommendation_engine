There are so many different features that figuring out how to integrate that into real business systems is overwhelming.We wrote this book to show small biz owners the ways that we use Infusionsoft in our day to day business. Full of great real world tips and examples, this guide will give you ideas on how to take the power of Infusionsoft and make it work for you!Who is this book for? Small Business Owners and Entrepreneurs Coaches, Speakers and Consultants Professional Services Providers Local Business Owners˃˃˃ What This Book Is NotBecause you may not get to see all the way into the book before purchasing it, we want to make sure you know that there will not be screen captures and line item tutorials included. Infusionsoft has great tutorials available and we feel like other more technical authors will be better at showing you step by step how to implement the concepts we describe in this book.Instead, we are here to let you know what is possible using the software and to at least get you started understanding how to bring the whole database, marketing, website and internet world together in one cohesive system.",
