  "description": "Corinna Chapman is living her dream. She’s left the buttoned-down world of accounting behind—along with a less-than-lovable husband, James—to open a bakery in downtown Melbourne. The neighborhood could be nicer—performing CPR on an unconscious junkie is no way for a baker to start her morning—but the neighbors are something else again. Corinna’s bakery — Earthly Delights — is on the ground floor of a particularly eclectic apartment building, whose occupants promise to make life interesting. Someone’s taken offense to the building's professional dominatrix; poisoned pen letters find their way to all residents; suddenly more heroin addicts seem to overdosing than usual; and then there are the vampires. Someone’s got to get to the bottom of it all, and it might as well be Corinna.",
