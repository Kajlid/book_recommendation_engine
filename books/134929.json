  "description": "Amazing debut by New Jersey based writer/musician Tricia Warden. A collection of over sixty poems, \"Brainlift\" demonstrates Warden's uncanny ability to harmonize her distinctly sinister sense of humor with her disturbing accounts of abuse, violence, misogyny, disillusionment, and despair. Industry Reviews \"Filled with angry poetic rants and honest laments that print a grim picture of American disillusionment....Her best dig far beneath the external experiences and explore her deeply rooted sources of rage.\" \"Warden dares you to impale yourself on her words...Riveting in a horrific way, leaving a thought-provoking if unpleasant emotional residue.\"",
