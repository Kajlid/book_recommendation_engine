  "description": "This won't be a love story. Nobody is trying to tell you something about love. This will be a story about family.Claudio and Mathilde Simone were once romantic bohemians, hopelessly enamored of each other. Now nestled in domesticity in New York, they run a struggling vinyl record store and parent three daughters as best as they can: Natasha, an overachieving prodigy; Lucy, a sensitive girl with a debilitating heart condition; and romantic, adopted Carly, who is quietly fixated on her true origins.As the years put their tight-knit family bonds to the test, the Simones are forced to reckon with mental and physical illness, financial difficulty, and well-kept secrets that threaten to tear them apart. But through all of these ups and downs, they look to their favorite lyrics, to poetry, and to one another for strength.",
