  "description": "Julia has been married to Jim for fifteen years, and admittedly, the thrill is mostly gone. So it's no big surprise that, like so many women in her position, she finds herself thinking a bit too much about the one who got away - in Julia's case, the one in question is Ray, the rugged, impulsive lover of her college years. Now pushing forty, trapped in a job she doesn't care about, growing ever more distant from her son, and fed up with her husband's flirtatiousness with a much younger co-worker, Julia agrees to accompany Ray to a wedding of friends - and the day, somehow, ends with a quick tryst in the guest bathroom. Several weeks later, Julia learns she's pregnant, and because she's also recently slept with Jim - a rare event of late - she can't be quite certain of the baby's paternity. How she attempts to cope with this knotty problem, not to mention how to break the news to her prickly mother, her childless sister, her best friend, her therapist, her husband's family, and the men in her life, is the core of this story.",
