  "description": "I am now in my eighties, surprised at the face that greets me in the mirror each morning. Part of me remains young, always reaching for the child that is still inside me; that child and I still speak every day, but never really touch. Too many years have passed, too many horrors. I want to forget, but I shall not. I remember everything that happened over my lifetime—my teachers, my friends and family. I especially remember those who did not survive the war. Even now, nightmares still awaken me, ghastly faces of the dead choking me from my sleep.Lamb of Legacy is the beautifully honest and haunting true story of Edeltraud Fellendor's childhood in Silesia and adolescent years in Berlin, Germany, where she was raised in the shadow of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, the madness of World War II, and the years that followed. She survives today through the grace of God, and is determined to finally share her story before everything is forgotten—before the past is buried and no one remembers the ugliness of a world at war and what it means to be a German girl, a sacrificial Lamb that innocently carried on Hitler's Legacy.",
