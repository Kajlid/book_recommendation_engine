  "description": "The Necronomicon. Cthulu, The Unnamable. The cursed town of Arkham. These icons of horror sprang from the imagination of H. P. Lovecraft. But consider this: what if the imaginary terrors that Lovecraft wrote about were not imaginary at all? In the original graphic novel LOVECRAFT (Vertigo; Publication Date: March 1, 2004), screenwriter Hans Rodionoff (The Hollow), comics legend Keith Giffen, and acclaimed Argentinean artist Enrique Breccia follow the life of Howard Phillips Lovecraft from his bizarre childhood (where his mother dressed him as a girl) to the dissolution of his marriage. Lovecraft comes to believe that he is the guardian of the Necronomicon, the accursed book that is the doorway to the beyond. Was he insane? Or was he a hero? LOVECRAFT is a 144-page VERTIGO original hardcover graphic novel and is suggested for mature readers.",
