  "title": "The House of Strife",
  "description": "In mortal peril as a plagiarist, Ferdinand Wildblood, the impecunious poet of London Lyrics and the schizophrenic author of such best-sellers as Sirens of a Savage Shore, flees to New Zealand, the setting for his penny-dreadful prose. The South Sea ceases to be a lucrative London daydream; it is soon seething unromantically with troops and armed tribesman. The year is 1845 and Queen Victoria has just annexed the land, leaving Maori dangerously divided over the presence of the Union Jack. Enter the eloquent flagstaff-feller John Heke, the most handsome and Christian rebel with whom Britons ever feuded - though it is actually the old and bold pagan Kawiti, alias the Duke, who is the true warrior of the piece. Here is George Phillpotts, the monocled and wastrel son of the Bishop of Exeter, proving both buffoon and hero as skirmishes give way to battles, and battles to war. Here is the earnestly martial Major Cyprian Bridge trying to make sense of this vocation, of his confusingly civil foe, of his imbecilic superiors. Here is Reverend Williams trying to defend the virtue of his luscious Maori ward Angela against the blandishments of our amorous scribe. In the three-way war, rebels, counter-rebels, and soldiers of the Queen (‘the red tribe’) swim out of history to swarm on the page: there has never been a war like it, in life or in literature.In this magnificent novel, the third in his triumphant New Zealand Wars trilogy, Maurice Shadbolt orchestrates it all ‒ the historical detective work, the marvellous characterisation, the sweep and energy of the narrative, and, most memorably, the delicious wit ‒ with the cool hand of a maestro. Readers of his epic Season of the Jew and Monday’s Warriors will not be disappointed.",
