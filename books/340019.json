  "title": "The Many Misfortunes of Eugenia Wang",
  "description": "An upper MG graphic novel by debut author-illustrator Stan Yan pitched as Turning Red meets Goosebumps. Eugenia's party has never been celebrated on her actual birthday, April 4th, because of Mom’s belief in the Chinese superstition that 4 is an unlucky number, which Eugenia thinks is so ridiculous. But when she starts getting visions through her comic artwork of impending doom on 4/4, she’ll have to figure out what’s going on and maybe do something truly horrifying — admit Mom is right. Publication is set for September, 30 2025.",
