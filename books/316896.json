  "title": "The Adventures of Sissy Dog: In the Chicken Coop: A Rhyming Children's Series",
  "description": "Michelle & Ethan had to go to school today, leaving Sissy dog all alone on the farm. Her boredom feeds her curiosity for a day in the chicken coop. She knows that playing in the coop is forbidden, but she really wants to have a good time with the chickens. Unfortunately, I don't think they're up for fun and games.This book has a rhyme on every page, which is catchy for young children and enables memory through phonics. Phonics is a method of teaching people to read by correlating sounds with letters or groups of letters in an alphabetic writing system. Teaching phonics and rhyming to a child develops their phonological awareness skills â€“ which play an important part of becoming a good reader.",
