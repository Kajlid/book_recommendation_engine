  "description": "Stephen Cummings has been on the Australian music scene for decades after first achieving success as lead singer with The Sports in the mid 1970s. He has remained in the spotlight ever since with a high-flying solo career. Since his earliest days, Cummings has carved out a niche as an original, idiosyncratic performer, a producer of milestone albums, and a writer of fine, intelligent songs. In this entertaining memoir, Cummings relates anecdotes and stories from throughout his life, including his memories of traipsing the streets of Melbourne looking for life and music; of being humiliated in front of Mick Jagger in New York; of getting older and developing back problems; of the internal politics of rock bands; of his longstanding enemy, Michael Gudinski, and their Niagara Falls incident; and of becoming a parent and understanding his own parents. Filled with wit and affection, this is a funny, insightful, and thought-provoking look at love, family, and music.",
