  "title": "Brave New World",
  "description": "\"The greater a man's talents, the greater his power to lead astray.\"This prescient novel describes a future in which an \"ideal\" society has come to pass, controlled by a variety of forces, including genetic engineering, indoctrination, and drugs. Seemingly alone in his skepticism, the 'Alpha Plus' psychologist Bernard Marx begins to voice critical opinions about this brave new world....Alders Huxley's skillful prose coolly depicts a world in which spontaneous human desires and emotions have been overwritten by psychically anesthetizing public mantras -- \"everyone belongs to everyone else,\" \"everybody's happy nowadays.\" His brilliantly realized vision of a bland yet menacing dystopia sounded a bleak warning during the inter-war years of 1930s Britain, and resonates as much today as it did on its original publication.",
