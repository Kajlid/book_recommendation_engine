  "description": "What’s it like growing up in a town founded by inventors? On Saturdays, the adults open the doors of the Invent-o-Drome and give local children free rein to create whatever gadgets they can think up. Hypno-Goggles, a Rocket Chair, a homework-eating robo-dog – the can-do kids of Marveltown are never at a loss for ideas. But when an unfortunate short circuit causes a group of giant robot workers to go berserk – and the adults flee for their lives – are the kids ready to put their know-how to the test? In his first book for children, veteran illustrator Bruce McCall has crafted a tale of ingenuity and mayhem with pictures that pop with retro charm and crackerjack wit.",
