  "title": "The Avoidable Orphan: Can saving one small elephant help mend and unite a grieving family?",
  "description": "Recently widowed Rodger de Jonge is losing his bond with his daughters. He’s a man of the African bush, and coping with ‘girlie feelings’ was always Helene’s department, not his. When an orphaned baby elephant is found, Rodger sees an opportunity that might help him reconnect with his children. But interfering with the orphan goes against his usual conservation methods. It will require a new approach to save both the baby and his family.",
