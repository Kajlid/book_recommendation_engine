  "description": "Based on an anonymous tip, US Diplomatic Security Agent Maggie Spencer apprehends an internationally most-wanted fugitive, Nicholas Janssen. Then US marshal Rob Dunnemore turns up asking some very tough questions. Maggie has no reason to trust Rob, especially when she learns he has a personal interest: he was almost killed thanks to Janssen. Then Maggie and Rob discover the body of an American diplomat, and they realize there’s another killer on the loose. Determined to tie up the case, Maggie heads to upstate New York following a questionable lead. Knowing she’s holding back on him, Rob’s right on her tail. And now she has no choice but to trust him. Because a trap has been set, and they have both walked right into it. Originally published in 2004",
