  "description": "I should have known this would happen...  Nothing about my fraternity was ever simple. Parties, tequila – tons of tequila – and wild souvenirs from our kind of crazy.  Never, and I do mean never, did I expect my brother’s girl to target me in a midnight prank. A prank that backfired and left me squealing in pain.  Have you ever seen those shows, the ones that say the “dirty deed” sent you to the ER? Well, I went to the ER, and yes, my manhood was involved. Let me just say I gained absolutely no pleasure from it. Unless, of course, you consider that sweet nurse who treated me.  The problem? She hated me…and I had no idea why, but I wasn’t willing to let her walk away until I figured it out.  Emelie was feisty, and I’d never felt the type of excitement I did after spending only five seconds in her line of fire. I was gonna enjoy this...way more than I should, and I knew it.  She saw, she conquered, and I was defeated. All it took was just one touch, and oh, what a ride it was.",
