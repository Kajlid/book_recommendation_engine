  "description": "(Alternate cover edition of ASIN B00KMDDDMM.) Men suck. They break you. Leave you. Take everything until there’s nothing left. And frankly, I’m done allowing them to make me feel insignificant. So, forget men. I’ll just throw myself into my job, because at least that never fails me. Jackson has other plans, though. I refuse to be impressed by his perfect body, the cute dimple on his cheek, or the rugged stubble on his face. Jackson Cole can be resisted. But, I’m only fooling myself. He’s going to wear me down. I can feel it. In the end he’ll prove that once again, I’m no one’s beloved.",
