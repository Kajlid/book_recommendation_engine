  "description": "Kerry Stephens is beyond excited. The job promotion with the cable company came through taking her out of the office in into the field. She needs this job and didn’t know how much more she could stomach her current boss. Anything has to be better than working for him, right? So much for wishful thinking.  The Bowen family is buying the floundering cable company and they want Kerry to help clean house. The problem? Kerry doesn’t want to talk. She may not be happy there under the current conditions, but she isn’t going to be responsible for anyone losing their job. She doesn’t need any more problems than she already has.  Reed’s new house is understaffed and the only furniture that’s arrived so far is a bedroom set. The last thing he expected is to find his mate so soon after coming back home. Reed is ready to settle down and is ecstatic to find her, he just doesn’t understand why Kerry isn’t.  Kerry’s entire life she has never had anyone to love her and trust doesn’t come easy for her. Daily threats from her step-sister’s boyfriend don’t help.  When things get heated will Reed be able to intervene? And when push comes to shove can the family stay together, or will a devastating blow drive the family apart forever? Find out in the final installment of the Bowen Boys―Reed",
