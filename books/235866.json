  "description": "“I’m pregnant.”But this baby bombshell is nothing compared to Adoni’s scandalous solution! A positive pregnancy test isn’t the only reminder Alice has of her one scorching night with Adoni Petrakis. As she defiantly tells him the news, memories of his skilled touch overwhelm her! The contract he draws up—to claim her, and his child—is utterly shocking. As is her realization that she’s still powerfully, inescapably, in thrall to this vengeful Greek!",
