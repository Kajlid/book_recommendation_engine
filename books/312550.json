  "description": "Run or die. It was a simple decision. Reyna had no choice but to escape her life and start somewhere new. A place where she’d finally feel safe. She fled, plunging straight into the depths of the unknown with only a hope she would land safely. She never would have expected to land straight into Everett’s arms. Fight or flight. It was instinct. \t\tEverett was ordered to flee, but it was his instinct to fight. His DEA team was being hunted and taken out one by one. Now, there were only two left and his boss ordered him to take leave. A few weeks on the beach of his hometown didn’t exactly sound like paradise, especially not with a killer on the loose. He vowed he’d find who was taking out his team, even if it defied orders. He’d fight. He didn’t find peace on the beach. He found Reyna. A woman on the run. His family took her under their wing, but he wasn’t so quick to trust the woman with a boat-full of secrets. A gorgeous roommate that surprised him at every turn was the last thing he needed. It was impossible for them to deny the sparks igniting between them. As they get lost in their passion, a killer lurks waiting to strike and take everything away.",
