She’s falling for a co-worker, Nathan Gould and she’s wracked with guilt about it. Just as things seem to be coming together with Nate, Elsa discovers something through her work as a sleep and dream researcher that leads her to believe she’s found the person who stole her son from her. Things escalates quickly to possibly disastrous consequences for Elsa and Nate. Fiction > Science Fiction >Futuristic",
