My new neighbor was older, gorgeous, and the Irish accent had me swooning. And no matter what, he was always there for me, but only as a friend.The day I walked out of his life without a trace . . .

And with each passing moment, I know one thing for certain--the truth always comes out, and once it does, there'll be no turning back.The billionaire Irish McGregor family returns in this hot friends-to-lovers romantic suspense.",
