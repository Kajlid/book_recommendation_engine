  "description": "Not every hero is lucky enough to be born a mutant, wizard, or demi-god.Five years ago Samantha Hathawayâ€™s archaeologist parents died while saving the world and she left her life in the secret world of magic, monsters, and mad scientists behind for the quiet simplicity of suburbia. But now, at age fourteen, the world class couch potato finds out she has inherited a spot at the brand new Miller's Grove Academy, a school designed to train a wide range of the best and brightest teens into the leaders of the 21st Century.Instead of the usual cliques of geeks, nerds, jocks, and cheerleaders she was prepared to deal with in high school, Sam finds herself the least talented student in a school full of video game champions, eccentric inventors, monster hunters, pop stars, and wannabe world emperors.As if things weren't bad enough she is framed for the theft of a powerful magical artifact that could spark a war between the forces of science and magic. With both sides gearing up for battle it is up to Sam and her new friends to find the real thief, prevent a war, and confront the most powerful sorcerer in history.Worst. Freshman Year. Ever.",
