  "title": "The Legacy of Conquest: The Unbroken Past of the American West",
  "description": "The 'settling' of the American West has been perceived throughout the world as a series of quaint, violent, and romantic adventures–most with happy endings–and a process that came to an end with the 'closing' of the frontier in the 1890s. But in fact, Patricia Nelson Limerick argues, the West has a history grounded in primary economic reality; in hardheaded questions of profit, loss, competition, and consolidation. In The Legacy of Conquest, she interprets the stories and the characters in a new way: the trappers, traders, Indians, farmers, oilmen, cowboys, and sheriffs of the Old West \"meant business\" in more ways than one, and their descendents mean business today.\"Written with extraordinary grace and understanding…[this book] returns the Western American past to the mainstream of national history. …Most important of all is her eloquent plea for Westerners, whether Anglo, Hispanic, Indian, Asian, or black, to see the West as a shared place, a splendid whole which each has helped create.\" -- Howard R.
