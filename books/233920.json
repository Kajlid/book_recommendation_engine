  "title": "It Can Happen Here",
  "description": "This is the book that has become a cult hit. The breath-taking revelations center on a young boy's opposition to authoritarianism and his subsequent struggle against it to foment rebellion. It is written in the ground-breaking new style of an alternate history book within a police state. The teenager lives in a world where infants are numbered as soon as they are born. The numbers are used to track and control everyone from cradle to grave, and to expropriate them continuously. The bloated government brainwashes each child for more than a decade. Small children are trained to perform bizarre rituals en masse and on command. The indoctrination is so intense that adults continue to perform in a knee-jerk manner on cue for their entire lives. A frightening book written for frightening times. A tale about the fragility of freedom, it is an alarming, eerily timeless look at how fascism could take hold in America. It juxtaposes sharp political satire with the chillingly realistic rise of authoritarianism. It is a shockingly prescient novel in terms that are as fresh and contemporary as todayâ€™s news. With references to actual historical events and people, the book will have readers wondering which parts are true and which parts aren't. It debunks Sinclair Lewis' book \"It Can't Happen Here.\" \"Do you dare peek inside the twisted noggin of researcher Dr. Rex Curry? The author Todd Conroy lifts the doctor's lid. A glimpse will change you forever. When you are done exploring, will your life return to boring?\" - Tumbling Pebble Magazine",
