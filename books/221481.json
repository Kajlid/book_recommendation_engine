  "description": "Vampire Games ~ No one gets out alive! A ruler short of a kingdom... It's the holidays, and Anna needs a client. Maybe they can help each other out.  Years ago, Dracula encountered his blood mate captured and bound. By rescuing her, a price was placed on his head. In exchange for her life, he endured unspeakable torture. Stripped of his titles, he goes by his given name: Victor Rawlings.  Banished from the realm, Victor is sentenced to bide his time in Lake Tahoe, playing the part of a mortal. Decades later, he's a successful VP complete with a type-A personality. As the last virile imperial vampire, if he claims a blood mate before the Hunter Moon, his lands and titles will be reinstated. British, wealthy, royal, and undead, the King of the vampires is in need of a Queen.  When Vic gets a load of a blue-eyed vixen up for auction at a masquerade fundraiser he's done waiting.  Anna Ibarra's party planning biz is in the red. Desperate doesn't cover her mindset. When her best friend serves up a half-baked plan to save the day, she jumps at the chance.  She's back on track, except for a few details... Nothing major, if Anna can get over payback involves a charity auction and she's the prize. How bad can it be for the return on Anna's investment?  Mmm, the type that leaves bite-marks. Victor places the winning bid and things go from crazy-ha-ha to crazy-hot in a heartbeat!",
