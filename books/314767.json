  "description": "When I left the love of my life asleep in my bed ten years ago without a backward glance, I never thought I’d get another chance.I thought there was only one thing I needed to make me happy. I was so sure becoming a rock star would heal the dark corners inside me. But every time I walk onto the stage, with a roaring crowd screaming my name, all I can think about is the boy I left behind. All I want to do is rewind and make a different choice. I’ve sang a hundred songs about love and loss, and Jace has been at the center of it all.The last place I ever expected to run into him again is the cabin in the woods where we first fell in love. I’d do anything for a second chance, but will he ever trust me again?***Face the Music is the first book in the Replay series. Each book in the series will focus on a different band member getting a second chance at love. Each book can be read as a stand-alone. This book contains descriptions of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and sexy times.",
