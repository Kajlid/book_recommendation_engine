  "description": "Amelia Riding--young, vibrant, haughty, and known throughout the land for her pampered wealth as well as her lush beauty--holds the captivation and adoration of all.But there is one man who wants nothing to do with her: Tim Woodman.Coarse, crude, a recluse by nature, Tim is a hard man with an iron will, and he uses that will to dominate and command those around him. He has no interest dealing with a haughty, insolent brat of a girl like Amelia Riding.Until one night, Tim Woodman saves Amelia’s life--and uncovers her strong, but buried, submissive nature. Tim will need all his patience and skill if he is to lay her submissive spirit bare. To do that, he must first tame Miss Riding’s unruly ways.So begins their dark and sordid relationship as Master and Pet.Tim has a lot to learn his new pet: the true power of her submission, the dark ecstasy of obedience and surrender.But winter is harsh in their cold and bleak land, and predators lurk in every shadow. For some, Amelia’s hot-blooded body and ethereal beauty would be the sweetest prey of all…Warning: Contains graphic sex, BDSM, anal sex, and heavy submission.",
