  "description": "Have you been left pining away for the likes of Godzilla or the Loch Ness Monster? Do you love rivers? Do tugboats make you smile? Then read on! The tugboat business on the Columbia River eats fools for breakfast. River dragons prefer cattle and fish. According to Mack McNaughton, the hero of this tale, his uncle Chauncey Winston, the villain, may qualify as a megalomaniac, but not as a cow or a carp. Therefore, he ought to be safe enough from the local resident river dragon. The river dragon, however, may beg to differ. Chauncey controls the family business, Winston Tug and Barge. And his dreams of glory include a plan to transform the business from a regional player into an international one. Before time runs out. Mack, however, holds the key to saving the company. The key? Nothing less than the ultimate fate of a dilapidated houseboat, Enoch's Folly. However, Chanzilla, the river dragon in this story, has another agenda in mind. Blending the traditions of John Jakes and Terry Pratchett, Godzilla and the Loch Ness monster, Enoch's Folly brews up both an enthralling family saga and a delightful satire, weaving an unforgettable tapestry of ambition, magic, violence, and love. If this sort of an urban-fantasy romp appeals to you, then snag a copy of Enoch's Folly right away, because nothing beats a family saga featuring a river dragon.",
