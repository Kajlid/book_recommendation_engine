  "title": "Mr. Robert's Bones",
  "description": "In a mid-city neighborhood full of quirky characters, three kids’ quest for hidden silver in an abandoned house pits them against long-forgotten ghosts with their own agenda and the house’s dark memories of racism, loss, and betrayal. The quest for the silver is especially nerve-racking for Annie, the kid who actually sees the ghosts, both of her deceased mother and of the bygone denizens of the house. Her friends want to believe her but can’t, and she herself is torn between running away from it all and following the ghosts into the house’s dark history. Written by a Ph.D. holder in English Literature, Mr. Robert’s Bones is richly layered beginning to end in meanings and literary qualities that fuse into the compelling flow of the plot.",
