The notoriously graceless baronet isn't impressed by good looks, or fooled by false charm. He's sure Robin is a liar—a fortune hunter, a card sharp, and a heartless, greedy fraud—and he'll protect his niece, whatever it takes.Then, just when Hart thinks he has Robin at his mercy, things take a sharp left turn. And as the grumpy baronet and the glib fortune hunter start to understand each other, they also find themselves starting to care—more than either of them thought possible.But Robin's cheated and lied and let people down for money. Can a professional rogue earn an honest happy ever after?",
