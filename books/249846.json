She’s tasked to cover her editor’s favorite spot on the east coast: Hope Lake, PA.

Snow-covered treetops, Christmas lights a plenty, and an adorable town square decorated in all its holiday glory. The minute she sets foot in Hope Lake she is inspired. It also doesn’t hurt that she is charmed by Dr. Maxwell Reese. The stunning, and single, doctor who has settled down in Hope Lake after traveling the globe.
