It focuses on the lighter side of the human condition with poetry of love, hope, strength, faith, and nature. Mostly inspired by his love of nature and the wilderness, his love of the craft of writing, and above all, the love of his wife, Steven A Williams beautifully crafts those emotions into words in this collection that will bring joy, a smile, and a little spot of light to any of your days.",
