  "description": "Dan O'Neill was the most eccentric of the underground comix. His Odd Bodkins strip can possibly be found in two Hear the sound of my feet walking drown the sound of my voice talking, and the collective unconscious of Odd Bodkins. It began as a \"conventional\" newspaper strip syndicated by the Universal Press Syndicate, but the adventures of Fred Bird (the only comic strip character ever declared persona non grata by Britain) and his pointy-headed intellectual friend Hugh were very strange from the beginning. They took part in the infamous Mickey Mouse Vs. the Air Pirates Funnies which was the subject of a successful lawsuit by Disney corporation. United Press dropped the strip in favor of the tamer Doonesbury.",
