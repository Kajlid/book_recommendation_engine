Little do they know they're sharing their house with a sinister squatter that lingers in the fireplace and likes to come out and play when the sun goes down.Financially broke, Molly decides to go public about the ominous presence in the farmhouse, hoping to cash in on the phenomena, never considering the repercussions of her actions.",
