  "description": "Moments after FBI agent Raleigh Harmon arrives at a large rally on Richmond, Virginia's Southside neighborhood, two men plummet from a factory rooftop and lie dead on the sidewalk below. Though over 500 people are at the rally, no one saw what happened. Or are they just not talking? Between pressure from her boss to close the case quickly to avoid racial unrest and her own sense of duty to discover the truth, Raleigh finds herself digging deep into clues that are right underneath her feet. With possible witnesses reluctant to talk and the discovery of chummy connections between supposed enemies, Raleigh knows that this isn't just an ordinary case. Will she find the truth in time? Or will her choices ultimately bring down everyone involved--including Raleigh herself? This first novel from an accomplished journalist and forensic geologist is sure to leave readers guessing until the very end.",
