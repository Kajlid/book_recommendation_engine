  "description": "With an alcoholic brother and a complicated friendship with her best friend's boyfriend, twenty-one-year-old Katie Winters has always used photography as an escape. But when a teacher prompts her to explore the very feelings she's been trying to ignore, Katie finds herself painting three mysterious words under an abandoned I miss you. The feeling is real, but after searching her memory, Katie can't think of anyone who she could have meant. Then Katie meets Robin, an environmental enthusiast familiar to Katie in a way she can't place. His presence plagues her with the feeling that the last time they met, something went horribly wrong. In pursuit of answers, Katie finds herself caught up in a world of secrets, troublemakers, barely-legal schemes, and images of a story that was lost long before her birth.",
