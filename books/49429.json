  "title": "Chief of Thrones",
  "description": "Cameal only wants to feel the touch of a woman’s body against his. He only wants to feel… something, but for the Chief of Thrones—one of heaven’s most powerful Ophanim—any form of earthly desire is against the rules. For thirteen centuries, that rule wasn’t a problem. Then Uriel introduced him to life on earth and that’s when Cam discovered his addiction to women. But his earthly partners never fully sated him and it wasn’t until God delivered his punishment that he fully understood why. It takes finding the raven-haired beauty the angels on earth call “Mary” to make the Chief of Thrones realize what he truly wants. Now he has to decide what he’s willing to sacrifice to finally feel whole. Will he endure excruciating torture to forget her or will he risk their lives to have her?",
