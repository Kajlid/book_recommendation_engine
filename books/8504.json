  "title": "Only If they Could Hear Me Cry: A Personal Reflection of Poverty and Homelessness In America",
  "description": "Across the United States, we have citizens that cannot feed themselves or their children. The Republican politicians have lethargically responded to Americans living in abject conditions, by reducing their benefits and threatening them with joblessness. Republicans seem to be worry about the federal deficit than about the poverty deficit that is leaving many Americans to suffer and die. Across America, politicians are asking Americans for their votes while their children are going to bed hungry at night. Poverty is major concern in the United States, and across the world as the wealthy live in fear from retaliation of people living in poverty. America has treated poor Americans like an unopened bill, afraid to know what it is, therefore, throw it away or attend to it when they can. Poverty and poor conditions exist, and now it is time to tell world governments that we care about everyone in these deplorable conditions and it is the time to answer their call for help. The world has too many governments that misunderstand and miscalculate the conditions of the poor. Poverty destroys everything that psychologically and physically makes a person whole and induces them to commit crime for survival. Author Raymond Sturgis has written another masterpiece that will arouse the conscious of America and the world to pay more attention to the poor and homeless people of this great nation. This book is not to criticize or point fingers; however, it mainly corroborates the lives of people in their realistic ways of life, so we all can understand that we must put an end to poverty and help those in need despite their nationalities.",
