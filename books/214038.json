  "description": "This is the lifeline thrown to Richard Kent, middle-aged, and down on his luck in this standalone spin-off from the main Time Bubble series. Kicked out of his job by his boss, who calls him a dinosaur, henpecked by his wife, and ignored by his kids, nothing is going right for Kent. His waistline is expanding, he considers modern music and television to be rubbish and is feeling morosely nostalgic for a youth he will never see again – or will he?Then, a mysterious benefactor appears in the shape of his young self and offers him six trips to the past. Kent seizes the chance, starting with a journey back to 1984 to buy his first record, kicking off an incredible journey, revisiting key moments from his past. From an unfulfilled teenage crush to seeking revenge on his malevolent boss armed with nothing but a large rubber Brontosaurus, this humorous trip down memory lane will leave you pondering what you would do if offered the same opportunity.Books 7 – 11 in the Time Bubble series take a break from the main plot to explore the lives of some of the side characters from the earlier books. Lighter on the science fiction elements, these stories embrace the essence of the human experience, while continuing to explore the time travel genre in innovative new ways. No prior knowledge of the previous six books is required to enjoy these stories, so indulge yourself today in this delightful and heartfelt novel, crafted with a delicious touch of dark comedy.“Left me wishing it was possible. Who wouldn't want that travel back in time? A great read, well written in a style that keeps you reading.”",
