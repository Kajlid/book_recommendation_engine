  "description": "When you’re on the run from danger that has caught up to you, there’s no way in hell you will pass on a helping hand. Especially one that comes from a handsome, friendly biker who gives you a chance to catch your breath and even offers to take on the danger you’re facing so you won’t have to stand alone.  There are so many people on this planet, yet ultimately it’s a small world. Lives cross and blood will flow. Will the foundation of family cause blindness for what’s hiding in plain sight? Trust, friendship, and love cut deep but what happens when one could leave you bleeding to death? Family can lift you up or drag you down. But what if the ones who are supposed to have your back, are the ones you begin to question?
