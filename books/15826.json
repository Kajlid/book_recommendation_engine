And she knows there’s something important buried in her past, something that pertains to her death…but what? Her friend—and the local rep from the Grim Reaper’s office—Jimmy, that snarky bastard, knows but won’t tell Patty anything. He says she has all the answers inside her already, and all she has to do to discover them is “open her soul to the truth,” whatever that means.Patty’s not impressed by Jimmy’s psychobabble but she’s determined to learn the explosive truth about herself.",
