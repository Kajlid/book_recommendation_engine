  "description": "My sugar plum was all grown up and more forbidden than ever.  Holly Halliday was twenty years old and deliciously curvy. My best friend’s daughter. Too young. Off-limits. I’d kept my desires buried for the last two years, but now, with her realizing the effect she had on me, I was struggling to stay away. But this holiday season, Holly was especially irresistible, and there was no way I could say no to my desires any longer. I find myself breaking the vow I made with myself not to be with her. Holly's learned to use her womanly charm, and the moment those lace panties found their way under my pillow, I was a goner. There was no way I was keeping my distance, and I’d know how sweet Holly really is.  Sugar Plum is a father's best friend romance. Sugary-sweet and self-indulgent, this novella is the perfect bite-sized treat to enjoy on a cold winter evening!",
