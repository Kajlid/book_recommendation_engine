  "description": "Aiden and Ky Allyson James \"Book 4 in the Tales of the Shareem series.\" Brianne, a member of the elite ruling family of Bor Narga, is horrified when she inadvertently causes the arrest of two decadent Shareem-men genetically created to provide women ultimate pleasure. They are nearly terminated before she can get them released, and she wants to make amends. Little does she know that Ky, angry over the near loss of his best friend Aiden, will find an exquisite way to make her pay. Raised to believe that carnality has no place in civilized life, Brianne suddenly finds herself schooled by not one, but two Shareem. But Ky doesn't realize that their threesome games will stir to life his buried feelings for Aiden, and that a deadly secret from Ky's past will emerge to put him-and their newfound love-in danger.",
