  "description": "Stealth tech: a lost science everyone wants to reclaim. The woman who helped Boss dive the Dignity Vessel, known then as Squishy, claims a long and storied history with stealth tech. Her research into the lost science caused deaths before, and she failed to prevent more during a fateful dive. Now, she vows to find a way to destroy the technology once and for all. Coop and Boss want to keep stealth tech out of the Empire’s hands, too, but for different reasons. “Stealth tech” powers Coop’s ship in the form of its anacapa drive. A drive that malfunctioned, leaving Coop and his crew stranded. But to find a way home, he must know what happened in the past. When Squishy’s actions threaten Coop’s mission, he must make a choice—help Boss attack the Empire, or risk losing his hope for a future.“Rusch follows Diving into the Wreck and City of Ruins with another fast-paced novel of the far future.”—Publisher’s Weekly“Filled with well-defined characters who confront a variety of ethical and moral dilemmas, Rusch’s third Diving Universe novel is classic space opera, with richly detailed worldbuilding and lots of drama.” —RT Book ReviewsInternational bestselling writer Kristine Kathryn Rusch has won two Hugo awards, a World Fantasy Award, and six Asimov’s Readers Choice Awards.
