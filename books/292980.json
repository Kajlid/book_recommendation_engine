  "description": "What if J.R.R. Tolkien's work wasn't fiction, but a primer to help humanity get accustomed to a harsh truth?\nThere are nine known realms, a world for each race, including dwarves, gnomes, and elves.\nIn the middle rests Middang3ard. \n\nEach world knows the others. Each, except Earth.\nHumans long ago turned their backs on magic, throwing their stock into science and technology, their governments shielding the people from the reality of what was going on elsewhere.\nSo be it. Humans were never very good at getting along with other races anyway.\n\nThen the Dark One appeared, threatening to overrun the nine worlds, starting with Middang3ard and ending with the humans’ planet.\nThe second planet just went dark, Earth can't stay out of the fight, but can it do anything to save its own future?\nNow, humans must send elite warriors to Middang3ard to fight, else humans will fight on the shores of their own lands when the Dark One invades Earth.\n\nToo bad their elite starts and ends with Robert ‘Suzuki’ Fletcher and his team of Mundanes.",
