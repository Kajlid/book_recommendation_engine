  "title": "I Can Do It Myself!",
  "description": "Emily Pearl is a very big girl. She can pour her own juice. She can tie her own shoes. She can feed her goldfish. She can even curl her own hair. Whenever her mother tries to help, Emily says, I can do it myself! But even a very big girl like Emily can sometimes feel a teeny bit small, especially at bedtime when dark shadows creep across the walls of her bedroom. Lucky for Emily, her mom understands and gives her a helping hand. Young children will surely recognize themselves in Diane Adamss delightful, rhyming story of one childs determined quest for independence. Nancy Hayashis charming illustrations complement the text, colorfully capturing the chaotic ups and downs in the life of a preschooler.",
