  "description": "For most, liking one another typically serves as merely the starter fluid in the hope of a veritable happily ever after. A LIKE AFFAIR creates an entire life around the alternative. Aly and Justin are having an affair...A LIKE AFFAIR. They are destined, or perhaps just determined, to spend their lives apart in togetherness. This on-going episode of two skyrockets where its inspiration film Same Time Next Year left both friends and skeptics sizzling with controversy even in the shifting social world of the 1970's. In A LIKE AFFAIR the characters are single, yet they love and struggle both together and separately as a couple would. They dispute through the years (sometimes unknowingly and often with hefty doses of honesty) the cliched design that love and lust must be the dominating forces in a relationship. Seated beside each other on an otherwise uneventful flight, they fall into each other, setting the stage for decades worth of personality rustling and growth. Filled with passion and perseverance, A LIKE AFFAIR explores the intricacies that bind us to one another, and the unexpected ways in which we may find ourselves transformed by another s presence in our lives.",
