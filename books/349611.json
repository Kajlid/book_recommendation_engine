As part of their correspondence, Goro sends Kogito a trunk of tapes he has recorded of reflections about their friendship. But as Kogito is listening one night, he hears something odd. \"I'm going to head over to the Other Side now,\" Goro says, and then Kogito hears a loud thud. After a moment of silence, Goro's voice continues, \"But don't worry, I'm not going to stop communicating with you.\" Moments later, Kogito's wife rushes in; Goro has jumped to his death from the roof of a building.With that, Kogito begins a far-ranging search to understand what drove his brother-in-law to suicide. The quest takes him to Berlin, where he confronts ghosts from both his own past, and that of his lifelong, but departed, friend.",
