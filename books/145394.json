  "description": "Jessica Huntington, rich, smart, and beautiful, seeks refuge from betrayal in a desert paradise only to discover life is full of surprises like...  A DEAD SISTER!  Jessica Huntington's philandering husband and his she-beast aren't done with her yet. It's not just the debacle on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills that has Jessica wondering if the shopping gods have it in for her. There's more trouble on El Paseo, too!  Jessica and her 'cat pack' friends are back in this, the second Jessica Huntington Desert Cities Mystery. Jessica's childhood friend, Kelly Fontana, was killed soon after graduating from high school. The victim of a hit-and-run accident in downtown Palm Springs, the investigation into her death quickly grew cold. Now more than a decade later a lowlife meth addict claims to have witnessed her death and swears:   \"It weren't no accident! It was on purpose.\"  Why would someone do such a thing to the 19-year-old, auburn-haired beauty with a voice like an angel and a streak of wild? Can Jessica and her friends figure out who killed her and, finally, get justice for Kelly? Will they get him before he gets them?",
