  "description": "A proudly independent fantasy anthology! The Houston Writers Guild presents sixteen short fables, sword and sorcery, and urban fantasy. These bold visions of the impossible will take you to worlds both very distant and closer than you'll believe. Among these stories are...  Talisman by Patricia C. Hughes tells of a man following a supernatural calling to a small town near an ancient castle. There he confronts the dark history of the place, overcoming dangerous magic and a plot that's been in the works for hundreds of years.  The Bargain by Claudia Herring is about an Angel named Andras sent with a message for a devout yet unpleasant Marquis. But Andras is preparing himself to handle the mission's deeper and more disturbing implications that draw into question the holiness of everything involved.  In Púca Dawns by Patricia Flaherty Pagan, a little girl named Maeve befriends a mischevious, shape-changing creature. As it enjoys simple offerings like apples and chocolate, the Púca observes Maeve and begins to suspect deeply troubling secrets in the little girl's life.   ... and many more.  The second in a series of anthologies from the Houston Writer's Guild. Tides of Impossibility is the fantasy companion of a science fiction anthology published last year, Tides of Possibility, both produced using funds faithfully pledged by local readers. This time, K.J. Russell has teamed up with \"Writers of the Future\" winner C. Stuart Hardwick to bring the best of Houston's visionary talent to you. Check out both anthologies and find out what kind of worlds the writers of Space City can imagine!",
