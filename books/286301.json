  "title": "The Bell Witch Unveiled at Last!: The True Story of a Poltergeist",
  "description": "Who was the true Bell Witch of Tennessee? John Bell of Adams, Tennessee, died on December 20, 1820. Why not? He was old. He was sick. He was comatose. Yet dozens of newspaper articles; a handful of published books, movies, videos, and websites; and countless amateur and professional storytellers all erroneously claim that John Bell was killed by a poltergeist. Who was this poltergeist many called the Bell Witch? Newspapers, books, websites, and countless people familiar with the 1817-1821 haunting pointed the finger of blame at a neighbor woman, Cate Batts. Her alleged guilt was purely circumstantial. For the first time, this breakthrough publication reveals the actual identities and motives of the three poltergeists. These three male entities followed John Bell from his former home in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, to Adams, Tennessee, seeking their revenge. Within the covers of this book, the Bell Witch is unveiled at last.",
