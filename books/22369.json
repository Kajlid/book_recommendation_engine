  "description": "The Camarillo Writer's Club is an eccentric collection of crazy people randomly pieced together from the public library system. We cover all ranges and genres, and have worked hard to cobble-together this compilation book(which was NOT assembled by elves or fairies, despite what they may like you to believe). Inside you will find thirty-three short stories and fifteen poems written by seventeen different authors.",
