  "description": "Max Evans is at the top. Labeled the Blonde Adonis, he’s idolized by millions around the world for his golden voice and his blonde good looks. He might be every woman’s dream, but for rising TV journalist Lucinda Cramer, he’s a troublesome glitch in her already complicated schedule. Filming a documentary about a pop idol on tour is hardly the kind of hard hitting assignment Lucy longs for, and the timing of the job couldn’t be worse. With her private life full of responsibilities and the shadow of a past tragedy looming over her family, the last thing she has time for is trailing after a pampered celebrity. Two weeks on a tour bus is plenty of time for Lucy and Max to discover that first impressions can’t always be trusted and second chances are never too late.",
