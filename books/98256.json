But just as Alex thinks she's on the road to finally healing after a tragic accident, she's once again hit with a loss, a loss that just might destroy her. When faced with her world crumbling down for the second time in her life, Alex discovers that her true therapy is in the one who has always saved her. But can the boy who was just skipping stones be the rock she's always needed?",
