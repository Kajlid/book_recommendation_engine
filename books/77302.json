  "description": "Everyone thinks 16-year-old Ryoko Sakura has weird taste in guys because she can't stop drooling over Fuji, the strong silent type who sits next to her in class. When she discovers he works for a host club--where women actually pay men to date them--will she finally wise up? Or will he leave his job to be with her? Or will she take a job at the club so he can quit and she can be with him...? Only one thing's for sure in B.O.D.Y.--you can't put a price on love!",
