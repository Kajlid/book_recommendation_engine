And maybe she’s not as nice as she seems. Still, Ford Howard is not the sort of man a smart girl plays with. But Erin Russell rediscovers her long-absent playful side right about the time she meets him . . . so challenges the sexy, beautiful man to a one-up flirtation in the back of his limo.Her mistake is immediately obvious. What is meant to be a lighthearted lark reveals a man with a complicated and fractured personality born of many painful experiences. She’s not sure she likes him at all . . . and when he pursues her, she knows it’s a mistake to let him catch her. Whatever it is about Erin that draws him, Ford doesn’t know. He doesn’t lack for female companionship. But after that limo ride, he knows one thing: Erin is the only woman brave enough to call him out on his practised veneer.She’s a relationship sort of woman, and Ford is a one-night stand sort of man. But already Erin is chipping away his carefully constructed persona. He needs to figure out a way to keep her without her learning who he really is.But Erin knows—to get everything you want, you’ve got to be vulnerable.",
