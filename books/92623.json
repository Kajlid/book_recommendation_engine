  "description": "This book which encompasses the extent of the Greek god pantheon brings to light the entwined family ancestry of the Greek Titans, Gods, and their Kin. Among the pages are rarely understood deities, and revelation in the heritage between the immortal beings that made Ancient Greece what it is.  We live in a world of story telling. Whether they come from your grandparents, a neighbor, or your favorite book, they are something that you tend to remember for years to come. There is something about enjoying stories of ancient times, of heroic battles, or vicious beasts, stories of love gone right, or gone wrong, stories of great cities rising & Falling. This is a the power of Mythology. These stories help build the cities of ancient times, and was central in their beliefs.  What can we say about the Greeks that they haven't already said about themselves? Consummate tall story tellers, they have classy classic Gods for all situations.  Greek Mythology is a veritable blockbusting soap opera. What can Zeus possibly get up to next - and with whom? How will Hera take her next revenge? Where will Aphrodite discard her nightie? Who has been barred from Olympus lately - and why? When is the next big punch-up? And will Hermes be sued for selling counterfeit sheep?  Full of twists, turns, plots within plots, wit, humor, satire, belly laughs, blood-curdling thrills, Greek Gods have beginnings, middles, and ends without end. Coming soon to a temple near you! And they are all big stars - brawnier, more beautiful, and larger than any life you have ever known.  The Romans couldn't improve upon them. So they just gave them a quick makeover and turned the whole pantheon into a spin-off sequel.",
