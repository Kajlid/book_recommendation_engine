  "description": "Every Halloween, Satan's Affair will come to you.We travel the country, offering terrifying haunted houses, thrilling rides and the tastiest food. And with every passing town, I cleanse this world, one execution at a time.I hide within the walls, casting my judgement for those that reek of evil, singing lullabies to their rotting souls.Once you've been chosen, there's no escaping my henchmenâ€”they cater to my every desire.You can run and you can hide, but it only excites me.Come.Take a walk through my dollhouse, where your screams will blend and your cute little pleas will go unanswered.But I can't promise it'll be over quickly...",
