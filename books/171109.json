His retreat high in the Rocky Mountains has left him utterly alone, and for too long. When fate intervenes by sending a shifter after him, Dix’s hunger to bond to a mate drives him to do something stupid.

Logan Dix is a dangerous Rogue Alpha and an accused murderer. Despite his training in black ops, Kristof hopes he can keep from becoming the hunted.  But the mountain is unforgiving, as is a rogue shifter rumored to be a former Delta Force soldier. It will take all of Kristof’s cunning to survive the ordeal he’s found himself in…and to keep his body and soul from becoming bonded to a fugitive from justice.  A 17,000 word novella. Book 1 in the Rogue Alpha Series. Taming His Mate – Rogue Alpha Series Book 2 Trusting His Mate – Rogue Alpha Series Book 3",
