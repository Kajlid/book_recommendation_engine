  "title": "Svetasvatara Upanisad: With the Commentary of Sankaracarya",
  "description": "This Upanishad consisting of 113 verses in six chapters belongs to the Shukla Yajur Veda and takes its name from the sage Svetasvatara. It has for its ultimate conclusion non-dualism. Still, its devotional tone is too strong to be ignored. The harmony of knowledge and devotion is quite evident in the texts. With a faithful and lucid English translation of Shankaracharya's commentary added by relevant notes, it goes without saying that this work will be extremely important for all the students of Vedanta.",
