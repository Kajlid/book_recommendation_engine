  "title": "The Descent of Woman",
  "description": "This pioneering work, first published in 1972 and revised in 1985, was the first to intelligently argue the equal role of women in human evolution. The book's influence has been profound and lasting â€” on the terminology used by students of prehistoric anthropology, on the theory of evolution, and, above all, on the societally-fostered attitudes towards women as an afterthought and an amenity. It remains a key book in any discussion of women's place in society.",
