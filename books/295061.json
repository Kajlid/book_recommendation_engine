  "description": "To tell you honestly, I did wonder about publishing this when I first found it hidden at the bottom of his filing cabinet. It's pretty incoherent and obviously from the mind of someone whose completely out of it. But hey - at Christmas time he's everyone's hero and I'm sure you'll want to hear what the great man has to say when he's off duty, so I thought, why not just put it out there for everyone to see? Genius or madman - you'll have to make up your own mind.",
