  "description": "Retired Vancouver Police officer Sam Watson has little use for religion. When his only son, Jeff, commits to missionary service in Thailand, Sam is understandably upset. An uneasy long distance relationship continues until the unthinkable happens: Jeff is murdered. The mission organization wants nothing to do with the investigation and the Thai Police seem unable or unwilling to solve the crime. Sam finds himself in Thailand seeking his son’s killer but also grappling with loss, culture shock and, ultimately, the meaning of his son’s short life.",
