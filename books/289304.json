After they arrived, it turned out that the entire human colony of twenty billion people had been killed there by a powerful plasma energy wave that occurred a hundred years ago by the invasion of a pure energy creature called Dragon.Only electric machines that could survive the energy wave, and energy from the remnants of the Dragon also trapped there forbid anyone to escape. The planet which consisted of hundreds of countries is now controlled by AI from the autopilot defense system, an automatic crazy exoskeleton robot, Android called as Replicas which are based on the memories of previous human brains, and many more types of robots. Caught as the only biological human on the dead planet filled by corpses and bones, a man must be able to defeat the monster that has made all life become animated.",
