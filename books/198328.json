  "title": "Buddhist Spirituality II: Later China, Korea, Japan and the Modern World",
  "description": "Of all the great religions, Buddhism has focused most intensively on the aspect of religion that we call spirituality. No religion has set a higher value on the states of spiritual insight and liberation, and none has set forth so methodically and with such a wealth of reflection the various paths and disciplines by which such states are reached. This volume, the second in the series, takes up further developments of Buddhism in China, Korea, and Japan, including Ch'an (Zen) and new Buddhist movements. It presents the Chinese realization of enlightenment here and now, and the practical, down-to-earth terms in which the enlightened vision was expressed and enacted.",
