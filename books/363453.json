  "description": "A woman's story of love, romance and marriage to a husband who introduces her to a life of swinging. This awakens a deep desire inside her to be wanted and the passion becomes a drug driving her to the brink of depravity. . . . . . This is a tale of lust and sex from a woman who doesn't realise the power of her beauty or her allure to other men. This book is Nicci's account of her life that gives an insight into what life might be like for a swinger and her husband. The story begins full of romance and passion before descending into erotic sexual pleasure and fantasy that leaves you wanting more. If you enjoy erotic fiction this is certainly the book for you, a bonkfest with a superb underlying story which differs greatly from the traditional erotic novel. If however you are just looking for a good read and a great story this like all good books entices the reader with many questions leaving it open for you to decide what is right and what is wrong. This is a book for any adult and can be enjoyed by both men and women as the story is told in an easy to read literary style with short chapters that will tantalise you with its erotic tales and the concept of swinging whether you've ever considered it or not?!",
