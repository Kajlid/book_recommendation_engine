  "description": "An enthralling roman à clé depicting the rise of Nazi ideology in Germany. Martin Krüger, a museum director in Munich, has become quite unpopular and some people would like to be rid of him. Consequently, the lawsuit against him does not turn out to his favor. However, his friends keep fighting to prove his innocence. \"The novel Success is more than a 'documentation of Bavaria.' It turns out to be the story about the overall state of affairs in the epoch of incipient Nazism in Germany.\" -Victor Klemperer",
