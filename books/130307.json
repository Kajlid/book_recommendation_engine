  "description": "Luke Hawkins is not a popular teenager. His parents think he's an odd one; he has no friends and has seen many shrinks. When his parents go on vacation, they leave him with his estranged sister, Samantha. What looks to be a terrible week turns out quite differently than expected. Luke never knew that he and his sister share a passionate interest in the paranormal, specifically in spirits. Luke finds an old book that gives instructions on how to get to the other side--the Afterlife ... and Luke and Sam embark on an otherworldly adventure. Breaking laws they didn't know existed, they become \"most wanted\" by Afterlife authorities. Their only help is from a whacky scientist and a king from a world of Afterlife rejects, and the Afterlife's most notorious, rebellious bad-boy spirit. For Luke and Sam, nothing is ever quite what it seems to be in the dimensions beyond the Symbol of the Dead.***This edition of the book is NO longer available.***",
