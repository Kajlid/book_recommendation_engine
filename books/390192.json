  "description": "In Sherry Ellis' delightful book, That Mama is a Grouch, children from age 3-7 will quickly learn that clutter-caused tension in a home can be avoided. In this story, Mama is having a bit of a tantrum over the mess, and the narrator, a precocious child indeed, soon understands all too well. Toys are strewn about as obstacles that can cause falls and short tempers. Mama is tired-tired-tired of cleaning up this constant clutter. In a voice as wise as it is adorable, the narrator reminds children that parents are human, with feelings and moods. At the same time, parents are reminded that children are, well, children! Ms. Ellis has produced a book that takes the place of yelling. Whether read by adults to children or a child reading alone, this book guarantees to charm, amuse, and result in some much-needed changes in behavior",
