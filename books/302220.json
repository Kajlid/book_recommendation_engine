Being a trifle lonely himself—only a trifle—he's looking for a fresh start in fresh surrounds.Fabianus has always enjoyed the company of sensible women, though, and Lady Daisy is very sensible. Her ladyship doesn't mince words regarding disappointing marital experiences, is ferociously devoted to her children, and has an immediate rapport with Penweather's small daughter. When Daisy's happiness is threatened by her in-laws, Penweather is honor-bound to intervene. Soon Daisy will have to choose, between her children and the man who makes her dream once again of the kind of happily ever after she'd thought could never be hers.",
