  "title": "The Dangerous Journey: A Tale of Moomin Valley",
  "description": "A little girl is transported with the help of magic glasses from the tedium of a summer afternoon into an exciting world of mangrove swamps, spluttering volcanoes and sea, where birds fly upside down and wild things threaten to pounce. But she is not alone. Old friends from Moomin Valley – Hemulen, Sniff, Snufkin, Thingummy & Bob – have joined her in her journey, and Tooticky too, who rides to their rescue in a stripey balloon.And who should be waiting to celebrate their safe landing? Why, Moomin of course.This brand new version of a classic book pairs Jansson’s irresistible artwork with a playful rhyming text by Sophie Hannah, one of Britain’s star poets, and calligraphy by Peter Blegvad: the perfect match for Jansson’s quirky illustrations.",
