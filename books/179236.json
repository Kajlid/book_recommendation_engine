  "description": "From the world of Carolina Bad Boys! Hunter Sexton is too hot to handle . . . Hunter:My call-sign is GHOST. My roadname, too. I keep my head down, stay off the grid, fly under the radar. I’m the rough, gruff, good guy who does bad things for pay. JB is my most recent mistake. The MC babe is innocence wrapped up in a rockin’ body. Don’t get me wrong, she has a wicked side, too. She’s kickass in bed, when we make it that far. But she’s the ultimate wholesome good girl, and I don’t want to dirty her up. Hey, no one said life was all fun and games, right?JB:Good girl? I prefer to think of myself as a rebellious hellion. I live my life like I ride my bike: carefree, in your face, and full throttle. My soft side? Well, that’s reserved for my job. I’m not looking for love, and I certainly don’t need any relationship complications. Too bad complicated is the only way Hunter comes. He’s a quiet, deadly storm. He prowls. He hunts me. He wants me. He’s sexy, sinful . . . secretive. Hunter will turn my life inside out no thanks to his dangerous past about to come back and bite us both in the ass. Who’s gonna save us now?Warning: Graphic sex, graphic action, graphic language. Triple X caution.",
