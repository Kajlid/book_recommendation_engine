  "description": "When two Memphis police detectives knocked on Vern Beachy's door on a Friday night in June of 2006, Vern didn't know what the detectives had to say, but he knew it wasn't good news. In fact, it was about the worst message one can hear. Vern's wife, Melinda, was dead, and it was believed she had committed suicide.In this memoir, A Tear-Stained Letter, Vern provides a candid and emotional look at his journey after the death of Melinda--his wife, his best friend, and his very best support system as he dealt with the ravages of multiple sclerosis. Vern recounts the night he heard the fateful news, the frustrations of dealing with the authorities, the grief of a funeral and its aftermath, and the desperation of living alone.A Tear-Stained Letter reminisces about Vern and Melinda's life together and how she helped him handle living with the many aspects of multiple sclerosis. This memoir tells a story of enduring love and how living after the death of a loved one never gets easier, but it does get different.",
