What else I might lose, if I go back to the life I used to want so badly.Every night he has me in his bed, in every way he pleases. But nothing can stop me from burning the Blackmoor heirs and their queen to ash, no matter the threats he makes, the punishments he exacts, or the way he makes me feel.
