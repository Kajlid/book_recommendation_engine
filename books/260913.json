  "description": "The stunning conclusion to Luke and Alex’s story!Finding love was the easy part... Making it last was another story all together. I couldn't imagine my life without Luke. He was kind, gentle and the most down to earth guy... but being a famous Hollywood actor came with strings. Messy ones; like crazy fans and having our lives torn apart all over social media. Sure I had my own baggage, an abusive ex-husband that didn't want to let go, and the amazing son that we shared. But my life was simple, quiet and it was hard to focus on our budding romance with the noise our relationship was causing from coast to coast. We found ourselves back to being miles apart, and with the distance came doubt. I wanted a forever with Luke, but our happy ending seemed just out of reach.I knew our life wouldn’t be easy, but I never thought our love would put us in danger. Could we really overcome everything standing in our way, and finally get the fairytale ending we deserved?",
