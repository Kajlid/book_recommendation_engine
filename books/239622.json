  "description": "I had two rules in life: Never fall in love. Never have sex with a student.As a college preceptor, you’re not supposed to fraternize with your pupils, but what happens when you get a taste of the forbidden before you know it isn’t supposed to be yours? That night at Brian’s bachelor party was epic. We danced, I dominated, and she left. One night, no further contact, no regrets, just how I liked it—until she walked into my algebra class the next week and I knew the two rules I had in place had to change.Never fall in love. Never get caught having sex with a student. This will be a naughty student-teacher story! ;) Coming 2022",
