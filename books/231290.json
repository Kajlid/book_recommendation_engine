And the small town of Lychford is suffering.But what can three rural witches do to guard against the unknown? And why are unwary hikers being led over the magical borders by their smartphones' mapping software? And is the European question *really* important enough to kill for?At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",
