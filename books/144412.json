  "description": "To get better acquainted - and, in some cases, reacquainted - with each other, the residents of Ayakashi Hall spend the last weeks of summer break at a seaside vacation spot. Between beach basking and tests of courage, Ririchiyo slowly warms to her new cohorts, but the one resident who never seems to betray his emotions is Miketsukami - and the group is determined to fix that! Will her efforts to unmask Soushi expose the truth of who he is - that is, who he is not?",
