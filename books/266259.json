  "description": "Spring, 1941. Britain is losing the war. Paris is occupied by the Nazis, dark and silent at night. But when the clouds part, and moonlight floods the city, a Resistance leader called Mathieu steps out to begin his work. The fighters of the French Resistance are determined not to give up. These courageous men and women - young and old, aristocrats and nightclub owners, teachers and students - help downed British airmen reach the border with Spain. They risk everything to open Europe's sealed doors and lead Allied fighters to freedom. But then Mathieu and his team face a new threat, dispatched from the Reich to destroy them all.",
