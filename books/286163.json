  "title": "Serious as a Heart Attack: A Comedic Memoir about Dropping Dead",
  "description": "Serious as a Heart Attack is a comedic memoir about the time I dropped dead of a heart attack. Well, obviously I didn’t actually drop dead or I wouldn’t be here to tell you about it. And they tell me I didn’t technically have a heart attack either. But that’s alright, it’s not meant to be an historical memoir, it’s an hysterical memoir, and it’s a drop-dead laugh riot.The story begins the day I told my boss I would be a couple hours late so I could stop by the doctor “to get this thing checked out” and yada, yada, yada had immediate emergency open-heart surgery.The story then diverges in time, going forward through recovery while reflecting back on my life and what led me to this fateful cardiological crossroads. Through a year of medical consultations, clinical trials and some post-graduate research I come to learn that (spoiler alert!) fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life.Turns out I was a walking cardiological time bomb my entire life leading up to that fateful day. I grapple with addressing or accepting each risk factor as I go through recovery and emerge a skinnier, sexier, healthier version of myself than I had ever been.",
