  "title": "Philosophy of Foucault (Continental European Philosophy Series)",
  "description": "What remains constant is that Foucault never stops asking the question of who we are and how we came to be that way. Following Foucault's itinerary from his early history of madness to his recently published Collhge de France lectures, Todd May shows that the question of who we are, while changing, remains always at or just below the surface of Foucault's writings. In so doing he offers students an immediately engaging and perceptive way to understand Foucault. The Philosophy of Foucault is an accessible and stimulating introduction that will be welcomed by students studying Foucault as part of politics, sociology, and history courses as well as within philosophy.",
