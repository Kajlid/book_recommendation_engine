  "title": "An Exceptional Woman",
  "description": "This book is not just a biography; it is also a complete authentic work that speaks of a life that began with good, did good and ended with good, by Allah’s leave. And the goodness is continuing with the efforts of her sons and grandsons, their Royal Highnesses the Princes Muhammad, Saud, Sultan and Khaled and Princess Latifah.This book begins with a biography of this noble character, may Allah forgive her and cause her and her father, His Highness Prince Abd Al-'Aziz bin Musaed, and her paternal aunt, Her Highness Princess al-Jawharah bint Musaed, and her mother, Her Highness Princess Tarfat Al-Battaal to dwell in the vastness of His Paradise.The story could not have been told in full without the family of Âl Jalawi and what they embody of courage, pride, unyielding strength, high calibre, modesty and love of country. This book also quotes her will which was written by one of the most prominent modern scholars, His Excellency Shaykh Abd Al-'Aziz bin Abdullah bin Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), on 12/8/1387 AH, in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah.Then we discuss the contents of the will, followed by a discussion of the foundation that carries her name and its achievements over the last eight years. The book ends with a word for the future and is a guide which any young man or woman may follow; simply put, it is a guide that shows the safe road and safe consequences, by Allah’s Leave.",
