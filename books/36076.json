  "title": "Leiyatel's Embrace",
  "description": "Leiyatel, the once-invincible power of the vast and ancient castle realm of Dica, has long been weakening, leaving the castle to slumber on through its twilight years. Only the inevitable fall of the realm lies ahead. As the king has lost his mind, who can then be expected to defend it when a wholly unexpected invasion threatens, and when no one can even remember when Dica last had any need of an army?This story follows those idiosyncratically unique characters who rise to the challenge, who seek a solution amidst the vast and convoluted spread of the castle, and in so doing, uncover much about Dica’s history and about themselves. They also discover that there may very well be a way of renewing Leiyatel, and so restoring Dica.Their journey proves far from straightforward, though, full of surprising twists and turns, and all within a world rich in the awe-inspiring and the downright weird. From vast vistas to exquisite detail, the castle and its realm are brought vividly to life, as though the reader has walked through its wonders in the company of close friends.Although largely a tale of mystery, it’s also laced with constant surprises: the conflict between man and nature, the often wry and ironic clash of monarchy and republic, and the humour, pain and pathos of characters at odds with each other or touchingly close. In a subtle and enchanting way, it explores much of the mystery of life itself.This is most certainly an epic tale, a tale that ineluctably draws to a thrilling, strange, and totally surprising climax. A tale that will enthral, that will stay with the reader for a long time—a very long time, indeed",
