  "description": "This first novel by a former U.S. Army captain offers a unique perspective on the Vietnam War as experienced by a gay man. Capt. Matthew Fairchild is a desk officer in Saigon who, despite his constant struggle with hiding his sexuality, does superior work and is admired by his superiors. His affair with a young Vietnamese busboy named Nham gives him insight into the people he is fighting and himself as well. When Fairchild discovers secret information of misconduct involving the massacre of a Vietnamese village, his personal ethics as well as the inevitable disclosure of his homosexuality bring the novel to a tense and ultimately satisfying conclusion. Despite some weighty passages involving religion, Vietnamese history, etc., the author moves the story at a brisk pace and is exceptionally good at dialog. Readers will care about the characters, and this fictional account of a timely topic should be of interest.",
