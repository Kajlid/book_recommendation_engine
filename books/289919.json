  "description": "I know rock stars. I grew up in the business, and now I make a living managing their tours. I’ve seen the good, the bad, and the ugly.Lots and lots of ugly.All that ugly is why I’ve sworn off dating rockers, but sleeping with them, well...I’ve been known to make the occasional exception.One sultry night in Vegas, Mo Aronson, lead singer of Unrequited, becomes one of those exceptions. We dance, we connect, we... get married.That wasn’t in the cards. And the positive pregnancy test a few weeks later really wasn’t in the cards.Despite the shock, I think I can handle becoming a mom. What I’m not sure I can handle is the younger, bad boy rocker who won’t back down no matter how many times I push him away.",
