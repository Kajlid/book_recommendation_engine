  "description": "Tokunaga is a young comedian struggling to make a name for himself in Osaka, when he is taken under the wing of the more experienced, but no more famous, Kamiya. But as much as Kamiya's indestructible confidence inspires him, it also makes him doubt the limits of his own talent, and his own dedication to comedy.Winner of the prestigious Akutagawa Prize, Spark is about art and friendship, about what it means to be committed to our own ambitions and to each other. A novel about comedy that's as moving and thoughtful as it is funny, it's already been a sensation in Japan.",
