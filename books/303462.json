  "description": "An extremely violent alien humanoid born on the planet Czarnia, Lobo is a sadistic intergalactic bounty hunter who takes pleasure in the pain and misery that he inflicts on his victims. In the darkly humorous LOBO'S BACK BACK, Lobo is killed over and over again by one of his quarries but is refused entrance to both Heaven and Hell. As a result, the Main Man finds himself reincarnated in various forms, among them a woman and a squirrel. Furious but unfazed by his less than appealing new identities, the bounty hunter continues his mission.",
