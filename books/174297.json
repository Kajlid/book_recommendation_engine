  "description": "Twenty-three-year-old Emma Jane Hellsbane just found out she's not human—or, at least, not only human. She's half angel, too, and now Heaven's got a job for round up all the Fallen angels and their red-skinned, horned devil-demon minions and boot their butts back into the abyss. Only problem? The demons and their Fallen masters fight back…and they don't fight fair.Luckily for Emma, she can put a stop to the constant threat of having her head hacked off if she figures out which Fallen angel is her father—and then kill him before he kills her. Of course, in the meantime, she'll have to avoid accidentally seducing her angelic mentor, help an old friend conquer his own Fallen sperm donor, and basically save the world from a cataclysmic divine smack down.No one said being Heaven's bounty hunter would be easy. But with a name like Hellsbane, Emma Jane was born for the job.",
