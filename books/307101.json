  "title": "Expecting it All",
  "description": "A brand-new standalone novel in the Punishment Pit World.What happens when an age-play little gets pregnant? She loved every part of being her Daddy’s baby—from the diapers, bottles, and snuggles to the naughty-girl spankings. But now, her real-life son was growing inside her and Rachel Parker had to come to terms with the idea of growing up into a woman—a mother. It was inevitable that her pregnancy would change her marriage, but she hadn’t been prepared to lose her Daddy—her husband—her Dom. Derek was used to being in control of every aspect of her life, but there was no controlling the changes a tiny infant would have on their relationship.  Expecting it All takes a deep look into how having a baby might impact a BDSM age-play couple. It contains a scene the author loves to call “Three Doms and a Baby” that will have you cracking up between your tears.",
