  "description": "Happy endings don't always happen. In a book, the hero and heroine go through obstacles and trials. But in the end, their happily ever after comes. But that isn't life. Sometimes there are obstacles and trials, followed by more obstacles and trials, in the grand romance, with no happily ever after in sight. Sometimes people never even find their grand romance. Sometimes people lose their grand romance before their life is over, leaving them with regrets and heartache. And sometimes, people lose their life. Piper Skye wants to be her own person, not who her mother wants her to be. She owns an already mildly successful dessert business, but wants to be more than mildly successful. When a trip to a custom auto shop for some improvements on her work van introduces her to a garage filled with hotties, how's the black sheep rocker chick to resist hanging out? And if hanging out leads to finding her very own badass, that'd be cool with her. The question is, which one? And, more importantly, will she live long enough to find her happily ever after? *Warning: Contains strong adult language, even stronger adult situations, and so much alpha, it'll put your head, and other much lower parts, in a tizzy.",
