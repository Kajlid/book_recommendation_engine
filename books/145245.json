  "description": "A dangerous secret could ruin everything…Logan blazed into my life on a Harley and stole more than my breath. I hardly knew his name when he showed up at my apartment and made me his in a way no other man has before. I'm sure he still has deep red scratches hidden under his vest.The second he gave me that smirk and revved out of my apartment complex, I started aching for him to come back... and I haven't stopped yet. Even thinking about him gives me goosebumps despite the suffocating heat of the Arizona sun.But I’m nervous. I think his crew is suspicious, and I don’t know what to do. If I push him away, who will keep them at bay?A betrayal that won’t be dismissed…I can’t shake Cassie. Lying to my crew about her is one thing, but getting distracted by thoughts of her body wrapped around mine doesn't help either. I can’t worry about that problem though. With Surge out of commission and the club in my hands, I have to whip the men into shape for the drug deal this weekend. I hope I can mold them from scared children into the aggressive lions I need them to be. Especially with the Skeletons MC breathing down our necks.If I can’t, I could lose it all, including Cassie.I can’t let that happen, no matter what it takes.",
