When he asks to meet her, Jae-Gyu's understandably nervous - she bullied him pretty badly back in school. Instead of carrying a grudge, our rock star is actually carrying a flame for Jae-Gyu, and their chance meeting was really a setup for him to meet his love again. Bur there are lot of distractions in the big city, not to mention all the good looking boys!",
