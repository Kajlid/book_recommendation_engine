  "description": "Destiny will find you.  Izzy has always loved the freedom and adventure of life on the road, but she’s recently decided to settle down—as much as a rogue wolf can. When her boyfriend gets her a job working at a hot Shifter bar, she runs into the last person on earth she expected to see again.  Jericho isn’t the famous rock star he once was, though he still plays in a local band and loves to party. Beautiful women come and go, but music is his only passion—until a sassy redhead named Isabelle Monroe shows up unexpectedly.  Fate reunites two former friends living with one foot in the present and the other in the past. But will they have a future when one of them is forced to choose between life and death? Old habits die hard, and sometimes the toughest addictions to shake are the ones that control our hearts. \nSEVEN SERIES READING ORDER:\nBook 1 - Seven Years Book 2 - Six Months Book 3 - Five WeeksBook 4 - Four DaysBook 5 - Three HoursBook 6 - Two MinutesCharming (side-world novel)Book 7 - One Second Book 8 - Winter MoonSeven Series Companion: An Insider's Guide",
