  "description": "What do you do when being with the man you love is forbidden?You hide it. Our relationship is secret because he's my teacher, but it wasn't always that way. We met online, when I lied about my age. For six months we built a friendship that slowly moved into something more. What i wasn't expecting was for my lies to unravel like they did when he walked into that classroom. We're too far gone to try and deny our feelings for each other, so we sneak around like we are ashamed of how we feel. We steal kisses or the touch of a hand when nobody is watching.The problem is, somebody is always watching and when things go wrong, they have the potential to ruin everything.",
