  "title": "69: A Short Novel of Cosmic Horror",
  "description": "“Everything is sixty-nine.”  It happened suddenly. Overnight. Inside Spring Lakes Assisted Living, seven residents - sixty-nine years of age - died mysterious deaths. Only... they aren’t really dead. Their bodies remain still, their staring eyes void of life; yet their hearts continue to beat, their lungs fight for oxygen, and somewhere within their petrified bodies their souls cling to life.  No one has a rational explanation for what’s happening. Three investigators from the CDC are dispatched to the facility in hopes of finding answers, but what they discover is far beyond human comprehension. Something terrifying has come to town. An unseen entity that leeches off the living, the dead, and everything in between.  69 is a brand new short novel of cosmic horror from Tim Meyer, author of The Switch House and Kill Hill Carnage.",
