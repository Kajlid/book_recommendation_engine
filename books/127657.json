  "description": "Brigeet works finding talents via news articles and medical reports. She normally sends recruiters out to contact those talents, but she gets tapped to set up a new Guardian base and so all the recruiting is up to her.  She has to convince their family matriarchs that it is a good idea to let them join.  Solos had Brigeet in his bed, but he was forced to leave her behind, now they are working together, and she is on his home world. On his turf, he can have her on his terms, if his family will agree.  Other families want Brigeet to take their sons as well, so it will be a competition to see whom she will take on as bond mate first.",
