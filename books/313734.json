  "description": "This estranged best friends to lovers romance is full of comfort, mutual pining, and sweet love that finally blooms. Elle doesn't believe in love anymore but she starts to change her mind when her childhood best friend comes back into her life and is determined to prove there is love everywhere around her. Elle Jones is a workaholic and doesn't prioritize anything else. She doesn't let people in, and she's terrified she's not good enough to ever find love that is good and soft, and won't break her heart.Dylan Andrews just moved in with his brother, and he's jobless but full of excitement to figure out what he wants to do with his life. When the two of them run into each other, they're overwhelmed by old feelings that never really went away. After a long talk on a quiet beach under a glimmering night sky, Dylan comes up with an idea that could change everything. He writes a list of things to show Elle that love can be real, true, everlasting, and it can find her when the time is right. As they check off the items on a crumped piece of paper, Elle learns there is more to life than she thought, and Dylan realizes he would do anything to fight for love. Can the two of them face the feelings they've been trying to avoid for years before the list ends? Can they take a leap towards a future that could be filled with unconditional love, both for each other and themselves, or will it be too late?",
