  "description": "Finalist for the Man Asian Literary PrizeIn an old ruined city, emptied of most of its inhabitants, Ustad Ramzi, a famous wrestler past his prime, and Gohar Jan, a well-known courtesan whose kotha once attracted the wealthy and the eminent, contemplate the former splendour of their lives and the ruthless currents of time and history that have swept them into oblivion.“There is a bell-like clarity to Farooqi’s delineation of his characters, his slow unraveling of their motivations and desires . . . This is a quietly affecting book, with a profound understanding of tragedy; that what happens to us is as much a function of how we respond to events as the events themselves.” – The Sunday Guardian",
