  "description": "It is a future time, when brain-based cybernetic computers are all but universal throughout humanity. A computer virus of unprecedented potency has swept across the globe, laying waste to technology and leaving half the world's population dead. The other half are neither dead nor alive – they are zombies, reanimated not by witchcraft, but by the virus infecting their brainware.  David Lawney – an acybernetic, whose body inexplicably rejected brainware as a child – has survived the disaster in a London now teeming with horrors. Haunted by memories of society's mistreatment of his kind, living in constant fear of a gruesome death, somehow David must find the strength and courage needed to protect a fellow survivor, a young boy, whose existence may hold the key to the only remaining record of all human history.[WARNING: Contains adult themes, violence and M/M romance.]",
