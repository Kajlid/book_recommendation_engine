Maybe, in addition to her (over)weight, it's because she has a tendency to babble senselessly when she's nervous in front of a guy - which is all of the time. Or maybe it's because she's one-quarter tiger shifter, and nobody wants that muck in their genes.When her bitchy younger sister, Terry, gets engaged, Ellen decides to respond to an ad in the shifter classifieds:TIGER SHIFTER WIFE WANTED URGENTLY. MUST BE WILLING TO LIVE IN AFRICAAfrica! Seriously?Soon enough, Ellen is booked on a first class flight to Africa, with just one complication.

The sweet, anxious and plump Ellen, or her slim and sexy sister, Terry, who is doing everything she can to get into his pants?MAIL ORDERÂ TIGER BRIDE WARS is a sweet and sexy and humorous shifter romance which reads exactly as good as its title.",
