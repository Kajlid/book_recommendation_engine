  "description": "A Rockstar Romance set in the World of Triple Threat.  Brandon Knight, lead guitarist for the rock band Wicked End, has his girl back and they are as solid as ever. The move to Florida is complicated, but he is willing to sacrifice for love. When Mackenzie agrees to go to California with him for their recording sessions, he is ecstatic.  Mackenzie Winters is grateful for Brandon’s forgiveness and never-ending love. Her life changed more than she ever thought possible. It wasn’t easy to let fear and control go so they could just live their lives. She is excited to see the band in the studio and stay with his trusted bandmates. What she didn’t expect was to fall further in love and toss her vision of the future to the wind.  The pressure of recording a new album on the heels of their last release has the entire band in a tailspin. Can the band stay together after exposure throws their fans into an online battle? Can Brandon and Makenzie take a step into the unknown, or is she still terrified of the consequences? Book four will show you just how close this band is.  Warning: For those 18 and over only. Definitely not suitable for all readers. Proceed with caution. ;)",
