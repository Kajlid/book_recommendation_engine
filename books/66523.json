  "description": "A collection of five short stories on the undead. Suspense grows as characters encounter unnatural forces only imagined in their worst nightmares. The convergence of the living and the undead has unknown consequences for the world and all of humanity. THE BEGINNING follows a German scientific expedition to the Amazon and reveals the genesis of the zombie virus. THE FIRST EXPERIMENT takes place in a concentration camp in eastern Poland as an experiment goes horribly wrong and is spun into a success to the Nazi leadership. NOVEMBER 1944 pits cold, hungry and battle weary American soldiers in the Hurtgen Forest against an undead foe. THE FLIGHT follows a plane load of evacuees from Europe. Screened and assumed safe aboard a US bound aircraft, they must contend with a deadly virus unleashed by terrorists and Chechen rebels. And, FROM LIFE TO UNDEATH is a twisted turn of justice which reveals why the undead seek the living. As a bonus, the first few chapters of the full length novel, PLAGUE: The Release, is included. A containment team fails to stop the spread of a deadly virus from the research laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland. As the number of undead grows, the dwindling numbers of survivors struggle to understand the destruction and violence around them. While they band together and attempt to find safety and avoid extinction, they discover a more sinister plot behind the release of the PLAGUE.",
