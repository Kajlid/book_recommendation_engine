  "description": "Paranormal Shifter RomanceIn the south, things get real dirty. Especially on Saturdays. Mud on your jeans. Grit in your beer. Your tan washes off in the shower. That's how you know it's racing day. Or as the Dirt Track Dogs like to put it, winning day. Because they aren't racing unless they're winning. Haunted by loss from the past, Blister, the most mysterious of the Dirt Track Dogs, is now running from his future. He’s found his mate, the sweet-as-sugar owner of a local bar, Annie Redmond. But the idea of shaming her with his disfigurement is unacceptable to him. He’s content to watch her from afar until a storm rips through Cedar Valley, leaving her home in need of major repairs. He could never abandon his mate in her time of need, but keeping his wolf from claiming her will be the greatest challenge of his life. Perpetually alone and forever a virgin, Annie has watched her closest friends mate Dirt Track Dogs, and now it’s her turn. She’s pined after elusive Blister for months but he seems about as interested as a moth to a dark room. When she finds herself in a jam, he steps up to help, bringing in a crew of cats from the Ouachitas to rebuilt her broken home. For once, her patience pays off as their time together slowly reveals a pain she shares herself. Loss. But if he’ll give her a chance, they could have the one thing both of them crave more than anything: Love. **Can be read as a standalone (NO CLIFFHANGER)**  **Warning: this book contains dirty, dirty things. Including but not limited to dirty talk, dirty sex, dirty minds, dirty mouths, and dirty looks. Do not read this book if you are a germaphobe.",
