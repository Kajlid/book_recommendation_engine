  "description": "Mary Ann Rivers delivers the moving story of a woman who must confront a life-changing event, and the man who helps her view the world in a different light—just in time for Christmas. When Jenny Wright becomes involved in an online romance with someone she knows only as “C,” she can’t get enough of their conversations. Flirting online helps Jenny temporarily escape confronting the innumerable changes to her life as she slowly loses her vision. It’s easier having a relationship with someone behind a computer screen, someone with whom she doesn’t have to share every intimate detail of her life. Jenny’s occupational therapist, Evan Carlisle-Ford, is helping her prepare for the challenges ahead. But the forthright, trustworthy man can no longer ignore his growing attraction to his fiercely intelligent client. His only option is to end their professional relationship . . . and embrace a romantic one. Now Jenny must choose between the safe, anonymous “C”—or the flesh-and-blood Evan, whose heated kisses can melt snow faster than it can fall. And after receiving an unexpected present for Christmas, Jenny just may find the courage to let down her defenses and trust—in herself, and in the possibility of lasting love. Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from another Loveswept title.",
