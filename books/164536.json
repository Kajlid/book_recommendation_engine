  "description": "Amongst other things, I’m Just Sitting on a Fence chronicles Dax Flame’s travels in India, Hollywood, Rome, Mexico, San Francisco, and the Grand Canyon, where he volunteers at an orphanage, auditions with a movie star, falls in love, kills a fish, goes through a nervous breakdown, and has an epiphany-inducing near-death experience. But that may be misleading; there’s more to it than that.",
