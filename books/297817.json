  "description": "Some stories paint us sweet, told to children as they fall asleep.Mother Earth she weaves the world with a whirl of her magic, and her kind embrace shapes us all. Father Time keeps us all, ever constant, ever moving onwards, for time never stands still.Icy hands and a frozen touch, Jack Frost ushers in the cold snap, coating the earth with sparkly delights. If Jack brings cold, May Queen brings warmth, her delicate touch bringing forth the spring.Follow the rainbow and maybe youâ€™ll find, a Leprechaun with his lucky pot of gold. The tooth fairy dances through the night, collecting teeth, and leaving shiny coins behind.The watchful eyes of Man in the Moon keeps all of the secrets of the night, shining down on us with his silvery light. The Sandman is here to soothe you to sleep, bringing all to slumber with a pinch of magic dust. Shhh, sleep now. Beware the Boogeyman lurking out of sight, waiting under your bed, to catch naughty children in the night. Be good little children, for Santa is watching, and he knows if you've been naughty or nice.Tales of lore, fair music to our ears. Can you hear it? Did you know? Not every tale is sweet. The truth is darker, our stories more twisted, unlike the rhymes that children hear.All proceeds will be donated to Save the ChildrenThis is a mixed M/F and M/M anthology that contains trigger warnings for its dark content. It is intended for a mature audience of 18+.",
