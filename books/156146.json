  "title": "Heartbeat",
  "description": "Heartbeat By Yuriko Hime I felt a longing to trail my hands on her body. To explore and know the vampire who managed to steal my heart. I inched closer, every single cell of my body hyper aware of her nearness. The music picked up its rhythm, and we swayed with each other, a dance of seduction that slowly but surely consumed my mind. My eyes automatically went to her lips, frozen in a half-smile, tempting, coaxing me to kiss her. In this moment, my sickness, my parents and siblings, every thought seemed to vanish, except her and me. Sweat trickled down my back. I leaned nearer, nearer, feeling her breath on my face. I opened my mouth, ready to taste the forbidden fruit in front of me.
