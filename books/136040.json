  "description": "Kevin Huizenga introduces his everyman Glenn Ganges (previously seen in the acclaimed Drawn and Quarterly Showcase and Or Else ) to the \"Ignatz\" family with this suite of all-new stories. Ganges tries to decide what to do when confronted with \"The Litterer\"; gets into an argument with his wife Wendy about The Beatles' \"She's Leaving Home\"; indulges in some whimsical \"Time Travelling\" while on a walk around his neighborhood; and more! Huizenga's elegant neo-clear-line style brings a crispness and humor to these low-key slice-of-life stories, and the gray-blue duotone he has picked gives the art a new depth and complexity",
