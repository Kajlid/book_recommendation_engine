When he pulls Maggie from the charred ruins of her chateau, he knows her for what she is -- the final, dangerous flower of a noble line. He's ruthless enough to use her for his own ends. And Maggie has come up with some interesting plans for Doyle. As they're drawn inexorably into the intrigue and madness of revolutionary Paris, they gamble on a love neither of them will admit. When the dance of deception and desire is over, which one of them will betray the other?",
