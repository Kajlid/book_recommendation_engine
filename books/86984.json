  "title": "3 Fun Tales About Monsters",
  "description": "Whether your child fears the dark, the sounds your house makes, or swimming, this triad of tales is for you. We all have monsters to deal with, yet we tend to forget what we had to face as children. So why not have a little fun in exposing these fears to your child the right way, by having a good laugh. Things aren't always what children think they are, so this illustrated book does the trick by identifying monsters, while revealing the truth. 3 Fun Tales About Monsters is targeted at younger children who are early readers. The sentences are relatively easy with illustrated pictures to help tell the story. This book would be most suitable for children up through second grade, although this may depend upon your own child's progress. The story was developed to help children cope with their fears of the dark, noises, and swimming by identifying scary situations and bringing humor into the mix.",
