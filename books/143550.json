  "description": "People disappear all the time in Caroline's fading city. They go off in search of jobs, they follow predatory men, or their addictions swallow them whole. But in the last year, the number of missing has skyrocketed, and Caroline is terrified her unstable, addict mother will be next. Not wanting to lose her only parent, she sets out to find the reason, hoping if she knows what's going on, she can save her mother.​What she discovers are literal monsters: demons from another dimension and angels so long forgotten by God that some doubt they’re even real. She finds an ally in a new friend, Dani, but it ends up he isn't even human, and may be more involved in the missing than he'd like to admit. The closer Caroline gets to the heart of the disappearances, the more danger she finds herself in. The fight for her mother becomes a fight for her survival as she is thrust into a dangerous, supernatural world seemingly bent on making Caroline vanish forever.",
