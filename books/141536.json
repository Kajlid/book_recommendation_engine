  "description": "Elizabeth Carter had it all; a fulfilling relationship, a successful career and a home she loved. That all changed the day her fianc√© Michael was tragically killed. Now, fleeing from the well-intentioned platitudes of her friends and family, and an increasingly aggressive agent urging her to start painting again, Liz tries to find peace in the solitude of the rugged mountains of Pennsylvania. Having lost her inspiration, and with her faith in jeopardy, she hopes to rekindle the memories of Michael that she once held dear. If only she could move beyond her grief, she could live again. But before she can do that, she must learn to forgive herself and let go of the guilt that threatens to weigh her down. God has the power to heal her heart, but will Liz have the strength to hand over her burden and accept redemption?",
