  "description": "Nineteen year old genius Olisbeth Mason has had insufferable migraine headaches since her twelfth birthday. Her headaches made her different: a friendless freak. Now, she is out on her own, a junior in college, and has found a group of friends that don't treat her like a freak: her roommate Phoebe, her boyfriend (and Phoebe's twin brother) Arthur, and her landlady Marissa. Through her friends, Olisbeth discovers she can send her headaches to other people. But her friends are hiding a dark and dangerous secret from her. Olisbeth is the human incarnation of Athena, Phoebe is Apollo, and her boyfriend is Artemis. And Olisbeth is at the center of a 2,000 year old prophecy that will shake Olympus to its very core.",
