  "description": "In the autumn of 1975, the town of Trent, North Carolina, struggles with the mysterious and brutal murder of Brandon Pierce, a gay teenager found dead in his parents' bed following a high-school keg party. As Thomas Edgecombe, the editor of the town's newspaper, diligently reports on the crime, he begins to suspect that his two sons may know more about the murder than they're letting on. Daniel, a straight-A student and a friend of the victim, seems destined for a prestigious college scholarship and a better life while his younger brother Pete numbs his adolescent pain in a haze of marijuana smoke and derelict behavior. Once the investigation closes in on the two brothers they make a desperate bid for freedom, escaping north across the lush Virginia landscape to rendezvous with sudden tragedy in the redlight precincts of Washington, D.C.",
