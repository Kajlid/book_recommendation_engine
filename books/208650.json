  "description": "\"You look something.\" Jennifer had heard this her entire life as a \"white-washed\" half-Cherokee, half-white girl in a small Oregon town. THE WRONG KIND OF INDIAN is a thinly-veiled memoir-style story of what it means to claim your identity after a dysfunctional childhood steeped in sexuality and eventual homelessness, parents who toe the line between neglect and abuse, and the flailing that occurs when you don't feel like you belong. Spanning the challenging bridge across 30 - from 27 to 34 years old - and set in the Pacific Northwest, Costa Rica and India, The Wrong Kind of Indian is a journey of cultural pride, self exploration, and search for love through Oregon, Costa Rica and India.",
