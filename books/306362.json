  "description": "I live a happy life. I have a lover that I am quickly falling for. I have friends and family that rely on me to keep my territory safe and secure for them. My bar’s business is booming.But I’ve made enemies, some that I know and some that I don’t. Hate for me and the life I’m building is creeping in the darkness.Hate can be insidious. It can stain the purest of hearts and fog the sharpest of minds. It can come from the most unlikely of places. It can show up behind a smile just as easily as at the end of the barrel of a gun. It comes in many shades, coloring the way people see the world and each other.My name is Jacky Leon. I’m a werecat, a daughter of Hasan. I’ve fought for what I believe in and will do so until my last breath but…Everything I’ve built is being threatened and I didn’t see it coming.",
