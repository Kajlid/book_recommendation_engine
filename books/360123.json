  "description": "According to The New Enlightenment, ''If religions could be made more reasonableâ€¦ [they] could become a more positive force and begin to achieve their core purpose of spiritual guidance.''It is with this premise that this author starts his quest. Has religion in the past 30 centuries been a cause of human problems instead of a solution? Is religion often ''a proxy for tribal and national interests?'' Are doctrinal religions becoming especially dangerous today as the philosophical underpinnings for increasingly destructive political movements based upon uncompromising, fundamentalist viewpoints? In this profound and intriguing philosophical treatise, Grady Means argues effectively that humans are spirit-seeking creatures who need a different God than the anthropomorphic deities advanced by doctrinal religions. To overcome the effects of traditional ''Theonomics''-- religions as fundamentally economic and political entities, driven by predictable forces of supply and demand -- mankind must seek out a new rationalism, not unlike that of the 18th Century and the founding of America, in which humans find spiritual comfort through their free minds and souls.",
