  "description": "Jon, 18, is a bunny shifter who's very youthful-looking for his age...and very gay. He's so happy with life on Sweet Briar Farm, now that he's safe and free from bullies. Fitch, 17, is a skunk shifter who just arrived. Trusting anyone is hard for him, and he throws up a barrier of assumed toughness. He's survived a lot of pain and doesn't want more. But he can't resist Jon's warm friendliness. The two boys are drawn inexplicably to one another. Will they be friends for life...or more than friends? And what, precisely, does that mean for two boys who'd never been particularly interested in sex?Sweet Briar Farm is a place for them to heal, to find themselves, and to find each other...whatever that means to the two of them.",
