What's wrong with me?If that's ever crossed your mind, and if you know there's more to life than what you've been living, this book is for you.It sucks to acknowledge that you are what's keeping you from the life you want. You sacrifice what you want most for what you want in the moment. You know everything you're supposed to do, and yet you feel stuck--limited by your past, overwhelmed by your future--in a purgatory of your own behavior.After decades of feeling trapped by this mindset, Elizabeth Benton shifted her whole life by proving her own stories wrong. In this book, Elizabeth will help you live a new story, in which you can, you will, and you already have everything you need to make it happen.",
