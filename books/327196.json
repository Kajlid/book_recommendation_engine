  "title": "The Beast",
  "description": "Once upon a time, I fell in love with two men. Gaeton, with his brash charm and casual cruelty. Beast, his lust equal to his penchant for violence. Their feelings for me were matched only by their hatred for each other. Being with them was sinful and perfect in different ways. In the end, I couldn't choose, and I lost them both. Now, my sisters have tasked me with securing our power base, no matter the cost. I will do anything for my family-even if it means agreeing to the terms set by Gaeton and Beast. The three of us. Together. But only for as long as it takes me to choose one of them once and for all. When playing games of power, happily ever after isn't a priority. Not even for me. Especially not for me.",
