  "description": "Amira Badir, a young woman from a wealthy family in the Middle Eastern country of al-Remal, lives a life of luxury in opulent palaces. But repressive al-Remal discourages intelligence and initiative, so her life is also one of stark wearing designer gowns at home, but never stepping outside without being swathed in black veils and accompanied by an escort.Amira is not prepared for the sadistic savagery of her new husband, nor for the increasing control he exerts over her. Fearing for her safety, she escapes with her baby to start a new life in the United States. But her past—and her powerful husband—won't give her up easily. . . .",
