For Zelda Bowen it means carrying on with the tradition of visiting, Pops, her cantankerous and ill-tempered grandfather. Armed with his beloved burgers, she shows up at his retirement home ready to do the usual battle with the old codger. But is Zelda visiting out of respect for her grandfather or with a plan to ambush her own dad when he visits the old man? Both heartbreaking and hilarious, Where’s Your Daddy? shows you are never too old to change or too hurt to forgive.",
