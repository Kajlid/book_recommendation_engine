  "description": "When an expedition team travels through a time portal to the year 1815 at Hidden Lake, Montana, they're hoping for a better life. A place and time to start their world over again, untouched by the corruption and greed of modern society. Little do they know, two of their five leaders have an ulterior motive. Gael, Colin, Jenna, Jessica, and Levi are the five leaders. They have such dreams of a new history for their little colony. But Colin and Jenna are actually arriving in this new-old place for another reason. There's a 10,000 year old idol of the Egyptian Magic god, Thoth. What has he got to do with a time-travelling expedition colony? Why has Colin and Jenna kept this a secret? What do they have up their sleeves? Will things ever be the same? Do these people still have hope for a better tomorrow? If you enjoy Magic vs. Technology fantasies riddled with time-travel, alternate timelines, and immortality, this urban fantasy just might throw you for a whirl.",
