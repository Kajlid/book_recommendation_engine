  "description": "Vicki Bradford might work for the most ruthless sports agent in the business, but she's no quitter, even when she hits the lowest of career lows--acting as a glorified babysitter to NASCAR's disruptive newcomer, Brandon Burke. But his devilish grin and the gleam in his eye tell her he won't be so easy to tame....Brandon isn't about to let his wild ways on and off the track be tempered by a buttoned-up stunner hired to make him behave. And he's not above a little pulse-pounding game of seduction to send her running. But one kiss ignites something powerful between them. And now it's a matter of how to avoid the crash and burn of two opposites steering recklessly toward love.",
