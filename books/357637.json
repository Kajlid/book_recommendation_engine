  "description": "He was sculpture-perfect but had a tangled feel. Shadow and radiance.  He didn't look much older than her, until she saw the arrogance in his posture. Then, he reminded her of the faeries who walked through the courts and crowds confident that they could slaughter everyone in the room. Like chaos in a glass cage. \"Come dance.\" Ani turned her back and let herself be swept into the crowd. Alluring romance, heart-stopping danger and sinister intrigue combine in the penultimate volume of Melissa Marr's bestselling Wicked Lovely series.",
