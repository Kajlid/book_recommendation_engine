  "description": "Eddie, the novelâ€™s main character, is battling a mid-life crisis when the idea strikes him that he is smart enough to get away with murder. Having suddenly become the recipient of limitless free time, he is seeking a hobby to relieve his doldrums, and homicide seems like a viable option. The entire story is told in his words, lending a unique perspective into the motivation of an aspiring serial killer. The reader is privy to every tormented thought, convoluted rationale and psychotic escalation as Eddie evolves in unexpected directions. Yet, in spite of his flaws, it becomes difficult to avoid relating to this man of tribulation. So much of his imperfect past is universal to our common, human experience. Hate him, or love him, he is enthralling, and he's anxious to share his secrets.",
