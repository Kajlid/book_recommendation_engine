She can use her ancient powers to hydroshift, but she's still figuring out how to be smooth out of the water.Sheltered behind the palace walls, Jet trains to become queen of a secret island. All that changes when she's forced to accept a mission she isn't prepared for — fitting in at high school. Jet's powers, never before tested, are pushed to their limits. Jet learns that handling high school life is just as complicated and dangerous as the mystery that brought her there. Jet's journey leads her to friendship, romance, and her first taste of freedom. But betrayal threatens to take all that away. Jet faces an enemy that could cost her everything she loves. She must succeed…or die trying.",
