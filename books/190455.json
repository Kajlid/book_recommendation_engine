  "description": "FOR AHREN, IT'S NO LONGER A QUESTION of someone trying to kill him; it's who will try next.  Still on the run for a murder he didn’t commit, Ahren adapts to life as an outlaw as his reputation of the Black Raven grows. Yet nothing comes easy. Dogged by bounty hunters, he finds himself crossing steel with pirates on the high seas and battling monsters in subterranean cities. If that wasn’t enough, he’s paid to assassinate an immortal and must break out of a heavily-fortified prison.  Just another day in the life of the Black Raven.  SEA OF QUILLS is the second book in this collection of tales by Seth Skorkowsky, the author of DAMOREN and the best-selling Valducan urban fantasy series.  PRAISE \"Punctuated by gritty outlaw-versus-outlaw capers and the most vividly narrated tales of a fantasy rogue's trade-craft I've ever read.\" —Clay Sanger, Reviewer",
