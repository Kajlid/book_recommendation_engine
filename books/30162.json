Big Oil + Sex = Game OnIf you can't imagine one thing Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olbermann could agree on, you need to read a novel both sides of the political spectrum will find laughing-out-loud funny. Our toxic political atmosphere could use a few grins.Fred Underwood, a failed English teacher fired long before retirement age, now makes his living as a package deliveryman. Seeing a gasoline station advertising its per gallon price at $4.15, an idea strikes him—how to use the political system to get rich. He will run as a Democratic candidate in an all Republican area for the state’s House of Representatives on an ultra-liberal campaign of nationalizing the oil industry, socializing medicine and banning handguns. His accomplice, Zoe, the female bartender he lusts for, will run against him so there will be a Democratic primary. He theorizes his campaign will encourage Big Oil and other special interests groups to donate money to her campaign and they will share the proceeds.Thus begins a wild and very funny read.",
