  "description": "I’m rich, angry and powerful, and I have one thing in my sights—revenge.Nothing’s going to stop me from executing my plan and taking down the man who dares to call himself my father. Not even her.With curves for days, hair a man can wrap his fist around, and a mouth begging to be owned, Temple thinks she can stop me. Dragging her into my world, putting a target on her back—it’s all part of the plan.Claiming her wasn’t.But now I’m addicted to playing her traitorous body like a weapon, and the only thing that will save me is sacrificing her.There’s a reason they call me ‘Sin’.*DEVIANT SIN is a standalone in the Cruel Desires series",
