He wasn’t supposed to be my teacher.  He did things to my body that no man had ever done before. Things I wanted him to do again And again. And again.  But the man I had in my bed two days ago was now off limits.  He was my teacher. I was his student.  I couldn’t have him... I wanted him anyway.  First Semester is a 50,000 word standalone novel and the first in The Campus Tales series.",
