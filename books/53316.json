  "description": "THEY WERE FROM OPPOSITE WORLDS…Libby Summerfield can’t wait to get out of Deadman’s Gulch—a lawless mining town filled with gunfights, brawls, and uncivilized mountain men—men like Logan St. John. Stranded there with a new baby, the pretty widow tries to make the best of it. But she vows to return to the refinement of Boston as soon as the weather clears and the stage resumes its run. Maybe then her heart would stop quickening at the thought of Logan’s gentle touch.…AND IN AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATIONLogan St. John knows Deadman’s Gulch is no place for a woman—especially one who single-handedly turns him into a church-going family man. Of all the crazy things! The sooner she and her precious baby leave for Boston the better. But how could he stand to lose this spirited woman who tamed this wild western town—and melted his heart of stone forever?",
