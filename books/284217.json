  "description": "\"The original illustrations, marvelously expressive black and white drawings by Fulvio Testa, form the ideal complement for Burgess's text.\" — The Emerald City Book ReviewEdmund Ironside, Edward the Confessor, Edward the Elder, Edward the Martyr . . .  Edgar wearies of an endless history lecture on England's Anglo-Saxon kings and longs for an escape from the classroom—which he finds with a sudden plunge through a tiny hole in his desk. Now Edgar is on the shores of Easter Island, listening to the chiming of Easter bells, and searching for Edenborough, from whence he must find his way home in time for tea. Like Lewis Carroll's Alice, Edgar finds himself astray in a wonderland, his bizarre adventures highlighted by gloriously nonsensical conversations with curious creatures.Anthony Burgess, the acclaimed author of A Clockwork Orange, plays with logic and language in this captivating lost classic. Studded with Joycean puns and fantastical words, the dreamlike odyssey offers a passing nod to the concepts of free will and relativity and can be appreciated by readers of all ages. This edition marks a return to print for A Long Trip to Teatime, which has been unavailable since the late 1970s. Newly republished in the centennial of Burgess's birth, this volume features the charming original illustrations by artist Fulvio Testa.",
