  "description": "Charlie Walker doesn’t believe in God or the supernatural. But Charlie’s views change when he takes the biggest risk of his life―he quits his job to write the novel he’s always wanted to write. The problem is that Charlie is a method writer. Since he’s writing horror, he needs to experience horror. Charlie begins to dabble with the supernatural and experiences the paranormal around his house. Messages appear on mirrors, furniture moves, and his kids start seeing things. Charlie is so lost in his book that he can’t see how it’s affecting his family. He thinks if he just stops, it will all wash away. It doesn’t. Friends convince Charlie that his only choice is to find God to save his family and home. Charlie becomes the unlikely hero in a supernatural battle. As he fights for his home and family, he meets his guardian angel and the demon assigned to him. Is Charlie going crazy? Is there really a supernatural war taking place around Charlie’s home, the neighborhood mailbox, and local swimming pool? Homemade Haunting is a comedy, thriller, and allegory―just the type of story expected from Rob Stennett.",
