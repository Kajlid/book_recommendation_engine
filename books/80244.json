  "description": "Like a shade, I walked in silence unseen by anyone. Until I needed to feed.Rufus Hobster is not my real name. It did not become my name until I saw it chiselled on a gravestone one moonlit night and claimed it as my own. It was not until I found a name I realised I had once been a man. From that night onwards, I endeavoured to become more human.London in the 1800â€™s taught me what it meant to be mortal. Made me understand why a human should never fall in love with a vampire.",
