  "description": "It wasn’t my fault. I didn’t even see her. There was a bump, and the next thing I knew, she was sitting in my passenger seat. Hitting her with my car didn’t kill her. She was already dead when I smashed into her. But sitting beside me, smiling, wearing a tie-dye outfit from the Hippie era of the 1960s, she didn’t look like a ghost. She looked great for a dead girl. I kept driving. She had things to say. She was saying that she’d be happy to be my “old lady” now. I'm just trying to stay in control of the car and not freak out at the girl suddenly beside me. When the car stops swerving into the oncoming lane, we’ll find out where this dead Hippie chick came from. What does she mean, she’s my old lady?",
