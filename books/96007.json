  "description": "A short story.Utopia gone sour.They say Blackrock used to be a beautiful place. The mountains shimmered with gold and the lake teemed with fish, until the forefathers boarded it over from shore to shore. It was on these planks one man built his dream: a village free of ailment and neglect.But then the imprisoned lake turned.One hundred years later and the Plankers know nothing of beauty, only the ruins of a lunatic's failed ideals and the caustic poison ever-seeping up from below their feet. Murder and corruption gild everyday life under the Blackrock mob, but more frightening than the dangerous walk home is the recent plague of disappearances, and the dozens of mysterious holes punched through the boards to the black depths below...Welcome to The Planks",
