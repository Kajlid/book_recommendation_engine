  "description": "I’m an introvert who prefers books to boys and written punch lines to lines to the rum-spiked punch bowl.After a bad breakup, I take a study abroad semester and notice I’m not the only one who’s “studying.”The scorching hot older man who owns the salsa studio I pass by each day can’t keep his eyes off me.He’s the definition of tall, dark, and handsome and I can see he wants nothing more than to get his hands all over my curves.But dancing, and doing much of anything that doesn’t involve reading, isn’t my forte, until my salsa stalker shows me my ex-boyfriend was wrong. I’m anything but boring.And now I’m going to show him what my ex never got to see, all of me, for the first time.But is this just a steamy night of revenge that I might regret, or will my salsa stalker show me that this is real, and my first time with him is something that will last forever?*Salsa Stalker is an insta-everything standalone instalove romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.",
