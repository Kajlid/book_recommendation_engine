They need us to keep water in their kingdom flowing, without it, their kind would surely all perish; as not even the powerful Fae have control over the waters that feed life to everything.Somewhere along the line, they all lost that ability as if that element revolted against them.For over twenty-one years Iâ€™ve been kept in the dark about my true heritage, being raised as a witch like my auntie, that can wield water with spells.Soon I would be old enough to leave my childhood home and go beyond the protection spell that has kept me safe all these years, to seek out my destiny.A vision, perhaps even a prophecy, in the castle where I was born caused my parents to secret me away under the cover of darkness. Saved by an unlikely partnership.For the first time in thousands of years, the elements are set to combine into the greatest power ever known, and somehow I am the center of it all.The power of the elements are told to bring about peace in the lands and restore life in the realm; to a greatness more than it has ever been before.No more struggles for food, no more starvation. No more taxation with penalties of death. No more hatred and fear of the rulers of the kingdom. Only prosperity, health, and maybe even something more?Please note: This is a Reverse Harem Novel. It contains explicit content intended for adults only. 18+",
