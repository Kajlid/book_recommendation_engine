  "title": "Men of Valor: The Powerful Impact of a Righteous Man",
  "description": "Each righteous priesthood holder has the potential to make an enormous difference â€” in his family, in the community, and in the Church. Men of Valor uplifts and encourages the men of the Church, reminding them of their importance, while cautioning them not to be too hard on themselves. Most actively engaged Latter-day Saints are doing better than they give themselves credit for, even as they strive to make important improvements. The book reminds readers that every man who leads his family in righteousness can have a powerful leavening effect on a society whose moral values are rapidly eroding. Men will appreciate the call to purify their lives, to set themselves apart from things of worldliness, and to become a royal priesthood and a holy nation.",
