  "description": "Tarrytown, New York. A quiet little town occasionally referred to as Sleepy Hollow and definitely not the place Anna Forester had planned to spend her Thanksgiving. Her plan had been to spend her brief vacation blending into the vibrant evening scene of New York City. But it seemed that the fates had other plans for her.  Literally.  Enter Cillian Blake, the small town’s resident outcast and… murder suspect? Her plans for a secluded Thanksgiving are turned upside down as she finds herself falling into a world of mythology and legend come to life. Especially when they discover that Anna happens to be the last of a line of creatures meant to destroy werewolves – like Cillian.",
