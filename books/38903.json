  "description": "\"The perfect piece of noir fiction.\" ― New York Times Book Review \"Terse, brutal, poetic, perfectly wrought.\" ― Publishers Weekly STARRED review At the end of Drive , Driver has killed Bernie Rose, \"the only one he ever mourned,\" ending his campaign against those who double-crossed him. Driven tells how that young man, done with killing, becomes the one who goes down \"at 3 a.m. on a clear, cool morning in a Tijuana bar.\" Seven years have passed. Driver has left the old life, become Paul West, and founded a successful business back in Phoenix. Walking down the street one day, he and his fiancée are attacked by two men and, while Driver dispatches both, his fiancée is killed. Sinking back into anonymity, aided by his friend Felix, an ex-gangbanger and Desert Storm vet, Driver retreats but finds that his past stalks him and will not stop. He has to turn and face it. Because he drives. That's what he does.",
