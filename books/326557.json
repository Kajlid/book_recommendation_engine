  "description": "I want to take this opportunity to explain what this book is about. It is about sperm and egg donors, and real parents who may or may not take responsibility for their actions. I am not talking about the people who attend the sperm banks or surrogate mothers or women who let people use their eggs to bring life into this world. Those people are blessing others for shortcomings, that they may have. You will see the words donor and real parent, a lot but look at the explanation first.A sperm and egg donor, to me are men and women who have children and do not take care of the blessings that God has presented them with in their lives.A ''real\" parent is the parent that is there everyday in the daily activities of the child. The real parent is the parent who is the key factor in the child's life. The real parent takes the responsible role for the child. The real parent is also the Child's First Teacher and the positive guide in the child's life, on all levels.",
