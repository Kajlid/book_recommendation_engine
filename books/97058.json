  "description": "Mr. Mulliner is the genial Scheherazade of the Anglers’ Rest, a bucolic English pub. Each evening, sipping his Scotch and lemon, Mr. Mulliner tells of an adventure that once befell a nephew, a cousin’s son, or some other un-stuffy younger relative. Mr. Mulliner’s narratives showcase Wodehouse’s particular genius for fetching whimsy and eccenric shenanigans.",
