  "description": "My name is Landon Hamilton.I’m a ghost.I died five years ago, except I didn’t get to rest in peace like most of the departed. Instead, I was tapped by Dante (yes, that Dante) in Purgatory to become his champion and save humankind from the rest of the Divine - you know, angels and demons and their mortal followers.It seemed like a great deal at the time. I would answer my calling as a diuscrucis (a perfect balance of angel, demon, and human) by getting sent back to the mortal world, inheriting the ‘magic’ to bend the universe to my will, and saving humanity from devastation.Hindsight… it sucks.Yeah, I saved the world; but my vampire almost-girlfriend, Rebecca, stabbed me in the back (literally), I was forced to kill my angel best-friend, Josette, I’ve got a snarky werewolf taking up residence in my soul, and to be honest, I’m getting tired of the whole damn thing.I don’t eat, don’t sleep, and barely feel. I’ve become obsessed with the Demon Queen’s warning, and the only thing keeping me hanging onto any shred of my humanity is Josette’s daughter Sarah.Except… now she’s gone.She was taken right out from under my nose, and I don’t know by who or for what purpose. What I do know is that I’ll do whatever it takes to get her back, and there isn’t an angel, demon, or god that can stop me.It’s a good thing I’ve still got my anger.",
