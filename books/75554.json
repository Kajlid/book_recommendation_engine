  "description": "As you sleep and dream, the Wee Hours appear when the clock strikes one, two, three and four. These delightfully mischievous creatures pull books from your shelves and build towers from your shoes, put on plays behind your curtains and do backflips off your bedposts. As morning draws near, the older hours emerge to tidy up the mess the Wee Hours have made, and carry them off to bed.Â Readers ages three and up will enjoy finding numbers, clocks and magical surprises on every page of this enchanting book.",
