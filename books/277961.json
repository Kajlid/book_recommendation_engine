A very real — and very dead — leathery body is revealed.This has quickly become the most realistic fright house she’s ever experienced.For the first time that night, Avery feels a jolt of fear. And a dash of adrenaline as a new case falls into her lap.The next day, an old school friend tumbles to her death over Bow Falls. Her horror-struck husband faints. But did she fall or was she pushed?Either way, his new lady friend seems too close for comfort.Avery must piece together a very cold case and a very cold-blooded murder. But nothing is ever clear-cut in Dacus. Can she straighten things out?",
