  "description": "What happens when the veteran K9 handler goes down to Texas to protect his deployed battle buddy’s sister from men intent on taking the family bar? When his deployed Army K9 buddy asks him to drop everything and haul a$$ down to Texas to protect his little sister, Karden and his dog Kiki don’t hesitate to answer the call. He also doesn’t expect to fall for her. She’s sassy, supple, and perfectly antagonistic—all the things that get his blood pumping. She’s in danger, which brings all of his protective instincts roaring to life. When the new big bads of her little town threaten her because she won’t sell her bar, Karden has to use his military contacts to persuade them to find another investment. Sylvie Santiago, aka little Saint, doesn’t have a halo around her head. According to her overprotective big brother Saint, they get in the way of her devil horns. She’s hyper-independent, a magnet for trouble, and doesn’t understand the meaning of “backing down from a fight.” She doesn’t need or want Karden’s protection, but one look at him and she has no problem keeping him close. The eye candy alone is worth his overbearing presence. Her brother will kill her for coming on to his best friend, but he won’t get a chance if the Lupino brothers get to her first. She’s in over her head, and only the big, bad, broken man from Colorado seems to be able to protect her, even from herself.",
