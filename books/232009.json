  "description": "‘Tis one thing to be tempted, another thing to fall. – William ShakespeareTemptation is a wild dance, a tug of war of will, of faith, testing your limits, stretching your boundaries until you succumb to its wicked spell. Once it’s touched you, tainted you, there’s no turning back. It stays with you, feeding your doubts, nurturing your insecurity.Love … it can only go so far until it can no longer heal you. When your soul seeks for something darker, an element harder to define, and you find yourself lost, forever searching for that missing piece that promises to complete you, there’s no turning back.Like a ticking time bomb, I knew sooner or later, everything would begin to crumble.I should’ve known better.",
