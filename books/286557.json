  "description": "Sixteen-year-old Alicía Diaz’s parents have been in a stable, nurturing polyamorous relationship all her life, so and dating both a boy and a girl in high school doesn’t seem like a big deal to her. When Allie crashes the car during an impromptu driving lesson, there’ll be no more driving for her until it’s paid in full. Her love life crashes next: she finds out her girlfriend is moving away, and that she told her new boyfriend before telling Allie. She’s determined to handle it all on her own, but then other kids start harassing her to the point of threatening her summer job – the one she really needs to pay off her accident. Allie doesn’t know how she’s going to make everything work. But she knows she has to stay true to herself.",
