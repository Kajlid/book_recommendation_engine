  "description": "On the day her husband dies, Alexandra Winter's fragile world begins to disintegrate. To date, her life has been built on a sham - a materialistic fantasy world that had rotated solely around Richard Winter's law career. After discovering his awful betrayal, and with no real friends or family to rely on, Alex flees her city life in desperation. And she turns up in a very unexpected place. The Black Forest of Northern Pennsylvania was merely a dot on a map, until Alex ended up lost in the middle of its wild interior, millions of acres in size. Jamie Sheldon is a forester with an unbreakable love of the mountainous land and of his family's farm. He happens upon Ms. Alexandra Winters alone in the woods - a hard, cold shell of a woman with an arrogant city attitude straight from hell. But as Alexandra's bitter layers recede beneath her intensely mounting attraction to Jamie, and the promise of a fresh new start in a beautiful place, all bets are off. Alexandra impulsively relocates to the Black Forest, buying a dilapidated ranch surrounded by acres of magnificent forest - old growth virgin timber that has been protected by generations of a native family. Unknowingly, her rash decision places her directly in the path of a ruthless company that will stop at nothing to possess the property when its true value is discovered, including manipulation, threats, torture, and murder. Yet there is more to Eden Ranch than one would ever guess. Alex, Jamie, and his entire family will soon discover the true darkness that faces their homeland. With its cold advance, they will learn that he lush boundary of Eden's forests contains a power that has been guarded through generations.",
