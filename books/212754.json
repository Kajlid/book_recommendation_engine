  "description": "A visually stunning, comprehensive resource on North America’s birds of preyAlways a popular group of birds, raptors symbolize freedom and fierceness, and in Pete Dunne’s definitive guide, these traits are portrayed in hundreds of stunning color photographs showing raptors up close, in flight, and in action—fighting, hunting, and nesting.   These gorgeous photographs enhance the comprehensive, authoritative text, which goes far beyond identification to cover raptor ecology, behavior, conservation, and much more.   In returning to his forte and his first love, Pete Dunne has crafted a benchmark book on the first place to turn for any question about these highly popular birds, whether it’s what they eat, where they live, or how they behave.",
