  "title": "GURPS Robots: Bold Experiments, Faithful Servants, Soulless Killers",
  "description": "A cold-eyed stare from the shadows of the alley ... the spine-tingling scrape, scrape as metallic feet drag along the concrete ... the squeak and whirr of hinges and hydraulics as the machine approaches. The robot is an intriguing yet sinister being -- created to serve, but in many ways superior to its weak and fallible human masters. We need the robots. Do they need us? This book contains detailed rules for designing, building and playing robots -- from the tiniest nanobots to the mightiest megabots. You can create cyborgs, androids, and even biomorphs -- deadly fluid-metal machines that can take any shape.",
