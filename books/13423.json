  "description": "Eve, Michael, Shane, and Claire go to the EEK party one year after the events in The Dead Girls' Dance. When Michael ends up leaving and doesn't come back, Eve goes to search for him...Note: This novella is now available in the anthology The Eternal Kiss.What goes together better than Morganville and Halloween? Morganville, Halloween, Eve, Shane, a sinister stranger at a rave … This short story was originally printed in the Eternal Kiss anthology, edited by Trisha Telep, and I was delighted to write it. Michael’s a vampire, and Eve’s desperately in love and trying to make that Romeo-Juliet thing work.Miranda delivers another of her eerie prophecies, which hasn’t quite come true … yet? But who knows? More Morganville stories yet to be told.I always wanted to put the Glass House Gang in full costume; we got to do a little with Feast of Fools, but I wanted to see what they’d wear if they picked it themselves. Not sure it’s a total surprise, but it was a pleasure.",
