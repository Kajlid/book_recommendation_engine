  "description": "Colby Blanchard is the popular cheerleader with the grades, the hunky boyfriend, and the homecoming crown in the bag. Then things go bad-like turning-into-a-vampire bad. And complicating things is the fact that her orthodontist father has removed her canine teeth to give her a perfect smile, so she can't even do the vampire thing properly. Luckily, he's fitting her with some new headgear so she can feed. (So now she's not just a vampire but a dork.)  This lighthearted debut will have Buffy fans of all ages laughing and shuddering as Colby battles the Vampire Council, resists her attraction to a fellow vamp, and hunts down the rogue bloodsucker who got her in this mess in the first place-all while trying to snag a date for homecoming.",
