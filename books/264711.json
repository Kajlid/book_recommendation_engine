  "description": "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s the sexiest cowboy of them all…As a Beverly Hills princess, I prefer Egyptian sheets, designer clothing, and shopping on Rodeo Drive. Cleaning stables? Definitely not my thing.After my great aunt dies, I volunteer to go to Copper Creek, Montana to tie up loose ends and put the house she willed me on the market.The last thing I expect to find is irritating, yet sexier-than-sin Noah Daniels. ***Nine years ago, I left town only to return with a broken heart, a love for restoring vintage cars, and the plan to never leave Copper Creek again. When hotter-than-hell Kate Snow decides to fix up her great aunt’s house, turning down her offer isn’t an option. She needs the extra hands so she can meet her deadline. And I need the extra cash.But the job comes with additional perks: Hanging out with Kate. Teaching her about horses. The mind-blowing sex with her. What I haven’t planned on is for my heart to be a willing part of the deal—a deal that could result in Kate landing her dream job. In Beverly Hills.",
