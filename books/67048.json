  "title": "The True Story of Paul Revere's Ride",
  "description": "The true story of Paul Revere’s life and his midnight ride are presented in a fun and engaging way. Revere was a respected Boston citizen, an artisan, and a patriot. Students will be fascinated to see the facts separated from the legend, which contained instances of pure poetic license in Longfellow’s poem. Color photographs, paintings, and Revere’s own engraving illuminate colonial life and spur a sense of curiosity about the true stories of American history.",
