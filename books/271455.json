  "description": "Two men with a rocky history, and one with an all-consuming love for both of them.   Sometimes I’m so lonely I swear I can’t breathe. I bring men and women into my bed to chase away the ache, but it never seems to help. I want something real, something lasting, but I’ve never been more afraid of anything in my life. If I have nothing else in my life I can count on, at least I have my best friend, Cas. If I have nothing else in my life that feels solid, at least I have Cas.  Until one sad smile from a beautiful man tilts my world on its axis.  But Finn is Cas’ ex, and that means he’s off limits, right? What if I could have something permanent, if I’m willing to put my heart on the line? Finn and Cas may have a history, but something tells me the three of us could have a future, if we’re willing to let things get a little complicated. **This is a MMM spin-off of the HEATHENS INK series and there ARE appearances by your favorite Heathens Ink characters. However it CAN be read as a stand alone.",
