  "description": "Graham Cahill is a senior in college and the catcher and captain of the softball team. Her life is chaotic with her senior thesis due and graduation coming up. She's not thrilled when she has to spend extra time practicing with the new hotshot freshman pitcher. Despite being an all-star pitcher, Bailey Michaels is young and arrogant. She struggles at the mound and is not willing to admit she has a problem with ball control. Graham and Bailey are forced to get to know each other off the field in order to learn to work together on the field. Will the extra time pay off or will it drive a nail through the team?",
