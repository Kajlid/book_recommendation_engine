  "description": "The animals aren't the only thing wild in Alaska...  Missy Monroe and Pepper Lawson have a problem. She traded his engagement ring for a badge. She might patrol the town, but Pepper’s wealth and charm rules it. So when wildlife begins to disrupt the quirky residents of Timber Valley, Missy thinks there’s more to it than hungry bears in search of baked goods. Their trail of bakery crumbs lead her straight to Pepper’s Christmas Tree Farm and right into his arms. She always wanted to cuff the man—but not arrest him.  To get close, to find the answers, Missy might have to get High on the Mountain.",
