  "description": "The story he has to tell is one of trauma and heartache, but also of comradery, nobility, and the strength to survive. His story is private, but in a way it is also shared by anyone who puts on a uniform and serves. A United States Marine, he attempts to reclaim his life after returning from Iraq. In 500 Miles An Hour, retired Staff Sergeant Shawn Garrett displays not only the sharp reality of military service, but the healing power of sharing your story with others. Reality shines through in the brutal honesty, the intense emotions, and the brotherhood shared by those who give their all in the name of their country.",
