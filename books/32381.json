  "description": "\"A comic gem\" (Alexander McCall Smith) about a housewife who kisses her chintz and her cheating husband goodbye     Constance Harding lives in a picture perfect house. She is, however, absolutely clueless about the real world, e.g.,     *why her twenty-five-year-old son still hasn’t found a nice girl,     *why her Lithuanian housekeeper’s thongs keep turning up in her husband’s study, and     *why her teenage daughter is dressed in head-to-toe spandex . . .     When disaster strikes, she flees her comfortable nest. Constance is about to discover a wider world she thought it was too late to find. And she’s putting it all in her blog-thingy.",
