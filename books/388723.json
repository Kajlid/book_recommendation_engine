  "description": "Read the original books before you see the How to Train Your Dragon film! THE STORY CONTINUES in the third volume of Hiccup's How to Train Your Dragon memoirs ...Haddock III was an awesome sword-fighter, a dragon-whisperer and the greatest Viking Hero who ever lived. But it wasn't always like that. Hiccup's memoirs look back to when Hiccup was just an ordinary boy, and finding it very hard to be a Hero. Climbing on to a Roman Dragon Rustling ship by mistake in your first 'Boarding an Enemy Ship' lesson is bad enough. But to then discover that Alvin the Treacherous is also on board proves to Hiccup he couldn't have been more wrong, especially when he steals his copy of How to Speak Dragonese. Can Hiccup save the dragons and the day? How to Train Your Dragon is soon to be a DreamWorks film starring Gerrard Butler, America Ferrera and Jonah Hill, out in March 2010 adapted from the best selling How to Train Your Dragon series by Cressida Cowell.
