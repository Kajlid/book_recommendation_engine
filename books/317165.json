Banished by his king, the cat shifter is doing his best to keep it together… and failing. Who knew farming would be so hard? The sooner the cat takes over and drags him off into the woods for good, the better.Curse them all—if Verity could go back in time and slap every last one of her foolish fellow witches, she would in a heartbeat. Create an army of monsters hellbent on revenge? Not the witches’ smartest plan. There’s nothing left to do but run and hope that nothing with fangs catches up to her… especially while she sneaks a desperate night of sleep.The last thing Wilos needs is a witch hiding out on his farm. She’s beautiful and annoyingly alluring, but she’s a witch—and the sooner he gets rid of her, the sooner he can go back to being left alone.With half the kingdom hunting her and his cat watching her every move, getting rid of the stubborn creature might be easier said than done.Hexed Heart is a prequel novella to the Raven Falls shifter series!
