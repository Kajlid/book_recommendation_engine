  "description": "Nick Williams, heir to a vast fortune, lives with his lover, Carter Jones, in the Eureka Valley neighborhood of San Francisco at 137 Hartford Street in an unassuming bungalow. Little do the neighborhood ladies, who do their daily marketing on Castro Street, know that just down the street their neighbor is the richest homosexual since possibly Alexander the Great.  His no-nonsense secretary Marnie Wilson keeps things together at the office in the Tenderloin at 777 Bush Street. To her frustration, Nick is always turning away clients. He doesn’t really need the money, after all.  In The Amorous Attorney, Jeffrey Klein's love affair is heating up and Nick has to chase him down because, frankly, he needs a lawyer to set up his new business. Oh, and Eddie Mannix at Metro is on the warpath and being a general pain in Nick’s ass. After finding Jeffrey shacked up in a compromising position, Nick has to deal with his own personal mess when it comes to saying goodbye to an old flame.  After receiving a telegram asking for help, Nick and Carter end up flying south of the border, down Mexico way. When they get there, they find a corrupt politician, a flirtatious police captain, and a woman terrified of an uncertain future and what it holds for her.    Long before the Summer of Love, pride parades down Market Street, and the fight for marriage equality, San Francisco in 1953 was all about the Red Scare, F.B.I. investigations, yellow journalism run amok, and the ladies who play mah jong over tea.",
