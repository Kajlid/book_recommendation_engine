  "description": "Akane is the rarest of all creatures, a Kitsune; a fox demon of Japanese lore. She has no soul, only the precious pearl that she holds under her tongue; it is the source of her life and power. Her greatest desire is to have a soul of her own and she soon discovers that people are more than willing to sell theirs for money, power or fame. Nikolai and Thomas are an unlikely pair, a scientist and a blind priest, who uncover a book of dark magic called The Black Hen and the Thirteen Magic Rings. After a deadly run-in with a vengeful demon, Thomas vows never to use the book again. However, Nikolai, seduced by the book’s power, foolishly summons Akane to complete his masterpiece, never realizing his heart’s deepest desire may turn into his greatest defeat. Akane finds herself caught between two men, drawn into a fight with a demon more powerful than any she’s ever known, where death may be her only hope of escape. The Devil’s Fox is a spellbinding story that will wrench your soul and touch your heart. A literary tapestry entwined with vivid characters, a riveting plot and luxurious voice.
