  "description": "Only a vampire is man enough to teach werewolves how to fight.\nPretty librarian Sugar wants her life to stay quiet. That's hard enough when friends and neighbors turn into furry wolves every full moon. But when a hot vampire gets involved, life's bound to get complicated. The Omega have always been the pansies of the paranormal. Now Chicago's top werewolf pack has issued them a life or death challenge. Their only option: hire a vampire warrior to teach them the moves. Daedalus has been a powerful vampire for ages. Intrigued by the chance to train the geeks of the underworld, he wasn't bargaining on losing his heart to a human. Can he make the Omegas a success, fit into Sugar's quiet life, and avoid being ripped to shreds in the process?",
