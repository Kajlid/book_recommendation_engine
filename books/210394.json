  "description": "ESTHER: Everyone on campus thinks football hotshot, Saint Williams is a pious and righteous role model.  He has this whole university fooled. Not me.  I've seen a whole other sinful side to Mr. Touchdown. I've witnessed his swagger. Heard his filthy mouth and lost count how often he says the Lord's name in vain.  I can’t stand that man. So why is he starring in my dreams? Why do I have a carnal highlight reel in my mind, looping with images that have nothing to do with the game of football?  Now I’m the first-ever water girl for the university football team. My plan? I need to stay far, far away from temptation.  I’m here for the thrill of the game. Not to worship the sexy-as-sin Quarterback.  But from the first day of practice Saint's sultry gaze makes it perfectly clear that he intends to score.   SAINT: They call me Saint.  That’s because I’m a miracle on the football field. I’ve taken this cloistered, religious university and launched it into the national spotlight.  All I want is to play ball and get to know some of my lovely and devoted female fans. They flock to my games. They can't wait to offer me anything I want after the final play.  But all that changes when I catch sight of Esther. The water girl is the only girl on campus who doesn't want me.   That's okay because I like a challenge, I like strategy and I really like the idea of finally claiming Esther's heavenly body.  This standalone, full-length novel contains cursing, steamy sex scenes, no cheating, and a guaranteed happily ever after.",
