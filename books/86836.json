  "description": "Can a woman find love and happiness after searching for it everywhere?In this humorous novel, a self-help writer anxiously faces a milestone birthday by compulsively searching for a serious relationship. Meanwhile, concerned friends urge her to “Stop looking for love, just enjoy yourself.” From day spas to dominatrix dungeons, wacky encounters with cheaters, narcissists, and a college fantasy via Facebook, she perseveres with unbridled optimism. Passionate interludes cloud her thinking. Is Sara having a mid-life crisis? Will lots of sex be abundantly fulfilling -- or just create more laundry? As she fervently searches, her funny and sometimes dangerous amorous adventures take her high, low, and everywhere in between, yet ultimately lead to finding companionship and love in The Last Place She’d Look.The sex lives of women ages 45-60 are laughably laid bare in this raucous romp. It’s a bit of Bossypants meets 50 Shades of Grey. Or think Candace Bushnell’s Sex and the City babes, a decade older, with real life clothes, shoes and hair, set in Los Angeles.",
