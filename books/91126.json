  "description": "Love--and healing--can come from the most unexpected places...Sensual Healing, Book 3Still hurting physically and emotionally after a tragic car accident, Mia Nicholls has everything but love on her mind. Until quiet, sexy Colm Molony--a man who barely registered on her romantic radar--gives her a more-than-friends birthday kiss that really rings her bell.The minute he laid eyes on Mia, Colm knew she was trouble, which is one reason he's kept his distance. The other is that he'll be leaving New Zealand to go back to Ireland at summer's end. Yet when he touches Mia's watch, his supernatural ability to sense others' emotions kicks in, and his instinct to soothe her private pain overrides his intention to stay away.While away on a course together, talk leads to massage, then to a game of strip whist, culminating in a physical relationship that turns emotional faster than either expected. But when a shocking event threatens to upset Mia's tenuous equilibrium, Colm must untangle himself from his own past before he can save her wounded heart from slipping beyond his reach.",
