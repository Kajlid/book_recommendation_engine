Disguising herself as a boy, she finds a position taking care of an unhappy young child - cousin and heir to Sir Nicholas Laidley. This attractive gentleman's enjoyment of \"Adrian's\" company is surpassed only by his disdain for women, especially the beauty who jilted him as a young man.

And how can she keep from falling in love with him?",
