  "description": "It's been over a year since Master rescued me from the commune. Now, I live my amazing life with the man of my dreams as I pursue my career as a vlogger. The only problem is, as much as I love my master and the life we lead, I've sworn off all male friendships aside from Jake's--our next door neighbor. It's nothing personal. I just can't seem to get past... the one thing that tore into my soul and won't let go. I don't want to be this way. But I can't seem to help it...Will Master find a way to fix what's been broken?Or, am I destined to live my life jaded, thanks to a scarred past?I'm not a damn victim.If only my brain would get the memo. Read at your discretion. This novella contains a plethora of shameless sexual M/M content. Fun plot. Adult F'in language. A smidgen of mushy love. Taboo elements including those of consensual BDSM relationships. And whatever else that makes it unsuitable for anyone under the age of 18.- Can be read as a standalone, but it is highly suggested you read His Master first for the most enjoyment.24k Word novella.- See some of your favorite characters from His Boy and Corrupt Chaos series in this story.",
