  "description": "Blue isn't how most people picture a hardcore rock music fan - he's self-conscious, delicate, a little nerdy and a lot neurotic. But when he catches the interest of Rhys - the lead singer of his favorite band Collision In Reverse - after a concert, Blue just can't say no. Before he knows what's happening, the band is back on the tour bus and Blue's along for the ride. While he enjoys living an adventure for the first time in his life, Blue has to work hard to keep the favor of distant, enigmatic Rhys. He's clueless about life on tour and blunders his way from one awkward situation to the next, trying to fit in with the road crew, getting used to his status as a glorified groupie, and dealing with the mood swings of his selfish lover. His guileless charm eventually wins over the crew, and even Rhys seems to be growing fond of Blue. But just as Blue dares to hope that he is more to the singer than a convenient warm body, his world falls apart in one heart-shattering night, and not even love may be enough to put the pieces back together.",
