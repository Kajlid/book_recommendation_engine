  "description": "Guts the Black Swordsman and his companions brave the open sea, hoping to reach Puck's homeland, Elfhelm, and its powerful elven king, who might be able to restore the sanity of Guts' former lover, Casca. But seeking out a sanctuary for Casca means that Guts must postpone his hunt for his ex-friend and leader, Griffith, who has been reborn as a demon lord hell-bent on conquest. The winds of change blow fast and hard across the war-torn lands of the Holy See, and if Guts waits too long to exact his vengeance, Griffith might attain his murderous goals before Guts can return to Midland to stop him!",
