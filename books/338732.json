  "description": "Great college course on the history of fantasy literature from Beowolf to Harry Potter with lots of emphasis on Tolkien. I hate to listen to the last lecture because I don't want it to end. Guess I could just relisten.Drout is a philologist and develops the history through his study of words and folklore. After listening I have a geater appreciation than ever for the depth of Tolkiens Middle Earth and for Ursula LeGuin land. I will go back and read Beowulf again. He also looks at King Arthur legends, CS Lewis, and Donaldson. Good stuff!",
