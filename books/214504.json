  "title": "Scattered Reflections: Life through rhyme, verse, and form",
  "description": "A gem of a chapbook, Scattered Reflections is an eclectic romp through the chockablock playroom of its ever-accumulating, culturally urbane author. At once playful, regional, and accessible, it explores campfires with working cowhands, mans avant-garde sailing craft in regattas on dangerous seas, being robbed while commuting in a complex city, Scattered Reflections reaches the soul and touches the heart as it explores a love-hate relationship with poetry, the coming-of-age of a child, and the dichotomy of youth and age contrasted with its virtuoso ability to unite and endear generations.",
