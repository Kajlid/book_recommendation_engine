  "description": "The craftsman has waited centuries to fulfill his oath and aid the sons of man in their hour of need. He is the last of the sons of Ivaldi, the mighty dwarfs of Norse mythology who forged the weapons of the gods. Now, at last, he is called to ride out over land and sea, across the realms of Hell, and even through time itself to fight an ancient evil that refuses to die. But he is not alone. Unbeknownst to him, another has been called to join in the fight. But as a youth of only seventeen, born bent of spine and withered of limb, in a harsh and unforgiving world, will he find the courage he needs to be the wizard he is destined to be? The Craftsman and the Wizard is a classic tale of fantasy where the unlikeliest of heroes, armed only with truth and courage, love and self-sacrifice pit themselves against the darkest of arcane terrors â€“ and almost live to tell the tale. Come along on a whimsical escape into a world of what might have been, where you will learn that the weak can become strong, that good can triumph over evil, and that love is so powerful, it can even slay a god.",
