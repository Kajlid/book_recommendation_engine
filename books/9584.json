  "description": "In Driven to Distraction , Drs.  Hallowell and Ratey revealed why millions of  adults and children are chronic underachievers, caught  up in persistent problems in school, at work, and  at home. The cause is not lack of  self-discipline, but, rather, an inborn neurological condition,  Attention Deficit Disorder, or  ADD.Answers To Distraction provides  practical solutions to the dilemmas of ADD. This  \"user's guide\" to ADD is presented in  question-and-answer format ideal for even the most  distractible reader. Each chapter covers a specific  aspect of ADD, such as ADD in women, ADD and  aggression, ADD and addiction, or ADD and work. The  authors provide advice for teachers on recognizing ADD  and helping students to cope, plus extraordinary  insights into the relationship difficulties caused  by ADD.",
