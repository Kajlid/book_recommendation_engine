  "description": "Cash and Travis... it all began one warm October day back in 2003 on a forgotten levee of the mighty Yellowstone River. They were high-school students-seniors, in fact. As champions within their own fields (Cash, a rodeo cowboy, and Travis, a football player) they come to the plate on their own terms, but eventually, they fall in love. And what happens after that brings the sleepy town of Miles City to life-challenging many paradigms. As they work through their differences and face outside challenges, their relationship grows stronger; or so it seems until it's revealed to Cash he's inherited a young girl-not just any girl, but Lee's daughter. So, with concerns of completing their educations, taking on careers and child-raising, Cash and Travis struggle with issues many couples encounter today. And these events eventually bring unbearable strain, affronting the very elements keeping them together. The question is-will they survive and develop a stronger relationship, or will their love crack and crumble as it does so often today? Where Free Men Pray is the second in a series of four stories. It's a tale of two passionate men who have committed to each other that... what Heaven hath joined together, let no man cut asunder.",
