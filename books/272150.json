  "description": "When life isn't going the way you want it, sometimes faking it is the only way to go.  The moment Lucy Harrington turned eighteen she followed her dream. She applied for a spot on The Next Big Model, walked away from her foster family of three years, and dropped out of high school. She’d had many challenges over the years, but nothing was going to get in the way of her destiny.  Except maybe herself.  Six months later Lucy’s living in a tiny apartment, working at The Pie Whole pizza restaurant and hoping no one recognizes her from the most publicly humiliating moment in her life. Unfortunately, not only is she recognized, it’s by none other than Dean Turner, the gorgeous rising star of the hit new show, Avondale.  After a rocky start, Lucy and Dean agree to help one another. She needs to learn to move on and get her confidence back. He needs to learn that there’s more to life than just work and unwavering drive. When these two make a deal to challenge one another, neither realized how close they would become to achieving their dreams—and to one another.  The price of fame is high, and Lucy and Dean are willing to do almost anything it takes to succeed. Will the pact that brought them together tear them apart?  Lucy and the Love Pact is the second novel from Love in Ocean Grove, a series of books about swoony, first-time love and toe-curling kisses for readers of all ages.",
