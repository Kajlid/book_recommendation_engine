  "description": "Why did the popular vote for the Democratic nominee for president increase in an unusual straight-line for almost 30 years, with the exception of one election? What created this unique voting trend? Did the trend influence the outcome of past presidential elections and could it affect elections yet to come? This new and groundbreaking book provides answers to these questions and includes insight into the probable results of future elections, including the projected winner for president in 2016.  The author, Tony Fairfax, has discovered and written about this unique voting pattern in this concise book titled, An Introduction to the Presidential Trend. The book discusses an intriguing phenomenon whereby the popular vote for the Democratic candidate for president has increased in a linear and predictable manner. The trend, in fact, existed from 1972 to 2000, with the exception of one presidential election. During that same period, the vote for Republican and Independent candidates fluctuated. The linear trend is the basis for a new political theory and is positioned to become a prominent part of US presidential election history.  Amazingly, the straight-line popular vote trend occurred despite the fact that each election contained different opponents, changing issues, fluctuating US and global conditions, and most importantly varying voter turnout percentages. In fact, the trend was so straight that the popular vote for Bill Clinton and Al Gore in 1992, 1996 and 2000 could have been predicted in 1988 with an accuracy of 99% or better.  The book provides a simplified overview of the original publication, The Presidential Trend. Those who wish to delve into exit poll data, voter turnout and demographic data should read the full version. It has been written for the novice as well as experienced analyst. The reader is taken through a literary narrative journey of the development of the authorâ€™s original theory. Many will enjoy the condensed explanations and analysis of a theory that some say is destined to alter how presidential elections are viewed and analyzed.",
