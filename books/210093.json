  "description": "Luna now knows how significant she is in the supernatural world but her life has not become any easier. She continues to be hunted by the evil forces which will stop at nothing to capture her and use her as a weapon against all creatures; light and dark. With the dark, demonic leader of the underworld at her side, she must not only rid the world of evil for herself but for each and every being to live freely. Being the Goddess of the sky was never something which Luna believed she actually was but as her powers develop she begins to see exactly how important she is. She must stand next to the leader of the darkness who owns her soul and fight for her chance to live freely and safely with him. The fates haven't finished with Luna yet though as she comes to realise.",
