  "description": "Someone is killing the women folk of Oakwell, and the body count is growing. The moorland that surrounds the town has begun to relinquish some of its morbid past. Inspector Abaline has been drafted onto the case, to breathe new life into the faltering investigation. Can he unlock the secret of the Devil's Tourniquet before deaths shadow casts its cloak once more over the already terrified residents of Oakwell? Excitement, suspense and mystery. If Hard-Boiled, British Detective Crime Thrillers, with a light sprinkling of the Occult and Supernatural are your vice, then welcome to a refreshing approach and original plot to engage and captivate your senses. Inspector Maxwell Abaline, a gruff stalwart with the patience of a three-year-old child, and his sidekick, Sergeant William Bowman, a mild mannered and conscientious member of the local police force are the two detectives tasked with leading the investigation to solve a series of gruesome murders of local woman. Along the way they must sift through the lines of deceit, deception, depravity, double-cross and death in their quest to find the killer. If you are a reader of works by authors such as Ruth Rendell, Ian Rankin, P.D. James, Agatha Christie and Elizabeth George, then Paul R Melia would be a welcome addition to your book collection.",
