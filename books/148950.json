  "description": "How difficult is it to earn your place in Heaven? If you’re not abiding by God’s Law, then it’s all but impossible. No one knows this better than 12-year-old Catholic schoolboy, Brian Scanlon. He’s on a quest, not only to save his own soul, but that of his younger brother Michael. However, there is just one thing that lies between them and eternal salvation – their evil, older brother, Patrick. It’s 1985 in small town Catholic Ireland where religion is deeply rooted into the psyche of the people. Confession is a weekly event, statues of the Virgin Mary are moving or crying up and down the country and Dallas is almost as popular as Sunday Mass. For The Love of God follows the darkly humourous twists and turns in the life of the three brothers. In the end, as the age-old question goes – can good really overcome evil?",
