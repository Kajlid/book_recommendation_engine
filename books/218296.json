It's on my website! http://alorakateauthor.wixsite.com/al...Lincoln: Catching sight of my neighbor’s ass in the hallway the day I moved in more than piqued my interest. It's not just the body that has my attention. She's mysterious, hiding behind sunglasses that cover most of her face. I ask her name and try to get her to talk on the rare occasions I see her in the hallway, but every time she ignores me and turns away. I need to know more about this woman, I can't get her out of my head. Do I keep trying? Do I keep asking her name? Ashton: I’m barely holding on. I’m always on the edge, even after all these years. I live every day the same and I can’t change who I am no matter how much I try. My new neighbor won't give up asking my name and trying to make conversation with me. If he knew me he wouldn't keep trying. I'm a lost cause.Warning: Some people might consider this a Dark Romance.Recommended for 18+ due to graphic details and language.",
