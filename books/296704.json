It’s no big deal, she has all she wants: her three little boys and a fresh start in a small Alberta town. After ten years of unsatisfactory, missionary-position sex, she certainly never expected her libido to reawaken. Then one look at sex-in-boots Daniel Coleman blows the dust off her sexuality.Sensing an edge of desperation, even fear, beneath Beth’s come-on, Daniel finds himself giving in to the powerful urge to let his normally restrained desires run wild. The lady wants non-judgmental, non-vanilla sex? She’s got it—in and out of the bedroom.At first, friends with blazing-hot benefits is more than enough. Then Beth realizes Daniel is burning away the protective fortress around her heart…and the guilty secret she dare not reveal.Contains: One woman determined to retake control of her life and a man with the single-minded purpose of offering her everything she needs to get there. Inappropriate behaviour in barns, change rooms, and oh-my-gawd phone sex with a cowboy.Originally published 2012",
