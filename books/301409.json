  "description": "Isn’t your desire to overeat really spiritual hunger?“I can stop in the middle of a candy bar and have no desire to eat the second half if my stomach is not calling for it.”- Gwen ShamblinDo you eat and eat and never feel full? Rise above the magnetic pull of the refrigerator and turn to the bounty offered to thousands who have embraced a liberating weight-reduction program in churches across America. The Weigh Down Diet gives new hope to millions who have failed on conventional diets and guides readers to the richer satisfaction that comes not from food, but from faith.Gwen Shamblin’s The Weigh Down Diet is a groundbreaking approach to weight loss. People who have known no end to their hunger and who have no control over their late-night binges have learned through the Weigh Down Workshop that they can remove the irresistible desire for food. This is not a diet like others, because it is not food-focused. It contains chapters such as “It’s Not Genetics or Your Mother’s Fault,” “I Feel Hungry All the Time,” and “How to Eat Potato Chips and Chocolate.” So, as you can see, here is a very different approach to weight loss. Weigh Down gives back hope to dieters who will learn that God did not put chocolate or lasagna on Earth to torture us – but rather for our enjoyment!",
