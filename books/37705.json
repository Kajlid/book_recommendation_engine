  "description": "Perdonar means to forgive. To forgive is to let go. The novel Perdonar is the tender and exciting story of a woman who lets go of her past, and courageously begins to grow and thus transform her very life. The striking scenery of Peru, Cuba, Costa Rica and New York provides a dynamic background for the intriguing people she meets during this journey of maturation. Caught between two generations - on the one hand, ladies raised in a traditional society, and on the other, rebellious young girls - the heroine must hew out her own interior space and redefine herself. Giving up, what at first, seems the very basis of her identity, she takes the first step to defining herself by her own terms, and, in finding herself, she renews an authentic connection with others. No matter at what point on your own path you find yourself, this story will encourage you to go one step further.",
