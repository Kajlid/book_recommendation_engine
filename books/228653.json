  "description": "A SECRET LIES DEEP is a fictional exploration of a young woman who harbors secrets that she is reluctant to reveal. At the same time she seeks answers to questions/secrets that are hidden from her. As the story progresses she learns much about herself, including her sexuality, as she becomes romantically involved, not once, but twice. But the romantic part is only a very interesting and soul searching subplot. The main plot is finding the answers to the secrets eluding her, and she eventually does find those answers with the help of her host family in upstate New York and with the aid of some odd paranormal activity while she and a coworker are assigned the task of researching genealogies for their living history museum; more is revealed about her own life than she ever would have thought possible!",
