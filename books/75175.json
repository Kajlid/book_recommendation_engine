  "description": "Growing out of a spellbinding “Modern Love” column in the New York Times, a fresh, wrenching story of young love and mortality.As a teenager, Elizabeth Scarboro imagined an adventurous future for herself in which she would live all over the world, and settling down was out of the question. But then she fell in love with Stephen: brilliant, infuriating, living with cystic fibrosis. With Stephen's life expectancy hovering around thirty years, Scarboro embraced another sort of adventure--simultaneously joyous and heartrending--choosing to stay with Stephen and live an entire marriage in the ten years they had.A memoir in the tradition of Gail Caldwell's Let's Take the Long Way Home and Francisco Goldman's Say Her Name, Scarboro's story, told in intimate prose, reveals the ephemerality of her tender marriage. My Foreign Cities is a modern Love Story, a portrait of a young couple approaching mortality with reckless abandon, gleefully outrunning it for as long as they can.",
