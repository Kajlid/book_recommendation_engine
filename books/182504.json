  "description": "I was having an affair with murder.There. I admit it. And there was no program for me—no rehab or clinic. I couldn’t deny my obsession, my fantasy. Murder. It was only a matter of time before someone died. And I knew I wouldn’t be able to stop after just one. So, when the temptations had become too intense, I risked everything for one little taste. Immediately, my life was filled with twists and turns and thrills—the seductive arms of a dark society embracing my desires, relentlessly drawing me in until I'd lost sight of who I was.

I know people live for the idea that their fantasies can come true. The question I began to ask was should they?",
