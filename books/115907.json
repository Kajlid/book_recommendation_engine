  "description": "Did you know that every 60 seconds another prince is turned into a frog? The Prince of Capitol City was in danger of becoming just another statistic when young Tom discovered him croaking on his bedroom windowsill. Now, with a little help from a cranky old dwarf, an overly optimistic dragon, and a wise-cracking library book, Tom must restore His Majesty to mammal-hood, and that’s not as easy as it sounds. Along the way they’ll face witches, monstriches, the horrifying (but eminently literate) Bookwyrm, and the dastardly pirate captain Dirty Beard Daggert, with his notoriously bad hygiene and his chronically ill parrot, Admiral Petey. They’ll swim through the innards of a giant sea turtle, witness the unbridled ferocity of a traditional Dwarven meal, and explore the tranquil beaches of Insignifica, where the world’s tiniest armed forces don’t take kindly to trespassers. And – who knows? – they may even learn a thing or two about sniggling while they’re at it. The Frog Who Would Be Prince is a 60,000 word novel designed for middle readers with an interest in humorous fantasy adventure, but its quirky, off-beat humor will inspire a laugh from readers of all ages.",
