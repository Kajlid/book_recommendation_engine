  "description": "Orion, or Rion for short, is just a normal kid, or so he thought. His memories have been robbed from him and he is watched closely by a group of mysterious and beautiful women. He and his friends must plot an escape. They are quickly thrust into a struggle that they cannot begin to understand, with Orion at the center of it all. He must decide if he wants to lead, or just try to survive and uncover his past. Rion discovers that it is truly difficult to determine who to trust, and what is real in the battle for the Zodiacs. Could he really be the thirteenth sign? The One?",
