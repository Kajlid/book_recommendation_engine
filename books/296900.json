  "description": "Braxton is a small town. A town where even your darkest secrets are cast out for all to see.  Something which is only made worse when you’re the Mayor’s daughter.  All eyes are on me. No matter what I do or where I go, people are always watching, anticipating my next move. Hoping I’ll turn out just like my mom.  Perfect and saint like.   Oh, how I wish that were true.  That isn't the life I want to live.  I'm fed up of hiding in the shadows.  I want adventure, passion and a whole heap of fun, and this year I'm going to make sure it happens.  Fortunately for me, the new arrival of a hot, brooding asshat looks like things could go in my favor.  But do I really have what it takes to throw away everything I have ever known?  Do I really want to risk my Mother's reputation when I know this dark, mysterious boy will only bring me broken promises and an unforgivable amount of heartbreak? You only get one shot at life, right? Do I really want to look back and regret the risks I could have taken?",
