  "description": "Ever since we found the two Outcasts, it’s been my goal to get them to join our beach tribe. Handsome, impossible Juth has resisted all my efforts to recruit him and his small son. He’s made it very clear that he doesn’t belong with us.But when I’m trapped at Juth’s side as the beach is invaded by monsters, everything changes. He talks to me instead of pointedly ignoring me. We become friends. Heck, we even share a few stolen kisses. And when the rescue party arrives, he announces to everyone that I’m his mate and he’s joining the tribe.Which is great except…I never agreed to anything? If I point out I’m not Juth’s mate, he’ll pack up and leave with his son. He sure won’t give me more of those toe-curling kisses or touch me like it’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened to him.So…I guess I’m mated? Because I’m not sure I can give any of that - or Juth - up.",
