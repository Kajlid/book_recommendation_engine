  "title": "Beneath the Liquid Skin",
  "description": "Immerse yourself in what has long enraptured both the sensualist and the scientist-the natural world. Seismic in its permeable temporal and geographic states, Beneath the Liquid Skin examines humankind's response to the environment: our pursuit of milder emotional, political, social, and cultural climes; our flight from ecological catastrophe; and our refuge in safer mythical domains. Although her habitat is exotic, Berit Ellingsen saturates-with humanistic and preternatural harmony-a remarkably vulnerable yet enduring surface.",
