  "description": "Sixteen-year-old Addison Solomon never expected she’d be allowed to return home after spending the summer in hell at Camp Trinidad in Spain, but there were images to keep. Back at home she’s reminded of how much her fiancé’, Jackson Van Buren controls her life and family. It sickens her, but she knows going against his wishes might result in a one-way ticket back to camp or worse. Jackson leaves for college and Addison thinks she’s finally free of his rope of control, but when she finds out that a new student at school is linked to Jackson she begins to question everyone and everything. Secrets from the past and lies reveal themselves in the second installment of the Twisted series.",
