  "description": "I have a secret. Darkness exists. I try to hide, but where can I go when it lives inside me?On the run from those who want to kill me, I made an uneasy alliance and found a new home. Everything goes just fine until a coven of witches walk into the pub where I work. Broody, sexy, and scary as hell, I’m determined to avoid them, no matter how much attraction sizzles between us.But Ezra, Alexander, Jason, and Benjamin have no intention of leaving me alone. They’re the council’s finest hunters, and they recognize the power that lives inside me, even if they don’t know what it is. They’re in town on a mission and agree to hold off turning me in. Which means I have limited time to convince them I’m not a bad person.The darkness inside me grows, though, and when it breaks free in public, I’ll be forced to face the consequences. The only question is, can I trust these men who I feel a bond with, or will it lead to my destruction?",
