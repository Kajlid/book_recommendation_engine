  "description": "The Shadow Drivers want Josie Jackson dead! Fleeing her attackers, the young teen is wrenched from Earth and thrust into the Deadlands, the lawless, hardscrabble western frontier of Kimberallis. Joined by her brother, Ricky, two wolf-like beasts called lupafers, and Morgan LeGrey, the legendary exiled Lightrider, Josie must traverse the Deadlands to the safety of the Lightriders’ secret compound. Once Kimberallis’s protectors, the Lightriders—famed light-wielding gunslingers—now live as outlaws battling the Shadow Drivers for control of Kimberallis. Dark rulers, the Shadow Drivers are bent on exterminating anybody who imperils their reign. Crossing the Deadlands, Josie finds that the Wild West-like borderland has awakened rare abilities in her –skills that the Lightriders want to hone, and talents that the Shadow Drivers want destroyed. Tasked with killing Josie is a gang of hardened warriors that includes two malevolent teenagers, Dexalian and Remalia. Ruthless killers, they seek to eliminate Josie and Ricky before they can reach the Lightriders’ fortress. But it is Morgan who steers the teens into danger. An outlaw wanted for past crimes, Morgan seems to be an ally. But Josie suspects that Morgan is hiding secrets that could endanger them further. More complicated yet are Josie’s feelings for the Shadow Driver, Dexalian. Sworn enemies, they find themselves conflicted by their growing attraction to each other. Josie must finally decide whether to trust Morgan or to surrender to her emotions for Dexalian. Her decision will have a profound impact on Kimberallis. But it could mean losing Dexalian forever.",
