  "description": "Gypsy boy Daniel Cooper leads a rough-and-ready life in a busy community of Romany travelling folk. It is the year 1949, and as the country adjusts after the upheaval of war, his gypsy family peacefully travel the Welsh country lanes and by-ways, comfortable in their outdoor existence. For Daniel, the lure of a ‘normal’ life becomes very real when he learns that his older brother, who fought in the army, has settled down with a wife and bought a house in a town in Wales. Envious of his brother’s worldly experiences, Daniel longs to free himself of the burden of his family, much to the consternation of his traditionally minded father. Daniel finds comfort and friendship from the gypsy fortune teller, who feeds his curiosity with tales from her life on the road. One night the camp is attacked and Daniel goes to help his friend. She bestows a gift upon him, and then disappears. When Daniel returns to the destroyed campsite, his family have gone. The wagons have been torn apart – what were the attackers searching for?",
