  "description": "Magic sinks its teeth into Kodiak Island.Can Jason and Emma save their hometown before it’s too late?With Emma home from college for the summer, I will finally show her how I really feel, make her mine, take that kiss we shared one step further. But my plans are interrupted. People are going missing in Kodiak, Alaska. The victims are all young ladies around our age. Friends we grew up with. People we care about. Then my new outfitter’s shop gets broken into and my employee is kidnapped. The evidence: bloody bear prints and a black ooze that can eat the flesh from bones. Bears don’t wander into busy shopping districts, turn off security alarms, and break into stores. Now strange faeries are popping up around town. And I’m a suspect in my own break-in. The cops can’t possibly handle a paranormal crime. It’s my world, my people. My responsibility.",
