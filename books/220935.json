  "title": "My Lovely Boy",
  "description": "This is a very dark, psychological, twisted, sinister tale, that comes with a warning; incest scenes, sex and child abuse  Phoebe first meets her Great Auntie Val at her 19th birthday party. The family are thrilled to have a new family member. Then Phoebe meets Paul whom his mother calls ‘My Lovely Boy’ Life will never be the same again…This book is like marmite, as one of my reviewers said below. There is a warning on it to ensure people who might be disturbed or offended by it, won't. I strongly suggest to read that warning before reading it. Not only for your own benefit, but for mine too - there is no point in rating it low because one is not happy about the theme, and it is unfair for me as a writer. I normally write memoir, self-help, inspiring fiction and I am a therapeutic counsellor, and do not wish to offend anyone :-)",
