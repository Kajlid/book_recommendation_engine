  "description": "Once upon a Christmas, there was an old woman who lived in a hut at the edge of the forest, with only her old dog, Uproar, to keep her company. The old woman had only one wish: to celebrate a real Christmas, with a tree and presents and candles and food. Just once.High up in the heavens, Star Mother’s youngest child makes a wish, too. “Mother!” he wails, “just once I want to celebrate Christmas like they do down there!” So Star Mother sends him to earth, where he finds a hut and knocks on the door . . .In this original, heartwarming fable, Louise Moeri tells the story of an unlikely friendship and how it made two Christmas wishes come true.\"In three words I can state clearly why I wanted to be a part of the children's book field: Trina Schart Hyman. In 1975, the year I graduated from college, I won a literary prize for my own writing and with the money I bought books. One book in particular altered the course of my life: STAR MOTHER'S YOUNGEST CHILD. Both the story and Trina's heartfelt illustrations propelled me to be a part of the wondrous world of children's books. I still have my first edition copy, a bit tattered from frequent readings and poring over Trina's artwork. Whenever I needed encouragement this book, with all its magic, gave me that artistic boost.\" Olivier Dunrea, author.",
