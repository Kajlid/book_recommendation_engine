  "title": "The Unexpected Chosen",
  "description": "Hesed was never supposed to be like this, but a collision of spheres has changed everything. It started with fire. Then the black roses and scarlet silks made their way through the land of snow and diamonds. The quiet caused confusion; the memories brought torture. And then came the darkness…the ripples…the screaming birds…the monstrous creatures. Still, the purpose remained, the mirror portals persevered, and the watchmen will not waiver. The unexpected chosen have come, and the girl who once thrived will endure a journey like none before. The Unexpected Chosen is part of the young adult fantasy fiction series In the Depths of Hesed. It's a story of community and hope within a fallen world.",
