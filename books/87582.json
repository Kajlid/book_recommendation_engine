  "description": "Retired federal agent Ashley Cameron had disappeared into anonymity for years until summoned to help a family member. Now, she finds herself thrown back into the world of filth, treachery, money, drugs and murder that almost destroyed her years earlier. Not to mention, the loss of Anthony, her one and only true love. After twelve years, she still lives with the physical scars and vivid nightmares from her past. A world where the players consist of elected officials owned by The Colombian Drug Cartel and the Dixie Mafia. The success of this operation will mean plunging into her own gruesome past, one filled with a shattered heart, bitter disillusionment and a heart jaded by justice. Can Ashley get back in the game and face the truths that lurk beneath the surface? Is she prepared for the feelings that still exist and can she open her heart up to the even more terrifying possibility of a future without revealing the secret she has kept for years?...",
