Fergal's cousin, Colm, asks them to manage a Finger Lakes winery that he bought as an investment. They accept his gift of fate, but when they move upstate from Queens, see the run-down Keuka Lake property and meet its surly winemaker, they realize it will be quite a challenge getting from grapevine to bottle. Meanwhile, their best friends Maeve Kenny and Andy Krall face a challenge of their own - separation while he gets experimental cell therapy in Europe for paralysis sustained in a car crash. As both couples face unsettled futures, will they be able to keep hope alive?",
