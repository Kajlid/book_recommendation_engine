An untrained witch can lose his or her grip on reality. He meets several other lost souls in his search to tame the wild magic. A young woman with visions. An old native scout. A hidden city of magic users.  As he draws nearer to the truth, he fears he will also have to face his greatest nightmare, the Ravenger, a demon of unspeakable power. In the end, Zerrick must decide whether witchcraft will lead him to goodness . . . or to evil.",
