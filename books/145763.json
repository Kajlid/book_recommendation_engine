  "description": "Jodi Taylor brings all her comic writing skills to this heart-warming tale of self-discovery.  Getting a life isn't always easy. And hanging on to it is even harder... Known as “The Nothing Girl” because of her severe stutter and chronically low self-confidence, Jenny Dove is only just prevented from ending it all by the sudden appearance of Thomas, a mystical golden horse only she can see. Under his guidance, Jenny unexpectedly acquires a husband – the charming and chaotic Russell Checkland – and for her, nothing will ever be the same again.  With over-protective relatives on one hand and the world's most erratic spouse on the other, Jenny needs to become Someone. And fast!  Fans of Jodi Taylor's best-selling Chronicles of St Mary's series will adore the quirky humour in this new, contemporary novel.",
