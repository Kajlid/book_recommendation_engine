  "description": "Lucy loves her new neighbor. One, because he's seriously hot; and two, because he leaves his window open while getting himself off. What she doesn't know however is that Nate can see her too. Every evening, he watches her undress, the blue film covering her window not enough to mask her silhouette. He's already half in lust with her body and that's before he knows what she looks like, apart from her round breasts and even rounder ass.Things accelerate when Nate takes matters into his own hands and invites her to his condo. But will lust still prevail when another man invites himself to the party?",
