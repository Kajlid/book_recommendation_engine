  "description": "Beatrice Thomson doesn't mind her funny nickname. It makes her feel special, which is important when you're the middle child: not the smartest, or the best-looking, or a boy. The Depression years are hard ones, with her father out of work and the family struggling to make ends meet. But irrepressible Booky, with her big imagination and even bigger plans, can tackle anything. A sharp-eyed kid can find plenty to see and do without spending a cent. Even if it does get her into scrapes!",
