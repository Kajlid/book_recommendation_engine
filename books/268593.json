  "title": "Spiritual Warfare without the Spiritual Weirdness: A Bible Study on Spiritual Warfare and the Armor of God",
  "description": "There are a lot of crazy weird teachings about spiritual warfare out there that are based on a total misunderstanding of what the Bible teaches. You have probably read a lot of those books. They give the impression that spiritual warfare is an esoteric experience reserved for the super spiritual elite, and as a result, many Christians are reluctant to delve into spiritual warfare.Spiritual Warfare without the Spiritual Weirdness is a free spiritual warfare book for anyone serious about understanding what the BIBLE teaches about spiritual warfare. If you feel something is just not right about what popular authors are teaching about spiritual warfare, then this book is for you.We explain all the scriptures on spiritual warfare, the armor of God, strongholds and the wiles of the devil; and we show you that spiritual warfare is something that every Christian could and should be involved in. Most of all, it is not weird and super-spiritual.True warfare is about using the weapons God gave you (the armor of God) to pull down strongholds in your mind. There is a strong chance that you are living a defeated life because there is some element of Biblical truth that you have not fully grasped deep in your spirit. True warfare is about replacing your wrong thinking with scriptural thinking. This alone can give you the victory you seek.Spiritual Warfare without the Spiritual Weirdness shows you how to pray, how to identify strategies of the devil, how to identify strongholds, and how to pull them down; and it is based solely on the Bible. We pray that it will be a tremendous blessing to you.",
