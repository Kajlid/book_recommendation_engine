Their professional parents have a unique love for Black History which brought them together many years ago. Now they desire for Nina and Miles to have the same passion for Black History. Miles, the youngest of the duo, loves to learn! He is a little more interested in Black History facts than his older sister. Nina, on the other hand, is less interested in learning about Black History. She feels the past is the past and it's no longer relevant to modern day society. Come join Nina and Miles as they take an unexpected journey back in time with the help of an unexpected connection! But will these historical adventures be enough to prove to them the importance of knowing Black History in today's society?",
