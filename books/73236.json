  "title": "Express As YOU: Celebrate Your Uniqueness",
  "description": "This small book is a collection of simple statements of profound wisdom, and is best savored slowly. Each stanza reinforces the value of our human existence, and the purpose of our unique and individual expression of life.This gem will assist you in:- Experiencing your true nature; - Connecting to your Soul's wisdom;- Understanding the difference between discernment and judgment;- Raising your consciousness;- Moving from insight to actionFrom the author: This book is a very personal one, in that I wrote it for myself, for my own evolutionary process. It is quite dense, which is why it is not very long, because this is how the Teacher in me teaches myself. I could unpack each paragraph to fill numerous pages, making it a larger book, but I do not wish to think for you. Rather, I desire for you to think for yourself; to learn to rely on your Soul to work with your psyche to unfold from within it what is right for you at the time. This way the book can be reread, each time gaining new insights from within; similar to the way some Master Teachers teach in parables or poems.",
