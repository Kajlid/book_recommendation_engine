  "description": "There is a prophecy foretold by the witches of long ago, and recorded in their sacred Book of Spells. The prophecy has been passed from generation to generation and taught to every supernatural child to ready them for the time of the great war and the re-birth of the chosen one.  For sixteen years Angel-May Black has been locked in a room, hidden from view - a prisoner within four walls. Beaten by her father after the loss of her mother, she is alone, unloved, and waiting for death to claim her.  However, Angel has been chosen by the gods to possess a power that will awaken during her seventeenth year. The once dormant powers of her inner-self grow stronger with each passing month and Angel must learn to control them to escape the nightmare she lives and gain her freedom.  On the day of her eighteenth year she is rescued by two supernatural beings, hired to find her by a grandmother she never knew, to bring her to safety and put Angel on the path that she must take to conquer evil.  There is much danger ahead as those who wish to destroy or control her for their own means are near and Angel, with the aid of the bloodthirsty Zared and other supernatural allies, must fight if light is going to ultimately triumph.  But there is another problem ahead for Angel. She is connected to two men by powerful unbreakable bonds. Angel must reveal her Hidden Destiny if the prophecy is to be fulfilled. To do this she must give one up to save her future and that of her unborn child, Isis. Whether she will make the right choice is yet uncertain.  HIDDEN DESTINY is the first installment of W.A. Case's ANGEL-MAY SAGA.",
