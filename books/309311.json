  "description": "(Alternate cover edition of ASIN B08SBWJ5MD.) Felix Papillon is determined he’ll never be hurt again. He may look like he has his life together from the outside—starting goalie for the Portland Seabirds, fancy car, adoring fans clamoring for his autograph—but he won’t allow anyone to see the scars on his heart. When he meets Fisher Montgomery in the back of a dimly lit bar, the attraction is instant and mutual. But Felix isn’t going to drop his guard just because of a pair of pretty brown eyes and excellent shoulders. He’s learned his lesson. So he gives Fisher a fake name, and he makes it clear from the beginning that no matter how compatible they are in and out of bed, their relationship will never be more than physical. That’s just fine by Fisher. He’s got enough to handle being a closeted gay man teaching kindergarten in a conservative private school. Someday he wants to settle down, but right now, with student loans, an old car about to fall apart, and a parent taking an inappropriate interest in him, Fisher doesn’t have time to wonder why the man he’s sleeping with looks vaguely familiar. For a while, things seem to be going just fine. But nothing lasts forever, and soon enough, both men will be forced to confront the ghosts of their pasts if they’re going to have any hope for a happy future.",
