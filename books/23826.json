  "description": "Emily Kane studies martial arts, but she never thought she'd have to use them... until her home is destroyed in a night time attack. Her family goes into hiding and wants her to assume a new identity on the run with them. But she refuses to become a fugitive and “live a lie,” as she puts it. She is determined to keep her name, to salvage the life she knows and above all to stay in school, even if she has to do it all on her own. But this may mean fighting off the people who attacked her home, and who may still be hunting for her. Along the way she learns she is not who she thinks she is, and her family is not who she thinks they are either. Who exactly is Emily Kane? Why is she so good at fighting? To solve the mystery of her identity she turns to her high school classmates. She makes new friends when she had always been a loner. But then she has to protect them from the danger swirling darkly around her. The only solution may be to draw her enemies out into the open and confront them face to face.",
