  "description": "If my time with Ryan Miller were a hit track on the radio, I imagine the lyrics would go something like this…“We’re so different, but they say opposites attract. Oops, I’ve fallen, and my heart doesn’t want to come back.”But, holy bingo night, is my attraction to the sexy, broody businessman so much more complicated than the chorus of a song.His dad lives right next to my mom, and after the two of them suffered an unexplained accident while taking down holiday decorations, both Ryan and I were forced to become the only thirtysomething residents of Sunny Creek Village Independent Senior Living Community.Temporarily moving in might seem like overkill for a fractured tailbone and a severely pulled groin muscle, but believe me, when your mom is as wild as mine and your dad is as cantankerous as Ryan’s, they need supervision to ensure they stick to doctor’s orders.Constantly thrown together by the antics of our crazy parents and the tough-as-nails community enforcer, Betty Matthews, Ryan and I formed an alliance for the sole purpose of survival.But I never expected to be so interested in finding out what he was hiding beneath his grumpy, serious demeanor. More than that, I never dreamed what I found would be the kind of man women sell their souls to the devil for.Unfortunately, our little one-hit wonder on the airwaves has more to say before it comes to an end.Although, finishing the outro to this song is a real doozy...Tell me…what lyric rhymes with Oops, I’ve fallen for my future stepbrother?",
