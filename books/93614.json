  "title": "Dreams of Love: A Book of Poems and Short Stories",
  "description": "Dreams of Love was born of the author's desire to share her encounter with a real Grand Love. Melodic and mystical, these tales of passion and romance amuse, and reveal the ecstasies and agonies of love and passion, and the courage and risk necessary to follow our dreams. Thirteen short stories and nineteen poems weave together, following a thread. They read like a novel. Provocative and bold, perhaps it is even shocking! \"Dreams of Love\" will pierce through to stir up deep rooted emotions, and will leave us wondering and reflecting long after we close the book.",
