  "description": "Once upon a time, Jezebel was a powerful succubus, capable of seducing men and sucking out their souls. But that was before Hell put a bounty on her head. Now her only chance to escape a fate far worse than death is to live as a mortal, losing herself in a sea of unfamiliar humanity, in a place where sinners walk hand-in-hand with saints--a place like New York City.Working as an exotic dancer is a piece of cake for a former demon who once specialized in sex. But she hadn't counted on meeting sexy Paul Hamilton, a man haunted by his past. Good-bye, succubus; hello, lovestruck.But Hell hasn't stopped looking for her. The secrets Jezebel holds are the most dangerous of all, the kind every demon in the Underworld would do their worst to protect. Demons are closing in, which is enough to make Jezebel shiver in her G-string. But it's her love for Paul that's going to have deadly consequences. . .\"Will captivate fans of Sherrilyn Kenyon and Laurell K. Hamilton from the very first pages.\" -- Romantic Times\"Hell's Belles will enchant paranormal fans.\" -- Romance Reviews Today",
