  "description": "PG-RATED FUNTime travel doesn't really happen. Does it? Jennie's beginning to wonder when she and her ex-fianc√© seem to be pulled into an Old West painting--right in the middle of a guns-blazing bank robbery. She doesn't know how it happened to begin with, or how they'll get back, and neither Jesse James nor the marshal seem inclined to give them a chance to find out. Worst of all, Jennie's falling for the one man she swore she'd never trust again.",
