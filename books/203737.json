  "title": "A Long Way Home",
  "description": "Dancing helped me forget.  Forget the pain of what I'd left behind. Forget the shame of what I'd done. Forget the fact that my future felt as untethered as the caravan in which I traveled.  On the run, Savannah Clark lives her life as a modern-day bohemian, hiding her identity behind her beaded scarves and swirling skirts. Marek and the Gypsies, a troupe of dancers and musicians, follow the Renaissance and Medieval Faire circuits, never staying in one place for very long. Her disguise, however, doesn't fool those who know and love her best, nor does it completely hide the evidence of how difficult living in fear can be.  But an unexpected encounter with Jordan Ransome, her first love, tears open old wounds, and tragic news from home brings Savannah face to face with her worst fears. Will she run again, a victim of the lies she's come to believe about herself and those she left behind, or can she trust her heart enough to embrace the girl she once was as the woman she has become?
