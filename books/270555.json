  "title": "Six Times Forever",
  "description": "The realisation of poetic storytelling and a stunning debut for a melodious poet, Six Times Forever is filled with vivid imagery and hopeless romance. Unique poetry styles complemented by several distinct voices intersperse the book with sprinkles of German limning a visual narrative echoing a medley of exotic stardust. A tale of two passionate lovers: fervent and fanatic, sizzling and sensuous. Part of the Muslim world where love is still considered taboo, ameliorated with the modern times; surreal in parts; supernatural in others but invariably heart-wrenching and effervescent, like honey draping the heavens. A tale of obsession and consuming mania; spiraling intomadness until it sings as sweetly as a symphony. A tale of loss and grief: undone; unwoven; unloved?",
