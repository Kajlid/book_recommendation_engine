  "title": "Flambards Divided",
  "description": "This is the final book in the best-selling Flabards series. The First World War is over and Christina marries Dick, who was once the groom at Flambards. The local gentry refuse to accept the couple socially and, with Mark Russell due home from the war, Christina is forced to face the consequences of her decision. And in the end it is Christina who is as much divided as Flambards, in her feelings for two very different men. This title was reissued in the Oxford Children's Modern Classics series earlier this year, and is now being issued in a mass-market paperback format.",
