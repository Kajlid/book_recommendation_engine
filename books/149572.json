  "description": "Away From the Nets tells two stories that examine the sometimes impossible standards by which people live their lives. The first is of a man who holds unbearable guilt over things he cannot control. The second is of a woman who embarks on the goal of achieving moral perfection. Away From the Nets is a taut psychological study that builds toward a shattering climax that, once read, cannot be forgotten.",
