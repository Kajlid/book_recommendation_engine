  "description": "Artist, Rylee Whitmore, grew up and made her home in Crescent Valley, GA. She knows, loves, and trusts everyone there, replacing the family she was robbed of in a tragic auto accident at a young age. An idyllic town filled with everything a small town should have, including dark secrets, betrayal, and murder. Jared Wolfe, real estate mogul, thinks he has walked into a town that is too good to be true when he first arrives in picturesque Crescent Valley in search of clues to his sister's murder. He's certain the police have missed something. But will the distraction of the beautiful artist, Rylee Whitmore, get in his way or get her killed?",
