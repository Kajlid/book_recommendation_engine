  "description": "High high school is out and the Hardy Boys have the summer to enjoy. But a planned family holiday gets interrupted when a robbery case confronts their father, Fenton.Valuable electronic parts containing platinum have been disappearing from shipments made by nearby Stanwide Mining Equipment Company. Even before their private detective father asks the two to conduct undercover snooping in the company's warehouse, Frank and Joe are nearly killed as a small plane runs them off a back road while it was landing in a secluded field.How could the boys not be in it? We're off to the Caribbean and Montana plus hidden caves closer to home in Bayport!Librarian's note: this is a description of the later editions; the first edition from 1930 is much different and has the boys being framed with their father coming to their aide.Librarian's note #2: the significant changes introduced by the publisher with new editions make this Goodreads description process much more difficult than with most other books.",
