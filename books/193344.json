  "description": "For twenty-five year old Michelle, starting a café with a gorgeous man was supposed to be fun, exciting and thrilling…until he disappears.  When Clive decides to take time off, for an undetermined amount of time, this leaves Michelle realising how little she knows about running a coffee shop. Her degree in English Literature can only help so far.  If she didn’t have enough on her plate trying to make ends meet, her landlord, handsome Arthur Banks Junior is ruthless and unreasonable. He’s obviously set to bankrupt her but Michelle's not afraid of a fight.  Michelle discovers Arthur has problems of his own. If they could just stop being so antagonistic toward each other and work together, maybe they can help each other out.",
