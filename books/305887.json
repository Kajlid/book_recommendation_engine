  "description": "Oasis One is the second book in Daniel Weisbeck's science fiction post-apocalyptic series Children of the Miracle.  The virus is spreading. War is approaching. Doctor Mercy Perching has stolen the only hope for a cure. Now, she will have to save her human-animal hybrid friends who are running for their lives. ----'In this first book, Weisbeck has created a colorful future and populated it with a variety of distinct creatures, and he ably expands and deepens the worldbuilding as the book goes on. Indeed, the vivid atmosphere is the book’s greatest asset and should please SF fans; it also gives Weisbeck a solid foundation for future installments.' -Kirkus (For Book One: Children of the Miracle)",
