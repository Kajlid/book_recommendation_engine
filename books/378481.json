  "description": "Jak Phoenix would rather kick back with a cold drink than stick his neck out to save the galaxy. But, as we all know, life often gets in the way of these 'big dreams.' Jak and his longtime friend Baxter once again find themselves on the verge of bankruptcy. A last minute salvage mission delivers more than they bargained for when Jak's old enemy shows up and steals their haul out from under them. When it is revealed the cargo is more important than any of them realized, Jak decides, against his better judgment, that a retrieval is necessary. His pursuit leads him right past his enemy and into the hands of the most feared pirate in the galaxy. In the spirit of space operas of old, comes an action packed novel following the exploits of the best low quality pirate in the galaxy, Jak Phoenix.",
