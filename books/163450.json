  "description": "The Dark Scarlett is a continuation of The NOVA Trilogy, but can be read as a standalone.COVEPaul Jameson forced me into the adult film industry at a young age, putting me through years of horrific abuse. It's no surprise I became an alcoholic, considering the ongoing trauma and depression that he caused.I’m just glad the lowlife finally got what he deserved, and I was free to get on with my life. A better life. An easier life. But then I fell in love. And love is never fucking easy. Especially when the woman who captured my heart is Paul’s daughter, Sophia.Go figure, right?Well, Sophia is sassy and sexy and caring and stunningly beautiful. All great things. She’s breathed new life into me. Still, I feel like I’ve got a dark cloud hanging over my head. Even with Paul gone, a bunch of weird shit keeps happening. Like when a guy gets murdered in the parking lot of my wine bar, The Dark Scarlett. And then some nutcase starts stalking Sophia. Plus, an adult film star I once knew comes out of nowhere and decides it will be fun to harass me. What the hell does he want?Count them. Not one, but two psychopaths are causing trouble.And I have to deal with the cops investigating the body found outside my bar.Maybe the devil himself—Paul Jameson—is behind all this.Or maybe these men aren’t the problem.Maybe the actual threat is closer to home.After all, how well do I know Sophia?-------------------------------------**Sexual situations **Violence **Dark content **Language warning",
