  "description": "Book 2 in The Sea Captain's Daughter Trilogy*  There’s something very wrong in the Southern Lair. The blind dragon refuses to choose a new knight partner, but only he can save Gryphon Isle from the deadly pirate menace. His human friends accompany him to the home of the last wizard, fighting on shore as he swims beneath the pirate ships, rising to flame them into oblivion. Together, they save the day…or do they?  Livia, Seth and Gowan befriend the wizard and his people—flocks of gryphons and villages of near-immortal fair folk. Plots are uncovered, including the magical subversion of the Lair leadership and the theft of a rare book of ancient magic from the wizard that might just destroy the world as they know it.  Livia struggles with her love for both men while new friends find love everlasting in the most unlikely of places. Alliances are formed and strengthened, enemy plots are revealed and through it all, the blossoming relationship between Livia and her two men stands strong…though their future seems uncertain. Will it work out for them? Only the Mother of All knows for sure.  Will the blind dragon learn to trust again? And if so, can the others form a family around him? Or will his stubborn pride, and evil outside forces, keep them apart forever?  * The Sea Captain's Daughter Trilogy consists of three novels all revolving around five main characters. Book 1 is called Sea Dragon and is available now in ebook and print.",
