  "description": "For more than four years, Martin McGartland lived the astonishing life of a secret agent. To the IRA, he was a trusted Intelligence Office and an integral member of an active service unit. To the British Government however, he was known only as Agent Carol. Martin McGartland is credited by British Intelligence with saving the lives of at least 50 people. Every time he tipped off the authorities, he risked detection and yet, heroically and fearlessly, he continued to pass on life-saving information. Finally, his cover was blown. Martin was taken from Sinn Fein headquarters in Belfast to an IRA safehouse for questioning and almost certain execution. Though guarded by three armed IRA men, in a desperate bid for freedom, he dived from a third floor window. This breathtaking story is now a major film starring Sir Ben Kingsley and Jim Sturgess.   \"The film is as near to the truth as earth is to pluto.  It is 99% fiction.  Read, the true story in my first book Fifty Dead Men Walking.\"  Says Marty.  Vist Marty's martinmcgartland.co.uk Song/Video from Fifty Dead Men Walking Film - Jim Sturgess Playing me (Sort Of); youtube.com/watch?v",
