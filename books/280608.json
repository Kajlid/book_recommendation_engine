  "description": "It’s company policy: don’t sleep with your employees. No matter how handsome and flirty they may be. Yet when my promotion puts me in charge of the three of them? That policy is going to be hard to follow.  Liam, the chestnut-haired boy-next-door I’ve flirted with for five years--and who is finally single. Arthur, the suave French accountant who pronounces my name like it’s an expensive wine. Robbie, the bashful computer nerd whose chiseled body and sleeve tattoos hint at something deeper.  The four of us have to finish our big project by Christmas. Which means my gorgeous employees are totally off-limits. But that just makes our professional relationship even more tantalizing. Especially as we start working long hours in the office.  With our careers on the line, can we ignore the growing attraction between us? Or will we all end up on Santa’s naughty list?  \nTHE NAUGHTY LIST\n is a sizzling, stand-alone Reverse Harem love story that is sure to fill you with holiday cheer. HEA guaranteed!",
