  "description": "In Hidden Magic, the first in a series about a secretive Eldritch sanctuary where magical beings fight to remain hidden from the outside world, a woman finds love—and the truth about herself—in a mysterious village in North Carolina. Sasha’s perfect life is destroyed when her wealthy fiancé Edward reveals his violent abusive side. Her harrowing, headlong escape leads her to Hallows, a mysterious hamlet in North Carolina when her car inexplicably breaks down. Hiding under a false identity, she takes the night shift at a local diner to pay for repairs. Despite her need to remain hidden, she is soon drawn into the life of Hallows. Sheriff Jake Wulfrick takes a personal interest in the beautiful newcomer. The sexy lawman finds her intriguing and desirable and Sasha must fight her own attraction to him. Peculiar things start to happen around her. Her blind landlady, Aunt Amelia, is oddly unaffected by her handicap and seems very much in charge. People appear in two places at once. Inanimate objects move on their own. Villagers watch her with suspicion and hostility. Soon she realizes Hallows has its own secrets and Sheriff Sexy is much more than he appears. The young woman’s arrival threatens to expose the supernatural nature of Hallows. And Sasha herself is about to uncover her parents’ lies about her own magical identity. When evil follows her to Hallows, will she be able to use her newfound powers to save herself, Hallows and the man she has come to love?",
