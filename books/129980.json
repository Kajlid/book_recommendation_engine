  "description": "Bo Burnham was a teenager living in his parents' attic in Massachusetts when he started posting funny songs to YouTube that immediately turned heads with their wise satire that belied his very young age. He quickly struck a chord. Over 16 million people watched his videos and he soon amassed a gigantic (and young) online following that excitedly awaited each new video. Soon after that, Bo became revered in all comedy circles for being a wholly original, highly intelligent young voice. Judd Apatow started championing the young comedian, and Bo taped his first Comedy Central special at age 18, the youngest in history. His comedy/song albums were huge critical and commercial successes. His MTV show ZACH STONE IS GONNA BE FAMOUS, of which he is the star, writer, director, and producer, and which largely comments on his own rise to fame, will premiere in 2013. Written in his very distinctive comedic voice, EGGHEAD: OR, YOU CAN'T SURVIVE ON IDEAS ALONE brings Bo's award-winning brand of brainy word play to the page in the form of off-kilter writings, thoughts, and poems. Collaborating with longtime friend, artist and illustrator Chance Bone, Bo writes about everything from painful breakups to bald barbers, in a collection that makes the reader laugh, but like his stand-up and music, also displays surprisingly mature insights. With one text piece and one original black & white illustration per page, this book will appeal to Bo's already established fans.",
