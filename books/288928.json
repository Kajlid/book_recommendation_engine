  "description": "If it wasn’t for bad luck, I wouldn’t have any luck at all. That saying is as old as the hills in Tennessee, where I used to live.  And it’s definitely true.   I’m a bad luck magnet, at least when it comes to men. Moving to Stone Lake was supposed to be a fresh start. Here, I was going to build a life I could be proud of. Finally put down roots and live quietly. Be safe and happy.  It didn’t quite work out that way, but I’m stubborn and I’m not about to give up. Ben Kingston was the first man to handle me with care. He gave me a glimpse of something I desperately wanted. And then, tore it away from me with the carelessness of one whispered word.  I don’t need a man to complete me. In fact, I’ve had enough of them. I’m okay with being single the rest of my life. I’ll be just fine with my handy friend B.O.B.  Except Ben keeps coming around, tempting me and a girl can only take so much. Ben’s out to prove I can trust him. I don’t trust any man, not anymore.  But my resolve weakens when he touches me, slides his hand down and proves buying stock in batteries might not be a good life plan.  Welcome back to the world of Stone Lake. Junie and Ben have a bumpy start for sure, but when trouble comes knocking on Junie’s door, will she let Sheriff Kingston prove he won’t let her down again?   Complete Standalone Romance",
