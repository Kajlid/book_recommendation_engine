  "description": "Then, Now and Beyond by Frank A. Reed Jr.Many times over the years when episodes of my life were told (like parachuting from a disabled plane or firing my rifle while on guard duty), friends would tell me--  that was interesting, why don't you write about it?  So, I decided to go for it.  Then, Now and Beyond  is my life. I lived it then, am living it now and how far into the beyond is in the Lord's hands.At age 13 my life changed from boyhood to manhood to help support a family of 10. Being the second child of eight, it became my job to help when my father took ill. Farm work wasn't easy, but it built me up for what lay service in the United States Marine Air Wing, my years with United Airlines, and my years of retirement.",
