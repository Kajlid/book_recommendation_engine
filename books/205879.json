By day he’s a tattoo artist who took the plunge and started his own business, but by night…  He’ll be whoever you want him to be—a wet dream in the flesh.  Brynn Palmer was content, enjoying her low-key life, one that rarely sprouted surprises. That is, until she crossed paths with the force better known as Marco.  It was only one night, but that one night changed everything.  ~  *To the guys, Indecent Exposure is more than just their place of business; it’s a place where they make women’s fantasies come true… and have a ton of fun doing it. “Marco” is the first standalone in “The Men of Indecent Exposure” series, so kick back and enjoy, but don’t get too comfortable.
