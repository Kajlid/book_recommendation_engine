  "description": "With high school mercifully drawing to a close, Emma's only question is, \"What next? And can it please be completely unlike what happened before?\" Then one lucky little lotto ticket seems to give the answer-or does it? Everything You Want is a story about what happens to an average family when money is suddenly no object. Although Emma is bright and creative and has a supportive family, she isn't exactly excited about life after high school. She's got her share of unresolved issues, including a disastrous ending to her crush of a lifetime, which left her with a broken heart and a bloody nose (how do you move on when the only boy you've ever wanted to date punches you in the face?). Then Emma's family wins fifty million dollars in the lottery, but instead of making everything better, it just makes everything more complicated. Everything You Want is the story of a young woman trying to figure out what she needs when, suddenly, she can have anything she wants.",
