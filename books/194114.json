  "description": "Fresh out of training, the Agency sends Kassie Shannon into the secret world of Robert Redmond. They know he’s using his billion-dollar software company to steal sensitive information. What they don’t know is who he is selling the stolen information to, and it’s her job to find out.  He is a highly organized and secretive individual, and gaining Robert’s trust will be no easy task. But his Achilles’ heel is his passion for the BDSM lifestyle, so Kassie poses as a trainee submissive and puts herself in his path.  Naturally cautious, Robert has never let a woman get under his skin... until now. There’s something appealing about this inquisitive brunette with her oddly changeable personality and her passion for all things painful. He agrees to become her Master, but soon falls for the chameleon beauty who is quickly becoming the most promising novice he has ever trained.  For Kassie there’s one big problem, though. The first rule of spying is not to fall in love on the job. Yet it’s hard to keep a professional detachment when your mark is all you ever wanted in a partner, and one who keeps opening doors to pleasures you never knew existed.  Still, sooner or later she will have to choose between two opposing demands—the cause she believes in, or the man she is bound to. Whichever choice she makes, it is likely that no one will win.",
