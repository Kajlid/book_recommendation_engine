  "description": "2005 RWA Golden Quill Best First Book Dear Mom, How’s Florida? Life in little ole Peeler, Oklahoma has been exciting. My new neighbor, big-time lawyer, Jason Brooks, has finished building his ultra-modern mansion next to my old dilapidated Victorian. The first time I met him, he knocked me off my feet—literally, right into the red dirt. I know what you’re thinking, but forget the matchmaking, Mom. A high society attorney wouldn’t go for a tree-hugging, vegetarian, health food store owner named Persephone Jones. (What were you thinking?) And by the way, the whole town is in an uproar over a proposed commercial hog farm. I’m leading the crusade against a huge corporation that wants to pollute our local environment. When I find out who’s behind this mess, I’m really going to let him have it. Gotta run, big town meeting tonight. Write soon. Love, Perse P.S. could you send me your recipe for chocolate chip cookies? I sort of promised that stuffed shirt brooks I would bake him some as a welcoming gift. Don’t get any ideas, I’m just being neighborly!",
