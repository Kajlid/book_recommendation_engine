  "description": "Brick, a bear shifter and the Sergeant at Arms for the Grizzly MC, is a recluse and bastard by all accounts. With an ugly past, and a scar to match, he is content with using club whores to pass the time. But then he sees Darra, a stripper and the only female that makes his cold, dead heart beat again.  Darra Strand has a past filled with emotional and physical pain, but she is stronger because of it. When someone threatens her, a savior comes in the form of an angry, scarred, and heavily muscled biker named Brick.  But when the MC has to go on a run out of state to help another charter, Brick is forced to leave Darra behind. A club rival decides the time for retaliation toward the Grizzlies has come. But Darra is Brickâ€™s and anyone that hurts her is as good as dead.",
