  "description": "The accident on the bridge had consequences far surpassing the death of the King: it set Evelyn on an adventure to track down a sorcerer and with the help of a swordsman destroy a powerful artifact before the forces of evil acquired it. But her story did not stop there or—as her psychologist believes—it never began. Waking from a coma, Evelyn believes she comes from a land of dragons and magic, but everyone else insists she simply has a wild imagination. With her own sanity to lose, she must decide which world is real. Dismissing her adventure as a dream means never seeing her beloved Roy again, but believing in him could cost Evelyn her sister. Either way she loses someone.",
