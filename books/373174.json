  "description": "“Here we have stories of Tzaddik, The Rat, the Rabbi… Lavie is mining ancient traditions and recent history to write stories of modern despair and a weird sort of redemptive compassion, messing with our expectations and always, always, leading with our humanity, even when those heroes are, by some standards, monsters.”—Laura Anne Gilman, author of Burning BridgesPopular short fiction writer Lavie Tidhar gathers some of his best work in one collection. Stories that are infused with centuries of tradition and painted with Hebrew mythology. We meet the Tzaddik as he faces off against a vengeful angel intent on sending the Fallen to hell. The shapeshifting Rat fights lycanthropic Nazis. The Rabbi takes us on a thoughtful and amusing journey into the possibilities of a Jewish state in the heart of Africa. Finally, all three protagonists appear in an old-fashioned caper story that will leave you breathless.Includes a special introduction from Hugo Award-nominated author Laura Anne Gilman.“Lavie Tidhar has staked out (no pun intended) his own territory by imagining a Judaic mystical alternative history into which he injects vampires, zombies, werewolves, Tzaddiks, golems, and Rabbis. These four stories are wondrous, adventurous, and thought-provoking.”—Ellen Datlow, co-editor of The Year’s Best Fantasy and HorrorBIOLavie Tidhar is the author of An Occupation of Angels and the editor of the critically-acclaimed international fiction anthology The Apex Book of World SF.",
