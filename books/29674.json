  "description": "Secrets and lies linger in the very walls of the solid Normandy house where Thérèse and Léonie, French and English cousins, grow up after the war. Intrigued by adults' guilty silences and the broken shrine they find in the woods, the girls weave their own fantasies, unwittingly revealing the village's buried shame, a shame that will haunt them both for the rest of their lives.",
