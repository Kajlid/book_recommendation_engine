  "description": "Every god has a story.\n\nIn the daunting peaks of Razor's Mountains, someone has twisted the war cats into hideous meat vegetables, slaughtering them and sending them to feed Ravager armies. It's enough to unsettle even Kita's stomach. But she refuses to relent until the war cats and their beautiful and alluring queen, Snowy, are free and have their vengeance. \nBut is it too late for Kita's Legion?\n\nKita's army was destroyed at Razor's Pass and Kita has nowhere left to go but journey into the Unfinished Wastes and learn the horrifying truth. The Ravager armies have overrun the Legion's tubesâ€”but remnants can be saved if Kita can get there in time.  \nKita must choose.\n\nSave what's left of her Legion, or stay, and protect the woman she loves.
