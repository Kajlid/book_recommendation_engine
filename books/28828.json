  "description": "Whoever might perfume a scorpionWill not thereby escape its sting.--Sufi master Bahaudin Naqshband Using the powerful approach of classical teachers, Shah has crafted a contemporary teaching tool that blends a fast-paced look at today's world with the timeless teachings of the Sufis. The book brings into sharp focus the conditioned behavior and self-deception that are common in Western minds. Far more than a literary tool for breaking loose old mental habits, it is a blueprint for a process of self-development that precludes self-deceit. Truly a book among books, A Perfumed Scorpion is treasured the world over for its clarity of wisdom and its forcefulness of insight.",
