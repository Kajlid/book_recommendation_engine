  "description": "The weirdest realms in fantasyHere again in these sixteen stories are the gorgeous, luxuriant, and feverishly distorted visions of infinite spheres and multiple dimensions which have made of Clark Ashton Smith's work something unique in the annals of the macabre. In this collection there are tales of Hyperborea, Zothique, Averoigne, Atlantis, Xiccarph, and other vanished worlds of Smith's unparalleled creation. Here are such unforgettable tales as Vulthoom, The Colossus of Ylourgne, The Charnel God, The Black Abbot of Puuthuum, The Weaver in the Vault, and others.None strikes the note of cosmic horror as well as Clark Ashton Smith. In sheer daemonic strangeness and fertility of conception, Smith is perhaps unexcelled by any other writer, dead or living - H.P. LovecraftHe had a monstrously vivid imagination, a keenly ironic sense of humour, and an uninhibited bent for the macabre. -  L. Sprague de CampCover illustration by Brice Pennington",
