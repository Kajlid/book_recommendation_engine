  "description": "Elizabeth is living a solitary life after the death of her parents until the day a beautiful stranger named Ali comes barging in. He is adamant on becoming a huge part of her life if she gives him a chance. Elizabeth finds in him a friend who holds her hand when she visits her parentsâ€™ graves, a rescuer from the monsters that live in college parties, and a lover who would die before he lets anything happen to her. His love makes her strong and helps her become who she is, until one fateful day when he is called back to his country. Her trust and hope are the only things that she holds on when she tells him goodbye. But will they be enough? Will she finally be with the one she let go or was it her mistake to find love when it was only there to break her heart?",
