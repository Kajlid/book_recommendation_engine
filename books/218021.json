  "description": "Magical realm - middle grade fantasy; young adult fantasy; older juvenile.(Now in paperback and ebook.)You never know what life's going to throw at you â€“ moving to a new place, making new friends . . . disappearing into a magical world!  On the brink of turning thirteen, Luke McKinnon survived moving halfway across the country from the cool California coast to the flat farmlands of Indiana. He left all his friends behind, sure he would never find new ones to replace them. \tWell, it took a while, but now that he's fourteen, Luke's actually made a pretty decent friend in Beth DeVere from right next door . . . but then she goes and gets herself swept up into some other world (he hadn't seen THAT coming!), and eventually he goes after her, and when they finally connect again . . . well, there's good news and bad. The place where they've ended up has some major drama going on and it's apparently Beth's job (with the help of her very best friend) to make everything better, even though there are dangers and secret enemies and a riddle that no one's been able to figure out for ten years! That's the good news, as far as Luke is concerned! It's like a super cool role-playing fantasy game with actual cloaks and daggers and weird creatures and swords that don't have rubber tips and the whole bit! . . . But they do need to go home eventually, and they're not quite sure how to manage that. So, that's kind of bad news.",
