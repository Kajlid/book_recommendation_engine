I’m robbed the day I arrive, left with nothing but a few euros and the clothes on my back.My desperation leads me right to Damiano De Rossi. He rules over this island with an iron fist and beneath his strikingly handsome face lies a wicked darkness. I ask him for a job. He gives me far more than that—degradation, jealousy, and toe-curling lust.When my resistance to him is all but gone, a secret is revealed, and we fall apart like a house of cards.I know what I have to do. Run.But when I try, I discover…he’s already got me bound.Note: When She Unravels is an 18+ dark mafia romance with mature themes, profanity, and plenty of steam. It's book one in The Fallen series but can be read as a standalone.",
