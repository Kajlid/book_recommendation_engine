  "description": "Colonel Brenden Winter was one of Queen Victoria's most trusted agents of her elite Secret Intelligence Service. Now, he is wanted for her murder, which he did not commit. His only recourse is to fake his own death, so that he can destroy the faction that set him up and has toppled an empire. His new persona is that of an ordinary London doctor, Heywood Atkinson. Now, he can hide in plain sight and plan the destruction of these evil men, who now rule the world. He is not alone in his mission. Colleagues, friends and agents throughout the world, who share this taste of freedom, have pledged to fight this injustice at every turn. The battle lines have been drawn and Brenden Winter has chosen to lead this fight, wearing the mask and armor of an avenger. He has become the city...every street, every alley, every shadow. He has become both protector and executioner. His enemies fear him, while the people have renamed him. They call him, the Archangel",
