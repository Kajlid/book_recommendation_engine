  "description": "I hate him. Now I can't get away from him. He's everywhere. My work, my home, and now because my dad was feeling overprotective, he's out with my friends to keep watch over us. We threw my friend an Anti-Bachelorette after her real Bachelorette got cancelled when we found out her fianc√© was cheating on her. Everything changed that night. All because of a stupid dare. Now I don't know how to act around him, but he's still everywhere I go.",
