  "title": "The Lynmouth Flood Disaster",
  "description": "The author of this book has written an excellent account of the disaster in N. Devon and W. Somerset which took place on August 15th, 1952. He traces the cause of the Floods, and then writes a story which depicts the enormous damage done to the Lynmouth area in the space of a few hours, the dreadful experience of many people, and the heroism so often displayed.The author brings out very clearly how well all, men and women, officials and volunteers alike, whether from local, County, Regional, or military organisations, worked together; and how their wholehearted co-operation succeeded in minimising suffering and getting all the services, on which the life of the district depended, into action again. - from the Foreword by Lord Fortescue",
