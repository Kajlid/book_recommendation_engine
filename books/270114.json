  "title": "Chasing Daylight: Seize the Power of Every Moment",
  "description": "Choices unlock divine moments. Pastor and author Erwin Raphael McManus invites readers to choose a life of blazing urgency. Are you willing to risk failure? Are you ready to get in the game? You may stumble, but you will find yourself falling forward, propelled toward the God-inspired adventure He intends you to live. Using the biblical characters of Saul and Jonathan during Israel’s war with the Philistines (1 Samuel 13 and 14), Chasing Daylight (formerly titled Seizing Your Divine Moment) demonstrates the difference between living a life of purpose and adventure and living one of apathy and missed opportunity. While Saul rested beneath a pomegranate tree, Jonathan seized the divine moment and redirected the future of Israel. McManus uses Jonathan’s example to artfully illustrates the eight characteristics of an adventurer’s heart, what he calls “the Jonathan factor”: We have but one life. We are given one opportunity to pursue our dreams and fulfill our divine purpose. Every moment counts, and we must engage them with fierceness and zeal. In Chasing Daylight , Erwin Raphael McManus offers the tools to put an end to passive observation and start seizing the raw, untapped potential of your life with God.",
