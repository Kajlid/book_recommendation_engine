  "description": "'The hunters' pack is swelling. They're whooping. The hounds are baying for my blood. The drumbeats are growing unbearably loud. They're circling me. They're closing in on me . . .'Yashwant Chittal's acclaimed novel Shikari, set in the concrete jungles of Bombay, weaves together the high-stakes conspiracies of the corporate world and the parochial intrigues of a close-knit community. Nagappa, a senior manager at an MNC, is framed for a crime he has not committed. As the story unfolds, it reveals a fiercely competitive arena where Man's primordial instincts surface, and the line between the hunter and the hunted is often blurred. Shikari is a monumental work in which Chittal, as far back as 1979, exposed the underbelly of the corporate world.",
