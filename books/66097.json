These opposites attract—he’s blue collar and she’s blue blood.Can they find some common ground? Only when they discover they both love music. Jessica turns to the piano as an escape from her legacy as the daughter of a steel magnate while Quade uses it as therapy after the death of a wife and newborn son.
