  "description": "It all starts when Judith Carstairs goes to a party on Sunday night (which she's pretty sure she's going to hell for) and ends with her being turned into a vampireâ€¦ sort of. Jude has a week to make it through the transition period without drinking blood if she wants to be human again, but with an English test, a delicious smelling best friend, and her handsome sire with a baby sister who hates her, it's going to be hard to keep her cool. Then there's the fact her parents are getting home from a business trip on Saturday, and oh yeah, there's that one werewolf named Kyle... Suddenly, hell seems the least of Jude's worries.",
