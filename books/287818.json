  "description": "A lost king…Goya is a rare magical being: a royal Beast. And not just any animal shifter, but the king of the earthly realm--the great white tiger. But now he is a king without a home, cut off from his kin, and trapped in a human body against his will. A single mother…Maddie Peterson is a career-minded single mother who has a fundamental distrust (and often, dislike) of men, especially in light of her cheating ex-husband and manipulative co-worker. But, then, she's never met a male like Goya before. Opposite worlds collide…When Maddie welcomes the silent stranger into her home, there is no denying their animal attraction. She teaches him how to be human, and he teaches her how to be wild. But when he gives his heart and soul to her, the pure spirit of the noblest of Beasts, is she brave enough to accept him as a partner into her life, as well as step into his fantastical, dangerous world?",
