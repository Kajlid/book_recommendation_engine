  "description": "“'Crach Ffinnant' The Prophecy”—It’s 1375 and the Welsh people have been “long chastised, ridiculed and ruled by the English...their hearts, heavy with doom. A great prince is waiting in the wings, not yet ready to rule but well placed to do so. He knows not at this time the destiny written for him but will awaken to come forth when the heavens decree, leading the down-trodden people to freedom.” A dwarf named Crach listens respectfully as his master relates the prophecy but wonders what it has to do with him, “a small man in a much bigger world!” That’s when his master, an aging wizard named Llwyd ap Crachan Llwyd tells Crach his apprenticeship of ten years is over and he must go on a long journey to the land of the accursed English where he will ultimately serve the future prince of Wales and fulfill his destiny according to the prophecy. Crach panics and protests. “Calm yourself, Crach,” Master spoke softly. “Do you honestly think I would send you on such a journey without all that you need to do what you must do? Keep your eyes on the heavens. A solution exists for every problem and it’s always a simple one. Justice always prevails. It is the way of all things!”",
