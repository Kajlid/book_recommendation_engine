  "description": "‘Glows with warmth and wit’ Jenny McLachlan, author of Flirty Dancing‘A witty, feel-good romp of a book’ Emma Carroll, author of Letters from the Lighthouse‘So warm and funny with characters who feel like friends’ Keris Stainton, author of \nStarring Kitty \n Elektra James is back and her life is more hilariously chaotic than ever! Elektra is hoping for BIG things this year... She's finished her first feature film (even if her character was unexpectedly killed off half-way through filming), hosted the party of the year (well, before her mum arrived and threw everyone out - how embarrassing!) and managed to become Archie Mortimer's Actual Real Life girlfriend (for now anyway...), so things are most definitely moving in the right direction. But with social media to navigate (#actinggoals #instanightmare), GCSEs looming and a seemingly never-ending parade of failed casting calls, Elektra's road to acting stardom is proving to be as rocky as ever. Full of humour and warmth, this is the perfect series for fans of Holly Smale, Katy Birchill, Beth Garrod and Marianne Levy.",
