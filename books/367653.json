  "title": "The Power of an Open Question: The Buddha's Path to Freedom",
  "description": "Asking challenging questions leads to powerful insights. That’s the premise of this first book by Buddhist teacher Elizabeth Mattis-Namgyel. How do we find a resting place in a world that is complex and always changing? How do we practice spirituality beyond the limits of blind acceptance and doubt? Elizabeth proposes that we access our deepest intelligence through asking these kinds of questions. “When we ask a question,” she suggests, “our mind is engaged yet open. The process of inquiry protects us from our tendency to reach static conclusions. Instead, we can respond to uncertainty and change with inquisitiveness and a sense of wonder.” Her book guides us on a provocative, playful, and spiritually enriching journey of contemplation that could last a lifetime.",
