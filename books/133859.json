  "description": "You'll be pleasantly surprised at what you discover beyond the front cover...It's a beautiful, heartfelt love story...Funny, amusing, emotional, and entertaining...Profound, thought-provoking, and inspirational...You'll laugh on one page and cry on the next...And in the end, perhaps you will discover that you too live inside a testimony meant to be shared with others!My first book is a collection of life lessons - stories that exemplify God's amazing love and abundant blessings. You'll witness the inspiration, faith, hope, humor, romance, and love that I experienced on an incredible journey. The stories revolve around my family, friends, and other individuals who have contributed, often unknowingly, to the path God has chosen for my life. You'll read about how I fell in love at age fourteen (with my future husband) followed by his near-death experience with emergency brain surgery a week before our high school graduation. I also share our amazing experience in New York a week prior to 9/11. You'll become captivated with the humorously frustrating 3-year ordeal my husband and I overcame when trying to purchase land that was NOT for sale in order to build our dream home right next door to my husband's beloved mother-in-law.Ultimately, you will discover that I have been living inside a testimony (and so have you), but it wasn't until I started writing that I realized what a monumental impact it can be to share my testimony with others. God has orchestrated my lifeâ€™s path every step of the way, and I hope you enjoy the journey as you take a walk with me, inside my testimony.",
