  "description": "Pop star Anna Howard is used to private planes and Hollywood privilege, not small towns and tree climbing. Back in Mill City to clean up her grandfather's house, Anna falls--literally--into the arms of the sexy single-dad next door.  When they were teenagers, Nick Maddox set her summer nights on fire with passionate kisses and wicked smiles. He's only gotten better with age. Now, with her heart on the line, it's time for Anna to decide what she's really looking for.",
