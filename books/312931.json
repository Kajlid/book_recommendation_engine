  "title": "The Dykemaster",
  "description": "First English translation in thirty years of Storm's Der Schimmelreiter, one of the masterpieces of nineteenth-century German fiction. \"\"This tremendous tale, with which Storm made his conception of the Novelle the epic sister of drama...\"\" - Thomas Mann. The Dykemaster (1888), is the tale of a legendary young dykemaster at odds with his community. Innovative and creative, he designs a new form of dyke. While supervising his work, he rides his grey horse along the dyke. When he is unwilling to engage in a sacrificial ritual of a dog to celebrate completion of the work, villagers think he is in the hands of evil powers. The passing of time and tides contributes to this misconception and he becomes a legend, a phantom riding his grey along the dyke whenever the sea threatens to break through. Storm's highly sophisticated narrative-within-a narrative structure is far in advance of its time. Denis Jackson's brilliant translation of Der Schimmelreiter recreates the full impact of Theodor Storm's masterpiece. \"\"There is plenty of eerie Germanic mood here, but there is also a fine and tragic story of a man who follows his own path to its final, terrible end.\"\" _Publishers Weekly.",
