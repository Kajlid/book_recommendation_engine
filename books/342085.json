  "description": "An honest, explosive novel that turns conventional ideas of 1950s femininity upside down, The Girls in 3-B reveals in page-turning detail the hidden world of mid-century America, showcasing predatory Beatnick men, workplace intrigues, drug hallucinations, repressed family secrets, and clandestine lesbian trysts. From the hip-hang of a bohemian lifestyle to the sophisticated lure of a wealthy boss to the happier—but taboo—security of a lesbian relationship, these three young women experience first-hand the adventures and the limitations that await spirited young working women who strike out on their own in a decidedly male-centered world.",
