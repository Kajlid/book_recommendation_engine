  "description": "Adelaide Davies, who's been living in Sacramento, returns to Whiskey Creek, the place she once called home. She's there to take care of her aging grandmother and to help with Gran's restaurant, Just Like Mom's. But Adelaide isn't happy to be back. There are too many people here she'd rather avoid-people who were involved in the events of that terrible June night fifteen years ago. Ever since the graduation party that changed her life, she's wanted to go to the police and make sure that the boys who were responsible-men now-are punished. But she can't, not without revealing an even darker secret. So it's better to pretend. Noah Rackham, popular, attractive, and successful, is shocked when Adelaide won't have anything to do with him. He has no idea that his very presence reminds her of something she'd rather forget. He only knows that he's finally met a woman he could love.",
