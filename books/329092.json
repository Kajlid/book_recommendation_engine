An immortal world on the brink.NaiyaI’m supposed to lead my coven… but I don’t think there’s anything I can do to stop the vicious wave from crashing down on us.

Their latest gambit has drawn the eyes of the Blood King… and he can’t take them off of me. I was taught to avoid the fae at all costs, especially Blood fae. After all, my father is Winter fae.And the Blood and Winter Kingdoms are at war.FinradorIt is my duty to end the war with the Winter Kingdom. I will succeed where my father failed.The Oracle has spoken. To kill the Winter Queen, I must claim my mate and harness her power… and the half-fae witch will lead me to my female.Naiya is a savage little thing. I would greatly enjoy playing with her.Alas, there is much at stake, and she must act as the tool I require her to be.For I am the Blood King, and the witch will cleave unto me.Note: Hydrous is a deliciously dark and steamy paranormal romance. It features enemies-to-lovers, forced proximity, fated mates, a dirty-talking and psycho-sunshine hero, and a grumpy warrior heroine. Each book in the Immortal Coven series has an HEA for the couple, but the series has an overarching plot. See \"Note for Readers\" in the book for the content warning.",
