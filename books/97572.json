  "description": "'Oh, this was sweet torture. To be this close to nirvana and walk away because I am coy. I closed my eyes tightly and swallowed down my fears. Theo wanted me. Like this. He craved me, in any way he could get me. Even if I wasnâ€™t his, even if this all was torn asunder tomorrow, how could I not take the chance to feel this, to share this, with him? Even if just for a moment.'For the past year Casey Eden has nurtured a crush on handsome, confident and slightly arrogant Theo Peters. For the first time in her life she's actually been able to flirt with a man. She even believed he was about to take their delicious flirtations to the next step.But then things changed.A pit full of dirt.A preternatural world she never knew existed.And a fire of passion ignited deep inside her heart.Now, they are sworn enemies, their attraction to each other a bitter-sweet temptation that will only lead to heartache in the end.

To do that, she must walk a dangerous tightrope between desire and reality.
