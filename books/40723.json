  "title": "Issues in Your tissues: Heal Body and Emotion from the Inside Out",
  "description": "Issues in Your Tissues is a practical, easy-to read guide to exploring the emotional holding that creates physical stress, pain and dis-ease. Full of stories, cartoons, exercises and clear descriptions, this book gives you the insight and tools you need to go into your body and get the healing answers you've been looking for.\"Our bodies continue to experience physical symptoms as long as we carry the emotional “charge” or vibration associated with them. Your bones may have knitted back together and you may have regained physical function, but if you have not also released the sadness or anger or fear in those tissues, your body will continue to let you know there are still issues to work on. The trick is recognizing your symptoms as an indication that there may be something non-physical to heal and then letting your body guide you to a solution.\"",
