  "description": "The Greater Haverhill Poets (GHP) invites you to enjoy this collection of poetry and art. All members worked enthusiastically on the project. Poets are lovers of language, of ideas and artists are visual interpreters of life and ideas. We hope that our readers will find the cooperative effort in this book a perfect blending of these two world views. The Greater Haverhill Poets have been meeting at the Haverhill (Massachusetts) Public Library since the early 1980s. New poets are always welcome to join and to share their work with us. We meet on the third Saturday of each month at the library from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.",
