  "description": "Bad news: No one is coming to save you.Good news: You can save yourself.THIS IS HOW YOU SURVIVE is a poetry collection of moments and a happy book before anything else. With poems such as \"I Think It's Brave\" and \"You Can Save Yourself,\" This Is How You Survive represents the circular journey of life. It does not shy away from grief and healing, or joy and anger.  It simply accepts them as they are.\"If you are looking for something to read that will inspire you to buy combat boots and the reddest lipstick you can find; that will make you want to grab your keys and drive off in search of adventure without a destination in mind; that will remind you that no matter how many people have tried to break you, you're still alive and kicking - this is the book for you.\"- Amazon Review",
