And Draven has learned his conflicting loyalties are going to cost a number of people a dear price.

Propelled by honor, duty and love, the three spend their nights searching for Jasmyne's mother and the ancient Greek relic she's stolen. And days sating their unrelenting carnal need for each other. Two men, one woman-and a driving sexual hunger that none can resist-in a race against time to save the innocent.or destroy themselves. \"Reader Advisory: While Carnal Hunger can be enjoyed as a stand-alone novel, readers may enjoy it more having read the earlier story.
