  "description": "The first day of school finally arrived, and boy was Isabella in for a shock! To her surprise all of the kids at her new school were not Mexican-American as she previously expected.In fact, there were kids from all racial groups, but there was one problem: there were too many cliques, making it hard for Isabella to fit in. Isabella grew tired of seeing all the division and began a quest to form a heritage club so that all students could come together and learn about each otherâ€™s heritages, likes, and dislikes. Who knows along the way they might find similarities.",
