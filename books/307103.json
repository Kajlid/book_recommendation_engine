  "description": "As a child, Griffin Hilliard’s special abilities were attributed to an overactive imagination. But by adulthood, his psychic talents were so strong he’d become a threat to his politically powerful family. To protect their dirty little secrets, they arranged an “accident” for him. He survived, but now he lives on the run, only one step ahead of his family’s hired assassins. Until one night, when he’s finally caught... His life is saved by a mysterious man named Jarrah. Griffin senses a dangerous, primal undercurrent in the stranger—as if he’s not quite human. Yet Griffin’s inexplicably drawn to him. It could be the emotional pain he suspects his rescuer hides. But Griffin fears the real reason is more disturbing—Jarrah stirs a powerful longing in him that goes against everything Griffin’s ever believed about himself. As the assassins close in once again, and his rescuer reveals himself for what he really is, Griffin’s torn between running, as he’s done his whole life, or standing up to face his past...and his own soul-deep desires...
