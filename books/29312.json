  "description": "Eric's band is on the verge of making the big time and life is good. But when he's forced to work with Faith, a sexy but hateful videographer, life for the foreseeable future might be a little rocky. The tension between Eric and Faith is nearly tangible. Their troublesome friction abruptly becomes a lust-hate situation, fraught with vicious barbs and spite, but an explosive sexual chemistry that could burn them both, leaving nothing but a pile of ash in its wake. But Cupid has a wicked sense of humor and the two of them will find that the person you hate the most can sometimes rock your world the hardest.A 30,000 word story that's heavy on romance, passion, and ultra heavy on the sex!",
