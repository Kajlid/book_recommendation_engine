  "description": "YA Fantasy Adventure in the lost realm Under the Mountain – Book 2. Blood Crystal: the sequel to Heart of the Mountain  The underground realm is under attack from mad Overseer Uzza and the Crystal Heart is failing. As things become desperate, Twins Delvina and Retza must brave a treacherous journey to seek help from their new friend Zadeki and his people.  Will they find the answers they seek before it’s too late? Is the blood of Uzza’s children the only way to restore the Crystal Heart? What are the twins prepared to do to save their realm and those they love from certain destruction?  Blood Crystal is the second novella in the Under the Mountain series. Like most of my fiction, it is set in the world of Nardva and occurs after the events of Ruhanna's Flight (Glimpses of Light) and before the saga of the Akrad's Legacy series (Akrad's Children coming soon).",
