  "description": "I have a responsibility to use my powers for good - and that means saving his life.\n  I don’t know where my special abilities came from. I was abandoned as a baby, and I grew up pretty rough in some of the riskier areas of Detroit. I was just some dumb kid before my powers manifested… but once they did, I knew I had a purpose.  They call me the Ghost of Detroit. I save people. Hunt down the bad guys. The night I found him, I thought I was seeing another gang deal go down. But it wasn’t. This was something more.  I don’t know what it is I’m stepping in, but I need to keep him safe. There’s this heat between us that I’ve never felt before. Like he’s the only thing that matters.  Omega’s Savior is the fifth book in the epic mpreg Guardian Dragons series. Featuring a sweet and steamy love story between an omega who doesn’t believe in super heroes and a dragon who doesn’t know what he is, this adventure romance will have you on the edge of your seat! While Omega’s Savior can be read as a standalone, it is best read as fifth in its series.",
