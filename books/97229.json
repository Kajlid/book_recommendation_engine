  "description": "In this open and honest mini-memoir, Aaron Dietz describes the strangest things that have ever happened to him. He's seen glowing balls of energy in his bedroom. He's successfully communicated with spiders. A god once told him of its existence. And he's become a sort of god himself (though only for a limited period of time). These are the things that Aaron Dietz wants to tell you, just in case he dies.",
