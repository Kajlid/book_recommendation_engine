  "description": "Easy To Lose is a stand-alone novel set in Kristen Proby's Boudreaux Universe.Leaving New York after my now ex-fiancé cheated on me was easy.Moving back home to Miami to run Charly Boudreaux’s Head Over Heels expansion store, even as it scares the hell out of me…also easy.Finding out that Owen Peters, my ex-best friend and the boy I fell in love with in high school, the one who broke my heart, works next door? Not quite so easy.Hearing that Morgan Lawson is finally coming home makes me ecstatic. It provides me with a second chance—something I waited ten years to grasp.Watching her struggle to accept the body she was born with, the one that makes me crazy with desire, allows me to show her exactly how beautiful she is, both inside and out—and how much she means to me.Letting her go the first time was a huge mistake, and I refuse to go down that road again. Because not realizing how easy she was to lose, or how not having her in my life makes me feel incomplete, is something I never want to experience again.",
