  "description": "\"I was drowning and he rescued me, even if it meant the cost of him drowning. Even if it meant him being swept out to sea, lost forever...\"Penny is not your typical college student. She's shy, socially awkward and suffering from an extreme case of just wanting to be invisible. She prefers to listen to music and tune out the rest of the world by getting lost in her own thoughts. Lucas is the exact opposite. He's in a band, he says whatever he wants and has been known to get into trouble. Everything changes when he meets Penny. Suddenly, saying or doing the wrong thing might scare her away and that's the last thing he wants. But sometimes things need to be said, no matter what the consequences are or how reckless they may seem. ***Contains Adult Language***",
