  "description": "Holbrook loves to paint. He HAS to paint. But no one in the dusty town of Rattler’s Bend understands how important art is. Hoping to find someone who will appreciate his artistic efforts, the young lizard sets off for Golden City, where he encounters a colorful cast of characters, from singing snails to scruffy pigeons. The elegant mink and renowned art patron Count Rainier Rumolde takes Holbrook under his paw and introduces him to the great artists of the day, among them the prima ballerina Margot Frogtayne and the amazing tenor Enrico Escargot.But not all that glitters is gold, and Holbrook soon finds himself trapped in a frightening world he didn’t know existed. His only chance at escape is to rely on the few tools at his disposal—imagination, courage, and newfound friends.Hilarious black-and-white drawings illustrate the zany cast of characters in this charming story about a lizard's desire to show his true colors.
