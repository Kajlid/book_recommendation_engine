  "description": "You might have seen me on TV a few times, on commercials, on cereal boxes. Yes, I'm the Magnus Fuller. Some people call me the best Quarterback in the league. Other people just call me the cockiest guy in football.I win games, period. That's all that matters.At least that's all that mattered until a bad play ended up knocking out some stupid fan in the stands. Now my agent wants me kissing the ass of this girl... taking her on dates and acting like I care.I thought Cricket was just like every other woman when I first met her, but she's not. She's not impressed by my fame and fortune. In fact, she doesn't seem like me at all. And that just makes me want her even more.I've got to get my head back in the game, but it seems like the only thing I can focus on lately is her.",
