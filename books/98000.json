  "description": "A charmingly funny read-aloud that asks an important \"Who sank the boat?\"Beside the sea, there once lived a cow, a donkey, a sheep, a pig, and a tiny little mouse. They were good friends, and one warm, sunny morning, for no particular reason, they decided to go for a row in the bay. Do you know who sank the boat?“The idea is funny, the pictures are splendid, and the easy text is just right for the very young.”— The New Yorker“A bright, brisk tale, simply told, illustrated by cheerful, comical pictures.”— The Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books",
