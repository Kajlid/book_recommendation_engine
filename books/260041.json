  "title": "South Tamilnadu Recipes: OPOS Cookbook",
  "description": "Tamilnadu has rich and varied cuisines. I grew up on the Tirunelveli cuisine and got introduced to the Sivakasi cuisine after my wedding. A computer engineer by profession, cooking became mainstream for me only after kids. I became conscious of the food we cook and eat. I started to learn nutrition-rich dishes from family/relatives/friends and routinely started cooking them at home. However, the traditional method of cooking is complex and time consuming. That’s when OPOS happened like a breath of fresh air! The simple, scientific approach to food and recipes piqued my interest and there has been no looking back.  This cookbook, is my humble attempt to bring back the spotlight on our cuisine. The dishes which were perfected by our great grandmothers and their mothers; which required them to toil for hours in the kitchen; can now be made in minutes, with all their goodness, requiring very less manual labour. Thanks to OPOS!  OPOS (One Pot, One Shot) is the cleanest, greenest, healthiest, tastiest and fastest way to cook just about anything. OPOS works for anyone, anywhere, anytime! This is the OPOS promise.  We will show you how to make “Maapillai Sodhi”, “Milagai Kuzhambu”, “Ulundhang Kali”, “Ulundhu Paal/Kheer” called fondly as the ‘protein power house’ by many, “Thiribagam” – termed as the king of sweets down south, and lots of other simple and complex dishes, all in minutes.  I have covered the crème de la crème of dishes from the mentioned regions of South Tamilnadu, using OPOS techniques. I hope we cherish and enjoy all the goodness of our cuisine, for a long and healthy life!",
