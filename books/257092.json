  "title": "The Big Green House",
  "description": "Akhtar Naraghi is a Canadian poet, writer and scholar. She holds a doctorate in English literature from McGill University and works in English. Her novels are all written in the first person, and revolve around the narrator's efforts to make a home in new surroundings, in different cultures. She has published four novels, in the first three of which – The Big Green House (1994; short-listed for the QSPELL Hugh McLennan Prize for Fiction in 1995), Blue Curtains (1999) and With Mara That Summer (2004) – the narrator-protagonist recounts episodes from her life, beginning in early childhood and ending with her declining years. Deeply concerned with human rights, she is currently the President of the International Organization of the Helen Prize for Women which annually honors the achievements of women of the world, whatever their backgrounds or fields of endeavor. The narratives in this book can be viewed as separate stories or as a single story with a variety of experiences filtered through the consciousness of one narrator/protagonist. Together the narratives comprise a female bildungsroman exhibiting the deeply personal and agonizing struggle for meaning and purpose. With a courageous facing of the future, the chief character accomplishes that status afforded Dilsey in William Faulkner’s “The Sound and the Fury”.",
