  "title": "The Invention of Christianity",
  "description": "The Invention of Christianity is an exploration of the influence that Hellenization had on the evolution of Judaism into Christianity. It investigates how the stories of Dionysus could have evolved into that of Jesus, how rituals of the Dionysian mysteries are now found in Christianity, and the evolution of the Greek conception of the afterlife into the current Christian conception of Heaven and Hell.This book utilizes many of the ideas put forth in Drakeâ€™s first book The Invention of Religion throughout its investigation. It also looks into whether the Bible really had a divine source or was invented by humans and contains two appendices charting the age of the world according to the bible and the stories contained in each of the synoptic gospels.",
