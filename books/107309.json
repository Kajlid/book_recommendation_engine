  "title": "Attack Hitler's Bunker!",
  "description": "The RAF secret mission that never happened - probably.Richard Earlgood, maverick RAF veteran from the Battle of Britain, and Michael Dorfmann, an ambitious Luftwaffe pilot turned double-agent, plan a daring attack against Hitler in his bunker. They are brought together by Anna, a Station X decoder. With a dark, Italian beauty, she is the booty both men want to win.Richard comes up with an audacious plan which will test his new, crack squadron of pilots to their limits.The odds are increasingly slim of either pilot surviving as German Intelligence gets wind of the plan and Hitler orders counter-measures. As the Hurricanes descend into the Hell's Mouth around the Reich Chancellery it seems as if the whole Third Reich is there to stop them.Fans of 633 Squadron will love this white-hot roller-coaster ride through the streets of Wartime Berlin on a bombing mission with no equal. All profits from sales of this book until 10 September 2015 will go to The Stirling Aircraft Project Charity, a project to build a Short Stirling front fuselage section from as many original parts as possible, in commemoration of the people who designed, built flew and maintained this historic aircraft.",
