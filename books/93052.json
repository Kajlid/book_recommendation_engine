  "description": "David’s stories are engaging, entertaining, and full of both true and embellished historical facts. Growing up during the depression as a Jewish boy with an Arabic-sounding name in what he describes as a dysfunctional family environment gave him plenty of fodder for his stories. Young, middle-aged, elderly, Jewish, non-Jewish, baby boomers, folks who grew up during the depression, business people, men, and women will all find David’s stories not only enjoyable but also will see parts of their own lives that parallel the times of his life cleverly depicted in humorous, engaging, and partially auto-biographical tales. David was a huge fan of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David who both talk about “nothing” and make it hysterical. Many of David’s stories emulate their styles while making fun of himself and others in whatever particular niche of life his story involves. His stories are timeless and have universal appeal.",
