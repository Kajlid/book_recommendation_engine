  "description": "Since the age of six I was used to losing everything I had ever loved. My life was boring and pitiful to say the least. No boyfriend, no friends and most importantly no parents. Some might think that hearing your mother's treacherous screams as she is being stabbed to death in the other room is disheartening and clearly very traumatizing. But looking back on it now, I realized that loosing my parents was just the first few drops of rain before the big storm. There were always mysteries behind my sheltered childhood, things that I learned I was oblivious to as a child. I would never of thought that the death of my parents would've caused me to be thrown into a society with species unlike you could ever image, filled of so much hatred and rage. And unfortunately for me the only think that they had all in common was to kill me. But the thing is though I didn't want to die just because of who my parent's were or the division that they belonged to. Isn't it funny the target that can develop on your back by just having ties to certain people? I thought that stuff just happened in movies. Some might think my life is like a movie but guess what people I am living in my own personal hell. Above all else I am trying to survive in a world I didn't even know was real. But don't start feeling bad for me now because upon staring death in the face I was also met with the person who's responsibility was to keep me alive. Not only from the monster who's job was to savagely rip me apart but from all the twist and turns this world was going to throw at me. A world full of bloodshed, tears, torture and trembling events that will keep you up at night asking yourself why?",
