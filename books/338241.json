  "description": "Security. Protection. Enforcer.It’s not what I do, it’s who I am down to my very core. Which is why I throw myself in harm’s way when a woman is endangered at the club where I work.But not just any woman. Her.She’s unlike anyone I’ve ever met, every possessive bone in my body rising up with the need to claim her, keep her safe, and put a baby in her belly and make her mine…forever.I know I’ve found the one but when a friend tips her off about the kind of club where I work, she suddenly starts to question just how secure she feels about being in my presence.She already knows I’m the man she wants, now it’s up to me to prove to her I’m the man she needs. Always.And I’m going to do exactly that…no matter how long or what it takes. Because she’s mine. Forever.",
