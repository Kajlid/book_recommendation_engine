  "description": "Are you ready for more Kit and Bobby?   After an attack that almost claimed her life, Kit wakes to find her boyfriend standing at her back, exactly where he said he'd always be. He'll protect her forever, just like he promised, but there  is  such thing as too much love.  His coddling threatens to smother her.  He means well, but Kit craves independence and the satisfaction of knowing her enemies canâ€™t take anything more from her. With a wedding to plan, and a career-making (or destroying) fight Bobby needs to prepare for, the Kincaid household is too busy for the secrets in the air.  This tight-knit family  will  be torn apart.  Despite the volatile undercurrents hurting those he loves, Bobby  must  train and win, or risk losing everything he ever worked for.   Please Note   This book is a republication of the 2017 version of Finding Victory. It's rewritten, recovered, re-edited, and contains extra content and bonus scenes.",
