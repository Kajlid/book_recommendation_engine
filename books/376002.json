  "description": "Savage World Deep in the jungled hell of Big Tamtung, a miraculous material is found that will unlock the secrets of life on Earth--Prima Materia, whispered about since Biblical times. In the 19th Century, Charles Darwin discovered the last pool of Prima Materia on Big Tamtung but his discovery was suppressed by The School of Night, a powerful secret society. Now, when a small group of scientists and fortune hunters explore the jungles of Big Tamtung, they must endure frightening tests of their ingenuity and courage, as they struggle against ancient terrors--a lost world of dinosaurs and a miracle older than time. Lavishly illustrated by Jeff Slemons. Cryptozoicaâ€¦where the past has not stopped breathing! \"CRYPTOZOICA is a novel for those who really want to sink their teeth into something engrossing to the finish. For a modern take on pulp adventure, you would be hard-pressed to find one that delivers like this. -Bruce Grossman, Bookgasm",
