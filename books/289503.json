  "title": "FOUNDATIONS OF THE FUTURE: THE GLOBAL BATTLE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE",
  "description": "Foundations of the Future examines the geo-economic and geo-strategic implications of a growing global \"battle\" to promote infrastructural connectivity across and between continents of the world. In this context, it highlights the importance of China's Belt and Road Initiative and of corresponding initiatives by the United States, Japan, India and Australia, among others.This book argues that many of the world's most advanced economies have neglected investment in basic infrastructure in recent decades, at a potential cost to their future economic and social development. It examines some of the financial and ideological constraints behind this neglect and argues that advanced economies in general need to adopt fundamental reforms in their approach to infrastructure. By emphasising the \"battle\" elements of emerging infrastructure competition among major powers, the book sets out to alert policymakers to the danger of some of these powers losing out in what is becoming a race to stay ahead or even abreast of others in the bid to achieve global physical connectivity. General readers, economists, financial analysts, engineers, politicians, diplomats, university students, logistics specialists, academics.",
