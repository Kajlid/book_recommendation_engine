  "title": "Rolling with the Punchlines: A Memoir",
  "description": "Written with her trademark deadpan humour, Urzila's memoir is full of great stories about both the big things in life and the little things.  Urzila's accidental beginning in stand-up has led to an incredibly successful career in comedy, with regular gigs on television as well as sell-out shows in comedy festivals across New Zealand and Australia.  But life hasn't always been a bundle of laughs. Urzila talks candidly about her childhood with a great family, apart from her abusive dad, and about growing up in South Africa. She shares crazy but true tales about her OE, her move to New Zealand, coming out, getting married and having children, and her life in comedy.  This is a great listen from one of our most loved and most popular comedians.",
