  "description": "Terry Davenport is new to the job as Walkerville’s chief of police, but he takes his position seriously – even though very few things of note happen in the small hamlet. Walkerville may be boring, but Terry’s personal life is anything but.When termites infest his house, Terry has no choice but to check into a local inn while his home is being tented. He chooses the Winchesters’ bed and breakfast, of course, and he’s hoping for good food and a modicum of entertainment from the young girls he loves so much.Instead of relaxation, though, Terry finds himself in the thick of things when teenagers Bay, Clove and Thistle inform him that they’re sure some of the new guests at the inn are up to something nefarious. Terry thinks they’re jumping to the wrong conclusion, but he finds their endeavors to suss out the truth entertaining – even as Tillie Winchester eggs them on and makes things worse.Unfortunately for Terry, it looks as if two scam artists are making their way to Walkerville and – surprise, surprise – the girls might be right after all. It’s up to Terry to find out the truth… and keep the people he cares about safe.This is a short story set in the Wicked Witches of the Midwest world. It’s set back in time so it can be read at any point in the timeline.",
