  "description": "Roddy Doyle dazzled and delighted readers with his \"Barrytown Trilogy,\" beginning with The Commitments, hailed by critics as the freshest and funniest first novel in years. Now, in his latest novel, a number-one best-seller in England and Ireland, Doyle takes us to a new level of emotional richness with the story of a young boy trying to make sense of his world.It is 1968. Patrick Clarke is ten. He loves George Best, Geronimo, and the smell of his hot water bottle. He hates zoos, kissing, and the boys from the Corporation houses. He can't stand his little brother Sinbad. He wants to be a missionary like Father Damien, and he coerces the McCarthy twins and Willy Hancock into playing lepers. He never picks the scabs off his knees before they're ready.Kevin is his best friend. Their names are all over Barrytown, written with sticks in wet cement. They play football, knickknack, jumping to the bottom of the sea. They shoplift. Robbing Football Monthly means four million years in purgatory. But a good confession before you died and you'd go straight to heaven.Paddy wants to know why no one jumped in for him when Charles Leavy had been going to kill him. He wants to stop his da arguing with his ma. He's confused: he sees everything, but he understands less and less.Witty and poignant, earthy and exuberant, Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha charts the triumphs, indignities, and bewilderment of a young boy and his world, a place full of warmth, cruelty, love, and slaps across the face.",
