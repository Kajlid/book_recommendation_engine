  "description": "Stand-alone Wishing Well romance, complete with HEA--and plenty of heat and heart along the way!  For Bryson O’Sullivan, Wishing Well was home. He had a good life with his family and friends but the sexy Irish-Texan knew something was missing and he found it when he laid eyes on her…  Kelsi Robbins was ready to do what no one had ever done for her; make someone else priority number one. And as new guardian for her younger brother Milo, she had enough to worry about. Which meant that falling for him was out of the question…or was it?  He wants nothing more than to be there for her, and she has to be there for someone else, but when love enters the picture, Kelsi will have to decide if Trusting Bryson is worth it all.",
