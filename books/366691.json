  "title": "The Poetic Edda: Volume III Mythological Poems II",
  "description": "This volume presents four of the most intricate and fascinating mythological poems of the Poetic Edda , with parallel translations and individual introductions and commentaries. 'Havamal', notable for its unforgettable flashes of beauty and despair, explores the nature of human knowledge. 'Hymiskvita' is the boisterous tale of the giant Hymir. 'Grimnismal', the lay of Grimnir, the Visored God, is a dramatic monologue spoken by Otin. The final poem, 'Grottasongr', is the song of two girls kept as slaves by King Froti to work at his magic grindstone. Ursula Dronke provides new and illuminating textual readings of these celebrated works.",
