  "title": "Victor Hugo: Poems of Romance and Revolution",
  "description": "Victor Hugo is celebrated globally for Les Misérables and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, but in France, he is equally revered as a leading Romantic-era poet and an iconic political figure. This volume presents the four books of poetry written by Hugo during the July Monarchy, a turbulent period in France’s transition to republicanism.\nAutumn Leaves\n (Les Feuilles d’automne) offers poignant reflections and intimate inspirations, while \nSongs of Twilight\n (Les Chants du crépuscule) responds passionately to a nation in turmoil. In \nInner Voices\n (Les Voix intérieures), Hugo delves into personal and philosophical meditations, and \nSunlight and Shadows\n (Les Rayons et les ombres) masterfully blends vivid imagery with universal themes.Together, these works capture the political and emotional currents of the time, offering a window into Hugo’s literary and political evolution during one of France’s most revolutionary chapters.",
