A plain cardboard box in the mail blows when he opens it. Pumps hot nails through his face.So begins the series of mail bombs that beckons FBI profiler Violet Darger to New York.The bomber's plan is meticulous -- an ever growing spectacle of gruesome violence meant to spread his cryptic message piece by piece. And the clock is ticking.Starting at midnight tonight, a bomb will go off roughly every eight hours, and a target will be neutralized.The bomber has left chunks of his journal throughout the city. These not only articulate his twisted message, they contain clues about the bombs.Clues for names. Clues for places.Everything law enforcement needs to locate and disarm one of the bombs is there... if they can find it in time.It's a race against the clock.Understanding the bomber's psychology could be the key to deciphering the codes and riddles, the key to saving lives.Darger faces a threat on a scale unlike anything she's encountered so far. If she doesn't solve the clues in time, thousands will die.Let the countdown begin.",
