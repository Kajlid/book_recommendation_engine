  "description": "The world of the Vormonde is a world of wolfmen and wiseguys. Tythia is from the ordinary neighborhood of Twin Rivers but a chance arrest, down in the Hook, leads her into the center of a street war between the Vormonde Packs. The only one who can save Tythia from the vengeance of Strong-Arm Vinse and his Nightstalkers is Balladur the Sly. But in protecting Tythia, Balladur brings her into a world her mother had always hid her from. To save her life (and reunite with the man she loves) Tythia must come to terms with her heritage as a Vormonde Queen.",
