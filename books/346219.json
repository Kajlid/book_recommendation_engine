  "description": "Manoj Mishra gives up his PhD and moves with his wife to work at an institute that perfects the artificial insemination of the Indian cow with European sperm so she produces more milk to end poverty in Indian villages. In Nandgaon, a village that has consciously decided to turn its back on modernity, the simple Ramu sneaks off and marries a beautiful educated girl, Laxmi, who is considered tainted because of her father's suicide. Soon after his marriage, Ramu finds an abandoned cow in the forest and adopts it. The two unlikely couples meet, and what is at stake is not a cow or a human, but the identify of Nandgaon, and of India itself. Lanterns on their Horns is a huge, ambitious and compulsive novel reminiscent of both Charles Dickens and Naguib Mahfouz.",
