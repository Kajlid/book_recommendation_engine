  "title": "Tangle Wood: A Captivating Colouring Book with Hidden Jewels",
  "description": "Enter the calming and beautiful, magical world of illustrator and papercutter, Jessica Palmer. Jessica has created 80 pages of enchanting hand-drawn pictures for you to color and lose yourself in. The images all have a magical woodland theme, and each one includes a 'hidden jewel', intricately worked into the design. Rings, brooches, pendants, chains, bracelets and earrings featuring insects, animals and leafy patterns. The book includes designs that fit on a single page as well as those that extend across a double-page spread and there are even those that have space left for the reader to extend the design themselves. A stunning book with lay flat, unbreakable 'flexi' binding and high quality paper resistant to ink bleeding. Unleash your creativity and calm the soul.",
