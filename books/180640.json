This book is not intended to be read as a stand-alone.  Can one phone call change everything? For Kasi Markson and Radek Cole, it does.  The day Kasi receives a call from an unexpected person, her world shifts. That one call puts into motion a series of events that brings old friends back into her life and opens up a wound she tried hard to bury.  Kai Sabata is the lead singer of the rock band Stars and Lies. When he shows up on Kasi’s doorstep with his bandmate, Lee, secrets are revealed, relationships are forever changed, and the media has once again focused their attention on her.  After all that she has been through, Kasi knows she can’t fight the battle alone. Radek is the one man who sets her body aflame and makes her feel loved like never before. His decisions leave her wondering if she truly knows the man she shares her bed and heart with. Will he stand beside her and fight, or leave her when she needs him most?",
