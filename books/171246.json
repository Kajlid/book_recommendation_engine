Translated by Keith Holyoak, this volume includes an introduction to the poets and their work, plus a bibliography. Holyoak's translations capture the essential beauty of the poetsâ€™ language, while retaining key elements of the structure of the original poems, including their metric form and rhyme scheme. The poems transport the reader back to the Tang dynasty of 8th-century China, while at the same time conveying timeless insights into the human condition that remain as relevant today as they were centuries ago.",
