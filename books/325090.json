  "description": "Monsters lurk beneath the roaring high seas … When street rat Del stows away on a merchant vessel he’s worried about staying hidden, not sea monsters. But when a kraken attacks, Del is thrown overboard and finds himself stranded on a desert island, one of three survivors. Rescue is impossible when they discover the kraken still lurking in the surrounding waters, desperate for the dragon eggs one of them is carrying. Del, wealthy merchant’s daughter Etenia, and former dragon rider Lathan must find a way off the island before the kraken finishes them. Del has only ever heard rumors of dragon riders and thought those stories were myths, but now Lathan’s clutch of dragon eggs is their only hope. But Del knows all too well that he can only rely on himself, so how is he supposed to bond with a dragon? He’ll need to learn quick or the monster in the deep will get him. Help isn’t coming and the only way off the island will be on the back of a dragon. Can Del really rely on his companions and a dragon hatchling? Or will his only hope of escape be to go it alone?",
