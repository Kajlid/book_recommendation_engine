  "title": "Dream Wrecks",
  "description": "Mitch Alexander, a gifted artist battered emotionally by the horrors of war, claws his way back toward normalcy through the healing power of art. Then he vanishes while painting on the Malibu cliffs-into captivity deep in Mexico. A chance for forbidden love appears and he goes for it regardless of the risk. Armed with an amazing talent and a marine's survival instinct, he faces a savage drug cartel and a rogue government intelligence operation. Dream Wrecks gives the reader a view into Mitch's psyche at the moments of artistic creation that keep him alive-and it jolts the reader with the brutal realities of a high tech drug war with Mitch in the cross hairs. The crackling action rips through central Mexico from lovely San Miguel de Allende to the exotically dangerous Sierra Gorda. Dream Wrecks is a mesmerizing roller coaster of plot twists hurtling to an extraordinary surprise ending.",
