  "description": "Dorothy Kimble is an eager young college student with great grades and a passion for history. But Dorothy's no ordinary, innocent college kid: she's a conjurer. Descended from a long line of patrons of the spirits, her family safeguards the customs of their ancestors who grant them their powerful magic through their concentrated earthbound spiritual energy. Nearly a year after the death of Dorothy's beloved grandmother, she is pulled back into her Midwestern hometown only to find her fellow conjurers in distress. Bound by a curse brought upon by harvesters, users of dark blood magic, the congregation is in need of Dorothy's assistance. The alternative is falling victim to the sacrificial rituals of the harvesters.",
