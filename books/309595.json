  "description": "August Monreaux was a stormy sea of a man, the dark between the stars, an electric chill cutting through a crowded room—all wrapped into one wicked, beautiful package. He was also off-limits. My entire life, I was kept a safe distance from the notoriously virulent Monreauxs, banned from so much as breathing the same air. And like the good daughter I was, I obeyed those rules. Until the one time I didn’t … Only while I sampled him, he devoured me like the forbidden fruit that I was. And in the blink of an eye, my worst enemy became my first love. His poison became my antidote. His touch, my addiction. And then he made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. So I didn’t. But falling in love was never part of our secret arrangement. Our futures were written in the stars long before either of us were born. But what a Monreaux wants, a Monreaux always gets. And August will stop at nothing to make me his—even if it costs him everything. AUTHOR’S This angsty, forbidden romance has major Romeo and Juliet vibes but promises a HEA. :-)",
