  "description": "Welcome to Your Energy Works. Richard has combined a number of different modalities with God Consciousness to create effective treatments for Anxiety, Stress and past experiences/memories that intrude into one’s daily lives today. For too long we have been searching outside of ourselves for self-acceptance, self-forgiveness and peace of mind.Richard’s journey took him into a world of addiction self-harm, dysfunctional behavior and relationships, self-medication and prescribed medication.Finally, Richard reached his rock bottom in recovery and went back to the source. In every religion and spiritual practice, the message is loud and clear.‘’if you ask for your mountain to be removed, it will be done’’Richard’s mountains were anxiety, stress, fear, disassociation, depression & resentments.He learned from a Jesuit priest how to start the process of having his mountains individually removed.[He has included this prayer practice in Your Energy Works.]To complete each removal he would need to do his part and so over the years learned a number of different healing modalities and today combining the best of these with prayer he created this book of healing.Approach this book with an open mind and Richard believes it will have a lasting effect on your life and that of those you share it with.",
