  "description": "Unexplainable things happen. Some call it coincidence, some say supernatural. In the compelling psychological thriller, Kingdome Come, CA, author Judy Strick introduces fascinating and some times scary questions about what we call reality. Ruby Wellman, a reclusive surrealist artist, hides a deep and horrifying childhood secret. As does Finn McCord, a profoundly disturbed six-year-old who talks only to animals and imaginary friends. Their lives intersect in Kingdom Come, a tiny mountain town in the middle of nowhere, California; a lovely setting with a requisite share of colorful and eccentric citizens, including an herbalist guru, a preternaturally clever dog, a dead 40's cowboy movie star, the part-time writer/sheriff, a transplanted New York couple with a rocky marriage, and the Wizard, Finn's new best friend who will come to play an important role in this story; as Ruby's paintings and Finns dreams collide in an unexpected explosion that both heals and reveals old secrets and wounds.",
