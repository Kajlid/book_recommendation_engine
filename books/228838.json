For the older it is a reminder that life is what you make it, and it's never too late to make the right choices for ourselves.We all make choices in life everyday about little things and big things. These choices define who we are. You choose who you are and who you become through YOUR decisions. You control who you become.The purpose of this book is for me to share my viewof the choices we all have and how I have tried tolive my life. My views have been acquired throughthe relationships and interactions I have had withfamily and numerous friends over the years,particularly with my parents. I have been fortunateover my lifetime to have had many great friendshipswith many ethical, caring people of high integrity.You know who you are.My hope is that in the future this text may provide comfort and insight for my future family about how I lived and what I believe, not necessarily as a guide, but one way, my way, to look at the world. It seems to me that history repeats itself and I hope that sharing my view can be helpful to others. I don't always follow my own advice, but I do the best I can.Who do you choose to be?",
