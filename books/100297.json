  "description": "When Commander Rocky is dog-napped by a ghost and disappears in a puff of smoke there is only one thing Astro can do. Summon the team together and go to the USA to save him. However, things don’t go to plan and our valiant heroes become locked in a room without a door. Then they come face to face with five ghosts in a haunted house and have to save a group of celebrity dogs. Still, all in a day’s work for our intrepid heroes but why then does the American Government beg them to leave?! In this fun children's book, Major Dakota’s Ghost, we meet again a tunnel digging terrier who carries a diamond encrusted nail file. A large dog for which the complexities of door handles are a complete mystery and who, instead, opens everything with his head. As well as, a commando, khaki wearing Blue heeler who is armed with a hunting bone and a smell grenade. All are part of a team of dogs who work for a secret organisation. This organisation exists without detection and operates right under our very noses. Its sole purpose is to save dogs from neglect and to save each other too! Spy links Included!! These are special web addresses where you can find puzzles and games that are not available anywhere else in the world!!",
