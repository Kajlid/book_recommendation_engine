  "description": "A book that tells the story of London since the thirties through the 28 streets, stations and utilities of the Monopoly board. In the wonderful world of Monopoly it still only cost Â£50 to buy a house in Islington, you can move around London with the shake of a dice and even park your car for free. The author visits all these places and charts his erratic progress around those streets, stations and utilities, in a well-researched history of London's wayward progress in the 66 years since the launch of the world's most popular board game",
