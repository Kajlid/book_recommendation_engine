As soulless as ever and not a drop wiser. If so, I would have stayed in bed.When Gabriel, the vampire I'm irrefutably drawn to, is searching for his brother, I live up to my promise to find the crazy bloodsucker. Only, the easy job I envisioned quickly becomes a twisted scavenger hunt.Devilish antics and flirtatious kisses are the least of my worries when I fall square in the lap of the most ancient, monstrous soul I've ever read. One with the ability to sway my thoughts and see into my heart.I would run in the opposite direction if I didn't owe Gabriel a debt of gratitude for saving my life... If he and this creature didn't share the same grave secret.As Gabriel's family sins unravel, I'm forced to come to terms with my status as the Cypher—a karmic rat who reads souls and spills their secrets to the vampires—as well as my feelings for the undead men in my life.The answers should be clear. Then again, it might be easier to walk away from my life completely—and everyone in it.Because nothing stays buried.",
