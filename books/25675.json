  "description": "History has a way of repeating itself…SIENA Coming on the heels of a big, fat failure at work, my best friend Madi’s glamorous French wedding is the perfect opportunity to prove I can do some things well—even if it kills me, which is looking like a distinct possibility. Maid of honor duties are no joke. And while I could honestly use an extra hand or ten, I have to refuse the offer of help from Madi’s flirt of a brother, Jack. Nothing would spoil the beautiful wedding festivities faster than her finding out about that thing that happened between Jack and me that one time…Not that there’s any danger of it happening again. It was so long ago, I’ve forgotten everything about it, down to the brand of his cologne. Aqua Di Gio is so utterly predictable.JACKI admit, I haven’t been the best brother to Madi. Okay, slight understatement—a history of dating her friends and ruining those friendships has landed me squarely in her black books.But my offer to help Siena isn’t some underhanded scheme to hurt Madi a third time. I genuinely want to be a better brother. And as for teasing Siena in the meantime? That’s just standard procedure for me.Because everything is totally normal here. Nothing to see, folks.",
