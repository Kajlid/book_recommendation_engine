At forty-three, she is a strikingly attractive wife and mother. And like the River House, her lovely home overlooking the Thames, Sonia's life is a picture of perfection and normalcy--until she meets Jez. From the moment he shows up on Sonia's doorstep, the gorgeous teenage boy awakens a torrent of memories that threaten to reveal a terrifying truth. Drawn to Jez by a compulsion that she scarcely understands, Sonia takes him captive--prepared to sacrifice everything to keep him.",
