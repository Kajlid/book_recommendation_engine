  "description": "A chance meeting turned my world inside out.  Intelligent, sexy, and rich. With a dash of roguish charm and a cocksure smile, Nathan Blake is the ultimate fantasy. He can have any woman he wants with only a glance. And he wants me.  My past has left me broken and humiliated, wary of men like him. I cut myself off from the pain, moving thousands of miles away to escape every reminder, determined to start anew. I’ve been second best before. It isn't happening again.  One kiss and I'm caught under his spell, drawn to him with every breath I take. I can't resist. The passion that explodes between us becomes an intense connection neither of us thought we'd share. Or need.  The suffering inside me reflects his – a pain I know he feels, but can’t bring himself to reveal.  I have no idea his love can heal me – that mine can heal him… …if only I can let down my guard for him and trust.  Salvation is a captivating story of finding, fighting and finally giving in to a love that is clearly meant to be. This is no ordinary billionaire romance - it is a beautifully tender, tastefully erotic story with twists and turns that will leave you wanting more.  Warning: This work of fiction is intended for mature audiences over the age of 18 due to the sexual content and explicit language used throughout. Parental/reader discretion is advised.  Please note that even though this book is set in the USA, it is written from the POV of the female lead who is English, therefore British English vocabulary and spelling has been used.",
