  "description": "Bear shifter Clover is steaming mad and ready to be fitted with a new pair of bear skin boots. How dare the sexy head of security for the McCoy clan forbid her younger sister from marrying his brother? His brother knocked the girl up and he’s going to do right by her, or her name isn’t Clover Lulabelle Movie Star Windwalker Jones – which, unfortunately, it is. (Her parents were hippies.) His. Clover is hotheaded, impulsive, demanding – and she’s his. Sam McCoy knows it the second he lays eyes on her. Sure, he’s arrested most of the members of her family at one time or another, and now she’s blaming him for ruining her younger sister’s life – details, right? Sam has a secret weapon – he gets her a marketing job at his family’s jelly and jam factory, which will help her retain custody of her brother and sisters. Late nights at the office and some sexy honey samplings lead to even sexier times, and the possibility of a future – until Clover’s past comes back to haunt her and threatens to tear apart the family she’s fought to save.",
