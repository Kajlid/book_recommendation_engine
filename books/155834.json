Her only comfort came from her childhood best friend Jake Summers. Six years later, she's facing the terrifying reality that Jake will soon be taken away by the Angels, who ruled her hometown of Painted Rock with an iron fist. Jake Summers is forced to choose between the past and the future. Like the other young men in Painted Rock, Jake has two choices: either get out of town or serve his time with the Angels. No matter what he chooses, it means losing Aimee forever. The two have always been there for each other but the currents of life are pulling them apart in different directions. Aimee has lost enough to the Bleeding Angels and she'll be damned if she loses Jake to them too. But in a town that lost its last fighting chance six years ago to a hailstorm of bullets, is there ever truly a choice or will they fall to the primitive doctrine that might makes right?",
