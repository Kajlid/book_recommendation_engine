A scary, dangerous plan. It could be a suicide mission, or the salvation Black Creek desperately needs.  As if taking on the ruling mafia family of the West Coast isn’t enough, my heart and mind are in constant struggle for control of my emotions.  Cain and Oliver are total opposites, but both of them have gotten under my skin. Oliver’s need to care for me has my heart opening more than it ever has, while Cain’s fiery temper lights a fire in my soul.  I’m one step closer to falling for these men, but life in Black Creek is never that simple, or easy, and right when I think I have my feelings figured out, I end up in the clutches of the man who once tried to kill me and his right hand man, who I’m quickly learning isn’t who I thought he was.  𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝘄𝗮𝗿 𝗶𝘀 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗯𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴.",
