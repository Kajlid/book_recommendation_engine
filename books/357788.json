Now Chloe has come to Indian rock hoping to find her beloved uncle John and a much-needed teaching post. But when she unexpectedly crosses paths with Jeb, her rage - and passion - flare even more than back in Tombstone.Chloe never intended to mislead Jeb about her previous marriage to a scoundrel of a man, but when she finds out Jeb needs a bride and a baby in order to inherit the Triple M, she is livid. Learning to trust will be the hardest part of this mixed-up marriage - until a stagecoach robbery and the return of a dangerous stranger prove to Jeb and Chloe that they need each other to love and honor as long as they both shall live.Â©2004 Linda Lael Miller (P)2016 Recorded Books",
