  "title": "Jimmy James Blood",
  "description": "Jimmy James Blood recounts the dark story of a rough group of teenagers growing up in a twisted rural logging town.There are no jobs. There is no sense of safety. But there is a small group of loyal friends, a truck waiting with the engine running, a pair of boots covered in blood and a hot 1911 with a pearl pistol grip…\"...an eloquent description of today’s desensitized, emotionally detached youth....Anne's powerful storytelling startles readers with its unapologetic bleakness. Her crafting, although gray and humorless, candidly frames the drifting characters in a snapshot of life outside the confines of comfort. An intense, lyrical portrait of America's vulnerable underbelly.\"--Kirkus Reviews",
