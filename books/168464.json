  "description": "Handsome and gifted, Walter Ralegh was a star even in a court of brilliant men ruled by one of the greatest monarchs of all time, Elizabeth I.  Ralegh held position and power, and was loved by the Queen, but his dream was to conquer new lands for Elizabeth, to find El Dorado.  Bess Throckmorton was one of the Queen's Maids of Honour.  Shy and retiring, her dream was to capture the heart of the proud and restless Ralegh, in whose life it seemed she would always come second.  But when Elizabeth dies and James I comes to power, Ralegh’s fortunes take a dramatic turn…  Once a beloved courtier, he becomes a disgraced prisoner.  And his dreams of reaching El Dorado seem to be forever out of reach.  Will Bess lose Ralegh to his seemingly unattainable goal?  Will Ralegh ever be free to re-take his position in court?  Or is he doomed to stay forever out of favour with the new king….?  Set against the dramatic backdrop of their times, Sir Walter Ralegh and Bess Throckmorton’s love was passionate and enduring.  ‘A sensitive, delightful novel that no woman could fail to enjoy' - THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Rosemary Sutcliff CBE (14 December 1920 – 23 July 1992) was a British novelist best known for children's books, especially historical fiction and retellings of myths and legends.
