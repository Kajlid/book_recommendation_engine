I’ve experienced serious and I’ve gone through the bad life has to offer. I’m ready for the good in life. I wear my heart on my sleeve just so someone can take it. Someone does…Natalia Moretti. Out of all the people for me to love, why does it have to be her?The frenemy’s daughter. I’m screwed. I’m risking my life to be with her. But if life isn’t about taking risks, then what the hell else are we supposed to do?Love with her isn’t simple. There’s blood. War.Revenge. Anger. And that’s not the worst of it. Her Uncle Maximo poses a threat a long with someone who I thought was long gone out of my life. Protecting the one’s I love means I could die. Death doesn’t scare me. I’ve come close one too many times to be afraid it.I face it head on.I will die giving this battle everything I have if it means my family is safe. And if I do, heaven better have tacos.",
