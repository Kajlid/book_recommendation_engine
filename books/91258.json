  "description": "Stuart, a naive and excitable 13 year old boy, and a few fellow scouts walk into a forest at night with a young and charismatic scout leader. Emerging from the forest Stuart is changed, damaged. The secret and his deteriorating family life propel him into a Punk Rock lifestyle where he discovers a fierce rebellion that he has little control over. Ejected from the family home and in trouble with the police, he and girlfriend Mandy flee their small town only to find themselves trapped in a gang culture that starts spiraling out of control. Squatting in Melbourne then Sydney he witnesses a series of horrendously violent events that leave him feeling broken and isolated. Haunted by memories of brutal stabbings, home invasions, attempted murders, torture and blood, he searches fruitlessly for happiness amongst lovers and drugs. One night, by chance, he catches a glimpse of the peace he has almost given up on and sets off in pursuit of it. On the path he meets a Tibetan Lama and again his trajectory is radically altered. This takes him to India and Tibet where he meets with Lama/mystics who give him a glimpse into their world and make him question his own. In Australia, as a new monk, he is put in the care of a gifted Buddhist nun who seeks to unravel his trauma and confusion before it unravels him. This is a harrowing ordeal as his carefully managed comfort zones are striped away and his ghosts are revealed. Slowly, through the efforts of the Lama and Nun, he starts to learn how to trust again and he enters a new stage of his life as one monk amongst 4500 in a Monastic University in rural South India.",
