When corner cutting, back slapping Dev Haskell loses his friend, Dermot Gallagher in what appears to be a random shooting he takes it personal. But the more he learns, the more questions seem to go unanswered. His old nemesis, local crimelord, Tubby Gustafson seems to be involved or is he? Then there's 'Fat Freddy' Zimmerman, a criminal of underachieving and dubious reputation if ever there was one. Swindle Lawless enters, stripping up a storm under her new stage name, 'Cougar.' Jackie Van Dorn, Tubby's attorney adds a special brand of polished sleaze to the entire affair. And, just when you think things couldn't possibly get any worse, Tubby's psychopathic enforcer, Bulldog shows up and seems to have more than a passing interest in Dermot's death. Dev ends up with only one option, the question is; Will he take it? \"Faricy is America's hottest new mystery writer...\" The Dirty Lowdown \"Faricy is the next Carl Hiaasen...\" Crime Scene \"Laugh a minute story line in another of Faricy's deliciously engaging worlds...\" The Irish Gazette",
