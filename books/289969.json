We meet at a masquerade ball on the Upper West Side, and we both feel it. His bruises match my cracks. Our love cures everything that ails us. Or it should. But this isn't a fairy tale. It's a tragedy. We're tangled in a web of lies from the first moment, star-crossed long before we ever know what turns our story dark.What should have been the perfect first love ends in bloodshed and so many broken things.Luca Galante's not a prince at all. And this is a cautionary tale. *Dark Heart is a dark new adult romance. Its sequel, Twisted Fate, is coming in mid-October.",
