Ken Kaneki is an ordinary college student until a violent encounter turns him into the first half-human half-ghoul hybrid. Trapped between two worlds, he must survive Ghoul turf wars, learn more about Ghoul society and master his new powers.Kaneki is captured and then tortured by Yamori, one of Aogiri Tree organization's most sadistic members.
