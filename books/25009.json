  "description": "“When I’m with you, there’s truly never a dull moment.”The Hunt is on! Penelope heads off to the small-game area in hopes of finding a present for Eckles…only to run into a hostile bear! Armed with desperation and a crossbow, Penelope holds it off, until Callisto unexpectedly comes to her rescue. Despite his heroism, Penelope wants nothing but to get away from the seemingly obsessed, definitely dangerous crown prince. Fate has other plans, though―someone has sent assassins after Callisto, and Penelope is now caught in the cross fire, tasked by the game system to protect him. Still, this might just be a chance to raise his affection… if they can make it out with their lives, that is!",
