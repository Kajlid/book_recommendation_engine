  "description": "Maui Fire Chief Mak Kalani is cursed in the love department. A respected island Kahuna said so. A tabloid article about his curse spread the tale like wildfire and since then Mak’s woes have become legend. The women of the island stay away from the ruggedly handsome Chief. The curse has become part of his life and Mak has accepted it. That is, until he rescues a feisty redheaded reporter from a blazing sugarcane field. Suddenly he finds himself burning with desire and excited about his future.\tSwooped up unexpectedly by a strong fireman, reporter Blythe Davenport finds the rescue a little unnecessary, but thanks her hunky hero none-the-less. Sitting together in the fire truck, the space grows claustrophobic when Blythe learns his identity. Not because of his curse, Blythe doesn’t believe in the silly superstitions of the island. She must flee to remain anonymous. Under a pseudonym, her sharp-tongued article about a cursed Hawaiian fireman set Maui abuzz. Continuously thrown together, fate has other plans for these two. Hiding their mutual heat is becoming difficult. Though the proximity to Mak might be too hot to handle due to her secret, Blythe swallows her trepidation and accompanies him to the deserted island of Kahoolawe for an exclusive. Once a testing ground for missiles and landmines after Pearl Harbor, Kahoolawe is fraught with danger. They soon discover another impending threat: the island is far from deserted after all. They must work together to survive the perils of the curse.",
