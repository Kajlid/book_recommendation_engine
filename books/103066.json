  "description": "Emery Morgan is a writer.  She writes stories about a love she had never really experienced for herself. A love that was soul-soaring, heart-hammering...a love we only read about in books.  Emery dealt with the loss of her mother - a woman who was clothed in strength and who loved her daughter more than life. Emery’s husband, Matt, was unable to see past himself to help her in any way.  Emery Morgan settled for what she thought she deserved. Little did she know life had other plans for her. What she deserved wasn’t even close to what she had with Matt.  She met Caid Burke - a Chicago firefighter, who lit a flame within her and ignited her own romance novel-worthy type of love. Emery found that the love she had written about could truly exist...but first, she needed to be freed.Freed by Fire is rated 18+ due to strong sexual and mature content. It is not intended for young readers.",
