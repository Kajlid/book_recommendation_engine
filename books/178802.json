  "description": "Years after returning from the magical Nether World, thirteen year old Mike Jones' dreams are disturbed by strange messages from a princess, begging his help. At night he is visited by a little blue man, a powerful djinn or genie, who wants to carry him back to the Nether World. Aboard the djinn's magic carpet, they fly to the Nether World and right into the hands of Jabir, the evil Arabian sorcerer, who plans to use them in his power-mad scheme to control or destroy the beautiful, peaceful kingdom. Will Mike and the djinn escape their terrible fate? Jabir is Master of the Elements and controls three of them — Earth, Wind and Fire — from his copper castle on the coast. Will he succeed in wrecking the kingdom with his volcanos and lava before Mike and his friends can stop him? And what crucial role does the dead pirate, Captain Dreadful, play in this turbulent drama?",
