  "description": "Kaylee knows art, friendship, and love. And because she’s known love, she wants nothing to do with it ever again. She likes her life just the way it is. Her art and her Brushes with Lushes classes keep her sane and happy.  Landon spends his days with numbers and financial spreadsheets. At night, he just wants to relax, but the only way he can do that is with a woman. But these days, not just any woman will do.  Kaylee and Landon do an excellent job of dancing around each other, but no matter how much desire burns between them or their own personal hang-ups, they’ll need to make a life as they know it, or a life that could be so much more.  Author Ink by Numbers is a Montgomery Ink short story and a little different than what you’re used to from me. It’s shorter than my other novellas at only ~15,000 words. It has a complete HEA, and is perfect for a steamy evening, one-sitting read.",
