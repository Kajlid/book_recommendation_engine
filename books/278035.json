  "title": "Over The Hedge",
  "description": "Over the Hedge , created by T Lewis and Michael Fry, takes a freshly skewed look at suburban living from the perspective of the animals who lived there first. The strip stars RJ, a mischievous raccoon, and Verne, his sensitive best-buddy turtle. Together they fight to save their wooded wonderland from the evils of encroaching suburbia but end up becoming distracted by wide-screen TVs, discarded fast food containers and the fun of wreaking havoc on the local homeowners' association.",
