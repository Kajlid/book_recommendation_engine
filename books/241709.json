  "description": "The ‘Swinging 60s’. It’s a time of revolution in music, clothes, drugs and sexuality. It’s also a time of irresponsibility, flamboyance, and decay of social order.Sophie is a social outcast because of lies made up about her by the high school sports hero. The pressures of being a teenager are overwhelming, and cruel gossip about her each day at school makes matters worse. She already had enough problems battling self-image anxieties without students making a game of telling her she’s ugly.Keeping silent and low-profile soon becomes a way of staying safe. She loses herself in books because they allow an escape to a world where heroines achieve freedom, success and romance, those things so desperately missing in her life.Then back to grim reality. She lives in a culture where girls are too often valued by their physical appeal, and society protects bullies and abusers.",
