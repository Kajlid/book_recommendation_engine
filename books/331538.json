  "description": "Two police officers are attacked by a career criminal Karl Smithson. One officer dies and the other Richard Wade is wounded. Wade, largely as a result of his own evidence, is acclaimed a hero and richly rewarded. The dead officer is forgotten.Only two people know the truth of what happened that day and Smithson, who is rightly serving a life sentence, is saying nothing.Doubts begin to emerge about Wade's story and, despite being obstructed by senior officers and politicians, Supt Munro and his handpicked team carry out a secret investigation to expose the truth. Thwarted on all sides they seek a more dangerous path, risking their own careers to do so.When the truth is revealed an angry press demand answers from police and politicians, all of whom attempt to distance themselves from an increasingly desperate Wade. The scandal reaches the top of the police service and even the government.When their incompetence, cost-cutting and complacency come out a number of people will go to any lengths to protect themselves and their careers. Scruples and personal principles are cast aside like dirty laundry in the name of ambition and self-preservation.",
