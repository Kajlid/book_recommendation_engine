It is a book about courage and achieving the seemingly impossible. It is for business leaders, and their teams, who are increasingly interested in not just solving problems for their clients but leveraging their skills and resources to begin addressing how they might solve some of the world's problems. Nicky Mih deftly takes us on a journey of the complexities and challenges of leading a child protection organisation. Working with families facing immense difficulties and children battling to go to school has taught Nicky many lessons that have changed the way she lives and leads. Do What Matters is a call to action to do more with the life we too often take for granted. It is a reminder to do what matters most to you - in your business, with your family, and in the world.",
