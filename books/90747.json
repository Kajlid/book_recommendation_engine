  "title": "The Man of Gold",
  "description": "Tekumel is a distant world populated by humans who had built up over thousands of years a vast and intricate civilization - based upon a legion of gods and demons, upon the ways and wiles of alien races who dwelled among them upon them, upon the layered traditions of monarchs ancient, medieval, or still reigning. Tekumel is a world as real as Earth, where surprise and adventure are as natural as day and night. The Man Of Gold is the first novel based upon this marvelous legendry, more intricate than Tolkien's Middle Earth, more credible than Frank Herbert, more mystifying than Lovecraft or Stephen King. Follow now the quest of Harson, acolyte of the temple Thumis, as he goes forth to seek a forgotten empire's super-weapon known only as the Man of Gold.",
