I’m more worried about what he might break…. WESHere at Crystal Peaks Resort, I’ve got everything I tall trees, fresh air, and no cell phone service. This is my happy place, and if I prove to my boss I can handle the job, the management position here will be mine. Everything is falling into place.Until the newest guest arrives.
