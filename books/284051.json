  "description": "Dive into the mind of a reclusive cynic as he shuts out the world and wrestles to complete the mysterious Eggplant project. This surreal world is as gritty and unforgiving as it is beautiful and strange. Delve in as his ruminations on life and death develop into questions so deeply profound that readers will find themselves revisiting to ponder long after they finish. This thought-provoking psychological horror is not only a philosophical treasure trove but also an artfully sentimental story of obsession and longing delivered with spellbinding imagery and a chilling sense of honesty",
