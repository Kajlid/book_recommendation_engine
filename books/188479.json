With an empty nest and no cheating spouse to look after, her future’s in desperate need of a makeover. Her quirky sister’s tropical getaway gift seemed a perfect place to start. But instead of thatched roof huts and designer pools, she’s landed at the one seventies throwback in the Riviera Maya—and caught the attention of a bold young man who won’t take no for an answer.Zade Painel’s a man on a mission—grab some much needed R&R at Gypsy Cove, and figure out how to reclaim his boudoir photography business. He never thought the answer would come in the form of a curvy, forty-year-old redhead and an accidental knee to the ‘nads, but Janie’s a force of nature with a penchant for fixing things. She’s also sexy as hell, despite her hangup with him being a younger man.He’ll show her age is just a number, starting with a very grown up invitation—stick to what society says is right, or give time and attention to her own desires and claim what Janie wants.",
