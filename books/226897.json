  "description": "WE ARE BUT A MOMENT takes the reader on a brisk tour of the globe that vividly imagines the inescapable crisis of the near future posed by overpopulation, diminishing natural resources, climate change, species extinction, and economic tumult. It is 2025, and a young White House aide, Aleks, finds himself locked up in quarantine when he tested positive after a routine briefing from a hotspot. Thus temporarily removed from the fast-paced world of politics, Aleks recounts how our much-admired female president Lucia Jackson became a globally revered leader who unites much of the world under the environmental banner. Aleks's position as a trusted environmental advisor to the president gives him a privileged insider's view into the political maneuvering - and the need for compromises - that have led to U.S. global dominance. What Aleks finally uncovers confronts the reader with the moral choices we all have to make in our precarious times. Philosophical rather than prescriptive, We Are But A Moment explores how we live and die in the 21st century, what we consume, how we inhabit our world, and whether we can all live, and love, in the future.",
