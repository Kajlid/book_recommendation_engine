  "description": "It's Christmastime in Bear Country, and Papa Bear is caught right in the middle of an ecological dilemma--every tree he picks to chop down is home to a fellow furred or feathered creature. Papa doesn't have the heart to make them homeless, and though he returns home enpty-handed, he does have a brilliant idea! Join in the holiday revelry as the Bears brighten their forest home with lots of bangles, bells, and colorful balls. This delightful reissue, which sold over 180,000 copies, will now have a stunning new cover to charm a whole new generation of Bear lovers.",
