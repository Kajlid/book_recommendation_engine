  "description": "Regarded as one of the greatest Presidents of The United States, Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919) led a full and vibrant life that reflected his storied personality and presence. 'The Autobiography of Theodore Roosevelt' is an invaluable literary work and a true gift to readers, as it is a glimpse into the psyche of such an enigmatic historical figure. Roosevelt led a life rich in accomplishments not limited to his being the youngest president in US history. He was a courageous soldier, posthumously receiving the Medal of Honor for his creation and leadership of the Rough Riders in Cuba during the Spanish-American War. He was also the first American to win a Nobel Peace prize, which he received for his negotiation of the end of the Russo-Japanese War. In addition, Roosevelt was an adventurer with a taste for hunting and exploring, especially in South America, where a river is named after him. His iconic slogan, \"Speak softly and carry a big stick,\" is still quoted and embodied by politicians to this very day, exemplifying his indelible impact on the history of the United States.http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=s...",
