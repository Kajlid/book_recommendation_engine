  "description": "\"Caught In Time\" is a time travel adventure. Rowyna Grae always thought that she was human until the day Arwoyn Telluria reveals that she was created secretly in his medical lab using parts of his DNA...specifically the gene for time travel. He confides that she came to him long ago when he was a boy telling him that she was from the far future. So, the older Arwoyn creates her to return to fulfill her destiny. But things go awry. Arwoyn dies, the new regime want to turn her into a stealth assassin, the young timelab assistant, Richard Steele, sends her to the wrong place and loses her. She lands with dangerously packed bags a thousand years into the past at the king's hunting lodge with an agenda to kill the king who is the original mutant of a dangerous line of \"talents\". Within a mere day, she manages to kill six men defending herself against robbers and rapists. Of course she falls in love with the very man she is supposed to kill, not knowing who he really is. The gun, science book, and alien crystal found in her bags create havoc as she changes the past and reorders Richard Steele's reality up the time stream. The charming medieval past isn't so charming when there's no running water, no central heat, court intrigue, and war on the horizon. Will she be forever \"caught in time\" or will she be \"caught in time\" for a final rescue? What's a resourceful replicant to do? The answer is...quite a lot, and therein lies a fun romping read.",
