  "description": "Book 2 in the Montague Vampires series. Rylan Montague has lusted after Ruthie for as long as he's known her. With her flaming red hair and the temper to match, he has long suspected the fiery passions burning beneath the surface. She remained maddeningly desirable, but never returned any interest in his flirting. Until he caught up with her at the Annual Desperate and Dateless Ball. Ruthie could not believe she had spent the night in bed with Rylan Montague-acknowledged vampire sex-stud and the subject of her most erotic secret fantasies for years-completely unconscious the entire time. But when he comes to her with the genuine request to help find his MIA father, Gavreel, she can't help but accept the case. Problem is, he wants to come along with her on her search. Now all their combined passions are contained inside one small ship-with a vampire in heat, and a woman who is just dying to put out his fire with one of her own.",
