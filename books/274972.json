  "description": "From  USA Today  Bestselling Author, Logan Chance, comes a laugh-out-loud fake relationship, enemies-to-lovers standalone romantic comedy. How deep undercover will these two go to catch the bad guy?  Special Agent Vin Mills has everything he’s ever wanted. Sweet job. Rock hard abs. Buns you can bounce a coin off of. And a money laundering mob boss who’s about to go down. The only thing standing in his way is fresh off the desk bombshell in heels, Special Agent Addison Buckley. She’s just destined to screw everything up.  Addison Buckley has one thing she wants—a promotion. The only thing standing in her way is egotistical and tattooed hottie, Vin Mills. The department wants them to pose as newlyweds and blend with the residents in one of the most prestigious and nosy neighborhoods in Colorado. A few touches, a few kisses, no problem.  Saying and doing are two different things, and this is one game of espionage these two rivals never bargained for. Will these NewlyFEDS be able to catch the bad guys, or get caught under cover first?",
