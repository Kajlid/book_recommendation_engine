  "description": "I live with a pack of misfit shifters.Freaks. Rogues. Oddballs. Prey. Runts. We're all welcome in Pack Aberrant.We aren't going to be winning any popularity contests, but our hodgepodge bunch is more loyal than even the strongest pred packs. I should know. I grew up in one of them. As soon as they realized I was different, I was despised, even by my own family. So I left, joined Pack Aberrant, and I've steered clear of alpha pred assholes ever since.Until my heatwave hits, and I accidentally jump three coyote shifters in a parking lot. Whoopsie.Once they realize what my animal is, they're gonna kick me to the curb just like every other pred shifter has. And my old pack? They come back to haunt me.I'm unwanted by the three hotties, threatened by my old pack, and to top it all off, I have to find a new job because I attacked a bank robber. Accidentally.Being a misfit really sucks sometimes.Author's Note: Every book in this series will be a stand-alone for that character, but will be a continuation of the Pack Aberrant story. Each book has a unique mate dynamic. Some main characters will have multiple mates, while some will have monogamous relationships. Addie will include multiple mates. Please be advised that this series is for readers 18 years and older, and includes explicit language and spicy scenes. Enjoy!",
