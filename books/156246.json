To compound my dilemma, I couldn’t stop looking at her damn photograph and had even used an image of her in my mind to get hard and come with another client. Not only was that highly unprofessional of me, it was potentially hazardous to my reputation in case I groaned the wrong woman’s name. I was already treading that very fine line between professional and personal. Before I’d even met the damn woman she had me breaking one of my cardinal rules, Never fall for one of your clients. The more I looked at her photo though, the more I wanted her. Summer Beresford, I’m about to woo your arse off and have my own virginal experience, making love for the first time.
