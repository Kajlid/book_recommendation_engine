  "description": "Simon Carter is a player, and Owen Sanders knows it. As Simon’s best friend, he’s a big part of Simon’s life, and he’s watched Simon sleep his way through random hookups, trying to avoid a repeat of his last failed relationship. But when Simon turns that fear of commitment and dangerous sex appeal on his best friend and then disappears, Owen decides he’s had enough. He sets out to Minnesota to drag his best friend back and make him see that if he’d just give Owen a chance, the two of them could make Simon’s loveless house into a home.",
