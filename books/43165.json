  "description": "Scientists are scrambling to find a way to solve the serious energy crisis on earth when they find and decode a secret star map in the Egyptian pyramids that leads them to an everlasting source of energy. The ruthless General Hezekai embarks on a mission to invade the distant planet of Harpatia with his army of Mechs. These armies of human operated war machines are going to seize control of the precious energy that awaits them on Harpatia, but it might not be as easy as they think. They might have been the dominant fighting force on Earth, but nothing could have prepared them for what they encountered upon invading the Harpatians. Follow King Leinad Seven, his brother Gressit, and the Warrior Cassion as they use their elemental magic and other abilities in the defense of their home planet Harpatia. Epic battles unfold as General Hezekai leads his robotic war machine army of Mechs, the MVF, against the magic wielding wizards and warriors of Harpatia. King Leinad Seven enlists the help of the Harpatian Elite Guard, the School for Combat and Magic Arts, the Dragon Legion, and the nearby Nowries, an Ogre like people, as he is tested in battle for the first time. Which side will you choose?",
