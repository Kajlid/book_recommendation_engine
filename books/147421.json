  "description": "A sexy category romance from Entangled’s Brazen imprint…She’s going to break all of his rules…Tech Sergeant John O’Donnell was never fond of his hometown. Too many reminders of poverty, his rocky family life, and the girl he was never allowed to have. Now he has exactly two weeks to sort out his mother's finances before he heads back overseas. Two weeks that he's determined to spend as far from his best friend’s little sister as possible.Alea Heling has a naughty streak a mile wide. Sweet and simple? Boring. She’s been craving a bad boy like John since their wild days together in high school, and this time, she’s not taking no for an answer. But with every panty-meltingly hot encounter, Alea forgets one hard, cold reality—this soldier won't let a fortnight turn into forever...and forever might be exactly what they both need.",
