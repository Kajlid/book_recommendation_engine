  "description": "Home is where the magic is.Jonah Sheppard has been on the run for so long he’s forgotten what a home is. He sleeps rough relying on the trees and plants to keep him safe. No one believes he can hear them talk or that they listen to him. He’s been locked up for his own good too many times too count. This time he is determined to stay free. An acid attack left Bronwyn scarred, but when she sings she feels beautiful again. With her voice she can hypnotise people. In the club where she works they tip generously not caring about the ruined side of her face. And no one is immune. Or so she thought. Until she meets a man who brazenly empties the wallets of those caught in her trance. Like Bronwyn, Jonah is a changeling. Another misfit with no chance of belonging. But they are unstoppable together. For the first time they live, using their powers openly in the human world, instead of hiding. Word of their exploits reaches Annwyn and the Darkling Lord is sent to intervene. Fairies aren’t ready for the Human world to know the truth. Bronwyn and Jonah will have to choose between the mortal world and Annwyn.",
