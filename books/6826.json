  "description": "Book 2 of the Award-Winning horror comedy series The Black Knight Chronicles!In the second volume of The Black Knight Chronicles, vampire detectives Jimmy Black and Greg Knightwood investigate a series of assaults plaguing the alleys of Charlotte NC. Along the way they battle trolls, bigotry, fairies, dragons and small minds on the way to a knock-down battle royal inside a steel cage. The boys find themselves fighting evil in alleys, trolls in bars, dragons in FairyLand, and trying to scrub the sparkle off after a battle with vicious Fae in the hall of the Fairy Queen.Yeah, really. All that and vampires, too.This non-sparkly snarky vampire comedy series has drawn favorable comparison to the works of Joss Whedon, Kevin Smith and Jim Butcher's Dresden Files.",
