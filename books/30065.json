  "description": "Part one of the epic 'Ant and Cleo' series from Hugo-nominated author Dominic Green.UFOs do not land in country parks. They are not piloted by Englishmen. They do not have nameplates saying \"HAWKER SIDDELEY AVIATION.\" And they are never, ever filled with smuggled catering packs of Monster Munch.Britain has had a top secret colony in space for decades. Unfortunately, the colony has grown tired of being run by the mother country - and the mother country has decided it's time to send in the military. A war of independence is going on, and one man's rebel is another man's freedom fighter. Between these two sides are Anthony Stevens and Cleopatra Shakespeare, abducted from England and hurled into a war between Britain, America, and the newly, fiercely independent United States of the Zodiac. A black girl from Northampton is about to encounter the dystopian U.S. colony of New Dixie, where the Deep South lives again and the white man rules supreme - and both Ant and Cleo are about to discover that the Cold War never ended in outer space, and that the KGB are still alive and well out among the scarlet stars.All flying saucer technology comes from the Saucerers, but who are they? Where is the mysterious hidden colony of Gondolin? How did the United States of America come to have interstellar spacecraft in the 1950s? And who or what is Truman J. Slughound the Third? Find out in a series guaranteed to contain colour-changing aliens, Godless communists from Altair, rednecks from Barnard's Star, space fighters, rocket pistols, death by ecstasy, very bad hair, and more explosions than you can shake a stick at.",
