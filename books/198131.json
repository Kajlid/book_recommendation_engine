  "description": "A psychic inspector, a sexy vampire boss, and a mysterious wolf . . . \nAgent Bluebell Kildare (a.k.a. Blue) has a gift. She can sense magic, feel emotions, and see souls. When she arrives at the scene of the crime and uses her gift, it's obvious the grotesquely damaged body of the deceased teenage boy was caused by far more than a simple hit and run. But that’s not all. Blue uncovers a powerful magical artifact nearby and soon discovers it acts as the key to an ancient Grimoire that holds the power to unravel the boundaries between Earth and the Plane of Fire. Blue and her clever wolf Varg follow a trail that starts at the Cock and Bull Tap and leads all through the town of Crimson Hollow. Between being sidelined by a stalker who sticks to the shadows and chasing a suspect who vanishes in thin air, the case is getting complicated. If that isn't enough, Dark Vampire activity hits a record high, and hate crimes are increasing. However, it's Blue’s growing feelings for Jack Tanner, her sexy Daylight Vampire boss, that just might undo her. While Blue searches for clues to nail the perpetrator, it seems someone else is conducting a search of their own. Who will find whom first? Danger lurks in every corner, and Blue needs all her focus in this increasingly dangerous game or she risks ending up the next victim. \nA suspenseful urban fantasy romance that will have you alternately charmed and gripping the edge of your seat. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Rated R: a few scenes contain graphic violence and explicit sex; recommended for 17+ years",
