The only man there is distant but kind. There’s only one there's no way to leave the island. Longing for the shackles of safety, she pulls from the last dregs of her will to prove her worth. It seems to be working. He responds first to her innocence and next to her confidence. The secrets of his past haunt the cabin, fraying the tightening bond between them, but it is her own memories that may finally unravel it.",
