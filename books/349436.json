  "description": "Touching, funny, and honest, In a Single Bound is the story of how a feisty little girl from Long Island became one of the world’s most famous disabled sports figures.A world-class athlete and a celebrated television personality, Sarah Reinertsen not only takes us to the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii—she also provides a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at her season on CBS’s The Amazing Race 10, where millions saw her climb up the Great Wall of China, scale the cliffs of Vietnam, and ride horses in the hinterlands of Mongolia.But In a Single Bound is about more than sports and television. A gripping memoir of inner strength, it’s about a one-legged child trying to fit in with her two-legged friends. It’s about an adolescent girl mustering the inner strength to go stag to her senior prom. It’s about a woman who dared to fear less and live more.",
