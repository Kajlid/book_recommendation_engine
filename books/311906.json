  "description": "Family secrets, strange coincidences, and stolen kisses with an alluring librarian are woven into this evocative, opposites-attract, lesbian romantic suspense. Globe-trotting photographer Eleanor Heysen is edgy, sexy, and just passing through. When a family mystery emerges while she’s back home in Melbourne, Eleanor crosses paths with intoxicating historian Alexa Bellamy. The self-assured picture-collections manager is irresistible. Steamy kisses between the stacks at the State Library are one thing, but what happens when the ever-curious Eleanor shakes Alexa’s family tree, and dark secrets tumble out? Alexa is in an emotional free-fall, overwhelmed by her broody, spirited, and likely fleeting admirer, and the fear and betrayal stirred up from the truth about Alexa’s ancestors. Is the invisible thread that brought the women together strong enough to pull them tighter? Or could it unravel and, just as Alexa fears, Eleanor will disappear?",
