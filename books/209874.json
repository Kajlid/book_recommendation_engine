  "description": "People make love seem complicated. Intricate. Novels try to capture its intensity; music tries to rein in its soul.I’ve read every novel I could. I’ve lived and breathed every song that I could listen to. The sounds fill my unquiet mind.Then he came.Killian.He brought with him the beauty of silence that echoes through my soul and showed me love isn’t complicated. It’s simple. Beautiful.Some say love at first sight doesn’t exist, that you can’t find your soul mate at sixteen years old. Those are people rooted in reality, chained to the confines of life that dictates how you are meant to think. Killian broke those chains. He broke everything, shattered it so I can see that reality is overrated, that daydreams can somehow come to life.My life tumbled into darkness in the time after I met him, so dark I’m not sure I’ll ever see the light again. But he is always at my side. His life means he knows how to navigate the dark and he can lead me out.I wade through the darkness with him at my side.We’ll be together forever; I’m certain of that.Until I’m not.Note: This is book one of two. Killian and Lexie's story does not end here and will be continued in a following book.",
