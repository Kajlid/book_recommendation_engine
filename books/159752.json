  "title": "The Anxiety Code: Deciphering the Purposes of Neurotic Anxiety",
  "description": "Alternate cover edition.ISBN: 9781312136601Generalized anxiety disorder is also known as neurotic anxiety. This book examines personality characteristics related to generating and maintaining anxiety. It offers a graduate-level textbook depth of exploration with easy-to-understand examples and encouraging dialogue. Given the generous amount of information, it may be best consumed slowly and deliberately. While not a step-by-step self-help manual, it may help readers develop self-awareness in the pursuit of symptom reduction. Just as many biological symptoms (e.g., pain, fever, sweating) serve various functions, the book presents as a mystery that poses an intriguing question: What if anxiety symptoms arenâ€™t merely the effect of some cause, but also personality-based and purposeful means to achieve goals?",
