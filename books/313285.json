  "description": "Love in crisis. When life gives you lemons, what do you do?Vesta has learned the hard way how to make lemonade. The beautiful and willful medieval doctor bears the unbearable. Her sufferings are innumerable. Intimidation, humiliation, gang-rapes, loss of loved ones, enforced miscarriage, psychological and emotional abuse, multiple surgeries, purificatory bathes, self-quarantine and isolation â€“ this Kurdish woman has seen it all. The bloodthirsty fanatics who ruthlessly attacked her home seems to disappear without trace or sufficient evidence to aid in her search for justice. Her relative and employer, King Saaid, sides with the attackers rather than the victim.Reality is too painful for her husband to handle. Ivar drowns himself in infidelity and alcohol which alters his physical and mental state. Will her marriage fail? Can she leave the past behind and give her brutally murdered children a legacy beyond her grief? Told in a poetic narrative, Females of Valor is a compelling account of suffering and survival, with captivating characters, stunning plot twists and thought-provoking themes, most notably what it means to be loyal to those we love.",
