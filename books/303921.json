  "description": "Do you want the ability to resolve your issues? To create a working harmony uniting mind, body, and emotion? Are you looking to discover your essential nature? Perhaps you’ve read countless books and articles on overcoming inner conflict, but you’re still seeking something that works. What if, despite all your efforts, a key ingredient to success has been missing?A fundamentally different approach to self-development, The Emotion Solution challenges our culture’s belief that we should shun the full range of our emotions. Rejecting this notion, gestalt therapist and social worker Fred Carlisle undertook years of research and experimentation to explore the emotions we usually avoid. What he uncovered has the remarkable power to rapidly resolve inner turmoil through expanding consciousness.A self-development practice in its own right, The Emotion Solution can also be used in tandem with virtually any traditional spiritual or goal-oriented practice to achieve astonishing results.",
