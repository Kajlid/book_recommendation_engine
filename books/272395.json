In this sixth book in the series Ramona is in the third grade and is big enough to ride the school bus on her own. She's determined to enjoy the third grade - that is until she gets sick and throws up right in front of everyone in the class! But being a patient isn't all bad, and although being eight isn't easy - it's never dull. * Beverly Cleary is one of America's most popular authors and has won many prestigious awards, including the American Library Association's Laura Ingalls Wilder Award. * Well-loved series about a great character. Mums and Dads will remember Ramona from their own childhood. * Tackles common issues with humour and sympathy. * Illustrated in black and white. * Beverly Cleary lives in California.",
