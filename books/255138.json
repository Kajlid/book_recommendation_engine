  "description": "When Amanda is given an engineering position aboard one of the many space stations orbiting Earth, she finds herself grateful for the chance to escape the dying surface and put her talents to good use. But when one simple mistake creates an explosion aboard the station, her escape pod is hurled into deep space, and crash lands her on a desert planet. After six long months alone, all hope is lost of a rescue—that is, until five alien humanoids show up and declare she is their Other. Amanda is torn between longing for home and her new could-be alien lovers. However, before they can explore any possibility of a relationship, they first must find a way to help a hostile species…or die.",
