  "description": "Using concepts from algebra and relating them to life, Tess navigates the waters of friendship, popularity, and family. Math lover Tess has always used mathematical concepts to help her understand things in her life. She is surprised to find out how much math—and life—can change in eighth grade. She also has to learn about injustice and ethics when a family friend mysteriously dies, and when she witnesses a cheating episode at her school and realizes that keeping silent about it, even to get in the good graces of the cutest boy in school, only leads to more trouble. Are theorems and axioms about life fail-safe? Is there an absolute answer to everything, just as there are absolute numbers? In the end, Tess decides that her life, like the infinity sign, is always changing, but that as long as she sticks to some key principles for herself, she can handle life’s uncertainties.",
