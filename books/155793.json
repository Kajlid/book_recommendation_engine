  "title": "Escape from Netherworld",
  "description": "For David Kuklis the love of science fiction and fantasy began at an early age, when he and his brother, inspired by the game Dungeons and DragonsTM, staged similar games in their backyard and nearby woods. His uncle, a marine paralyzed from the neck down in Vietnam, usually ran the indoor games around the table, and his father was the inspiration for Twiggy, a major character in this book. Those fond memories laid the groundwork for Escape from Netherworld, a thrilling tale of a group of friends whose simulated war games go awry one weekend, sending them into an alternate realm from which there appears to be no escape. Travel along with these friends as they embark upon one harrowing adventure after another, befriending druids along the way and battling ogres and orcs with the help of an array of magic weapons. Watch them try to outwit the evil wizard who seems determined to keep them in this alternate world. The battle scenes are vividly drawn and charged with suspense. Will the group ever escape from this alternate world? You will find yourself rooting for them until the final outcome!",
