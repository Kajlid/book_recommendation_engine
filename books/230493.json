  "description": "Just in case trying to locate his boss's missing daughter wasn't stressful enough, Edwin Burrows, CPA, gets called into his boss's boss's office; one of the firm's clients is suspected of being blackmailed, a suspicion that becomes more realistic when a school bus is hijacked with fifty-four students on board. Once the kidnappers demand $50,000 per student, the pressure rises for Edwin to uncover who, in the client's life, could be making such crazy demands. Each piece of information not only leads Edwin closer to solving the puzzle of the hijacked students, but edges him closer to rescuing them.",
