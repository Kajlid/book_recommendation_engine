  "title": "So Long, Hector Bebb",
  "description": "In a sparse and uncompromising style, this tale tells the story of a boxer from Cymmer in South Wales ready to make his comeback. Abe has ensured that Hector is nurtured into a single-minded fighting machine. He is ready to take on the world, but where do the true dangers lie? Through a series of first-person accounts, a compelling tragic-heroic story unfolds. The traditional values of family and friendship are stripped naked by the relentlessly violent world of boxing. Some are savaged and others liberated, but the consequences of these stark principles leave deep scars on everyone in Hector Bebb's life.",
