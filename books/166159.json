  "description": "Count and explore the zany world and words of Seuss in this classic picture book. From counting to opposites to Dr. Seuss's signature silly rhymes, this book has everything a beginning reader needs! Meet the bumpy Wump and the singing Ying, and even the winking Yink who drinks pink ink. The silly rhymes and colorful cast of characters will have every child giggling from morning to night. From near to farfrom here to there,funny things are everywhere. Originally created by Dr. Seuss himself, Beginner Books are fun, funny, and easy to read. These unjacketed hardcover early readers encourage children to read all on their own, using simple words and illustrations. Smaller than the classic large format Seuss picture books like The Lorax and Oh, the Places You’ll Go!, these portable packages are perfect for practicing readers ages 3-7, and lucky parents too!",
