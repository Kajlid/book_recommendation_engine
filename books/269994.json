  "title": "A Case for the Book of Mormon",
  "description": "“The Book of Mormon,” Tad R. Callister unequivocally states, “is God’s crowning witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ, the prophetic calling of Joseph Smith, and the absolute truth of this Church. It is all it claims to be. It is the word of God.” But over the years, many critics have claimed otherwise. In this logical examination of many of the critics’ claims, the author offers a compelling defense of the Book of Mormon. In addition, he outlines six further evidences of its divine authenticity and its ability to influence our lives for good. Ultimately, the author helps readers clearly understand how they can learn for themselves—not only intellectually, but spiritually—that the Book of Mormon is true.",
