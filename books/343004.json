  "description": "Major Alex Jansen has always had to quell the fire Janey Mackay ignites in him. Even touching her would mean death by the Mackay men. Until now, the girl of his dreams has lived in a vacuum of affection, shying away from the danger she thinks men represent thanks to her painful past. But when someone starts leaving Janey spine-chilling notes, Alex won't rest until she's completely safe and completely his- body and soul.",
