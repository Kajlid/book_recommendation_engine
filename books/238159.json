  "description": "Quoyle is a hapless, hopeless hack journalist living and working in New York. When his no-good wife is killed in a spectacular road accident, Quoyle heads for the land of his forefathers -- the remotest corner of far-flung Newfoundland. With 'the aunt' and his delinquent daughters -- Bunny and Sunshine -- in tow, Quoyle finds himself part of an unfolding, exhilarating Atlantic drama. The Shipping News is an irresistible comedy of human life and possibility.‘A very impressive achievement. Proulx's book is so funny, so full of delights.’ - Guardian‘As stark and ruggedly beautiful as the storm-battered coast of Newfoundland itself.’ - Daily Telegraph‘To read The Shipping News is to yearn to be sitting in The Flying Squid Lunchstop, eating seal fin curry, watching the icebergs clink together in the bay.’ - The Times‘Ambitious and accomplished…The characterisation is rich, the dialogue both original and convincing.’ - Alan Massie, Scotsman‘A breath of fresh air. I was sorry to leave the book down.’ - Irish Independent‘A stunning novel.’ - Observer",
