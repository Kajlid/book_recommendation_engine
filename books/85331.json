  "description": "Erick Angell was an angel who had protested too many about the human race and been thrown in the world as a human. And he's just one among men who'd been cursed with the living flesh and still could not be able to shake their true nature, defender of the light in a world full of blight.Erick was starting to understand what humans felt as sexual attraction. He could definitely feel it stirring within his human body whenever he thinks of Hollianne or when she was around. There were emotions, too, that speak of intimacy and the kind that kept human lovers attached to each other. He wanted to explore more about this, as he wanted to know more about what he detested to be human frailties that make them special. He was definitely interested, even when he would not openly admit it. Especially to other earthbounds.Hollianne could not deny the powerful sexual attraction she felt for her employer, Erick. But she was sane enough to know how inappropriate it was to fall for him when she was in the middle of a job--even when he was one of the most beautiful and kindest man she has ever met. She has to stop thinking about him as a man--she has to stop dreaming sexual dreams about him. Or she and her great job would be doomed. Can't stand the suspense?
