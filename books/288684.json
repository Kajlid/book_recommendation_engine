  "description": "Tom Hillman likes to tell the off beat stories, do things that other people might shy away from. In Digging for God, Tom takes you to a same-sex spiritual resort where you stay for three weeks. During your stay you will join in on all the work and activities of the retreat center. You will live amongst the monks and the spiritually motivated people who live there. You will have a schedule that includes meditation and all types of chores and projects that need to be done. You will get a taste of the camaraderie in the refectory and the delicious food. You will experience hanging out with meditators and learn to meditate yourself. You will realize that there are others ways to live in this world and you will meet people who are more interested in joy, peace, and love and less interested in the almighty dollar. You will find the value in taking a break from the world you live in, to retreat, refresh, and get ready to take on the world when you get back home.",
