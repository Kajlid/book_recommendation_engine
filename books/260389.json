  "description": "Annabelle Murphy specializes in treating post-traumatic stress disorders in soldiers. She’s seen her share of damaged souls and knows personally how left untreated, the world around you can come crashing down. When Patrick Connors, the only survivor of a chopper crash, walks into her office, everything she thought she knew about pain changes. Trick knows he’s broken. Nightmares and guilt are his constant companions. Pain, delivered by willing participants at an underground club, The Den, are his only saving grace and relief. That is, until the night he finds himself alone in a room with the last woman he ever thought needed his help, his understanding, his touch. Can either of them be saved by the other before it’s too late? Before time’s up?",
