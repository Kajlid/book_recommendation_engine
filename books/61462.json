  "description": "Is there redemption to be found in guiding another past the pitfalls of coming-of-age? Or is history doomed to repeat itself? When Mark, an ageing hedonist scraping his rock-bottom, is encouraged to meet with a seventeen-year-old who is just coming to terms with his sexuality, he spots an opportunity for redemption. Mark thinks he has the boy figured out, but when he sees Jake nurturing an obsession with him, he soon realises he’s out of his depth.Mark knows he owes Jake nothing, but in helping him navigate the gritty and unforgiving London gay scene, he feels on some level he’s navigating his own youth afresh. Perhaps this time around he’ll rescue himself from the depths of addiction, and save the boy in the process. Should Mark fail in his objective, it will only reinforce that the hole he’s found himself in was always inevitable, should he succeed, perhaps there’s a chance for atonement.  Conflicted Men is a novel about a different side of relationships. A gritty and dramatic story of stumbling upon obsessive love in an unforgiving city. \"Reading about two people who are opposites fascinates me and this story is no exception.\" - Sandra, Rainbow Book Reviews",
