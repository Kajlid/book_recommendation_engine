  "description": "God Not God is a chilling tale about what truly lurks within the dark corners of old churches. Maggie is just looking to get out of the rain when she decides to duck into Holy Saint Paul Catholic Church. What she finds is a mold that spreads like the plague, and a whispering answer to Father George's plea: let the seraphim come to the world and bless all around with their holy light. Only it's not a seraph sitting in the storage room hissing at Maggie. It's something else entirely. Something that would be a true sin to ignore.",
