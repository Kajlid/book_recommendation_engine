  "description": "The rules were simple—don’t fall for the handsome vet. Oops! Some rules are meant to be broken.The light turned red and suddenly my whole life changed. I found myself lying in the middle of the street with two little yellow eyes staring at me. Then he appeared. Logan. Tall, sexy, built. I’d prayed that Superman would show up to save me, but Logan’s even better. Except that he seems more interested in saving the cat I almost ran over.Since I can’t pay the vet bills for my unwelcome new guest, I’m forced to accept a job in his veterinary clinic as a receptionist. Not a great fit for someone who’s known since childhood that all animals have it in for her. And Logan seems to be more on their side than mine. Of course, there’s nothing that says I can’t also unfurl my claws and be a sex kitten for the hot veterinarian. He’s got just one rule: don’t get emotionally involved.Simple, no?Not when the damn test comes back positive. What can I say? Someone’s in trouble . . . and it’s not the cat.Oops, my bad.",
