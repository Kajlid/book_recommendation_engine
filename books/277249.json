  "description": "One step forward, two steps back.Our enemies are out in the open now - we have them in our sights. Unfortunately, that means we’re more exposed than ever, too.We found the Qilin, but we’ve lost my vampire. My guys tell me he’ll be fine, but will we?Just when I think I have Haret figured out, I find a new piece to the puzzle. There are cities in the sky, magical creatures losing magic, and goddesses cracking under the pressure.We might even have to make a bargain with an old devil, just to survive.There’s a war coming, and everyone is choosing sides between the fae and the mages. I say it’s time a third party enters this circus ring.I’m Carlyle Licorne, and balancing the darkness starts with me.",
