  "description": "Claudia Carroll is already a major bestselling author in her native Ireland, and now she’s ready to take America by storm with her poignantly hilarious new novel, I Never Fancied Him Anyway. Like her fellow countrywoman, New York Times bestselling novelist Marian Keyes, Carroll mixes outrageous humor with real emotion in this story of a hapless and loveless psychic who can see everyone’s future but her own. I Never Fancied Him Anyway is already in the works as a major motion picture from the producer of The Devil Wears Prada and P.S. I Love You. Now is the time to discover this funny, quirky, romantic winner that everyone will soon be talking about.",
