  "description": "A star baseball player decides that attending church is more important than the game he grew up loving and that will earn him millions. While his team works to keep him playing everyday, his wife must deal with the life she has come to expect turned upside down. At the same time, a Baptist pastor is faced with the loss of his church’s property for his decision to lead the church out of an association. A lawyer’s encounter with the athlete and the pastor causes him to see as never before how his own life has become defined by his job. Never on Sundays examines the division—and the hope—created by choosing the best path.",
