  "description": "Stewart Dunk's humble life takes an unexpected turn for the better when six very strange strangers move into the derelict house next door one Friday morning and begin renovations. The house next door is not the only thing they are there to renovate though. Stewart Dunk getting the life he deserves is their main goal, but to accomplish this they must make sure he gets back together with his long lost sweetheart Juliet, drive off his selfish, maneating mother Udela, his equally selfish, womanizing older brother Aiken, and at least throw his smarter than thou middle brother Erian off-kilter. In the meantime, these strangers, who go by the names of Apollo, Athena, Mars, Venus, Medusa, and Hermes, are grappling with their own baggage, which they've been carrying around since well before a certain war in the Aegean a very long time ago. The trick is to help Stewart get a good life at last without throttling each other in the process. This is the global distribution edition that can be purchased anywhere.",
