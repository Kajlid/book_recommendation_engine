So strongly does she resist training that Alec Ramsay and Henry Dailey have to trick her into running! But Black Minx has a few tricks of her own …In 1952, Walter Farley crated Black Minx, the first daughter of the famous Black Stallion. At the time, only one filly had ever won the Kentucky Derby in its seventy-seven-year history. In this classic racing story, Black minx just might be up to the challenge.",
