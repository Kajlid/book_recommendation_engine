  "description": "Drawing from beloved scriptural accounts and writing in the lyrical style of Even This, Emily Belle Freeman shares her understanding of how Jesus will meet you where you are, as you are, but He doesn't intend to leave you there. Instead, the Savior offers divine grace to heal wounds and elevate souls.Grace Where You Are is filled with inspired scripture, gentle moments of reflection and meditation, and opportunities for personal application. Spending some time in its pages will help you to recognize that no matter where you are in your life's journey, Christ will come to you when you feel you fall short, extending His divine grace and providing so much more than what you lack.",
