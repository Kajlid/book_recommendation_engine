  "description": "For years the only place I called home was the open road.  Until the Kings of Vengeance became family.  Setting down roots and building a life sounds so good I can almost taste it. But evil and trouble are brewing, threatening to take the life and woman I’ve claimed.  I’ll lean into the devil himself and spit in his face before I let that happen.  Vengeance will be mine.",
