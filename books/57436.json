  "title": "Cat Attacks: True Stories and Hard Lessons from Cougar Country",
  "description": "As many mountain lion attacks have occurred in the past ten years as in the hundred preceding. What's happening? Cougar populations are rebounding, but these wild cats have fewer and fewer places to live. This is the first unflinching look at what happens when cougars and people cross paths. Impossible to put down, Cat Attacks chronicles mountain lion attacks and encounters that have occurred in the last ten years in the West. These riveting stories of heroes and victims will tell you what to fear, what to ignore, and what to expect when we make room for the cat that is arguably America's most effective largest predator.",
