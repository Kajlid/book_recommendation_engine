  "description": "It was the most wonderful moment in Jodie's life. For her, the whole world seemed to sing with joy. The sky seemed brighter and the sunshine more golden. When Jodie Carpenter won the Greenvale Junior Show Jumping Championship there were tears of happiness in her eyes. She was not to know that she was about to be cruelly struck down by a crippling disease, and the hurdles ahead of her would be more challenging than those she had just overcome.",
