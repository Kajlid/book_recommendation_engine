  "description": "There are some days it just doesn’t pay to get out of bed. My girlfriend kicked me out. Then, even my dog didn’t want me, so he ran away. My boss fired me when I called to let him know I was going to be late. And to put the cherry on top of the crap sundae, I accidentally doused a woman in water who had more followers than brain cells. As if becoming one of the most hated men in Queen City wasn’t bad enough, some lunatic was stalking the popular life coach I had soaked. The fucker should be running from Zoey, not watching, especially with me protecting her. Some fuckers must learn the hard way, and I’m going to be the one to teach him. You don’t mess with anyone who belongs to a Predator. It was a perfect day … until I met Stump. I found a new friend, reached half a million followers, and was on the brink of putting my past behind me when the crazy biker accused me of stealing his dog. To make matters worse, he then blamed me for people hating on him. He did that with no help from me. I don’t blame the dog for running away. I would, too, if I belonged to him. My skills as a life coach don’t work on him. I might not be able to change the irritating Predator, but I’m not above using him to catch the one who wants me dead.",
