But when has Vasili made anything easy? * The more Niko tries to to carve out a perfect life, the more Vasili pulls away. Niko has one last chance to save them, one surprise that will cement their love forever or have it crumble to dust. * Vasili knows Nikolas is lying. If that weren't insulting enough, he also understands why. What can he offer Nikolas, but nightmares and trauma? Nikolas needs a good man for his good heart. As much as Vasili desperately wants to keep Nikolas close, he also knows he doesn't deserve him. But how to tell the only man he's ever truly loved that it's over? *** The Cottage is a romantic 30k word novella that takes place after the main events in the trilogy. It cannot be read as a standalone and should be read after Curse of the Dark Prince. There is 'misunderstanding angst', but The Cottage ends in a HEA.",
