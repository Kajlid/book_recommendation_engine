She decides to write her own book, hoping that the hero she creates will somehow appear in her life. And miraculously, he does in the form of Italian soccer star Roberto Buggati, whose daughter Lucia is one of Andie's new students. Roberto is married to a British movie star but that's not stopping him from pursuing Andie. Sure it's adultery but what harm can it do? Just one night with the stud would surely give her a lifetime of unforgettable memories. It would finally convince her that she is sexy and desirable and give her the confidence to live the rest of her life to the full.Complicating matters, an earnest German engineer, Stefan Kramer, has moved into Andie's apartment building. Stefan doesn't fit Andie's requirements as a lover but he's perfect for the role of best friend. Only he's not going along with her plan. He may be quiet -- but still waters run deep. Now Andie has to choose. Will she go for the smoking' hot Italian stallion with abs of steel -- even though he's off-limits -- or will she choose the safe, dependable German nerd -- who may not be quite as safe or nerdy as she thought? Or could she possibly have both.\"Loving Mr Average\" is a love letter to the romance novel genre that doesn't take itself too seriously, yet asks some probing questions.
