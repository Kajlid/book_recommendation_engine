  "description": "The Time Card series follows the adventures and fortunes of three friends – Blue, Jesse, and Ellie – as they use the contents of their newly found case to travel to diverse and exotic places. Their middle school studies come alive as they interact with historical figures of their country and the world, while at the same time struggling to not change the time-line or upset the course of history. Trying to hide the case from present day bullies, the friends try to stay one step ahead of their arch enemies Ryan Johnson and Jake Barker, not to mention sinister otherworld forces who are determined to find the time card. In Episode 6 of the Time Card Series, the three friends find themselves in a Daktar jail cell after being abducted by the Daktar alien rebels. Tam and his fighters rush to rescue the kids and find themselves in the fight of their lives. Meanwhile, Blue, Jesse, and Ellie won't sit by and wait to be rescued; they take matters into their own hands. Join the kids as they explore new worlds, battle bullies, deal with family issues, and ultimately try to save the world. The Time Card is aimed at young readers as short stories that can be read in a single sitting. As English teachers, we are always on the lookout for stories that our students (middle/high school) are interested in reading. We’ve found that most young readers (heck, even many adults!) who are reluctant to read balk at long stories. We really wanted to offer them short, engaging fiction stories, so we created The Time Card series. Anyone will enjoy the stories while learning about history, dealing with social situations, and improving vocabulary and reading skills.",
