  "description": "Loaded Stories is a personal essay about growing up in raucous 1970s California. Available at http://www.loadedstories.com/ Here's a review from Dave Alvin, a Grammy award-winning guitarist and singer-songwriter: “Dear Mr. Hayes, Thank you so damn much for sending me your powerful book. I read it as quickly as I could. It’s truly a fucking amazing piece of writing. Words kind of fail me but here are some perhaps cliché ones: heartbreaking, funny, painful, brutal, honest, beautiful and true. I’m a bit older than you but a bit younger than your mother and step-father but I knew the world you describe in the book to some extent. I started playing music in various southern California biker bars at a young age (including the Corral) and your description of that scene was spot on. As were your wonderful words about growing up in the wild and beautiful hills/mountains of California. Perhaps the best, and most painful writing, though, was about your family and how complicated, maddening and yet simple love can be. It’s not only a great California memoir but a great universal one. Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for sending your book to me and, more importantly, thank you for writing it.”",
