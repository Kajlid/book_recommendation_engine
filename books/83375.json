Facebook.com/TasselMossDeep in the woods, the Spanish moss keeps a sinister secret—one that children are dying to know… Thirteen-year-old Nellie Landers is a long way from her Hollywood home. Attending Camp Seamist in North Carolina—a sailing camp for girls—she teams up with three cabin mates: a feisty free-spirit, a tomboy extrovert, and a debutante equestrian. As these wisecracking friends enjoy a month without parents, they manage to survive the heat, the snakes, and the Saturday night dances with the neighboring boy’s camp. But can they survive what is lurking in the woods? Ignorant of impending danger, Nellie and her gang clash head-on with a centuries’ old curse. Its misty enchantress—a devious beauty—waits for one of them to wander within reach of her fatal touch. Propelled by the legend of a doomed prince and princess, this thrilling tale chronicles the escapades of four new friends as they stumble upon a vindictive renegade and come face to face with unimaginable evil. Celebrating the fierce bonds of friendship and the courageous faith of everlasting love, TASSEL MOSS is an unforgettable summer adventure filled with wit, camaraderie—and terror.",
