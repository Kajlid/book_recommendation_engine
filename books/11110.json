Like any other town, Serendipity has its secrets, scandals, pain, heartache and love, but there is also an implied promise of fortune and good luck, along with people at changes and crossroads in their lives.You already met Ethan Barron, the bad boy who has come home to make good and Faith Harrington, the girl who got away.  DESTINY is Nash  Barron and Kelly Moss's story and coming in May 2012 is Dare Barron in KARMA.I hope you'll continue to take this new journey with me and enjoy!Happy Reading,Carly Phillips",
