  "title": "Kuan Yin: Myths and Revelations of the Chinese Goddess of Compassion: The Prophecies of the Goddess of Mercy",
  "description": "Kuan Yin is the most important and best loved deity of the Chinese world. She is the living expression of compassion, whose gentle face and elegant figure form a centre of devotion in most Chinese homes and workplaces. Yet she is barely known in the West and few studies have been made of her. The authors of this book have travelled all over China in search of her true story and origins within Buddhism, Taoism and the female shamans of China. Now, in her universal mystery and power of the divine feminine, she transcends all doctrines, creeds and traditions.The beautiful poetry of the 100 Prophecies of Kuan Yin is here translated into English for the first time. These poems are used as a method of divination, to gain insight into the depths of the soul. With the myths, they form the heart of this new look at one of the most powerful but least known goddesses.",
