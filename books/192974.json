We will bring ten unique short stories from this overwhelming, vibrant, capital city to English-reading audiences in the next installation of our popular \"Reading the City\" series. Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh, which emerged as a nation state in 1971 after a violent struggle for independence from West Pakistan.
