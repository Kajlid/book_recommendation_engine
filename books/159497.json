  "description": "Nine Eons ago, the World of Atmotis was forged by The Originators. Following the Great Betrayal the World has been guarded by the Mystical Phoenix. Atmotis now has an unknown evil stirring. Here a paranoid Emperor strives to protect his realm from a mad deity; a few grief stricken sages learn ancient secrets lost to the world; an assassin sworn to a dark power undertakes his most arduous mission yet; and a retired mercenary pursuing vengeance come together in ways to support and thwart a young girl named Phae who realizes that her life has a greater purpose than cataloging books. This is a tale of Magick, weapons and martial arts; happiness, anguish and revenge; faiths shattered, loyalties questioned, and secret schemes. Can our hero save the world or will the blight consume it?",
