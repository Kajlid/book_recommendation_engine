  "description": "The first part of TRACE, a three-part series from New York Times and USA Today bestselling author, Deborah Bladon.  Being a nurse gives Vanessa Meyer a true purpose in life. It grounds her in a way that nothing else can. Since she's watched her mother slide into the clutches of a painful condition, she's worked hard to better the lives of her patients, giving as much as she can to those who seek help.  Garrett Ryan is an attorney in Manhattan. He centers his life on himself. When he's brought to the hospital after a horrible crash, Vanessa tends to his wounds.  Their first meeting is explosive. She sees the worst in him. He only sees the best in her.  When she needs his legal expertise, he jumps at the chance to help her find the answers she seeks. He encourages her to set out on a journey of self-discovery but neither can predict where that complex trail will take her. When she finally traces the path of her past to the present, it leads her to a reality that changes everything she's ever known.  Note: This ends in a cliffhanger. Parts Two and Three will be released within the next few weeks.",
