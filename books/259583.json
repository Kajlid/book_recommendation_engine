Be there as he watches criminals and angry mobs burn down drug lords' houses. Accompany him when he's looking for missing children. Be among the first to arrive at an eerie scene, late night on a city street, where a prominent international gangster died in a hail of bullets. Join him as he interviews a glamorous, evasive millionaire couple who are on the FDA/FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives List.The book also offers the reader a unique glimpse into the world of competitive news gathering and the workings of an old-fashioned newsroom, when these were still staffed by the eccentric, dark-humoured, off-beat types known as newsmen and women.",
