  "description": "When I first saw the monster hidden in the dark, teeth sharp and face covered in blood, the first thing I did was jump over Boston's Wall of Protection to warn the people inside it. Turns out the people already knew, and all I did was turn myself into a delicious little snack for the most terrifying creature to have ever existed.  I was sure he’d kill me. He didn’t. Instead, he turned me into one of them.  Being saved against your own will is no fun, especially when the knight in shining armor is a vampire who calls himself Hammer. He’s arrogant, flirty, and even more stubborn than me. Left with no other choice but to make a deal with him, I soon find out that I’m not just your usual bloodsucker. I’m something far worse. But at least I’m no longer all alone. Promises are not to be broken in my newfound world, and when my part of the deal is done, Hammer has seven days to complete his.  If he does, I will no longer be alive.",
