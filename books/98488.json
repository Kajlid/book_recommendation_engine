  "description": "When Detective Isaac Bell's mentor is shot, the turn-of-the-century investigator traces the attack from a booze-smuggling operation back to a team of international saboteurs in this #1 New York Times– bestselling series. It is 1920, and both Prohibition and bootlegging are in full swing. When Isaac Bell’s boss and lifelong friend Joseph Van Dorn is shot and nearly killed while leading the high-speed chase of a rum-running vessel, Bell swears to him that he will hunt down the men responsible.  But Bell doesn’t know what he is getting into. When a witness to Van Dorn’s shooting is executed in a ruthlessly efficient manner invented by the Russian secret police, it becomes clear that these are no ordinary criminals. In a trail that leads from the ravages of post-World-War-I Europe to the speakeasies of New York, to the lawless streets of Detroit and Florida’s lavish beachside resorts, Isaac tracks the footsteps of a enterprise more ingenious and far-reaching than any he has ever known.  For this is no mere bootlegging operation, but a powerful international organization with the very downfall of America in its sights . . .",
