  "description": "“Oi, that flower belongs to me!”When Amie Green picks a daisy from an overgrown lawn, it never occurs to her that it could spark such a row. Neither did she expect that it would ignite romantic feelings for the hot tempered man in the blue house. But, before long, it’s clear that Harry and his Irish wolfhound aren’t quite what they seem. What tremendous secret are they guarding? And is Amie brave anough to follow her heart into the unknown?In the first part of the Between series, we’re transported down a mysterious, misty river to a universe wrought out of magic and myth, where enchanted princes battle monstruous queens and evil creatures. Standing up to the mother-in-law from hell, an unlikely heroine proves that love can move mountains – or at least a tiny sliver of the universe.Splendidly skilled, author Zenka Wistram builds an atmosphere of old folklore, drawing upon Irish, Scandinavian, and Native American mythology, creating an original, epic adventure, wholly her own.",
