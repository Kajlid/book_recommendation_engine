  "description": "Dana Gray loves her husband and her two-year-old daughter, but her life is far from perfect. Domestic strain weighs down her marriage, and her role as a stay-at-home mom cuts her off the rest of the world. It's a thankless, never-ending job, and her only escape is shifting into a wolf and running beneath the trees and sky.When Cole Randall is captured again, he leverages his knowledge about a threat to the werewolf community in exchange for a pardon. And he's got a plan to neutralize this threat. He and Dana will go undercover. She'll have to pretend to be his prisoner.Dana knows that her draw to Cole is irrational and unwise. She knows that her life is far more stable without him in it. And she knows this plan of his is dangerous--not only to her safety, but to her relationship with her husband",
