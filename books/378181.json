  "description": "Miss Pickerell was mighty glad to be home from her vacation. She had had an overdose of noise and confusion. As she led her cow out to graze behind her little house she thought happily about the rest they were both going to have. But suddenly she saw, right in the middle of the pasture, the strangest, largest contraption she had ever laid eyes on. She was very frightened, but this was a clear case of trespassing. Miss Pickerell didn't hesitate. She went right up to investigate the outrage.What happens after that is more than she bargains for. It is a question who is most surprised: Miss Pickerell or the captain and the crew!",
