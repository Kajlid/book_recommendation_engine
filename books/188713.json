  "description": "Welcome to the CLAMP School, Japan's most prestigious place of learning--home to prodigies, wunderkinds and young geniuses of every make and model. In a world where the average student is smarter than the teachers, how can the top students challenge their intellects? Why, by creating a detective service, of course! Meet the CLAMP School Detectives: Nokoru Imonoyama, the world's smartest kid, who can detect a woman in distress from 2 kilometers away; Suoh Takamura, a martial arts master who's cool as ice; Akira Ijyuin, detective by day, master thief by night. Wherever there's a young lady in distress, they'll be there. After all, when you're as smart as they are, you don't have to study.",
