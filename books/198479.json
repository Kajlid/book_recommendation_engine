  "description": "Monsters aren't born... they're engineered. For nineteen-year-old, socially awkward Geoff Markham, the promise of a miracle pill to make him into the person heâ€™d always wanted to be was everything he could have hoped for. At first, the experiment delivered on that promise. Geoff began to change, becoming more confident, stronger, even fearless. People began to admire him and find him attractive. As with every new drug, there came side effects: the agitation, sleeplessness, the bad temper. When the strange dreams began, the ones that couldn't possibly be his own, he realized something else was happening to him. As he continued to change, he was becoming something much more than what had been promised... something far less human. Something unimaginable, unrecognizable. Increasingly strange and violent things begin to happen around him. Is he the hunted or the hunter?",
