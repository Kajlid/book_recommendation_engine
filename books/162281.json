But when he becomes my new roommate, well...Lachlan: I'm a male stripper. I'm not ashamed of it--in fact, I fucking love it. I turn girls on five nights a week. With a stare. With a sway of the hips. Then I take them home and fuck their brains out. I live by three rules: No commitments. No falling in love. Only mind-blowing orgasms.Now I want more.But Vi isn't interested in a fuck buddy, and I've never been one to stick to a single girl.They say that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But when you live here full time...That's when things really get interesting.",
