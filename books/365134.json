  "description": "\"We have to get to her first…\" Abducted? Runaway? Murder victim? Lily Odilon―local wild child from a middle-of-nowhere town―has vanished after spending the night with her boyfriend, new kid Albert Morales. Suspected in her disappearance, Albert sets out with Lily’s prickly younger sister, Olivia, to discover what really happened to Lily―and to keep the promise he made to her late one night. *** \"Reminiscent of John Green's Paper Towns (2008), this noir thriller hooks readers with realistic dialogue, fully fleshed characters and plenty of twists. Terrific to the last, good page.\" ― KIRKUS REVIEWS   \"A journey well worth taking.\" ― PUBLISHERS WEEKLY    \"In this debut suspense novel, teens search for elusive truths about Lily's family in their small Idaho town. With a chapter structure reminiscent of Paul Fleischman's Whirligig (Holt, 1998), the novel requires readers to piece together complete pictures of the characters in three divergent story lines in order to gain a full understanding of their plight.\"― SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL   \"This debut novel boasts a strong narrative drive, deft scene setting, and isn't bad at delivering catch-your-breath suspense, either.\" ― BOOKLIST",
