  "description": "Guiding Light is an 8,000 word short story.  Demon attacks have long since been the scapegoat for murders, disappearances, and other dark plans. When the village of Mountain Crest starts to show disturbing trends, similar to the events that lead to the annihilation of a small border town and the death of exiled Hunter Alexander Daamon, his daughter, currently an apprentice demon hunter, is sent in to investigate.  As Astral delves deeper into monastery's secret catacombs, she uncovers a breach in the veil separating the living from the dead where foul magic uses the spirits as fuel to open a rift into the pits of Hell. Are these signs just a coincidence? Or is the Red Order responsible for unleashing the demon legions threatening humanity's survival?",
