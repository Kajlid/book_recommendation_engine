  "description": "Cora He left eight years ago for the military. That was the hardest time of my life. Xavier was the boy who’d sneak into my bed at night and hold me as my parents fought in the next room. My protector. My best friend. The man I was in love with. The man I’d saved my virginity for. And now he was back home for good. Too much time had passed. I was done keeping us in the friend zone. I wanted him in my life in every way that counted. So if he wasn’t going to make the first move then I would, even if it might ruin what we had. Because I had to take that chance. Xavier She was my life, the very reason I breathed. I saved my virginity for Cora because no one else compared. No one else ever would. It was time I man up and tell Cora that she was the only girl I’d ever loved, that no matter how much time had passed she’d been it for me. But how could I go about doing that when eight years had gone by? Admitting how I felt was hard as hell seeing as we’d always just been friends. How could I not cross any lines and screw up the relationship we had? Easy. I’d tell her I loved her and propose. Reader A standalone romance with cameo appearances by Asher, Cash, and Trevor Mayson from Aurora Rose Reynolds Until series.",
