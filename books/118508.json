Is today the day?\" \"Yes,\" says Mama. \"Papa is almost ready.\" And so Chita and her father set out into the deep, snowy woods to find Chita's very own Christmas tree. And when Christmas morning comes, Chita has many surprises, but none as beautiful as her tree -- with its full and graceful branches and her name carved in its trunk.",
