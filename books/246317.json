  "title": "ABANDONED",
  "description": "Traumatized by acts of terrorism in the early 1980s, Susie exposes a multilevel marketing, pyramid scheme involving a child torture faction, human trafficking, and political corruption hidden behind a corporate veil of an American billionaire. She normalized persistent neglect and abuse to survive after her parents abandoned her at a warehouse at age sixteen. Narrowly escaping with her life, she became trapped in a cycle of tumultuous relationships for decades. Embracing hope, she sifted through the muddy waters, unveiled the skeletons lurking in high-ranking political closets, and emerged as a victor. After discovering branching carbon copies of this terroristic cult and mind control program, she connected with other survivors. As a trauma survivor, she found meaning and purpose as a worldwide special needs advocate and received international acclaim as an award-winning author with many distinctions. Her campaigns against institutional abuse, family violence, and bullying reach millions.",
