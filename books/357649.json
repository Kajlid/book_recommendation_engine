  "title": "A Passion for My Provence: Home Cooking from the South of France",
  "description": "With charm and enthusiasm, Lydie Marshall invites readers to explore the savory splendor of her native France. In A Passion for My Provence (previously published as Chez Nous ), Lydie combines anecdotes of her time spent in Provence--the land of olive oil and garlic--with recipes she has acquired from three generations of French friends and family. The book begins with a tour of Lydie's restored ch√¢teau in the olive capital, Nyons, ending at the birthplace of many fabulous meals--her inviting kitchen. But Lydie's inspirations come from beyond her copper-potted enclave; she gathers wild herbs in the surrounding hills, buys fresh produce and meats from the village market, and collects the traditional country recipes of her neighbors. These recipes, cleverly adapted for American kitchens, reflect the joyous bounty of France. With relaxed guidance and eminent authority, Lydie Marshall combines French flair, style, thrift, and taste with American efficiency and concern for diet. Sample Lydie's recipes, and you will taste the honest, satisfying, and delicious cooking of rural France.",
