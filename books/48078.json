  "description": "In the golden age of Egypt, the glory of the kingdom is rising to unprecedented heights. The united kingdom is thriving and expanding, and great stone monuments are rising from the fertile banks of the Nile. The Fourth Dynasty of Kemet is growing stronger under its ambitious new leader, Pharaoh Khufu. His father, King Sneferu has established a legacy of extravagant monuments and massive building projects, and his son will not allow himself to become a lesser king. With the science of pyramid construction now perfected, Khufu has determined to build the grandest monument of all time: the Great Pyramid. Itennu, a rising official for the new king, has been commissioned for a critical mission: to discover and secure new mineral resources in the arid eastern wilderness. And construction of the new pyramid cannot begin unless the expedition succeeds. Over the course of his journey, Itennu encounters a man who will profoundly change the way he sees the world, a man who has been promised to become the father of many nations.",
