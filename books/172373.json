  "description": "Hank Hanson’s family is not only blended; it’s pulverized by the weight of its own perfect symmetry\n\nTo the casual outsider, Hank Hanson’s life might seem idyllic. As a successful businessman on the verge of a major business deal and an all-around good guy, few get close enough to see the troubled soul underneath his open face.The product of a family fractured many times over by his parents’ multiple remarriages, Hank spends his Thanksgivings running a miserable, thankless gauntlet of visiting multiple family members.One Thanksgiving, he takes an unscheduled detour and meets Erin Contee, a woman who might just be too good for him – but at the same time, perfect. As the two grow closer together, Hank believes he has finally found the missing piece in his fragmented life.\n\nHe has a beautiful girl, great friends, a business, and a family – so why does he feel so bad?\n\nJust as Hank starts to believe that he has finally found everything, Erin reveals a dark secret own past, shattering Hank’s romantic vision with the blunt force trauma of reality.As Hank struggles to come to terms with Erin’s past and their future together, he must also deal with his family’s drama creeping into his home and business. Will Hank be able to do the right thing – or will he succumb under the weight of his own mistakes?The Symmetry of Snowflakes is not just another contemporary love story. Peters has created an intricate, yet symmetrical world for readers to explore and ponder on the endless complexity and fragility of human relationships – and the unyielding drama that inevitably accompanies emotional realities outside of the romantic ideal of true love.",
