  "description": "Irreverent, bizarre, whimsical, and mocking, Kley's pen-and-ink drawings rank among the most imaginative satirical cartoons of all time. This compilation draws upon his Skizzenbuch I and II (1909–10) to present 200 fantastic images that blend savage humor with brilliant draughtsmanship in sketches of humans, animals, and curious combinations of the two.",
