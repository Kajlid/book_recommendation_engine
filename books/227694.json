But in the hothouse of the school, a slight seems of earth-shattering importance, and Bruno soon finds himself caught up in his friend's fantasies of revenge.\" \"Years later, Bruno leads an uneventful life - dull days in the office made bearable by consoling drinks with his friend Jenny - until the sudden reappearance of Anthony forces Bruno to confront the darkest corners of his past. Now he must decide how far he is prepared to go to assuage his guilt - and how far Anthony will let him.",
