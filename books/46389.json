  "description": "What would you do if someone murdered your child, but the justice system let you down?  Kathryn Walters is faced with this dreadful decision when her daughter, Shelley, is found dead in her boyfriend's flat. Despite the best efforts of the Crown Prosecution barrister, Sarah Newby, it seems possible that the boyfriend, David Kidd, may be acquitted. Should her family tolerate this? Or seek their own form of justice through revenge?  Sarah Newby finds herself defending a client who is not only reluctant to give evidence on her own behalf, but also refuses to explain why she chose Sarah to defend her in the first place ...  This book was awarded a B.R.A.G Medallion 2012 as a top rated independent novel and is the second book in a series of British legal thrillers which have been compared to the works of John Grisham, Scott Turow and Michael Connelly.  'Excellent ... very satisfying.' Sarah Burns for the Kindle Book Review.  'Another brilliant read which kept me gripped from the start.
