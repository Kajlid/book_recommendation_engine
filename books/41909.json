  "description": "Home is where your hockey player is...As Allison Monroe balances work, school, and caring for her elderly grandmother, she has little time left for herself. Sure, she secretly dreams of a fairytale romance, but she is content living vicariously through her promiscuous, quirky best friend Izzy. However, Izzy has other plans. Intent on finding her friend a man, Izzy drags Ally to a local hockey game. Ally doesn't know anything about hockey, except for Izzy's hormone-fueled description of sweaty men in uniforms, but she tries to be a good sport anyway. To Ally's surprise, she enjoys the fast-paced game and is even more stunned when she collides with star player Benjamin Price, practically knocking him off his skates.Ben plays for the Red Valley Ravens and has everything that Ally does not: an exciting career, a multi-million dollar home overlooking the city, and, of course, a fast car. Ben opens up an exciting new world for Ally and easily sweeps her off her feet with his boyish good looks and athletic charm. When his contract with the Ravens expires and he is offered the chance to play for the best team in the league, which just so happens to be 1300 miles away, Ally risks losing everything. Will they end up on thin ice when life threatens to tear them apart?With the support of her family and friends, Ally experiences life, love, and letting go, and discovers that the true meaning of home isn't necessarily an address.",
