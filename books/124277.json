Honorable, brooding, and utterly unavailable as well as self-denying of pleasure, Summer Court's Commander walks around breaking hearts as if it’s his duty.It's not. His duty is to the king.When the king hears of the coup in the Spring Court, and the power vacuum it leaves, he sends the Commander to protect the only royal left standing: the former princess, now the inexperienced Spring Queen.Excellent.Destroying evil doers and restoring order are Commander's cup of tea. Everything about the new assignment is perfect.Orderly.Predictable and in control.Except his feelings for the new Queen.",
