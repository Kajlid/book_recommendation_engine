  "description": "Years ago he tried to break me.Now, five men are piecing together the shattered pieces of my soul.When I’m brutally attacked and find myself in the hospital, old memories are unburied. Memories of pain, torture, and an agony I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.I thought I’d finally begun to heal from my past trauma, but I didn’t know what healing was until I met them. The five protective men who infiltrated my life and dissipated the darkness of my past.Flynn, the EMT who saved my life. His smile alone is capable of eddying a room with light.Heath, the retired MMA fighter who owns a gym aimed to help abused women like myself. He makes me feel safe and protected, as if nothing can harm me when I’m in his presence.Owen, the compassionate doctor who fixed me up and gave me a home. He’s the unofficial leader of the group…and he won’t let you forget it.Kyle, the skilled, ex-army sniper who can’t decide what to do with me but desires me just as fiercely as I do him. And finally,Silas, the gruff, bossy asshole who makes my heart flutter with just a single word.The five of them saw something in me—something worth saving—and I’ll be damned if I don’t repay their generosity.But when my past comes knocking on my door, will I be strong enough to fight back and save myself and the men I’m growing to love? Or will my soul remain broken?This book contains some cliffhangers, not all plots get resolved in this book. It is a reverse harem where the heroine ends ups with at least three of the guys.CONTENT WARNING: This book contains graphic and frankly violent scenes, including rape, physical and emotional violence, animal abuse, and psychological turmoil.
