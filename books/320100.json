  "title": "Circus of Charades",
  "description": "This volume combines the three books in the series ‘Do Not Fed the Clowns’ so that, should you wish, you can enjoy them as they were originally intended, all in one go. It comprises of a collection of tales that explore some of the darker aspects of human existence. Quirky and bordering on the surreal, Buck Starmer approaches writing like it’s something that has to be done. Disturbing? Dark? Well yes, certainly . . . but also at times, with his tongue stuck firmly in his cheek. Reading his work is like trying on a series of lenses to reveal new insights that result from making the familiar world strange. Starmer often writes about characters on the edge to hint at what is wrong with human nature. Individuals are searching desperately for meaning in a meaningless world. A world full of dishonesty, self-interest and incompetence. With tales that lay somewhere between post-surrealist existential horror and psychological drama, Starmer seems to enjoy unleashing the hobgoblins of your mind and encouraging them to root around in your sub-conscious causing havoc. He uses his stories to explore what makes life so difficult, frustrating, unfulfilling and what the consequences might be for the future of the planet. Is it the system that’s at fault? Is it politics? Is it religion? Or is it something deeper and darker that lies within all of us? His stories are full of divergent meanings, cultural analyses and philosophical observation. These stories are for the kind of ‘wierdo’ who actually enjoys reading about alienation, social misfits, addictions, mysterious diseases, rare syndromes, circus side-shows, environmental desecration and the like. If you enjoy having your nose rubbed in allegory – this is for you.",
