  "description": "History never changes. It repeats. It errs. It lies. After all, it lied about her. She knew it was only a matter of time. She knew the Radicals would come. But knowing never seems to make it any less sudden. Even as the war raged on, Elvira Hamilton was sure she was safeâ€”safe in her little village, safe in her garden, safe under the canopy of stars. That is, until the Radicals, fueled by their desire for a pure human race, set out to eradicate those with the powers that branded them as unnatural and dangerous: the Marked. When the Radicals attack one fateful night, Elvira and her sister must escape, leaving their parents still caught in the struggle. With the war raging in England, they only have one choice: Flee to America with the other refugees. The only problem is, they are not refugees, and they are not supposed to leave. As stowaways on the RMS Celtic, the sisters embark on a precarious journey to America, only to find the strong bonds of lust pulling the strings of right and wrong. Handsome and avidly curious, Mr. Laurence makes Elvira question everything she once believed about the secrets she holds so dear to her heart. Should she tell him the truth and risk being handed over to the Radicals, or should she continue to lie, risking the loss of his trust and friendship along with everything else?",
