  "description": "“We all know in our hearts when we’re doing something we shouldn't…it doesn't stop us from doing it though, does it?”  Rebecca's stunned to discover that the stranger she had a mind-blowing one night stand with is actually a man with the money and power to ruin her. Somehow, even with her career at risk, she finds the strength to refuse his proposition for another night.  She thinks she can walk away, but Andrew doesn't give up that easily.  Their chemistry is off the charts, but when another stranger is added into the mix, things start to get ugly.  Watched by a Stranger is the second part in the Billionaire Behaving Badly Series, intended for 18+ readers who like sexy, alpha, uber-rich men with dirty mouths and a penchant for naughty bedroom antics! You've been warned in the best possible way!",
