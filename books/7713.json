Though some take human form, they can't hide their wicked souls (or the nasty things they do) from Cat. One can even turn her insides to mush...but in a good way.Blue-eyed Detective S. Tegan makes Cat's pulse race. But she can see in his mind that he's hiding something - and fangs are just the tip of the iceberg. With bodies piling up all around her, Cat needs help to break her family's curse. Only she can't afford to trust just anyone, especially when she doesn't even know his first name.",
