  "description": "Prince Thessian needs to strengthen the bonds with his allies in the Dante Kingdom, especially if he plans to protect his strong-willed regent. Life would be much simpler if his subordinates could stay out of trouble, and the criminal he's after didnâ€™t make him doubt his family. Meanwhile, Emilia is plagued with nightmares and feels she can't go on if she loses any of her dear friends. In a game of chess, pawns need to be sacrificed, but Emilia isn't used to others giving their lives for her. With powerful mages crawling out of the woodwork and well-kept secrets that could shake the foundation of the continent, Emilia is certain she has deviated the main plot. What will she and Thessian sacrifice for the greater good?",
