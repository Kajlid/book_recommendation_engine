  "description": "How many times can you make the same mistake? How many lifetimes does it take to get it right? And how many people have to die in the process? In Scotland, Anna searches for answers. She finds cold rain, steep hills... and terror. When she sees the ancient broch, the ruined building triggers a terror she can’t explain. Scenes from her past lives provide glimpses of the web of events linking her to the broch and the man she’s lost countless times before. Trapped in an eddy of Fate invariably ending in blood, Anna tries to break the chain and protect what she lost before. Her tealeaves and tarot cards lead her, but the weight of the past may be too heavy.",
