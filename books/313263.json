  "description": "Baby-sitter BluesAshley can't wait to go back to school. The new school year means shopping for new clothes, meeting boys...shopping for more new clothes! Her twin sister, Mary-Kate, thinks she's crazy. Mary-Kate would much rather hit a softball than hit the mega-mall. But they do agree on one thing: They're way too old for a baby-sitter! Too bad their dad doesn't see it the same way. Now the twins need a plan--a plan to show Dad just how right they are! Look inside for our photo scrapbook from the show!",
