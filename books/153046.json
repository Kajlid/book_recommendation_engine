  "description": "My name is Jamie, and I am brilliant. Or at least I was. Now I don’t know what’s what anymore.Living in a swirling fog of absent memories, Jamie struggles every day to remember who she is and where she’s going. While her classmates are discussing the latest book craze, she is tracking her own life in a journal.Each day brings new challenges, especially when Callum McKenzie appears, bringing with him a brief glimpse of clarity. Whenever the exchange student from Scotland is near, Jamie’s unusual amnesia recedes, allowing her to experience university life with ease.Unfortunately, Callum’s presence in her life is as unstable as the fog that threatens her. He knows more about Jamie’s life than she does, but he never sticks around long enough for her to figure anything out. It’s only a matter of time before she forgets everything altogether.",
