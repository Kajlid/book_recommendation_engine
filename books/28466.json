  "description": "I am her alpha, and her owner. I met my human mate when she accidentally sold herself at an alien slave auction. Sheâ€™s half my size, and she's cute when she's wrong. (And she's wrong about so many things, like who owns who.) I'll thoroughly enjoy teaching this human of mine just who she belongs to. And making the baby my pride demands of me? That's going to be a lot of fun too.But it's not all fun and games. The world I come from is harsh, and the rules of my pride are vicious. I cannot shelter her from every rough reality of Leonid life. My mate will have to be as strong as she is soft. She will have to bend so she does not break. I am alpha of my pride, and she will come to understand her place as my mate, or suffer the consequences.My Big Alien Owner contains many dark themes relating to a society of leonine aliens, and a very possessive alien alpha. Reader discretion is advised.",
