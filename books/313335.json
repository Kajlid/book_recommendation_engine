  "description": "Bestselling author, father, husband. Junkie. Elwood Cathis gave up everything for the needle. Desperate to rebuild a relationship with his daughter and ex-wife, he's come to Lake Chance, a once-bustling vacation hot spot, now caught in the throes of a prolonged demise. Tainted and scarred by past events, it's a place that echoes his own existence. Echoes... Something echoes. It calls out, like a forgotten broadcast stuck on repeat. Something in the forest. Something infernal that only he and others like him can hear; the lost, the weak, the tormented. Suffering from intense withdrawal and plagued by nightmarish visions, Elwood will confront the lake's dark past, and in doing so, uncover parts of himself he lost at the tip of a needle, and so much more.",
