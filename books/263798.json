But they have one thing in common; they are determined to offer Olivia the protection of marriage and the promise of endless carnal pleasures.Olivia worries that her instant attraction and hasty agreement to marry three men stems from a defect in her character.

She also never expected her brother to marry her by proxy to a trusted friend before dying on the journey.

It will take ample Scottish brash, a fair amount of brawn and plenty of carnal persuasion to free Rebecca of her inhibitions and show her how treasured she is.
