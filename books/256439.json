It is here that Kate will finally be forced to grow up and confront some hard truths about herself.  Kate runs into someone unexpected, and the teens are about to have the adventure of a lifetime! They will be whisked to the end-times, a distant land full of dangers and disasters where the evil queen Evrisx sets her sights on the young girl. Evrisx, with her unnatural powers and taste for human flesh, could not only harm Kate - she could doom the entire world and the constellation of stars.",
