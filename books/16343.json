  "description": "[Siren Classic Erotic Alternative Paranormal/Fantasy Romance, M/M, light BDSM, sex toys] The paranormal world is in chaos. The elders are tired of their younger people playing the field, causing trouble, and fighting with each other. Everyone who attends the UPAC Conference now has twenty-four hours to claim a mate of a different species. If they don't, they will never have a mate. The spell is cast. There is no escaping the Midnight Matings. Ten minutes after setting eyes on the sexy little phoenix shifter, Zaiden finds himself accidentally mated to the man. He doesn't know how it happened. The last thing he remembers, they'd been trying to escape. Asher isn't exactly thrilled about their mating either, but he doesn't have a choice. Giving up his life and everything he owns in Mexico, he commits himself to Zaiden and their new relationship. Luckily, he actually kind of likes the guy. Unfortunately, someone else does, too. Someone who's willing to do anything to remove Asher from the picture. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
