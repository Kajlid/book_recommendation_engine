To keep it safe, keep it with them forever, no matter how unrealistic that may seem.\" Jaime Williams is a typical girl. A Star Trek junkie, avid Beatles fan and proud sonic screwdriver owner, all she has ever wanted in her life was to find a place where she belongs. After years of searching high and low, Jaime has finally found just that in the small town of Heightway, Pennsylvania. However, when she and the economy get into a scuffle and her funds have all but dried up, Jaime fears she may have to bid farewell to the one place she ever truly called home. Even though Jaime has given up on herself, her friends have not. Moreover, they will do whatever it takes to keep Jaime in Heightway for good... whether she approves of it or not.",
