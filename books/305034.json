  "description": "Deranged devices and comic contraptions from the highly inventive and hilarious genius behind The Book of Bunny Suicides .Much like his hero, Renaissance man Leonardo da Vinci, bestselling author Andy Riley is not just an artist (or a liar)—he's an inventor. Imagine, if you • The easily assembled Pole-Dancing-Club-in-a-Briefcase for stranded businessmen• Christmas tree ornaments that provide surveillance to instantly tell Santa if you?ve been bad or good• A high-speed police response unit aptly named the Cop Catapult• The Arsehole Trap, which can clear an average size town of arseholes in a single day with its promise of Big Brother auditionsLike a twenty-first-century Rube Goldberg on the wrong mix of meds, in DIY Dentistry and Other Alarming Inventions  Andy Riley has created elaborate inventions that are often side-splittingly sociopathic and never short of patently hysterical.",
