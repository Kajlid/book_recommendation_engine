  "description": "Here is the tale of Godfrey de Montferrat, a young Templar knight who swore an oath to defend the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It is also the tale of that kingdom, which men called Outremer The Land Beyond the Sea. With the miraculous success of the First Crusade, all said that the heroic tales of old had come to life in that place. But by Godfrey s day the kingdom is dying, chivalry fading, and foes pressing hard from every side. But Godfrey stands in contradiction to the prevailing corruption. Where others strive to become mighty warlords and kings, Godfrey desires only to become a hero and a saint.Around Godfrey swirl the loves, betrayals, adventures, and disasters of the kingdom s waning years. From the desert wastes of Egypt, to the bustling streets of medieval Antioch, to the Holy City of Jerusalem itself, Nathan Sadasivan paints a vivid portrait of the Crusades strewn with unforgettable Amalric, the ill-tempered King of Jerusalem; Malik, the proud young Saracen; Jacques, Godfrey s childhood friend; Tristan, the single-minded swordmaster, and Andronicus, the enigmatic Byzantine prince, among many others.",
