  "description": "Eden dreamed. She dreamed of a man, one with liquid gold eyes. But when she meets Sahariel for the first time she can't help but wonder if she's going crazy. People can see him, but she can't see any colors swirl around him, not like they do with other people. Feeling irrevocably tied to him, she can't figure him out. Even with her own eccentricities, Eden thought she had finally become somewhat normal, but once he stepped into her life, everything was changed.",
