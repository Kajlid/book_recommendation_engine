  "description": "Private investigator Jack McPhee has a two-word business no partners. Rules are allegedly made to be broken, but Jack didn't expect that a contract to nab the so-called Calendar Burglar would force him to team up with a ten-pound, hyperactive Maltese.Or that as McPhee Investigations goes to the dogs, he'd fall deeply in-like with Dina Wexler, an undertall groomer, whose definition of a P.I. comes from watching w-a-a-y too many detective shows.Or that his absolutely genius idea to catch a thief would make him the prime—and only—suspect in a cold-blooded, diabolical homicide.",
