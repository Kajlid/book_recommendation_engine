  "description": "Why everyone LOVES Katie Ellison\n She's top of the class, she parties with the A-list she's bursting with talent - and she's got the kind of boyfriend any girl would kill to get their hands on. \nWhy everyone HATES Tommy Sullivan\n Four years ago he exposed the football team as cheats - and had to leave town, along with his family. But the graffiti branding him a freak still scares the gymnasium wall and no one has EVER forgotten. \nNow Tommy's back in town\n But he's very far from being a freak. In fact, Tom's hot - TOTALLY hot. And if Katie's not very careful he could ruin everything.",
