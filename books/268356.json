  "title": "The Indian Bride And Her Scarred Farmer",
  "description": "An Indian mail order bride is not what she sees herself as, and certainly not what he expects…  Ceeh'eenesie's whole family is dead. Her Arapaho way of life is dying. Sometimes Ceeh'eenesie wishes she could vanish as well.  But she has a promise to keep. Her dead grandfather wants her to go on, to carry on their ways. And being a mail order bride is her only way.  Until…  She discovers her late husband left her with a present: a baby in her belly.  Marshall Berkley hasn't seen any kin in years. When Marshall’s friend Michael Briggs tells him he's bringing him a bride, the last thing Marshall expects is an Indian.  One look at the Arapaho woman and he demands she be sent back to where she came from. But Michael pushes, and Marshall eventually relents. Somewhat.  Ceeh'eenesie can be his housekeeper, not his bride. And they won't become close. Ever. The last thing Marshall trusts is an Indian, and he has the scars on his face to show it.  Worse still, Ceeh'eenesie needs to tell Marshall about her secret child, especially with the summer's rising complications.  A federal agent arrives in town, bent on taking Ceeh'eenesie to the Indian reservation. Marshall then marries Ceeh'eenesie. Suddenly he finds that his own motivations have become increasingly confusing. All the while, the due date comes closer.  A secret Indian baby is on its way, and so is some of the greatest dangers Ceeh'eenesie and Marshall have ever faced.  How can a scarred Marshall let go of his past and embrace the present? How will Ceeh’eenesie manage her burden and love all at the same time?",
