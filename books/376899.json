  "title": "Smoke",
  "description": "Set in Baden-Baden, Smoke is Ivan Turgenev's most cosmopolitan novel. It is an exquisite study of politics and society and an enduringly poignant love story. Smoke, with its European setting, barbed wit, and visionary call for Russia to look west, became the center of a famous philosophical breach between Turgenev and Dostoevsky.",
