But when Damon shifts in front of her, she begins to doubt everything she’s known to be true.On the run from the rogues, Ava and Damon can’t ignore the red hot passion between them. But Damon knows it can’t last. Will he sacrifice everything he’s ever known to have the one thing he’s never meant to have?
