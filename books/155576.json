  "title": "The Prince of Prophecy Vol. I: Destined",
  "description": "Thirteen-year-old Prince Destan Von Diederich does not want to be king. In fact, he's terrified of the idea. Though, being that he's the last remaining descendant of the Von Diederich family line, it's not like he has much of a choice. All he wants is a bit of freedom and maybe even a little adventure. However, Destan soon finds out that with adventure comes risk. Between dodging his cruel cousin, searching for rings of power, being bothered by pesky authors, and helping a mysterious queen, Destan realizes that being a hero isn't all that it's cracked up to be. In his quest to find the pluck to take on his impending duties and adversaries, he is swept away into a world filled with magic and fairy tales-things he thought only existed in books. Will he find the courage he so desires, or will he remain valour-less, losing everything-including himself-in its pursuit?",
