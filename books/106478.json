As Hayley polishes off her Building Blocks of DNA speech, an idea hits her: Use the hot, visiting royal prince in her demonstration. Stand close to his highness—the untouchable. Go over his traits. Touch him. Win the crowd. Stomp all over Trallwyn Prep. Yes!No.The more she talks, the closer she comes to exposing a hurricane-sized secret--the stunning Irish prince may not be a prince at all. In fact, a fellow Trallwyn High School senior may be the true heir to the throne.Saying, “I’m sorry” isn’t enough. Not for Prince Callum and not for the danger she’s brought down on her team. Hayley will have to visit Ireland to discover the truth. Ireland: a land of tragic trinities, ancient artifacts, and time travel. Time Travel with a Prince! When she lands in medieval Ireland, getting the truth comes in second to getting home.",
