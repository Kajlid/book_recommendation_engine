  "description": "From the moment she stepped foot in the ominous and towering Gerard House, Constance Beechum sensed an evil chill that was far more deadly than the frigid blasts that had buffeted her on her way to Castine, Maine. She couldn’t turn back. She had left nothing behind, not even a life-line. Her uncle had found her a job caring for the old and dying Lady Elizabeth Gerard. Although she hadn’t an ounce of experience in nursing or caring for the ill, Constance had no choice but to accept the offer. She was penniless. Once she meets Lady Gerard’s two sons, Edward and Roger, and Edward’s wife, Catherine, she becomes more certain that there was danger in Gerard House. The Gerard’s had left no doubt that she was unwelcome. Constance could not know then that she had become a stumbling block to their evil intentions. They had no desire to wait for Lady Gerard to die. And now Constance, and her discovery of a long hidden secret, presented a new threat. But she had found the woman of her dreams, a true love in the face of evil, and she was determined to fight any obstacle to keep that love.",
