  "description": "Follow Edward as he dies and gets reincarnated into another world, but unlike your average isekai, his reincarnation goes awry in an unexpected, eldritch way. Now he is in a new world far unlike our own, and with the body of a weak eldritch abomination, but still has the mind of his human self. He must now use his strange new abilities to gain power, potentially start an occult following, and most importantly; ascend above all those around him.",
