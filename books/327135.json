Sam wants life to be the way it is in books – one meaningful moment after the other – so exchanging the country for the city on the eve of a new millennium presents a wonderful world of possibility. Sex, drugs, sport, a new circle to move in, plus a chance to make money doing something he loves: his fresh start offers it all.But reality soon becomes more potboiler than literary masterpiece, and Sam finds himself re-examining the books that have inspired him. Perhaps there he can find what he needs to be 'good at life' before his own spirals completely out of control.",
