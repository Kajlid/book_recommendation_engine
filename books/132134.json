  "description": "This is the first story in the 'Breaking' Series. Elizabeth has always been more at home breaking steers and branding cattle than in the house cooking and cleaning but her father is pushing her to settle down and get married to the man of his choosing. But what happens when she falls in love with a man who is completely off limits? Brody Atkinson isn't looking for love and he certainly isn't looking for any more life and death struggles but that's exactly what he finds when he meets Elizabeth McCready and the two of them uncover a plot to steal her ranch.",
