The only problem is, Holly is neither of those two things. Disaster seems to follow Holly wherever she goes and this time, it's in the shape of The Christmas Ruiner; a smug stranger who appears at the worst of times, taking the last of everything Holly needs to impress her family. Cue her best-friend Shawn; knight in shing amour and all-round Good Guy. Even though he's made it perfectly clear that they are just friends, the lines between friends and something more are becoming blurred. The more time they spend together, the more Holly can't ignore her feelings. Can Holly pull off the impossible to put on the perfect Christmas, and capture the heart of the man of her dreams?In this feel-good Christmas rom com set against a sweltering Australian summer, Holly learns that the less perfect life looks, the more perfect life feels. A HEA, friends to lovers trope, that will leave you laughing into your Christmas pudding.",
