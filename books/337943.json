  "description": "Tracking her was easy. Staying out of her bed—that's the hard part. On the run from her past and her overprotective brother, Ellie has had a taste of freedom—and likes it. Nothing can make her go home. Not even when the man she's always longed for shows up to drag her there. His wicked grins and irresistible dimples won't work. But she knows something else about Luke: He doesn't give up easily. Luckily, Ellie's not above resorting to naughty tactics. Seduction, she's certain, will make him so uncomfortable he won't be able to flee fast enough. And boy, is it going to be fun. The last thing Luke expects is for his best friend's sister to launch an erotic assault. He'll go along with her sexy games, but he's sure that when things get too hot, she'll come to her senses and come home. Except resisting her isn't as easy as he thought it'd be. And suddenly he's wondering if maybe there can be more than one winner in this dance of seduction. Warning, this title contains the following: explicit sex, graphic language",
