  "description": "From the Bestselling author...Zack Hartley opened a book store. One with a little cafe in the back, and a very special travel agency on the side. One that take people absolutely anywhere. Now he just has to get his life together while everything else in his world falls apart. It will mean wrangling overly enthusiastic Succubi, Mages and Vampires, as well as members of the general public and the local police force. Worst of all, his relatives. If he fails, then he dies. If he succeeds... Well, then he still probably dies. Who could resist odds like that? Not someone that doesn't get a choice in the matter. If Zack can hang on long enough, maybe he'll learn to become something more than anyone thought he could be? That's the plan. If he can pull it off.",
