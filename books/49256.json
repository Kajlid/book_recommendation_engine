Instead she finds Colin, who looks tough but treats her tenderly, despite her protests.He tempts her, but kindness and a few mindblowing orgasms aren't enough to put her back together again. Two years ago her best friend betrayed her in the worst possible way; she'd be stupid to trust a man again. Especially one like Colin, whose criminal past threatens them both.When her rapist returns, Allie must fight for the man she loves--and her life--hoping her newfound power will be enough to save them all.",
