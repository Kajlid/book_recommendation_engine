  "description": "The Dark Sorceress and her companions in the Otherworlds have decided to get rid of the mages once and for all. She targets Kara, who is particularly vulnerable to evil fairy magic since she is related to the Dark Sorceress. To save herself, Kara and her fellow mages, Emily and Adriane, must embark on a dangerous mission. They must go to the Otherworlds and retrieve the stolen power crystals of Avalon before it's too late. Dark Mage is the eleventh book in Web of Magic , a twelve-book fantasy series by Rachel Roberts for middle grade readers. During their magical journeys, the teenage heroines discover who they really are... and run into plenty of good guys, bad guys, and cute guys. Never completed before, Seven Seas is proud to present the beginning of the never seen before conclusion to Web of Magic.",
