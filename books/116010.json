  "description": "WARNING: This is a book of sick and twisted humor. It's offensive and not for the squeamish or the faint of heart. If you are a sensitive person or easily offended, this is not the book for you.\"Horrible Things\" is a nauseatingly clever collection of 101 cartoon inventions never meant for TV. Famed cartoonist Sam Gross refers to these cartoons as \"Insane\" but we like to think of them as sick and twisted. There are early signs of controversy with this title.Examples of these mad inventions include Salad on a Stick, Giant Hairy Fruit and the Edible Goiter.The book is intended for adults with a juvenile sense of humor and juveniles with an adult sense of humor.Readers of Mad and Cracked Magazine will surely enjoy this disturbingly witty book.",
