  "description": "In small Mercy, North Carolina, a group of influential women-the Mercy Study Club-decide to remove \"undesirable\" books from the school library. It was supposed to be easy. But they hadn't planned on Antigone Brown, a woman who has trouble reading road signs, keeps a stone in her pocket to help her remember right from left, and despairs of ever being a good mother to her unborn child. As she is quick to tell you, she is no hero. But now she will have to face her greatest fear to save the town's books.",
