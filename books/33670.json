  "description": "Collected in 1899 by Epiphanius Wilson, the works in this text are words of praise to the one unknown God, illustrating the spiritual connection between peoples spanning across continents and centuries. This volume includes hymns from the Hindu Vedas, thought to be the oldest sacred texts in the world; the Avesta of the Zoroastrians, from pre-Christian Middle East; the Dhammapada, transcribed words of the Buddha given to provide guidance to men; excerpts from the Upanishads, Indian scriptures meditating on the philosophy and nature of God; selections from the Koran, the words God spoke to the prophet Mohammed that formed the foundation of Islamic faith; and the poetic story of the life of Buddha. Seen together in one place, these holy writing beautifully illustrate the passion of the rich, worshipful tradition of the lands of the East.",
