  "description": "I spent ten years forgetting Wilder Flint, and it took every minute.I should have known better than to fall for his shallow charms and deep blue eyes, but I was good at calculus and bad at understanding people.He shredded my heart to pieces, but I moved away, grew up, and got over him. At least, I thought I did.Of course he shows up again in my new life. He’s got the same eyes, the same cocky grin, and a brand-new swagger that makes me weak in the knees.I’ve got a summer research project in the Arctic and three canceled flights. Wilder’s got a plane.But when we crash deep in the middle of nowhere, all we’ve got is each other.I've spent ten years hating Wilder for what he did to me back then.I don't know if I can forgive him. I don't know how to forgive him.But that doesn’t mean I can resist him.After all, love and hate aren’t so different.The Savage Wild is a high-heat standalone romance. It's for fans of survival romance, enemies who become lovers, heroes who grovel, and anyone who likes a little pining. The hero is a rugged, outdoorsy bush pilot who's former military, and the heroine is the dorky scientist who has no choice but to trust him even though he broke her heart. It's a steamy, sweet story, and of course there's an HEA!",
