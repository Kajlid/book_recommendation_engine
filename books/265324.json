  "description": "The dazzling short story collection by music legend Jimmy Buffett inspired by his real life.Margaritaville may not appear on a map, but it does exist—at least in the brilliantly creative, sometimes slightly skewed imagination of Jimmy Buffett. Tales from Margaritaville is a collection of short stories (some purely fiction, some based in truth) so vividly packed with restless dreamers, wild wanderers, and pure gypsy souls that just reading it is a wild adventure. Travel along with a cowboy named Tully Mars, as he heads from Heartache, Wyoming, to Graceland, and relive the autobiographical odyssey of a third-generation sailor and first-rate musical outlaw. With unforgettable stories that present the true roamer's twin loves—the sea and the road—Tales from Margaritaville is one \"smooth sailing book of infinite imagination\" (Chicago Sun-Times).",
