  "title": "Wonder: A Soul Savers Collection of Short Stories: Part 1 - Thanksgiving",
  "description": "This first part of the Wonder collection of short stories brings three New Adult Paranormal tales to the Thanksgiving table. Amity Baby vampire Mindy yearns for a traditional Thanksgiving feast, but her efforts result in disaster after disaster. Can she come to terms with what she is and learn new ways to celebrate? Or will her determination to hang onto the old traditions end up killing her own family? Belonging At sixteen years old, Rissa was kicked out of her house by her stepfather, bitten by a werewolf and infected so she’d become one herself. She hasn’t had a single thing to be grateful for in the six years since. When a handsome-as-the-devil college guy frees her from a trap, she knows she should leave him immediately, but she can’t bring herself to. Is he truly as nice as he seems and can he really give her a sense of belonging? Or is she setting herself up for the worst shock since her first full moon as a wolf? Gratitude Fresh off the battlefield, Alexis, Tristan, and the Soul Savers crew struggle to enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner, especially when a Daemoni attack ruins everything. When it’s all over, can they find a single blessing to count or is that too much to ask in this time of war? Meet new characters and revisit your favorites from the world of the bestselling Soul Savers Series by Kristie Cook. This is the first of a three-part collection, with Christmas and New Year’s coming November 2013.",
