Of course, as always, I said yes to her. Like always, I'd do anything to make her happy. And, okay, maybe I thought If we pretended to be together, she'd realize how amazing we could be and forget about the pact. Instead, I'm more in love with her than ever and have no idea if she'll ever allow herself to see me as more than her best friend.KailaThis is fine. It's all fine. We're just fake dating.
