  "description": "It was a master stroke to redress the balance of the war.  What if the Third Reich could own the night?  What if they had a Division of Vampires?  And if those Vampires didn't stop?  If they had plans to conquer the whole world?  Even Heinrich Himmler hadn't thought of that.  But in Transylvania someone had.  And on the Winter Solstice of 1944, the world would be at their mercy.",
