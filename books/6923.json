  "description": "The X-Men event of the decade is right here! It's never been a more dangerous time to be a mutant. Even with their numbers at a record low, the world refuses to trust mutantkind. And after a mutant-triggered international incident, anti-mutant hatred hits new heights. Of course it's at this moment, when the mutant race most needs to stand together, that a split begins that will tear apart the very foundation of the X-Men. From superstar writer and Marvel Architect Jason Aaron and a full roster of comics' top artists, this is an X-tale that will reverberate for years to come! When the dust settles, the X-Men landscape will be irreparably changed. Collecting: X-Men: Schism 1-5, Generation Hope 10-11, & X-Men: Regenesis",
