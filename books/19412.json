  "description": "Every Christmas Eve, the Master puts out rice pudding for the tomtes to say thank you for their help around the house throughout the year. But recently the Master has forgotten, and Mama tomte knows he'll forget again this year. The elves hatch a plot to steal a bowl of Christmas pudding, without being seen, so that Papa tomte doesn't get upset. This charming story is based on an old Swedish Christmas tradition. It is illustrated with great humor and is full of delightful detail, as the tomte family scurry around their Master's house one busy Christmas Eve.",
