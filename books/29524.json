  "description": "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, bestselling author, and Wheel of Fortune contestant Dave Barry exposes the shattering truth. Whether he's splashing with the U.S. sychronized swim team (\"Picture a bunch of elegant swans swimming with a flailing sea cow\") or reliving the Pilgrims' first Thanksgiving (\"We've decided to obliterate your culture, but first may we try the stuffing?\"), Dave Barry proves that one man can make a difference--by having the guts to answer the questions few people bother to ¸  What makes people want to eat animals they would never consider petting?¸  Where do the World's Three Most Boring People meet?¸  Why is Colorado freezing so many human gonads?¸  And just how does Oprah have the power to turn a 1957 Hotpoint toaster manual into a #1 bestseller?",
