  "description": "Alex Sheppard likes certain things: sex, parties, and the occasional fight to let off steam. But his wild ways catch up with him when he is put on football probation due to his lacking grade point average. When Mary Trellis offers to tutor him in exchange for a date to her sister's wedding, Alex sees it as an easy ride. She's smart, hot, and all she wants in return is one weekend of his company. Of course, nothing is as easy as it seems.When Mary propositioned the tattooed and pierced bad boy, Alex, she didn't realize what she was getting herself into. He has a habit of being vulgar and obscene, but she still wants him. It isn't until they are alone that Mary realizes refusing Alex what he wants—her—is easier said than done.",
