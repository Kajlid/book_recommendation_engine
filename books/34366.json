  "description": "Macie never questioned her belief in angels. As a good Catholic girl, she's read the Bible stories, she wears the guardian angel pin her grandma sends her at Christmas, and she sees them on stained glass and statues pretty much everywhere she turns. So why is she so shocked when the stunning new guy at school asks her if she truly believes?Elijah Strazar is the exact opposite of angelic. Mohawked, pierced, tattooed, and too sexy to handle, Macie takes one look at Elijah and decides that he's trouble she needs to stay far away from. But his rebellious outer appearance hides a startling truth; Elijah is a Nephilim, half man, half angel. And he's waited years and traveled miles to find Macie.Suddenly Macie finds herself caught in the middle of a violent angel war on Earth, and it's up to her to save Elijah from a brutal group of vengeful Grigori angels. But is she strong enough to accept her fate? And will her best efforts be enough to save the half man, half angel she's falling in love with?Mature/Older YA",
