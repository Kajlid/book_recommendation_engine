  "description": "CIG boss Ursula Frei asks Aeron for help to prevent a group of children in the Caprock Academy from becoming victims to a life that created the same deep scars Frei herself bears. But this personal request is complicated by Aeron’s dimming powers as a consequence of her actions for healing her mentor Renee. Although Aeron enjoys the respite from her burdens, she is forced to fake a vision, not realizing her mother, Lilia, has the same vision and ultimately allows the CIG team to get involved in the mission. Unfortunately, Aeron’s vision sees them rescuing the children and walking away stronger, and her mother sees the three agents implode and their mission unravel under the weight of secrets, misunderstandings, and hurt feelings. But Lilia has faith in Aeron, Frei, and Renee and still believes they can get the children out safely . . . even if it means one of the team gets left behind.",
