  "title": "The Red Jester: Andrei Bely's \"Petersburg\" As A Novel Of The European Modern (1)",
  "description": "What was Andrei Bely's aim in his ambiguous novel Petersburg? For the first time, this study firmly places Bely's work at the heart of the European Modern (die Moderne). The book argues that the novel - with its concern for the spiritual and its desire to create new aesthetics - helped reshape fundamental views of reality, of the Self, and of consciousness. Theories of Freud and Jung, as well as the aesthetics of the Viennese Secession, are used to elucidate Bely's approach to the narrative. The book also presents Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy as the prism through which Bely reflects modernist ideas. ( Slavistik - Vol. 1)",
