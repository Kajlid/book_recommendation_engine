  "description": "Valko can see the last moments of a victim’s life.It comes at a price - a scrap of flesh cut from his brain and replaced with an implant. Bound to a drug that lets him use his insight but brings with it the pain of synthetic emotion, he’s at war with himself.Now a killer has found a way to hide from him and two people are dead. Someone wants to keep their secrets buried. The trail leads out into the wasteland where death flies on the wind as nanotech dust. Manipulated and betrayed, Valko must get to the truth before his time runs out.If he only knew who to trust maybe he'd have a chance, but a man with an artificial soul can’t even trust himself…",
