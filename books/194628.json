  "description": "Gödel, Escher, Bach was a major literary event, a winner of the Pulitzer Prize and a best-seller. With Metamagical Themas, Dr Hofstadter has produced an equally remarkable book. No other writer can draw on such an extraordinary range of topics, and, with sudden shafts of insight, show how they interconnect. These brilliant essays (mostly from Scientific American, but previously unpublished) look at chaos and Chopin, grammar and genetics, racism and Rubik’s cube, and countless other subjects. From all this, Hofstadter makes a rich tapestry and throws startling new light on his central theme: how people – and machines – think and feel.",
