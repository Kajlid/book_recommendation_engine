  "description": "It's not easy growing upâ€”as a gay suburban teenager in the 80's. It's even harder when the crush you have on a major British pop star becomes reality. Steven Carlisle and Hayden Whitfield come from two completely different worlds. Steven is a teenager growing up in Orange County, grappling with his sexuality and identity in high school. Hayden is a major English pop star, trying to find acceptance and validation through his music. From the moment they meet, when Steven wins backstage passes to one of Hayden's concerts, an undeniable connection is created between the two; a connection that lasts eighteen years, evolving from letters into a wonderful, often tumultuous relationship. XOXO Hayden is the story of a suburban teenager's journey from adolescence into adulthood and the rise and fall of a mighty pop star and the indelible impression he leaves behind.",
