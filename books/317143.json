  "description": "The farm boy next door would have been perfect for me…if not for the arrangement he’s made that’s standing in our way.Everything in my life is falling apart, and following a brutal thunderstorm, that includes my patio. A girl in my situation has nothing to lose, but as it turns out, accepting the help from a cocky, smug, shamefully hot farm boy to repair my property can actually make things worse.Because Matthew is dangerously much more than a dexterous man providing me with creative inspiration. He’s also my dirty little fantasy. And completely off-limits. Because he struck a deal with my neighbor: take her daughter’s hand in marriage, and she’ll save his family’s plantation - an offer that will be off the table if he changes his mind.Falling for a man who’s spoken for is a fool’s errand, and it’s not on my agenda to get my heart broken a second time. So all I can do is wait until his work for me is done, and then cut all ties.But my dirty fantasy soon turns into a cruel nightmare when he sneaks into my room and catches me with my hands down my pants. Either I’ll marry the guy, or I’ll die of humiliation. Better to start digging my grave, I guess.",
