  "description": "Since Mike Mignola’s Hellboy first hit the stands in 1993, it has become a cultural sensation, racking up a dozen Eisner Awards and inspiring numerous spinoffs, from a novel line, to video games, to feature films. Now, Dark Horse is pleased to present the comics that started it all, collected in deluxe hardcover editions. Sized at 9\" by 12\", and handsomely bound to match The Art of Hellboy hardcover, each volume contains two full story-arcs — the equivalent of two trade-paperbacks. Each volume of the Hellboy Library Editions also includes extensive supplemental materials, including previously unreleased sketches and designs.Hellboy Library Edition Volume 1 collects the first two story-arcs — Seed of Destruction and Wake the Devil — with the original introductions by Robert Bloch and Alan Moore and expanded Mignola sketchbook sections.",
