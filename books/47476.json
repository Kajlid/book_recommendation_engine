  "title": "Wrecked: When a Broken World Slams into your Comfortable Life",
  "description": "What happens when a broken world slams into your comfortable life? Wrecked is about the life we are afraid to live. It’s about radical sacrifice and selfless service—how we find purpose in the midst of pain. It's a look at how we discover fulfillment in the least likely of places. It's about living like we mean it. It’s a guide to growing up and giving your life away, helping you live in the tension between the next adventure and the daily mundane. This book is for us—a generation intent on pursuing our life's work in a way that leaves us without regrets. Author Jeff Goins shares his own experience of struggling as a missionary and twentysomething who understands the call to live radically while dealing with the everyday responsibilities of life. Wrecked is a manifesto for a generation dissatisfied with the status quo and wanting to make a difference.",
