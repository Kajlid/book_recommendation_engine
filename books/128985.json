  "description": "2014 GOLD Readers' Favorite for Mystery/MurderLex Allen, Reviewer for Readers' Favorite International Book \"One often reads blurbs and reviews that talk about “fast paced”, “edge of your seat suspense” or “I couldn’t put it down.” In some cases these phrases are a bit exaggerated; in the instance of Vengeance is Mine by Harry James Krebs these phrases become understatements. This murder-mystery suspense thriller is among the very best I’ve read so far this year.\"***Driven by a traumatic, violent event in his teenage years, Benjamin Tucker, a true crime author and amateur detective, is obsessed with solving crimes near his home turf of Holly Springs, North Carolina. When a series of decapitated female victims is found in neighboring communities, he is helplessly drawn in to the investigation. The hunt for the killer becomes personal and Tucker isn’t sure if he’s become the killer’s idol or his next victim.",
