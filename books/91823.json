  "description": "The first of the new stand-alone books that are the parallel books to the Z is for Zombie series. Students are trapped in their school and find that the zombies are not nearly as dangerous as their peers. The teens, trapped in the building, must make it safe to stay in, but at the same time, deal with continuing peer pressure, violence among those trapped, flesh eaters, and concerns about their own families and the world itself. Great reading for anyone who recalls their high school trials and tribulations (with flesh eaters thrown in)",
