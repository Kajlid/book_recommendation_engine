  "description": "?Why do you have to nag so much?? Dad yelled across the living room at Mom. ?You know the divorce is final, and this is the last time we will do anything together as a family, so just let it alone!? My heart squeezed as the power of Dad?s words rang out clear through the walls and thrust daggers at my chest. Feeling dizzy, I grabbed for the bedpost and quickly surveyed my best friends? eyes all wide with surprise, as they heard, just like me, this shocking news for the very first time. I wanted to run and scurry into the nearest hole. But before going down, I took a long deliberate breath and struggled to display my last ounce of courage. Having just shared her dreams and plans with friends, of racing her horse Medallion up the bluebonnet covered hills near her beloved home, Becky?s birthday celebration comes to an abrupt halt. Triggered by the announcement of her parents? divorce, her peaceful life begins to collapse one step at a time like a shaky row of dominos all lined up and destined to fall. Becky must then find the courage to reach beyond herself for the help both she and her palomino will need to survive.",
