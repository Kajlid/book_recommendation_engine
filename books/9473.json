  "title": "Captain Swing and the Electrical Pirates of Cindery Island",
  "description": "From the sparking-mad mind of Warren Ellis, the creator of TRANSMETROPOLITAN and PLANETARY, comes an electrical romance of a pirate utopia thwarted! In the London of 1830, newly-minted copper Charlie Gravel keeps seeing things he's not supposed a crooked Bow Street Runner with a flintlock revolver, high-flying vessels that are not supposed to fly, and the violent Scientific Phantasmagoria popularly known as Spring-Heeled Jack. With the coming of Captain Swing and his Electrical Pirates, history shall never be the same! This crackling new graphic novel is illustrated by Raulo Caceres in a stunning woodcut style, capturing the classic literary feel from days of yore.",
