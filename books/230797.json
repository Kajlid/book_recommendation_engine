  "description": "After losing his parents as a teenager, Dane has learned to keep things simple. He’s happy with the life he’s built for himself, a life filled with easy girls, good times with his brother, and a job he loves. There’s nothing missing.  Until he meets her.  Lily has learned the hard way that nothing in life is free. And she’s flat-out broke – in every possible way. With her head down, she keeps to the shadows and lets life pass her by. All that matters is putting one more day safely behind her.  Until he’s lifting her chin.  Suddenly, nothing is safe or simple, and soon the walls they’ve been hiding behind begin to crumble. But to what end? Dane is definitely no one’s hero, and Lily is surely no one’s prize. Yet somehow they’re exactly what the other needs.  Just when they think they’ve got it all figured out, Lily’s past comes calling. That one last price life’s been trying to exact from her? It’s about to come due.  18+ The Penny Books are not standalones.
