  "description": "Evil cannot take hold of an unconsenting soul.Do not be amazed that hell is empty, since all the devils live here.One by one, they will meet their hellish fate.One down…Three to go.EastonA tyrannous society has discovered our most atrocious secret and decided to wage war on us.They’ve had their fun with Finn, and now it’s my turn to be their little puppet.Someone should have warned them that I don’t play well with others.If they think I’m going to bend over and let them screw with my life sans lube, they are sorely mistaken.I’m no man’s pawn.At least that’s what I told myself right up to the day I received a little black envelope that mercilessly sealed my fate—they’ve gone after the one person I would sacrifice anything for. My friends.Myself.Even her.ScarlettThey call him the dark prince of Asheville, a silvered eyed rebel without just cause for his defiance.But to me, Easton Price is so much more than the mischievous persona he openly flaunts.He’s the beautiful nightmare I desperately try to resist with clenched teeth and scarred heart.As the pastor’s niece, I’m considered the epitome of good, while he’s the embodiment of sin.There’s just one thing wrong with that assumption—I’m not that good.And Easton is going out of his way to prove it.*The Society is an Enemies to Lovers, New Adult College Romance.*Each book may be read as a standalone. However, all four books in this series have an entwined subplot, which will only be resolved in the final book. Therefore it is highly recommended that this series be read in its entirety for full enjoyment.*Recommended 18+ due to mature language and situations.",
