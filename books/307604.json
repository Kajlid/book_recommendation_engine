  "description": "LucasMy dreams of making it to the big league had finally come true,But one wild night in a strip club which was clearly a mistakeLanded me squarely on the team’s bad boy list. The PR manager is supposed to smooth it all over,Too bad all I wanted was to get in trouble with her. I wasn’t really the playboy they thought I was, I just needed to find the right woman to set me straight. Now I just have to prove I’m not what she thought.CarmenI have the career I’ve always dreamed of,Even if I have to deal with players who can’t seem to keep out of the news. What’s more infuriating is the one player I want to hate the most I can’t stop thinking about. The one whose voice makes me want to drop my panties at his feet. I know all about his playboy ways, But I also know the press can spin things to fit their narrative. Is he really as innocent as he claims to be? Or will he throw a screw ball I never saw coming?",
