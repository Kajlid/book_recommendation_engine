  "description": "What do Postman Pat, Tommy Cooper, Norman Wisdom, and George Best have in common with being abandoned in a Costa Rican jungle after a severe bout of flatulence? Indeed how are they connected to trying to buy an Australian brewery just to get a beer, owning twenty-two cars, an American soccer team, and Swiss mail-order pornography? I suppose we have to come clean and volunteer the name of a certain keyboard genius called Mr. Richard Wakeman. That said, you'll then not be surprised that this second volume of wondrous stories elaborates on violinists falling out of trees, being mauled on live TV by a German shepherd, playing golf with kangaroos, amputations sound-tracked by prog rock classics, a concert played to a solitary canine, and signing autographs on the toilet. The Further Adventures of a Grumpy Old Rock Star takes you, oh privileged reader, on a trip of absurd excess, a cultural car crash of side-splitting hilarity, and an unforgettable glimpse into the life of one of Britain's most legendary showmen, rock stars, and all-time great raconteurs.",
