A furious force unleashed in vengeance, the Storm’s destruction would rage across the kingdom if not for me.Day after day, I survive its wrath, taking the lightnings strikes, the icy needles of rain, and absorbing its deadly force, stopping its fury.Through it all, I bury my memories, and force myself to forget the promise I made, denying what I want most.My heart…Now, Baelen Rath has returned, wearing the scars of battle, and vowing to fight for me.He burns through the walls I’ve built around my heart, drawing me in, body and soul.But the closer he gets to me, the clearer it becomes that he has secrets he didn’t have before.So do I.Because the Storm is changing and its power is growing.Like the fire Baelen ignites within me, soon it will be beyond my control.Content information: Storm Princess 1 is the first book in a complete romantasy trilogy.
