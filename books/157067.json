As reality unravels and exposes truths about her family that should have remained deep under the mountain, Keahilani must either resist the call of her blood or risk losing everything to its darkness.When Keahilani’s family is threatened, the only cure for her hot-blooded fury is a loaded clip with a body bag chaser.",
