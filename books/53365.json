  "description": "Jason Mondy's world is unraveling. His seemingly secure job as a fire fighter is suddenly thrown into chaos. The bright spot in his week is that he rescued two children from a house fire, but he returns home that night to find all his furniture is missing. His girlfriend has left him without warning and his nightmares keep him from sleeping. Even just a simple trip home to find some rest leads his adoptive mother to sit him down and tell him that maybe his troubles aren't quite as innocuous as they seem. Then she divulges a secret she's kept for over twenty-six years . . . Jason has a brother he doesn't remember existed. He doesn't remember his life before he was adopted at age seven. He only knows that he was rescued from the fire that took his birth mother's life. But the story is deeper than that, and the foundation on which he built his world is now cracking. The brother he doesn't remember it out there somewhere, left behind. Armed with only this stunning new piece of information, Jason embarks on a quest to find the truths buried deep in his past. As he searches, one by one the pieces of his life fall like dominoes. And the more he uncovers, the more everything he thought he knew about himself and his past begins to turn to ash. His truth isn't true at all . . .",
