Determined to escape such a fate, she stows away on one of His Majesty’s frigates. But a woman alone is in constant danger.To Lieutenant Treynor, honor means everything.… Born a bastard to a wayward marquise, Lieutenant Crawford Treynor was given to a poor farmer to raise and was maltreated until he ran away to join the Royal Navy.
