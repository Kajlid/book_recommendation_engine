  "description": "A teen guardian angel's personal account about the funny side of the afterlife. As if the devil’s food cake at her wake and the white fat pants she’s stuck wearing for eternity weren’t bad enough, fourteen-year-old Gabby is quick to discover that Cirrus, the main rung of Heaven, is a far cry from the Pearly Gates. Here, SkyFones and InnerNets are all the rage. Gabby thinks it can’t get any worse until she finds out she has to protect Angela, her school nemesis, in order to move up through the training levels of heaven. Problem is, Angela is now hitting on Gabby's should-have-been boyfriend. (awkward!) Instead of protecting Angela, Gabby pranks her (since when is sticking toilet paper a shoe a sin?) with the hopes of cooling off the new couple. At first the pranks seem harmless, until the school dance sabotage gets completely out of control. Then her Celestial Sky Agent, who happens to have anger management issues of his own, puts Gabby on probation, threatening her eternal future. Determined to right her wrongs, Gabby steals an ancient artifact that allows her to return to Earth for just one day. Her well-meaning mission shifts the very foundation of Cirrus, Earth, and every place in between, causing the dangers of the dark side to roam free. Without knowing, Gabby kicks off a series of celestial events and learns what can happen when you hate someone to death. On the Bright Side is a hilarious road to guardian angeldom paved with so much drama and due-paying that it makes school look painless.",
