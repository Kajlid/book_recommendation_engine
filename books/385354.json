  "description": "\"Collecting Candace\" is a dark, visceral mind trip and road trip about faith, hope, desperation, murder, regret, guilt, penance…the spirituality of want. These are the conflicts played out in the mind of one man as he struggles to string together the lost pieces of the woman he loves — the endearing bad habits, idiosyncrasies, things that only a lover could appreciate. He knows that with each telling of a childhood memory, or a private joke, the spirit of her was spread more thinly. Every time she lost her temper or lay vulnerable in a lover’s arms, she gave up more of the only stuff that could catch a man, and keep him forever. Believing true love possible only when the whole of a woman is present, when her essence has been recaptured and returned, he embarks on a journey to each of Candace’s ex-husbands, to visit his beliefs upon them and retake the pieces of her that had been left, unknowingly, in their possession. A haunting look at the Underneath of Love, \"Collecting Candace\" is a frightening, violent and sorrowful show of one man’s desperation to learn love. \"Collecting Candace\" is Brook’s second novel. She has been named as one of “the best new voices in fiction published by independent presses” (ForeWord Magazine).",
