  "description": "The Intuitionist, determined to find her past, reaches Alphatech—the research ground with twelve towers—everyone’s dreamland and the largest net for the school of fish. A deeper truth coils around it. Then there’s the Security Tower—always watching, constantly advising, with food in one hand and whip in the other. The search for her past takes the Intuitionist to look for the Equation of God, a research banned for everyone except for the WSI, World Security Intelligence. They have secretly created the Sublime. Some call it the Doomsday Machine; others whisper it’s the Eye of God.They make her sleep for looking into banned books. So she moves on her path, stepping along the Oldest Dance, and the universe takes her towards what the Mesmerizer has predicted she will want someday—the Source. But first, she must fight the Mind World and untie the knots placed on her brain while protecting things they threaten to take. She must find out how these all connect to her past. How did it begin with her source?Meanwhile, the Mesmerizer and the Monk are far ahead as the seekers of the Source. As they compete to find it first, they face trails from the Ones With Long Memories, leaving one of them stuck in a cave deep inside the earth. Will the universe favor them once more? Or will she shy away?",
