  "description": "When Elodie Peach joins our school's History department, her clear green eyes, joyous ways and swan-like neck enchant me as much as Anne Boleyn’s charms captivated Henry VIII five hundred years ago.Monday to Friday, I’m grumpy Mr Vaughan, Head of History. Zero personality, except when I’m teaching. So passionate about my field that my pupils bought me a highly inappropriate t-shirt last year.I HAVE A HARD-ON FOR REVISIONIST HISTORY, if you must know.It’s only on Saturdays, when I play Henry VIII at Hampton Court Palace for over-exuberant tourists, that I allow myself to channel a bit of His Majesty’s swagger. There's something about wearing both a crown and a codpiece that makes me feel invincible.At school, I stay the hell away from that Peach woman. Because nothing good can come from my obsession.But it’s when I make her my Anne Boleyn on Saturdays that the sparks fly.[Please note this book contains themes of infertility]",
