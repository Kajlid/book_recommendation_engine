As expected, he isn’t happy to be there.But there's another problem.My dark magic has bound us together, making our desires undeniable and putting us both in grave danger.Breaking the spell means losing the one thing I fought so hard to find.And I’m not sure I’m willing to lose my monstrous lover just yet.* Monstrous Bond is a standalone novella. *",
