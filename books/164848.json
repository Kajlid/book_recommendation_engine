They don't all talk and act the same and everything doesn't always go right for them; nor do they all survive. Characters are all forced to join one of the wide range of colorful and often violent factions. Some seek to establish a new kind of society, and take specific, detailed steps of their own design.Those who oversaw the ruin of the Country, led by the US President, are desperate to cling to any power they can. The POTUS illegally invites the United Nations to help Homeland Security disarm its citizens and restore order to the nation. Many of the independent minded souls of the Midwest see things differently. . .",
