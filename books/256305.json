  "description": "Sonichu is Christian Weston Chandler's official life work and magnum opus. To most, however, it is a poorly-drawn and written comic book about the adventures and travels that befall \"him\" and his (imaginary) friends. Despite starting out as a comic about the titular character, it quickly turned into a wish-fulfillment outlet for Chris and his depraved fantasies, with Sonichu being a main character in name only, playing second fiddle to Chris's primary Mary Sue self-insert.",
