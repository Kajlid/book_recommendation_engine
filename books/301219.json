  "description": "Life as a guardian isn’t for the weak. For the last few decades, I’ve been working alongside my two best friends Ryland and Oliver. We’re the top guardians in Arvayta, so it should have come as no surprise when we'er summoned to complete the deadliest of tasks. Darkness has taken over the dragon territory and it’s up to the three of us to stop it. Only the fates haven’t given us much information to go off and we have no idea what we’re walking into when we enter the Otherworld.There is no shortage of obstacles as we make our way through the treacherous landscapes, only to fall directly into the dragon’s lair. Except not everything is as I’ve always believed and there’s no room for second-guessing.It’s time to slay some dragons.",
