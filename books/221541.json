If not for White Lucas and his family, I might have been on the streets. They showed me what family was—what I always wanted. Now I'm nearing thirty, I want my own family. The problem is there’s no man in the picture. When White volunteers his services, I should say no. Making a baby with my best friend could ruin everything. Couldn’t it?  White:   Kayla is my best friend. She has been for fifteen years. In all that time I’ve never once thought of her as more than a buddy, a pal. Then something happened. We kissed. It was good. Really good. So good that now it’s all I can think about. When she hatches a crazy scheme to have a baby, it’s my duty to stop her. Right? And offering my uh…services is the least I can do. I’m just looking out for her. As any friend would do. Any red-blooded man who is frustrated and dying for more. She wants a baby? I’m there. With A Raging Heart On.   Complete Stand Alone with No cheating and a Happy Ending all inside. Book two of the Lucas Brothers series but can be read completely on its own and is self-contained.  WARNING: This book contains friends turning into lovers, a meddling mother who keeps trying to help them out, a whole lot of baby making and all the hotness that implies. Hope you enjoy!",
