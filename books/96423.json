  "description": "FIND THE GREEN BOOKCOUNT THE SPARROWS\nShy and anxious Nadine Harnois has spent her whole life living in the shadow of her older, prettier sister, Noelle. But when Noelle mysteriously vanishes just months after her fairytale wedding, Nadine gathers her courage to go to her brother-in-law's home in Argentum to seek answers.Caledon Cullraven, the family's youngest son, takes an immediate interest in her, becoming both her tormentor and her ally. But beneath his playful demeanor lurks something twisted and depraved, and as her reluctant attraction to him grows, so, too, does the potential for real danger.The Cullraven family legacy goes back for generations, with secrets that run as deep and as dark as the town's abandoned silver mines. The people of Argentum are suspicious and fearful of their town's reclusive benefactors, and possibly with good reason: because the more time Nadine spends with this family, the more she suspects that they're hiding something truly terrible.\n“You want to run, Nadine? Run to me.” \nThis book is a revised and expanded version of a title on Kindle Vella and contains episodes 1-22.",
