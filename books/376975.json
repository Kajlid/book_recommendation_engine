  "description": "Northanger Abbey! These were thrilling words, and wound up Catherine's feelings to the highest point of ecstasy.While staying in Bath, Catherine Morland meets Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor who invite her to their family estate. A fan of Gothic Romance novels, naive Catherine is soon letting her imagination run wild in the atmospheric abbey, fuelled by her friendship with the vivacious Isabella Thorpe. It is only when the realities of life set in that Catherine's fantastical world is shattered. A coming-of-age novel, Austen expertly parodies the Gothic Romance novels of her time and reveals much about her unsentimental view of love and marriage in the 18th century.",
