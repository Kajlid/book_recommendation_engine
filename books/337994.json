  "title": "Hungers",
  "description": "Hungers reads like an irresistible cluster of want ads, the bemused wanters themselves not entirely sure what they're wanting. Vancouver writer Genni Gunn's collection of stories, her second, is also a dogged pursuit of that treacherousprefix 're.' Gunn sends her characters chasing after reunion, revision, regreat and fumbled gestures at reconciliation. Spurred by enticing premises, these stories twang with the sadness of tawdry lives, yet they are not sad stories. You feel for Gunn's people and can't help but find admirable their ability to bounce, even in questionable directions.The pieces in Hungers run the gamut from snappy, almost surreal interludes on fear and love to the brilliant title story, which perhaps would have been better served published as a novella, unencumbered by its sister hits . . . Gunn, a musician, translator and poet, and author of two previous novels, including last year's much praised Tracing Iris, brings her full bag of tricks to bear on each story, with varied results.... Gunn's wonderfully quirky and rigorous imagination, her unquenchable curiosity, her poet-passion for the plasticity of language, her knack for twinning grit and intelligence, are alive and kicking in Hungers.--- The Globe & Mail",
