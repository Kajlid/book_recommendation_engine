  "description": "Becoming a sports reporter isn't just my dream job--it's my calling.I've been sketching the blueprint for my future since I was an overly ambitious ten-year-old: \n   Get accepted into Windhaven University's journalism program? Check.  \n   Score the sports section of the campus paper? Easy as pie.  \n   Snag a once-in-a-lifetime internship? Currently in progress. \nEverything's going according to plan...Until a wrench in the form of a blue-eyed bad boy is thrown into the mix.Vaughn Steel's the last athlete on Earth I want to interview for the most important article of my college career. He's unreliable. Impulsive. Has arrogance levels that have me ready to pull out my hair.Oh...and did I mention he's gorgeous as sin? A wet dream in the flesh.But so what?So what if the guy's a total stud? So what if he's got a body sculpted by the gods?So freakin' what if those electric eyes and lush lips have my insides doing backflips?All I've got to do is make it through one semester with this cocky soccer player. End the year with a kickass article in one hand and my sanity intact in the other. Then I'm done with him. For good.Easier said than done.",
