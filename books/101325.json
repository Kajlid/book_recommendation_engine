  "description": "There's A Code Even The NSA Can’t Crack…But Dillon Richard can. Dillon is a straight-arrow genius with Asperger’s syndrome. He’s never told a lie. He’s never been kissed. And he’s never had a quantum computer for cracking codes. Until now. In just a few days, Dillon will finish the software to crack the “unbreakable” code that banks and terrorists use to protect their most valuable secrets.Everybody’s going to want a piece of Dillon. The Mafia. The NSA. And his two beautiful co-workers.Who'll get him first?Double Vision is a hilarious geeky suspense novel about a guy who has no idea how attractive he is to women. In fact, he has no idea how women think at all.Dillon is terribly strait-laced, and he’s a bit shocked when he sees that his sexy co-worker Rachel doesn’t wear a bra. But he’s in for a bigger surprise when well-endowed Keryn shows him where she hid the quantum computer. Dillon is just a wee bit opinionated, and he can’t say a word without offending somebody with his thoughts on science, religion, national security, and the burning question of whether the multiverse is real. This is the second edition of Double Vision, thoroughly rewritten so that Dillon offends even more people than in the first edition.",
