  "description": "In the Royal States of America, magic rules all, but life—and love—always finds a way.  Latent horse empath. Dishwasher. Closet chef.  Future king.  When food poisoning sweeps through Dallas, Patrick Laycal doesn't expect a princess to show up at his door asking for his help.  Her one, simple request dumps him in the middle of a Royal mess—one that could cost him far more than just his life.  Storm Called features characters first introduced in Null & Void, the first of the Royal States novels.Alternate cover edition of ASIN B07MBV9D13.",
