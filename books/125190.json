  "description": "For everything there is an appointed time, even a time for every affair under the heavens.\nAfter thirteen years it’s time for Mac to return home to face a past he’s been running from. A past his best friend Dave has been unable to escape.It was 1990, their final year of school and with an INXS soundtrack, life was moving on. Bus stops, homework and football were giving way to pay slips and beer, to first cars and first loves. Until one night changed it all.As the story of that evening unravels, so too do the binds that cross generations of family. The pride of fathers. The love of mothers and a sister. The love of a mate; the prejudices that run deep. Testing them, and the strong social ties that small towns have, Mac searches for honesty and for the precious words never said, while Dave fights for his story to be heard.  \nBefore it’s too late, can these once-close friends and their town still divided by tragedy find a time for peace?",
