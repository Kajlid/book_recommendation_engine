  "description": "pTen childhood snapshots from the master of the monologue#58; p A STRIP OF BLUE, PROPER NAMES, OUR WAR, EATING OUT, AN IDEAL HOME, AUNT EVELINE, A SHY BUTCHER, UNSAID PRAYERS, DAYS OUT, NO MEAN CITY p Following on from the phenomenal success of Writing Home, Alan Bennett reminisces about his early years #8211; from his schooldays to undergraduate life at Oxford University. p It was an ordinary childhood #8211; growing up in Leeds taught Alan early on that #8216;life is generally something that happens elsewhere#8217;. Yet the children who long for German bombs to lend their city some wartime glamour; the working class mother who reads Ideal Home and dreams of coffee mornings and cocktail parties; and 18-year-old Alan #8211; a practising Anglican who is deeply distrustful of God, strike a chord within all of us. p In fact, it is their very ordinariness that makes these tales so special #8211; combined, of course, with the wry observation and tender understatement that have earned Alan Bennett his place at the forefront of contemporary writing.",
