  "title": "The Emergency Claus",
  "description": "While engaged in overly-playful reindeer games, Santa Claus broke his leg. Now it is up to his daughter, Tabitha, to deliver the Christmas presents. Tabitha has never been interested in the family business and would much rather run her own consulting business based out of Chicago. She is even less interested in marrying some nice young boy to take over as Santa, but there are some nice (and perhaps a few naughty) women she finds more intriguing. It all comes to a head when Allison catches Tabitha in her role as Santa. This is a novella of 25,000 words.",
