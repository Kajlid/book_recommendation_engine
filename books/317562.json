  "description": "\"A moody, grisly thriller that supplies a nuanced cast and unresolved mysteries\" -- Kirkus ReviewsIn 1950, FBI Special Agent Derbert Hinke is tasked by J. Edgar Hoover to investigate the murders of twin girls in ritzy New Canaan, CT, because commie banners are found at the crime scene – but learns he’s up against something a lot more Evil than the Kremlin – and those weren’t the only twins murdered. Hinke is positive he's the only one who can solve the crimes -- but will he?Robert Ludlum’s bestseller, The Chancellor Manuscript, is an exceptional historical thriller centered around J. Edgar Hoover and his voluminous, explosive private files that could destroy any of the most powerful. Game of Twins – The Special Agent takes the shady story of those files and tells a fictional version of his longtime secretary, Helen Gandy, who controlled the files with an iron fist, and one FBI special agent whom she befriends. Add in some occult from Stephen King’s bestselling thriller, Salem's Lot – and you can get a flavor of this Books in the series are chronological, but each reads great as a standalone. Game of Twins – The Special Agent is the prequel set in the Hoover era and is the historical noire fiction novel of the series. The other 3 are set in the present.",
