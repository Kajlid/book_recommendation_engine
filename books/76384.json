  "title": "Power to the People",
  "description": "In her latest, radio personality and author Ingraham (Shut up and Sing) calls on the American people to take back the phrase \"Power to the People\" from the anti-establishment groups of yesterday that, today, have made the country, according to Ingraham, \"a slave to fringe groups, political correctness, expanding bureaucracies, and our own consumerism.\" Taking an approach that makes mutually exclusive groups out of those \"working and taking care of their families\" and the \"protest culture,\" Ingraham's message is loud and \"they're coming for you.\" Specifically, \"they\" means the Lifetime network (brainwashing women to \"swear off men and family\"), the growing ranks of \"Team Atheist\" (including Dan Brown), \"family deconstructivists,\" illegal immigrants and Islamic jihadists, among others. Chapters cover most of today's hot button topics-the war in Iraq, homeland security, the judiciary, the news media and global warming-with attitude and conviction. Ingraham's commentary on the lack of education in our schools and the \"pornification\" of the culture contain her most sound, articulate arguments (bolstered by a wealth of statistics), but Ingraham's assembling tactics are overzealous; still, fans of her strident radio show should be pleased to find more of the same here.",
