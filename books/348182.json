  "title": "Proud Man",
  "description": "Originally published in England in 1934, this searing, still timely novel offers and incisive critique of the sexual politics and militarism of England, and the West as a whole.Proud Man is told from the perspective of a \"Genuine Person\" who has been thrown back in time thousands of years from a peaceful future society. The Genuine Person comes from a people that are androgynous, self-fertilizing, and vegetarian; they live without a national government and artificial social divisions of gender and class. Taking on first female, then male form, the \"Genuine Person\" confronts the deeply troubled reality of England in the 1930s, still battered after one World War and on the road to another.",
