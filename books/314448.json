  "title": "Basic American Government",
  "description": "Basic American Government gives an account of the general government as established by the Constitution, of the state governments which preceded or came after it and their constitutions. More, it details the Ancient and modern foundations, scriptural and secular, on which these constitutions and governments rested. The Founders of the United States built on a great foundation, and the story of that is told in these pages. The story is told, too, how the Constitution of 1787 became venerated and accepted as the Higher Law in the 19th century. The account ends with the sobering description of the massive departures from the Constitution in the 10th century, on the way to constructing a Leviathon, which government is now out of control.",
