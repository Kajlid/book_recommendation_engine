  "description": "\"The measure of a man lies not in what he says but what he does...\"\nTwo of the comics industry's top creative talents, writer Grant Morrison and artist Frank Quitely, the acclaimed team behind 'JLA:EARTH 2' (2000), reunite to redefine Superman based on the timeless, essential iconic elements that everyone knows about the Man of Steel.In the first volume, the World's Greatest Super-Hero rescues a doomed group of astronauts on the surface of the sun, where he's exposed to massive amounts of solar radiation. No one could possibly anticipate how he'll be affected—except Lex Luthor! Now, the world's greatest superhero must set his affairs in order, beginning by telling Lois Lane the truth about Clark Kent's secret identity. You've seen it before. Now, see it again as though for the first time. Not an origin story, modernization, or reinvention—but instead a timeless and iconic presentation refined by the passion and craft of master storytellers, All-Star Superman presents a unique and elegant interpretation of the original and most recognizable of all superheroes.Age Rating: 12–17+ / Grades 7–9+",
