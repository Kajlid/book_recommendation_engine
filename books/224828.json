  "description": "Short Stories from the bestselling author of The Outsiders, plus exclusive interviews A teenager when she first gained fame, now a seasoned writer, S. E. Hinton takes her trademark themes to a new level in Some of Tim’s Stories—fourteen original stories depicting adults trapped in lives of missed connections and opportunities. The stories in this collection merge into a larger narrative about two cousins, Terry and Mike, whose lives and families are intertwined but whose paths lead to very different futures: one in prison, the other enduring a guilt-ridden existence working in a bar.The tales are made especially distinctive in the telling. The “author” of the stories is a bartender named Tim—the “Mike” of his own narrative—whose idiosyncrasies are perfectly captured in Hinton’s intriguing use of metafiction.The book also features exclusive interviews with Hinton conducted by Teresa Miller, host of public television’s Writing Out Loud. Hinton allows readers into her world as she never has before—speaking openly about her life and career. Complementing the book are line drawings that illustrate the stories and photographs that document the author’s life.In one interview, Hinton calls Some of Tim’s Stories “the best writing I’ve ever done.” These stories capture the feel of the earlier books that won her fame while demonstrating an adult edginess and a more disciplined talent. Some of Tim’s Stories is sure to captivate Hinton’s long-time fans as it shows new readers that her soul-searching fiction extends masterfully to adult themes as well.",
