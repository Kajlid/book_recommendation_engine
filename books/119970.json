  "title": "The Chirodiary",
  "description": "This is a non-too serious book, written as it chronicles my treatment at the hands of a Chiropractor.After years of despicable, miserable and debilitating pain I decided to finally try and find out first what was the cause of my pain, and what I could do to ease it.I decided to write this book after two days of treatment, as I found what was happening to me was probably quite amusing for others to read.This is NOT a self-help book on Chiropractic treatment. It is a volume infused with self deprecating humour and lots of swear words.Please do not buy if easily offended. Mature readers only.The Author of this book is not be confused with the proper, legitimate talented sane author by the same name responsible for Tom and the grumpy wizard.",
