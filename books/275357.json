  "description": "Making mistakes is part of life. But sometimes, a mistake can cost you everything. When her world is invaded by an influx of demons, slayer Krista Lennox calls upon something even worse to help her defeat them. Too bad he's more inclined to cause her trouble than to fix her problems. And too bad he thinks she's...interesting. As the city begins to lose hope and Krista's situation becomes dire, she knows two things for sure. Magic is not enough. And time is running out. *Reverse harem series* If you like snark and humor with your emotion and darkness, kickass female protagonists and dangerous, protective men, you need to read this series! -- \"This is so good!! Seriously, Laken's ability to develop character personalities in a couple of paragraphs is amazing. I just gave up on a book last night (which is rare for me) because I couldn’t connect with the characters. I’m already invested in Krista’s story. Love it!\" ~Taryn Rich Chancellor ★★★★★",
