  "description": "Three disturbing stories about the dangers of falling in love - an incompetent Cupid prepares for Valentine's Day, but his arrows melt faces, not hearts; a man's art exhibition conceals a macabre secret; and a betrayed bride makes unfaithful lovers regret their vow of 'til death us do part'. All their victims are bound by an unsettling truth - too much love can kill you.",
