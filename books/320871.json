I didn’t agree to this part. To…them. I cherished my past, and the memories I shared with these guys until I was whipped away in the dead of night, and now they hate me for it. Jagger. Jameson. Leo. Ezra. They might be trouble, but I’m still the reckless, outspoken girl I’ve always been. I was made for them, but they’ve forgotten that fact. It’s like our history never happened. Things have changed, and they’re keeping secrets. I’ll find out what’s going on, whether they like it or not. I’m Luella Carter, and Emerson U is mine.Watch Me Fall is book in the Emerson U series, which is an MM RH romance with steamy scenes and violence. Which means it is suitable for those aged over 17.",
