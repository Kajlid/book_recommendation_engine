  "title": "Wheels Down: Adjusting to Life After Deployment",
  "description": "As a military service member, you're looking forward to life after deployment and being back home among family and friends. But adjusting to \"normal\" life again can bring its own challenges. You're not the same person you were when you left on deployment. This book, written by military psychologists Moore and Kennedy, is a down-to-earth guide that's full of practical advice. The authors talk straight about both the joys and challenges of returning home, advising that one size does NOT fit all when it comes to making the transition. They share thoughtful, constructive tips for dealing with unwanted surprises like relationship break-ups, financial problems, and kids who are suddenly strangers. Experiences shared by many returning service members, like sleep disturbances, anger management, and learning to live with \"hyperstartle,\" are also discussed. For those whose transition has been more difficult, chapters on identifying the signs of PTSD, living with disturbing memories, and seeking relief from suicidal thoughts are particularly valuable. A final appendix is the definitive guide to support services for military members, with resources on everything from kid's books to financial management websites.",
