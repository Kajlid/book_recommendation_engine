Rory Hale was the nicest, sweetest man she had ever met. He was also the most unattainable. Gorgeous, rich and smart, Rory would never be interested in her. He wouldn’t go for a plump, boring woman that was a chef and suffered from the rejections of her past. Who wanted a foundling that had never even known who her parents were?

His mate would not be his choice.Rory Hale had liked Callie Marks since he had met her at his brother’s wedding.

His heart said yes…but his body was unresponsive.Until he touched her and discovered she was his mate!Rory was battered by mating instincts and his need to possess and dominate Callie . Could Callie ever except who she really was and what it meant to be the mate of a vampire? The guardian of his soul. Rory is determined to convince her…in any way possible!18+ ONLY - This book contains graphic sex, graphic language, rough sex, domination, bondage, spanking and other subjects that are intended for adults only. This is a romance but contains very erotic content. It is not a true BDSM novella, so if you prefer the SM element you won't find it here. There's no real pain inflicted. It is more romance with alpha male domination being part of the vampire nature and mating instincts. However, it does contain all of the above sexual content in the 18+ warning. Download only if you love a little (or maybe a lot) of kink and heat in you alpha male vampires romances. : )This is “Rory’s Mate” Book 2 of The Vampire Coalition. If you haven’t read “Ethan’s Mate” Book 1, I would highly recommend reading it first. Although these are complete stories you will miss much of the previous information on the nature of my vampires if they aren’t read in order and you may get lost. There is also a short prelude “The Rough Mating Of A Vampire” that is an erotic short about Adare and Kristin. It’s an optional story.*********************************",
