  "description": "Her Imperial Majesty Queen Victoria still rules her empire, the Royal Navy challenges the Chinese in the skies with their mighty airships, and Earth still turns on God's great brass gears of heaven as it makes it orderly passage around the lamp of the sun frim midnight to midnight and year to year.Rejoin the adventure in Lake's Clockwork Earth!Paolina Barthes, young sorceress, is crossing the Equatorial Wall; since she cannot remove her magical talent from herself, she must remove herself from Northern Earth. She fears and hates the powerful men of the empires of the North who have tried to use her instead of teach her. She hopes to find a home.Emily Childress is still aboard the renegade Chinese submarine, along with the British chief petty officer, Angus al-Wazir. They are being pursued most urgently by the powers that secretly rule Northern Earthâ€”the Silent Order and the White Birds. Childress, who assumed the identity of a Mask of the White Birds to save her life, is growing into that power. Every day she wields it, it becomes more truly her own.The mechanical man of Ophir, christened Boaz by Paolina, was abandoned on the coast of Africa and is held captive by castaway Chinese airmen. He desires only to find Paolina, but instead, the deepst memories of his Brass kind are being triggered by the place in which he finds himself. He is compelled to recover a long-hidden treasure and return it to Ophir.And in Southern Earth, a new power has its eye on Paolina; she will not be allowed to bring the political turmoil of the North into the more mystical South.",
