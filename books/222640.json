  "title": "Queen most fair",
  "description": "The tall figure slid wearily to the ground and was hustled to the water's edge where Geordie and Willie sat in their boat, aghast. Then the Queen flung back her hood and they saw her ashen face, her eyes dark-ringed with sleeplessness, as wild as the eyes of a hind that turns upon her hunters. A queen was being brought into captivity to this island of the Douglases at Loch Leven. It was up to Willie and the girl Kirstie to set her free.",
