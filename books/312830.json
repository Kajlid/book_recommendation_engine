  "description": "Take New York by storm and steer clear of serious relationships. That's the plan. That's the goal. It's easy too; now that my software company is taking off. Nothing is getting in the way of that--not even my personal trainer. I don't care how sexy and intriguing she is.Mel Dawson keeps talking me into doing things, like watching the sunset and slowing down to enjoy life.When she trains me, and I watch her body, I'm constantly fantasizing about exploring every inch of it all night long, claiming her mouth every time she gives me a sassy reply. I don't even know who I am when I'm with her. Iâ€™m suddenly a completely different man. But, I like this version of myself better. Mel's smart, determined, and keeps me guessing. She's everything I need and want, but I've been burned before. I'm used to taking chances in the boardroom, just not in my personal life. How much am I willing to risk for a chance to make her mine?",
