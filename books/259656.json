When the top team’s drivers start to die from engine sabotage, the cop who is assigned to investigate turns out to be the sexy stranger Sam slept with to get revenge on a cheating ex. At least that’s what she told herself.All cop, Detective Drew Thompson is bullheaded and arrogant—just the right qualifications to infiltrate the racing circuit as a cocky driver with a serious adrenaline addiction. Except, a one-night stand with the prime suspect isn’t exactly protocol for an undercover operation.Drew isn’t going to let another cop, or civilian for that matter, die on her watch. Can they catch the real killer before their chance at a future goes up in flames?",
