  "description": "FROM USA TODAY BESTSELLING AUTHOR ELLA JAMES... One boy. Mother calls him Hansel. One girl. Mother named her Gretel. Locked in little rooms, in the mountainside mansion of a crazy woman. Until he saws a hole into the wall dividing them. Then at least, they have each other’s hands. It doesn’t end well at Mother’s house. Everything gets…broken. Ten years later, they meet again in an exclusive Vegas sex club. Whips. Chains. And most of all, a mask. What happens to love when it gets twisted? Fairy tales are cautionary tales, remember?",
