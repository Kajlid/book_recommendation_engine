  "description": "Christmas is the most magical season of the year. Noel loves everything about it. From the decorating, to the music, and the baking. While visiting her parents in their farmhouse nestled in the Maine woods in preparation for the holiday, she finds herself alone when the power goes out.  But when she finds a stranger and his little boy stranded next to the road, she follows her intuition and offers them shelter until they can figure out how to restore the power.  All Ian wanted to do was take his son to see Santa. Now he’s stuck with a Christmas enthusiast in a farmhouse decorated with smiling faces on family pictures. But as Ian spends more and more time with Noel, he’s reminded of what the true spirit of Christmas is all about.  Family, joy, kindness…and love.",
