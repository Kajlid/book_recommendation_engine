  "description": "In modern day St Albans, England there is a grisly discovery in Verulamium Park and Australian DI Chris O'Rourke is the investigating officer. A crucified body, ancient coffins, 2000-year-old skeletons, Latin writings and an old pair of sandals-it is an investigation that baffles even the tenacious O'Rourke. In a story that spans three continents and two thousand years what O'Rourke eventually discovers is about to send shockwaves around the globe.",
