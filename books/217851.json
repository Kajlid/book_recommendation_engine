  "description": "Prospect…  Fighter…  Killer…  In order to prove his loyalty, Knights Corruption prospect, Jagger Blakeslee, readily agreed to immerse himself in situations that weren't meant for the faint of heart.  Every time, he stepped up.  Every time, he did what was asked.  Never questioning… until he met her.  Kena Prescott wasn’t like everyone else. Leading a simple yet lonely life, she preferred to live in the background, avoiding potential heartache by never bringing attention to herself or the challenge she faced on a daily basis.  Until a fated encounter with a stranger thrust her into a world she had never known existed.  He’d come to her rescue, but in the end, would she be the one to save him?",
