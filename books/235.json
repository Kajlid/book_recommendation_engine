  "description": "Which is worse, getting involved with one of your students or with one of your professors? Graduate student Paige Huntley finds herself dangerously tempted by both possibilities one summer in her sleepy Oregon town. Professor Stefan Serovinak, her thesis adviser, is elegant, witty, and brilliant, but married. To keep her mind off him, it's easy to flirt instead with gorgeous young Aidan Grey, a film star who has turned up as a student in the summer Linguistics class she's teaching. But their flirtation soon tumbles into a romantic entanglement that could wreck careers and reputations when the faculty--and the tabloids--find out about it.",
