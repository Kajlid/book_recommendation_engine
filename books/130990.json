  "description": "With the Order of Constantine disbanded, Ava, Jonathan, Rene, and Mark think that they are finally free of their past. But, when Constantines, dracos, and witches start being hunted all over the world, it soon becomes clear that the past still wants to make an appearance. Meanwhile, in the small city of Brasov, after a set of murders, the process is finally completed and the man everyone thought of as being dead since 1700 is now able to take both human and werewolf form. For 300 years, since he left London, he lived with just one thought: to get revenge against the one he created, the first draco, and against the Order he founded. Now Ava, dracos, and witches are losing their abilities, they are all becoming terribly human and they have to face their greatest enemy: the monster werewolf. Unfortunately for them, he has an army of sires. New questions arise. Can they win in their simple human form or do they need to stay supernatural? What is the reason the werewolf seeks to kill everyone, including those of his own Order? Why is he looking for Ava? And, most importantly, what is a mind bender? Species are now fighting. Who will survive and who will go extinct?",
