  "description": "James, Carl and Dane live together under the guise of being just roommates and nothing more. But, even as roommates, James doesn't feel he belongs with them sometimes. Carl and Dane are MMA fighters, two boys pulled off the streets, while James, on the other hand, was raised with what Carl and Dane would refer to as middle class normal - their joke.James supports the two fighters he loves by attending all of their fights. The brutality of the cage fights is just something he has adjusted to. He doesn't mind it rough at all though when one of his lovers wins and comes home all hyped up for sex, which is more naked wrestling in their apartment.Their tense situation changes dramatically when Dane is hurt in the cage. James just can't understand why Dane is fighting so hard to get back into the cage where he almost died.Will James' confusion make him the permanent odd man out, or will he eventually learn enough in play to make him understand his lovers' drive to fight?",
