  "title": "Going Bare",
  "description": "I have always wanted to try naturism and in August 2012 I got my wish as my terrified wife and excited kids joined me as we went to a naturist resort in southern France for a few days.This book offers a light-hearted look at our first family holiday in five years, when I persuaded them to go bare in public for the first time. The book is short - around an hour of reading - and details everything from when I first decided naturism appealed to me, to my thoughts after the holiday.",
