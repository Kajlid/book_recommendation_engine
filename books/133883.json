  "description": "\"I didn't have time to mope. We had a criminal or two to catch, a murder rap to solve, and an ex fiancé to save.\" - Lilly Millenovanovich. Rescue ex fiancé, Jake Kline. Save pastry chef, Audrey Willow. That's the plan. Mystery author, Lilly Millenovanovich finds herself up to her ears in mayhem and mischief in this latest caper. After receiving a phone call from professional hit lady, Brooke Williams, Lilly's life moves from hometown Barton, Ohio to the Gulf coast of Florida. Brooke claims to have Lilly's best friend and ex fiancé, Jake Kline under lock and key. Her directions are very clear: if Lilly wants to save Jake, come to Florida and do what Brooke asks, no matter what that is. As if that wasn't enough on her plate, Lilly is drawn into helping Aunt Sadie's friend and pastry chef, Audrey Willow, prove she really didn't poison a food critic with her famous chocolate dessert. Or did she? Lilly manages a skilled but somewhat haphazard juggling act to work at finding the real killer while trying to avoid provoking Jake's captor from sending him to the bottom of the ocean. Both old friends and enemies enter the picture. Like Latin dreamboat, Agent Nick Galina, who stirs up emotions Lilly would like to avoid. And Mexican crime boss, Carlos Ruido, who manages to be the center of all Lilly's problems. Of course, it wouldn't be any fun without throwing an aunt or three into the mix, along with their quirky, zany behaviors. Will Lilly rescue Jake? Will she prove Audrey Willow didn't commit murder? Devilish, Devious, and Deadly with One Bite will serve a tantalizing, scrumptious story with all the answers in this third installment of the Lilly M Mysteries.",
