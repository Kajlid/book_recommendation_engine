  "description": "Ravil is an alien with the power to jump spaceships across the galaxy in the blink of an eye. Instead of helping the ragtag Resistance fight off the Empire, she’s stuck on a backwater planet called Earth and on the run from Empire operatives who will use any means necessary to bring her under their control. To escape capture and enslavement, she teams up with Rake, a drug-addicted ex-Astronaut with nothing to live for besides scoring his next hit. Her goal is to get back to space and join an intergalactic war that Earth did not even know existed, but Ravil doesn’t have a spaceship or crew, and Rake still has to get sober enough to realize he’s traveling with an alien.",
