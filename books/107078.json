  "description": "14 year old Aecia has a secret. She lives in a world where evolution has ensured that VAMPIRES rule, and she is HUMAN! Disguised by her parents and uncle, her life is a macabre theatre production with her as the leading lady. With no friends, she carries this burden alone, until her desperate loneliness creates 'Amica' a blonde, blue-eyed and carefree human friend whom she writes to in her diary. When she becomes involved with a real friend 'Garok' her life takes a disastrous turn for the worst, but as her terrifying fears are realised she discovers that maybe she is not alone, and as each calamitous morsel of her life explodes into chaos, she finds that her own birth has been the catalyst to events that will shake the foundations of the tyrannous vampire world forever!",
