  "title": "Caffa",
  "description": "In the mid-fourteenth century, as Mongol soldiers hurled the corpses of plague victims over the walls of the besieged Crimean city of Caffa, it became ground zero for the pandemic that decimated Europe, North Africa and the Near East over a decade. In this third installment of the thrilling Aphrodite series, two reluctantly persistent heroes, Bill and Aphrodite, are pulled into their deadliest adventure yet, as they work to thwart a far more methodical and refined modern biological warfare attack. Can the duo beat the clock to save the family of an old friend and prevent another Caffa on American soil?",
