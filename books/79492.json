  "description": "“Valentine and Orson” is a romance which has been attached to the Carolingian cycle. Earliest English version (The Historye of the two Valyannte Brethren: Valentyne and Orson ... by Henry Watson) was printed by William Copland in about 1550.The tale adapted for the nursery was illustrated by Walter Crane in the Three Bears' Picture Book (1876).This book tells children about the story of twin brothers, abandoned in the woods in infancy; one of them is brought up as a knight, while the other grows up in a bear’s den.The “Animedia Company” e-book edition (2012) contains the original colorful illustrations by Walter Crane, which were carefully restored by a publisher. This edition is modified especially for the e-book format: the pictures occupy the whole screen space, while the text is separated from the pictures, is easy to read and, moreover, to change the size.",
