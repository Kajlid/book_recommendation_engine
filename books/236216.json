  "description": "Quirky, hilarious, always engaging and often moving, The Passion of Harry Bingo enters the lives of some of Britain’s least known but most amazing characters. From Orkney to the Sussex coast they bring light and laughter into all our lives: the Sikh pipe band and Wall of Death riders, herring queens and drag queens, crazy golfers and Harry himself, still following Partick Thistle in his nineties. This second selection of Peter Ross’s sideways looks at life in Scotland – and beyond – follows the highly successful and acclaimed Daunderlust.",
