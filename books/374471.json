  "description": "What happens when the political drama that unfolds in the country’s corridors of power, spills over to a complicated personal bond between three young people?Aditya, like the Congress party he belongs to, tends to be elitist and aristocratic; Brajesh Ranjan, like his party, the BJP, swears by an overtly nationalist agenda and Chaitali Sen, like the CPI(M) she represents, swears by the underpowered.In this page-turning book, set in the thick of political party maneuvering and against the backdrop of India’s nuclear deal, the author writes a riveting story about love and relationships that are made and broken by the ideologies of the political parties that each of these three protagonists represent. It takes a horrific incident like 26/11 to make each of them realize the shortcomings of the parties they swear by and to look at the larger picture.",
