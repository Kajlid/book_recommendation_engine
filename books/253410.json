  "description": "Teetering on the Tennessee border, Hootertown, Kentucky, suits beautician Jamie Lee Carter just fine. She’s the kind of gal who prefers longneck beers to cosmos, bare feet to high heels, and Daisy Dukes to Prada, but a bit of flash might still win out over another pool-hall line dance. That’s where Parker Carrington, a hunky Hollywood producer, comes in. He’s pegged Hootertown as an ideal movie site—and Jamie as more than a sexy extra. He’s adding sizzle to Jamie’s romantic slump and firing up something called jealousy in Griff Sheldon, Jamie’s brother’s best friend and her longtime crush. Now two hot-blooded rivals are going head-to-head. One’s got a Jaguar. One’s got a pickup. And only one’s got what it takes to give Jamie the ride of her life.",
