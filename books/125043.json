  "description": "Atlantic City social worker Lucy Womzak had always been able to find the good in people, to make the best out of bad situations and to cook her way out of stress. So when Les, her husband, leaves her for a slightly younger (but much skinnier) woman, she’s sure she has the skill set to handle it and re-create a happy home for her and her sixteen-year-old twins. After all, she can still make a decent meatloaf.But positive thinking and a degree in therapy can only go so far. When she discovers Les had led a secret life as a mafia-wannabe that may have now put her in danger, she realizes could use a little help, especially since her secret tomato sauce is at risk, too. Lucy reaches out to her good friend, Nico. Together they try to broker a deal with a black market tomato farmer and hunt down a necklace stolen from a sentimental mobster. Nico is more than willing to help. In fact he’s more than willing to be more than a friend. Nico’s funny. Nico’s sexy. Nico can appreciate a good linguine and clam sauce. Never before had she such a delicious opportunity. But will she survive long enough to do more than just taste it?",
