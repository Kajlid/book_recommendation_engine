  "description": "His touch has killed before. If only knowing it would stop me from laying my hands on him now. I’ve been told my love for adventure would get me in trouble one day. When I agree to be taken to a place unknown to entertain a group of men I’d never met, I wonder if that day has come.It is supposed to be a fantasy brought to life. Until one man hijacks it, taking over my imagination, my body, and eventually my heart.Except that he turns out to be not a man at all and his dark past might ruin everything between us before it even began.Unknown to us, danger lurks in the shadows, leading me to discover firsthand that sex demons have their vulnerabilities. And even Vadim, the Grand Master of the Eastern Council, is not invincible.Although, Grand Master is a brand new love story with a different couple as main characters, it is recommended to read the series in order, to better understand the world and the main plot of the series. Warning: Grand Master is a paranormal romance that contains graphic descriptions of intimacy, sexual themes, and violence. Intended for mature readers. Book 3.5, Zayne and Tanya, is free for my email subscribers.https://dl.bookfunnel.com/mk0dwaje4k",
