  "title": "Pulse and Prejudice",
  "description": "10 hrs and 37 mins In this thrilling and sensual adaptation of the classic love story Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth Bennet and the citizens of Hertfordshire know Fitzwilliam Darcy to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man, but they never suspect the dark secret of his true nature. He is not a man at all - but a vampire.When the haughty and wealthy Fitzwilliam Darcy arrives in the rural county of Hertfordshire, he finds he cannot control his attraction to Elizabeth Bennet - a horrifying thought because, as she is too far below his social standing to ignite his heart, he fears she must appeal to the dark impulses he struggles to suppress.Set against the vivid backdrop of historical Regency England, this adaptation of Pride and Prejudice follows the cursed Mr. Darcy as he endeavours to overcome both his love and his bloodlust for Miss Elizabeth Bennet. Although Pulse and Prejudice adheres to the original plot and style of the Jane Austen classic, it is not a \"mash-up\" but an imaginative, thrilling variation told primarily from Mr. Darcy's point of view as he descends into the seedier side of London and introduces Elizabeth to a world of passion and the paranormal she never knew existed.Pulse and Prejudice has been meticulously researched for historical accuracy and remains faithful to nineteenth century literary conventions and Miss Austen's narrative. The author spent fifteen months traveling to Britain and researching Regency England, as well as vampire lore and literature. In the few instances inwhich the plots overlap, excerpts from canon have been expertly woven in so that prior knowledge of Pride and Prejudice is not required for full enjoyment of this remarkable novel.",
