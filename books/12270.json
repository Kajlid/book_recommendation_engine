A thirty-nine-year- old divorced mother, she runs her own antique letterpress business, is a lifelong member of the Jane Austen Society, and gushes over everything Regency. But her business is failing, threatening her daughter's future.

But the witty and dashing Mr. Wrightman proves to be a prize worth winning, even if it means the gloves are off...",
