  "description": "Deadly Family Secrets Were Hidden Behind The Sin! Murder was a very rare crime in Sikeston, Missouri. But then, Leah Graves, the victim, was a very rare woman. She was the town everything: beauty, athlete, scholar, Cotton Bowl queen, spoiled brat, and royal bitch. Even her daddy, the richest, most powerful man in town couldn't control her. Leah knew at a young age how she affected men. She certainly had her father wrapped around her little finger and only laughed when he tried to warn her that someone as pretty as she was would cause members of the opposite sex to want to do things... sinful things.",
