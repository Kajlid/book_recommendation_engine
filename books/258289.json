  "description": "Being assassinated once may be an accident. Being assassinated twice is enemy action.Aeneas Tell of the House of Tell is one of the youngest Lords of Creation. His family rules the Nine Worlds through its control of the ultra-advanced technology that has permitted the colonization of the entire solar System. More gods than men, the Lords of Creation have cheated Death itself. But even a quasi-immortal god will take exception to being assassinated. Twice. Especially when the assassin turns out to be a someone he thought was a friend.And when his assassinations turn out to be a prelude to interstellar war on the grandest possible scale with an evil so cosmic that its limits can scarcely be imagined, Aeneas has no choice but to declare himself the Emperor of Man.SUPERLUMINARY is the latest and most brilliant creation of science fiction grandmaster John C. Wright, the Dragon-award winning author of THE UNWITHERING REALM, THE GOLDEN AGE, MOTH & COBWEB, and AWAKE IN THE NIGHT LAND.",
