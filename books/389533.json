  "title": "The Chalice of Immortality",
  "description": "In the final installment of the MAGICKEEPERS series Nick leaves the safety of the Winter Palace and travels to England in search of the secret behind Rasputin's longevity. With appearances by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Shakespeare, THE CHALICE OF IMMORTALITY is a thrilling conclusion to this clever, contemporary take on the world of magic. Harry Houdini stole it from his best friend. Shakespeare used it to kill Macbeth. And it's the secret to Rasputin's terrifying existence. The Chalice of Immortality has been missing for nearly a hundred years. Nick Rostov has only a few days to find it―or his father will die. What would you do for a goblet with the power to control life and death? Praise for The Eternal Hourglass : \"Though grounded in Russian history…this fantasy earns style points for being set in modern Las Vegas―in a hotel whose residents include polar bears, giant Siberian tigers, and Princess Anastasia herself.\"― Kirkus \"Kirov's story feels plenty original, and kids will be charmed by her brand of magic.\"― Publishers Weekly",
