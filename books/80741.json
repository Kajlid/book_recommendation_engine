  "description": "One night in September 2012, a woman sat at her desk and began to compose A poem she had poured all her feelings out about the lingering past of those haunting foes She then took a bold step and showed her work to her readers all around the earth Little did she know she’d just given birth… To an appetite for poetry that she has come to cherish For as long as she lives, it’ll never perish",
