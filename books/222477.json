  "title": "Operation Solo: The FBI's Man in the Kremlin",
  "description": "Operation Solo is America's greatest spy story. For 27 years, Morris Childs, code name \"Agent 58\", provided the USA with the Kremlin's innermost secrets. Repeatedly risking his life, \"Agent 58\" made 57 clandestine missions into the USSR, China, Eastern Europe & Cuba. Because of his high ranking in the American communist party & his position as editor of its official paper, the Daily Worker, he was treated like royalty by communist leaders such as Khrushchev, Brezhnev & Mao Tse-tung. Thru first-hand accounts, Operation Solo tells the story of the conflicts within the FBI & American intelligence about the operation, & how the FBI, thru extraordinary measures, managed to keep that operation hidden from everyone, including the CIA.",
