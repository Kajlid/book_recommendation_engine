The fire net burned my hands whenever I touched it, but I couldn't let it harm him any more than it already had. Kory's wings, with burn-holes between ribs, beat to help me get the net off him.  Kory screamed as the net sunk farther into sections of his back--it was designed to burn flesh until it had completely passed through its victim. I shook my hands to rid myself of the wad of net I held and reached for the part that was burning Kory so badly.\"  Lexsi: 1. Who is behind the plot to kill us? 2. What do they want? 3. Where are they? 4. Why me?  My to-do list is overwhelming...  Kordevik: 1. How can I keep my Thifilathi in line, when it wants Lexsi now? 2. How do I keep the werewolves, shifters, vampires and humans around me behaving in a civil manner toward each other? 3. How can I protect Lexsi and the others, when the enemy wants to destroy all of us? 4. How did I get myself into this mess?  A Demon's Work is Never Done...",
