  "description": "Finally, a practical way for parents to help children develop early reading skills! This unique book series gives parents an opportunity to help their children learn how to read--as they share the books together. The books are easy to use: On the left-hand pages, a passage appears for parents to read out loud to their children. This passage contains age-appropriate sight words that have been identified as crucial for reading development. The sight words are highlighted in red so that the child can see them in context. On the right -hand page, a short passage appears with the same sight words. By recognizing the sight words introduced earlier, the child, with practice, will be able to read the passage and continue the story.",
