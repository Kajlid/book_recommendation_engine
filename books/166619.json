  "description": "They warned Hazel. Hazel’s two demon lovers warned her that if she let another man touch her, she would be punished. Months have gone by and Hazel hasn’t heard from Amon or Zepar. They’ll never know. Lonely and frustrated she plans a night out with her friends at the most popular frat house on campus. One thing leads to another and she finds herself enjoying the company of one delicious frat brother. The sex is mediocre at best and only makes Hazel miss her demon lovers more. They never break a promise. Finally free from the Horror House, Amon and Zepar have work to do before they can claim their little co-ed for good. But when they find out she’s disobeyed them, there’s going to be hell to pay.",
