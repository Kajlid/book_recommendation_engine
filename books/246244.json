  "description": "He's a king who gave up on love. She's a girl with no memory.  \nAn entire ocean is keeping them apart. \n  Eight years have passed since the marriage tournament that decided the fate of Princess Pippa of Lauramore and strengthened alliances between the kingdoms of Elden. The competitors have moved on with their lives. Some have found adventure; some have found love.  Prince Bran of Triblue, however, has put his life on hold, preparing for his father's crown.  Two days before Bran's winter coronation, just when the prince cannot afford distractions, a girl washes onto the Triblue shore. She has no memory of her past life, no clue who she is or where she belongs—nothing but a ring on her finger and a peculiar marking on her cheek.  And the newly crowned king has more than a mysterious girl to worry about. The sea has become unpredictable. Storms claim ships in the dead of night, and sailors return with horrifying stories of monsters from the deep. It soon becomes clear the girl and the bizarre events are connected.  The girl came from the sea... and the sea wants her back.  But Bran isn't willing to give her or his kingdom up without a fight, even if it means he must request help from every corner of Elden.  An entire cast of Eldentimber characters returns in an epic series conclusion that readers have been asking for.",
