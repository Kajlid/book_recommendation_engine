  "description": "I’m a good girl.  I live by a code that can’t be bent or broken. It is my duty to my family to stay innocent and pure. To marry an Italian man. The stars are already aligned.  But Nikolai Kozlov re-writes my destiny with five simple words.  You belong to me now.  He's Russian mafiya. A thief. A skilled liar with no moral boundaries. He is everything I have been taught to hate. A man who stands for nothing. A man who takes what he wants without a second thought.  And what he wanted was me.  He thinks he controls my fate, but what he doesn’t know is, sometimes it’s the good girls you have to watch out for.   I’m a dangerous man.  I live by a code. The Vory code. It is my duty to my family to protect the brotherhood. To destroy anyone who threatens what we stand for, including her.  She’s a dancer. A beautiful little doll. My prisoner, and my new favorite puppet. This mafia princess thinks she has me under her spell, but in the end, she is simply collateral.  It’s a shame to destroy precious things.  But this is what bad men do.    Note: this book contains dark subject matter, please read at your own discretion. This is a full length standalone that can be read in any order within the series.",
