  "description": "Velma had lived two lives: her first as a former foster kid, and her second as an unlikely recruit into a secret order that satisfied her need for retribution. Her fifteen-year-old self had given up on hope, but after three years with the Taram, she'd found her life's purpose.That is, until she is surprisingly named Kachina, the fabled chosen empowered to fight the last battle for the fate of the world. Having to kill someone she loves was never part of the bargain, even if it means saving everyone else from damnation.Building a normal life free from the pull of the Taram--seems like the only answer to her prayers. Except her best friend, the other Kachina, is coming. The legend is clear that one of them must die.Velma will have to weigh the cost of her life against a world that's constantly betrayed her and quite literally decide if she'll be damned in dying, taking the whole world with her.",
