  "description": "As a war hero searches the oldest language in an ancient art of dance, he might discover the Intuitionist's power of reaching any answers.Missing memories might pile up if you encounter the Mesmerizer—the one who stopped World War III with a four-minute speech, especially if he asks you to forget. Even if it’s the one and only purpose you have, you will forget it, for he has the voice.Kusha forgot what she found on the night of the High Auction. But the laws of the universe are painfully fair sometimes. Purpose always calls you, either through your dreams, or daydreams, even nightmares … perhaps, through intuition? So the Intuitionist, Kusha, runs through the questions the universe asks her. Each question leads her to her purpose. It leads her to myths she never should tangle with. Most importantly, she never should encounter the war heroes, for they seek the Source, for they seek the signs that the devil has left for the naive humans, for they seek an old dance. A dance that calls her in her nightmares.Welcome to the Episode 2 of Wisdom Revolution.",
