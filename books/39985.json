  "description": "Raised in the shadow of genocide, where oppression and poverty still plague the streets of Phnom Penh, a young woman tries to support her family as a karaoke singer and fulfill her dreams of becoming a dancer. But in a city where women are treated as second-class citizens and corrupt officials rule with unlimited power, her chances for success are slim. When she is caught between the advances of a married man and the murderous rage of his wife, the results are horrifying. Inspired by true events, Shake Girl is the creation of the students and teachers of the Stanford University Graphic Novel Project, who wrote, illustrated, and designed tragic and haunting book in just six weeks. With its raw imagery and lyrical narrative Shake Girl is a powerful and groundbreaking achievement that will appeal to graphic novel fans and readers new to the medium.",
