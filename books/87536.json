  "description": "Gideon York is one of the most famous queer men in the world, but since his very public sex scandal, he’s on the verge of being permanently cancelled.Up for three Grammys this year, he needs to get through his six-week European tour without further incident or bad press.That’s where I come in. Call me his security detail, bodyguard, babysitter, or handler—I’ve been hired to keep him within my line of sight and out of trouble until the award ceremony. Should be a cakewalk.But nothing about Gideon or his life is ordinary, and no interaction I have with him feels anything less than charged. He makes me question everything I thought I knew about fame, desire, and sexuality.The more I know him, the more he invades me. The more I let him in, the more I lose myself.Gideon York is no cakewalk. He’s a recipe for disaster. And it turns out—I’m here for it.",
