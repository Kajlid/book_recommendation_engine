  "description": "Winner YALSA 2016 Great Graphic Novels for TeensIn February of 1947, the  crème de la crème  of Paris haute couture have flocked to see Christian Dior’s debut fashion show. In a flurry of corolla shaped skirts, the parade of models file down the runway and the mesmerized audience declares the show a triumph. When Clara—a freshly hired chronicler and guide to the busy corridors of the brand-new fashion house—is hand-picked by Dior to be a model, she knows her life will never be the same. A biography docudrama that marries fiction with the story of one of the greatest couturiers in history, this work is a breathless and stunning presentation of Christian Dior’s greatest designs, beautifully rendered by bestselling artist Annie Goetzinger.",
