  "description": "Harper's new boyfriend Logan Townsend is everything she never knew she always wanted--tall, muscular, with tousled brown hair that falls effortlessly around his face. But what's most exciting about Logan is that he's exhilaratingly dangerous, and dating him allows Harper to say, \"buh bye\" to her good-girl past and \"hello\" to newfound adventure.There's only one problem with Harper's otherwise heart-stopping Logan's twin brother Daemon. Harper knows he's a bad seed, but she tries to look past his dark, icy stare and his chilling demeanor. After all, he and Logan are a package deal.Then cow bones start appearing in people's mailboxes, a flock of birds show up dead, and all of the cars in the senior parking lot are given flat tires--and covered with blood-red handprints. Logan insists that Daemon isn't involved--sure, he's had some trouble in the past, but they moved to Harper's quiet northwest Washington town so that they could both start over.Harper desperately wants to believe Logan, but the more he tries to protect his brother, the more she wonders what she isn't being told. Now, Harper must unearth the hidden secrets of the mysterious Townsend brothers' history if she and Logan are to have any hope of a future. But learning what brought Logan and Daemon to town won't put just her heart in jeopardy... She's playing with her life.The author of Prada & Prejudice , You Wish , and Ripple delivers a modern-day retelling of a famously gothic tale, full of suspense, lies, and romance.",
