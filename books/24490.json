  "description": "Teodorico Raposo, the novel's anti-hero, is a master of deceit, one minute feigning devotion to his rich, pious aunt in order to inherit her money; the next, indulging in debauchery. Spurred on by the desire to please his aunt, and in order to get away from his unfaithful mistress, Teodorico embarks on a journey to the Holy Land in search of a holy relic. The resulting fiasco is a masterpiece of comic irony as religious bigotry and personal greed are mercilessly ridiculed.",
