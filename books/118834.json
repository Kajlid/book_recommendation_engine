  "description": "ENVIRONMENTAL FICTIONTrying to make sense of humanity’s quirky and often devastating behaviors, birds formed a religion complete with mythology, lore and fissured beliefs.“This is dangerous territory you place your wings in, my starling friend,” the goldfinch lowered his voice. “I feel something strange in the air ever since you came here. You aren’t usual, and there is an energy growing in the air we breathe -- like a berry on the vine. It’s ripening, and when it’s ready, there will be either a wonderful feast or poison.”The tenuous world-view of birds and perhaps humans too, is about to be challenged by the coming of a Starling of Prophecy and the truth He is called to discover and ultimately share.Order at: http://www.forestrypressproducts.com/...",
