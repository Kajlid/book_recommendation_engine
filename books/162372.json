Facing her greatest challenge yet, Rook Myfanwy Thomas must broker a deal between two bitter adversaries:The Checquy -- -the centuries-old covert British organization that protects society from supernatural threats, and...The Grafters -- -a centuries-old supernatural threat.But as bizarre attacks sweep London, threatening to sabotage negotiations, old hatreds flare. Surrounded by spies, only the Rook and two women who absolutely hate each other, can seek out the culprits before they trigger a devastating otherworldly war.Stiletto is a novel of preternatural diplomacy, paranoia, and snide remarks, from an author who \"adroitly straddles the thin line between fantasy, thriller, and spoof \"(Booklist).",
