  "description": "Tired of seeing “cripples” portrayed as asexual characters, Jillian Weise created this stunning lesson in desire and disease. The first section presents disability in a historical context, from the first “deaf and dumb” person granted the right to have sex to the surgeon who first cauterized war wounds. The middle section explores the physician as lover, and the final section depicts the rise and fall of a relationship. Characterized by a flesh-and-blood character, Holman, who also represents the larger tensions that arise between the abled and disabled.",
