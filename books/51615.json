But then, in the course of a single night, Adèle's husband dies and a black servant is shot, and Timar is sure that Adèle is involved. He'll cover for the crime if she'll do what he wants. The fix is in. But Timar can't even begin to imagine how deep.In Tropic Moon , Simenon, the master of the psychological novel, offers an incomparable picture of degeneracy and corruption in a colonial outpost.",
