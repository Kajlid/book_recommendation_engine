  "description": "Jared Heath led a line company in the Army of the Potomac. But then they convicted him of cowerdice in a drumhead court-martial, and his only chance lay with Company Q --a handful of misfits and outcasts, all of them disgraced. If Heath could make them an effective fighting force, if the cowards could prove their courage, they might one day be pardoned and regain their honor. And their chance did come -- deep in Comanche country, trapped and outnumbered by vengeful, savage warriors.",
