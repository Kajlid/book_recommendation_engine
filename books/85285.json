Knowing this keeps the lonely old woman going, together with the occasional 'trip' to her long dead husband and children. But she makes one mistake, and the villagers begin to suspect she is using occult spells to harm them. She tries desperately to regain their trust, but time is running short. Rosalind, rich, lonely and na√Øve, wants to experience true love and falls in love with a monk, by whom she conceives a child. Liza and the Lady Isabella, Rosalind's mother, must pick up the pieces. None of the three women will ever be the same again.",
