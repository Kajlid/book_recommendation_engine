  "description": "Jarvis Clark was stunned when he was verbally abused in the elevator at work and lewdly propositioned. Jarvis is young and handsome - the PA to the boss - a man with influence and power. His accoster might be butch and ruggedly good looking, but he is part of the rank and file - how dare he make such a move!Jarvis is left shocked, yet over the following weeks he continues to take the elevator late after work, knowing the man is likely to be there, and knowing the foul abuse he is going to receive. His life changes as questions are raised, put there in his mind by a verbal abuser - a nemesis come to life.Inevitably, the elevator takes this handsome young sophisticated man from the glamour of the top floor, all the way to the basement where the sex is rough and dirty â€“ where he is used and abused by an uncouth lout he comes to crave. Why did he allow it? Only Mr. Clark can tell you that for sure. Perhaps the man saw in Jarvis something he didn't know was there himself, and having lit the fuse, he had to explode. Whatever - this is his story of how he was used and abused and knew the perverted joys of humiliation and debasement!Warning: This book contains explicit gay m/m content and is suitable for readers 18 and above.",
