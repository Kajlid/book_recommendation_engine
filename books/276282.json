Then I meet him, Clark Jefferson. Six foot two inches of greek god hotness, with a smile that’ll make your panties disappear. He wears a clear warning label: Heartbreaker, and if I was smart I would stay away from him.  With my past, my secrets nothing could ever come of being with a man like him. Still I cannot ignore the feelings he stirs inside me. He frightens me and excites me all at once. He makes me want to break free of the suffocating fear that claims my heart.  Our meeting isn’t fate though, he needs me as much as I need him, and so we strike a deal. He’ll be my fake boyfriend and I’ll help him get out of trouble with his dad.  But secrets can’t remain secrets forever and as I grow closer to Clark my feelings for him grow too. Soon the line between fake and real blurs and when the past I’ve been running from finally catches up with me I’ll have to confess to Clark the truth or let go of a love that was only ever supposed to be fake.  **This is book three in the North Woods University Series.
