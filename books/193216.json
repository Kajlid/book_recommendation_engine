  "description": "There’s a rogue Warrior of the Myst out there going by the name of “Ghost” and no one knows just who this dark entity actually is. One thing is certain however – Ghost seeks to kill all who were responsible for the death of King Rigel III several months ago. Unfortunately, Ghost has some curious beliefs regarding that murder – beliefs that suggest that Valhalla’s current king, Mercer Knight, may have been responsible for that attack on Castle Mount. How do you battle against a powerful Myst Warrior who believes that they are already dead… merely a ghost of a person who is stuck between the world of the living and the world of the dead?  *This second Warrior of the Myst novel is written in the universe of the Colonization Saga by Scott McElhaney*  Editorial Reviews:  \"McElhaney's story telling is deft, well-paced, and with an ear for conversation\" ~ Beacon Journal Book Review  \"The author does a good job of sucking you into the moment and feeling as if you are the main character.
