  "description": "Desperate to find a sanctuary where his lover, Casca, will be safe from the demons drawn to her Brand of Sacrifice, Guts the Black Swordsman pushes his motley band of followers onward towards fairy Puck’s homeland, Elfhelm. With new allies who make their home in a mystically guarded woodland paradise, Guts’ goal seems within reach, but danger lurks in the shadows of even the most dazzling utopias, and even fairy witchery may not protect the wondrous kingdom from an army of marauding, murderous trolls!Created by Kentaro Miura, Berserk is a runaway manga locomotive, a crashing colossus of teeth-rattling action, spine-chilling horror, and taboo-breaking humor that fires the boilers of its devoted devotees and burns the rest. Ashes to ashes!",
