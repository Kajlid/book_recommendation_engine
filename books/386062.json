  "description": "In this a fictionalized memoir of Bella, we meet the marvellously drawn 18 year old shortly after the death of her father. Her scheming mother remarries Simon Daviditz, a lawyer who secretly buys the manor house left in trust to Bella to pay off her father's debts. The betrayal cuts Bella to the core - the house is a part of her. She has nothing left - except  she is beautiful, bold and unafraid to use sex to get revenge - as well as for her own pleasure.\"This is a work of erotic genius. I was gripped by this strong young protagonist who must find her way with no help from her aloof mother and lustful stepfather. The author beautifully captures the atmosphere of the English countryside...boarding schools run by nuns, and what it's like to be a gorgeous girl searching for her sexual identity, artistic success (she aspires to being a pop star), and, ultimately, revenge on her mother and stepfather for their betrayals.\"  5*****  Katie Dylan, author of Cult of Beauty , Amazon.com\"...a potent blend of classic erotica, bubbling with modernity,\"   Elizabeth Woodham, author of The Little Red Kilt",
