  "title": "Lady Mercy Danforthe Flirts with Scandal",
  "description": "Lady Mercy likes her life neat and tidy. She prides herself on being practical - like her engagement to Viscount Grey, whose dark colouring co-ordinates very well with her favourite furnishings. But things start to get messy when her best friend abandons her fiance at the altar, leaving it up to Mercy to help the couple. There's just one problem. The jilted man is Rafe Hartleyâ€”Mercy's former husband.Rafe has not forgiven Mercy for deserting him when they were seventeen. Their hasty marriage was declared void by law, but in his eyes the bossy little vixen was still his wife, even if the marriage lasted only a few hours. And Mercy \"Silky Drawers\" Danforthe still owes him a wedding night.",
