  "description": "Twisting The Script introduces Larry Aaron. A man strong enough to compete with a Gravier for a woman's love. Erica Reka Madison moved past her heartbreak to become a bolder and more confident woman. She staked her claim on her emotional independence and refused return to the emotional ruins left by Cyprien Gravier, two years earlier. Only the love of her childhood friend, Larry Aaron, was able to rescue her from her despair. The bond they shared was timeless. ...But, times were about to change. To keep Cyprien away, Erica and Larry play with fire. Could Erica handle the heat? The power of the passion he kept at bay left Erica breathless. Larry allowed Erica to discover just what she'd missed for years. Cyprien Gravier's insecurities led him to leave town and to end his relationship with Erica Madison. He left seeking fame and fortune and returned with not enough of either. Seeing Erica Madison again made Cyprien realize that leaving Erica was a mistake and he was determined to win Erica's heart. He turns to Johnathan Nate Gravier for advice and tutoring. Cyprien's troubles became the Bad Boy of all Gravier's, new project. Twisting the Script is the first work in the Aaron Family Series and is an offshoot of the now published Gravier Family Series.",
