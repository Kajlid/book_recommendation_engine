To complicate matters, Leah, the incredibly seductive stuntwoman who freelances for the show, is an immortal Demongate. Should Leah die, the Demongate will open and her sensual demon master will wreak havoc upon the unsuspecting human race. Can Tony—with the help of Leah, Henry, a tabloid reporter, a Mountie, and the cast of  Darkest Night —halt a demonic invasion and stave off the end of the world?",
