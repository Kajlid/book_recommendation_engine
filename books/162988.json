  "description": "Taz Aevos can make things fall with a single glance. Of all the random and bizarre powers that she and her three sisters were born with, hers is clearly the most useless. That is, until New Year’s Eve. When high school senior Stryder Black executes a cruel joke, Taz uses her powers, and all hell breaks loose. Stryder’s ill-fated prank lands him straight into a mysterious stranger's powerful curse—one meant to teach him a lesson. Desperate for help, Stryder unwittingly drags Taz into the curse with him. Now both are forced to relive the same twenty days of their lives over and over. But something goes deadly wrong. Not only is their loop mysteriously shrinking, Taz learns that Stryder is harboring a dark secret. Is his murky past the key to helping them escape…or will their time run out?",
