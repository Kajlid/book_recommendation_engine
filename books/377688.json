  "description": "Sometimes, slaying the dragon is the easy part. The medieval village of Markesew was besieged, its virgins demanded in tribute, so when St. George the Dragonslayer arrived from modern times -- in his silver pants and lace-up boots -- his task was clear. Being a professional wrestler didn't qualify him for the job, but a sword and imagination were all he needed... or so he thought, until he came up against the mysterious mistress of Devil's Mount.Twelve years ago Alizon had been sent to die in the jaws of the serpent. Too tough for dragon teeth then, she'd never surrender to some foreigner in shiny hose now. She feared first for the secret world she'd built atop the dragon's mountain... but as the hero approached, Alizon realized it was not the dragon's armor he had come to pierce, but the scales around her own ferocious heart.",
