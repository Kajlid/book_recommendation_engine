  "title": "My lord Foxe",
  "description": "It is the reign of Charles I, the \"Royal Martyr.\" This tragic passage of English history provides a backdrop for the story of Cavalier Brett Foxefield.Passionate and courageous, Foxe remains true to his sovereign, attempting to combat the growing power of the sternly righteous Oliver Cromwell. The beautiful and fiery Meredith Hartford, once a Puritan, now Lady Foxefield, struggles gallantly at her husband's side, but they are no match for Fate -- nor is their valor equal to the malignant influence of the debonair but villainous Duke of Buckingham or the selfishness of Charles' willful, sensuous Queen, Henrietta Maria.When the people realize that they prefer the King, regardless of his weaknesses, to the cheerless oppression of the Roundheads, it is already too late. Charles is declared a traitor and he cannot escape the waiting scaffold. Foxefield must stand by, bitterly observing this infamous execution; Meredith knows only that their love for each other will see them through the storm future.",
