  "description": "A man wakes in a changed city.  Always the outsider, the man has for the past two decades made his home in Taipei, one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Now the screams rising up from the streets herald the truth. His adopted homeland has changed overnight, and nothing will ever be the same.  They are coming.  John Jay McCarty has written a tremendously taught thriller, combining his intimate knowledge of the land and people with a horrifying story of a culture destroyed. The shattering realism of McCarty's Taiwan and his central anti-hero both contribute to a believable, claustrophobic, and frightening tale of nightmares come to life.  When the laws of God and man are gone, what takes their place? When death stalks every decision, and one man is forced to rely entirely on himself, a bitter road is carved out of the chaos around him. But can there be redemption for someone so deep in sin?",
