Even as the bond between them intensifies, and his self-control falters, Henri won’t risk losing his beloved again.When Henri takes Vincent as his demon-hunting apprentice, their combined abilities uncover corruption amongst the gods. Tempers flare and loyalties are tested as the lies meant to protect become the same ones that ensnare.And with divine forces attempting to coerce him at every turn, Henri must distinguish ally from enemy, and truth from deceit if he hopes to protect his bloodborn prince.Bloodborn Prince is the second installment of the Mortal and Divine trilogy. Blood crimes and betrayal abound.",
