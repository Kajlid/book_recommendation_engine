  "description": "Ashton I’ve shared an office with Dominic, the grumpy raincloud to my endless sunshine, for three and a half years. My roommates and colleagues are convinced I’m obsessed with him, and okay, maybe I am slightly curious about what he signed to me at the staff mid-winter party. Was it one of his normal snarky insults? A limerick? Directions to the nearest coffee shop? But am I ready to discover what Dominic actually wants to say to me? Love Language is a 13,000 word light and fluffy MM novella featuring a cantankerous computer programmer and a bubbly marketing assistant who unexpectedly learn that in the silence of gestures, love speaks the loudest.",
