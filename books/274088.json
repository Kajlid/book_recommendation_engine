  "description": "Felicia Perez, a carefree, hopeless flirt from Miami, is working a second job as a fitting model in Bangkok while saving up to expand her own clothing line. She loves women and her freedom and never shies away from going after what she wants.  Kate Simmons is a passionate interior designer who is married to her job. Her love for beauty is universal; she canâ€™t imagine tying herself down to anything that might limit her enjoyment of it, and that includes the shackles of a relationship.  When they meet in a hotel bar in Bangkok, they are instantly drawn to each other, but with both being used to having the upper hand, the situation is confusing to say the least. When two hunters cross paths, will one end up being the prey?  Together, they embark on a journey of self-discovery in the beautiful surroundings of exotic and mystical Thailand. Is the irresistible attraction between them merely the excitement of finally meeting their match or is the universe trying to steer them in the right direction?   Eastern Nights is part of the Compass Series but can also be read as a standalone.",
