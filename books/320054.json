As Luuk drifts away, Kevin will have to face his own truths—or lose the best thing to ever happen to him.The third book in The Cade Ranch Series, BUSTED, is a steamy M/M romance about finding love and holding it tight—no matter what people say.Trigger Warnings: Adult Situations and language. Themes of parental loss and pet loss. You might cry a little, but you’ll also laugh and cheer and fall in love. And there is always a guaranteed HEA.",
