  "title": "M Is For Moose: A Charles Pachter Alphabet",
  "description": "The marriage of words and image is a trend in contemporary art: visual artists are painting words, phrases, and sentences onto their canvases. Taking this trend and applying it to a children's book, Charles Pachter, one of Canada's pre-eminent visual artists, has reviewed forty years of work and matched a blend of familiar and new images with words that explore the idea of Canada. From 'Alberta' and 'autumn', through 'beaver' and 'butter tart', to a portrait of Margaret Atwood ('poet'), this beautiful book will delight children, parents, and grandparents alike. It contains reproductions of iconic paintings, such as the Queen patting a moose, and paintings of historical Canadian figures Pierre Elliot Trudeau, Susanna Moodie, and Wilfrid Laurier, along with short biographies for parents. Also included is the Canadian National Exhibition prize-winning recipe for butter tarts and a complete list of all illustrations in the book. With his talent joyfully evident on every page, M is for Moose celebrates Charles Pachter's continuing fascination with the marriage of words and images, his love of Canada, and his depth of understanding of our history.",
