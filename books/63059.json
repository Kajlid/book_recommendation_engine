  "title": "The Courage of Milo Minsky",
  "description": "Our main character is Milo Minsky, mild mannered mailman of River City, Iowa. Milo’s world is very much like our own, except that supernatural creatures like faeries, vampires and werewolves are quite real and cause frequent problems for one another. Knowing this, Milo prefers to keep to himself, working his job and enjoying the company of friends. He has a cozy little life. Unfortunately, there are times when one must rise to the occasion. When Milo finds that the daughter of his secret crush has been kidnapped, he vows to investigate the problem. The more he finds out about the girl’s disappearance, the more he realizes that the kidnapping was of a paranormal nature and redeeming the child might be out of his depth. Thankfully, Milo has friends who can help.This book is aimed at readers ages 12 and up. It was originally intended as Young Adult fiction, but I hope, as is the case with most YA literature, it holds enjoyable qualities for older readers as well.",
