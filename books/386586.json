  "description": "Thorn is a little dragon with a huge destiny - and the weight of responsibility hangs heavy on his immature shoulders. He feels he has done a terrible thing, condemning an innocent female hatchling to a dreadful subterranean fate, when all she did was try to help him in his hour of need. So he must find her and rescue her. Little does he know that his perilous quest will bring him face-to-face with blob monsters, terrifying living skeletons, a ravenous giant pitcher plant and eventually the supreme The Vile One himself, Darkmaw. Can Thorn - the outcast, the misfit - achieve what no other dragon has achieved before and defeat the embodiment of evil? This third book in Paul Benthom's epic series combines vivid fantasy with sound moral sense, and will entertain and thrill adults and children alike.",
