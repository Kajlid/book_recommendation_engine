The global response to this gripping tale has been passionate—an echo of the global outcry during the political upheaval of the summer of 2009. \n \nZahra’s Paradise is a first on the internet, a first for graphic novels, and a first in the history of political dissidence. Zahra’s Paradise is being serialized online at zahrasparadise.com.\n \n\nZahra’s Paradise is a Publishers Weekly Best Comics title for 2011.",
