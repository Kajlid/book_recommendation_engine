  "description": "She's not afraid of big, bad WEREWOLVES. They're afraid of HER.\n\nThe War of Eternal Hunger freed witches from the rule of werewolves, ending a patriarchy only to create a matriarchy. A thousand years later, Oriana, Matriarch of Steelcross and Crimson Hunter, is a young, untried ruler who seeks to bridge the divide between witches and werewolves. But how can witches trust werewolves not to hurt them when Rage Disrupter collars are needed to control their lust for witch's blood and magic? And how can werewolves trust witches to treat them as equals when they've built metal cities and armed themselves, literally, with iron weapons of werewolf destruction?\nMarrok is a Clan of the Black Moon werewolf. When he meets and falls in love with Oriana, he knows action must be taken to stave off his lust for her blood and magic. However, witches are the warm sun to werewolves' cold moon. Is it possible for them to share the same sky? Or will Marrok betray Oriana - his bloodlust stronger than his love?\nClaws and fangs.\nMagic and metal.\nWill one side devour the other, or will they find a way to peacefully coexist?\nWelcome to Earth Rift, where the moon is black, and the sun is crimson.",
