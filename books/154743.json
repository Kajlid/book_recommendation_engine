Then his wife had a stillbirth and his world fell apart.He listened to the unwanted apologies, stood by his wife as was expected of him, and kept his fa√ßade strong and firm for the entire world to see.But does he have the strength to let go and really grieve?When Ren Wakahisa landed in Croatia he was hoping to escape the cultural pressures put on him to conform. His family wanted him to forsake love for duty. They viewed his happiness as secondary to familial prosperity.Does he have the courage to be who he wants to be? Or, will he yield to their wishes?Summer Symphony is the story of how two men find their answers and what they learn about strength, and grace, and the endurance of love.",
