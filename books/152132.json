  "title": "Dairy Cows and Duck Races: The Tale of a Young Farmer",
  "description": "\"Skilfully crafted tales of farming life that veer seamlessly between enchanting and explicit, hilarious and heart-breaking\" - Paul Radford, former Reuters Senior editor As a boy, all Philip Dixon wanted to be in life was a farmer, but getting there would be a lot less straightforward than he'd anticipated! Starting work on a farm at the age of fifteen, he found himself handling some highly temperamental bulls, meeting some very “witchy” women, getting married and raising a family, acquiring his own farm and became part of the Round Table team that invented the plastic duck race! Enjoy Philip's story, as he makes progress in his farming career in the north east of England from the 1960s to the mid-1980s, meeting some remarkable characters, some of whom belong to an age all but lost to us. Philip's story will, at times have you laughing out loud. At other times it will have you weeping tears of sympathy for the hard knocks that life gives him, and lift your spirits as you read how he overcomes all, to make plans for a new future.",
