  "title": "The book of Lenity",
  "description": "Lenity is an anchor for me during interactions with others.It is a reminder that whilst I must have empathy & be considerate of my actions, I must just as importantly insist on the same in return.I must maintain my own dignity as I define it & not let others dictate who I choose to be.I am fallible & will make mistakes but I am also humble & wish to learn and grow.That is the concept of Lenity.It is how I choose to carry myself in life & is my gift to distribute to those who wish to receive it.May it inspire those whoâ€™s burdens are heavy..",
