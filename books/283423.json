  "description": "Only 22 years old. A 14-month-old baby. And a newborn who isn’t well. Overwhelming.Eva Doherty Gremmert’s life seems like a story book before the birth of her second son, Nicholas James Gremmert. Her first son is hitting all the textbook milestones while Nick is born distant and unresponsive to her. This young woman, with no medical diagnostic experience, inherently knows that something is dreadfully wrong with her son. Seeking answers from the medical professionals caring for Nick, she quickly realizes they won’t acknowledge his birth defects. All the answers they give are cold and unfeeling, simply given to send her away.This brilliant, highly capable mom then turns her mind to discovering her son’s real condition and ways to help him begin to thrive. Eva sought out and found the most cutting-edge pediatric neurologist who became her ally, mentor and friend. And thus began her 40-year transformational journey raising Nick with multiple disabilities and a rare life-threatening illness.Sharing many of the stark, yet often joyful, events of her fight for Nick over his lifetime, Eva eloquently and vividly portrays finding her way forward on her challenging path. At times light and funny, and then dark and foreboding, her story inspires us to unflinchingly strive in the face of all odds. And to find joy in the journey: joy in her son, joy in her family, and joy in her life. Her story inspires readers to unflinchingly strive in the face of all odds.",
