  "description": "Hamish and Mirren live in a quiet farmhouse by a beautiful loch in Scotland. In these six tales, they encounter a talking sea urchin, a strange flute, singing sand, the Wee Folk and their idea of 'spring cleaning', and Grizelda Grimithistle, a mischievous wee witch who, not content with stealing warm creamy milk direct from their cow, sets about helping herself to Mirren's freshly-died hanks of wool. Moira Miller's characteristic wit and humour shine through in this delightful collection of stories.",
