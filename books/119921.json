  "title": "Jùjú: A Social History and Ethnography of an African Popular Music",
  "description": "Now known internationally through the recordings of King Sunny Ade and others, juju music originated more than fifty years ago among the Yoruba of Nigeria. This history and ethnography of juju is the first detailed account of the evolution and social significance of a West African popular music. Enhanced with maps, color photographs of musicians and dance parties, musical transcriptions, interviews with musicians, and a glossary of Yoruba terms, Juju is an invaluable contribution to scholarship and a boon to fans who want to discover the roots of this vibrant music.\"What's most impressive about Juju is how much Waterman makes of his purism. By concentrating on one long- lived, well-defined genre, he helps the Western reader experience 'rock' the way any proud Yoruba would—as a tributary of African music rather than vice versa.\"—Robert Christgau, The Village VoiceThe companion cassette tape contains examples of the music discussed in the text. The music examples are primarily from commercial recordings from the 1930s to the 1980s.",
