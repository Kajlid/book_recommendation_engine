  "title": "Pure Abandon",
  "description": "Temptation comes in many forms. For me, it was in the soul-searing golden eyes of a magnanimous CEO. It all started when I decided to go back to work. After putting my career on hold, I told my husband I wanted to reclaim the woman I once was. My intentions were pure, and my heart belonged to my husband. Then, I met him. Alexander Asher is arrogant. Rude and dismissive, he got under my skin. I absolutely hated working for the Manhattan playboy and heir to his family’s fortune. Then, a misunderstanding led to friendship, the friendship becomes fierce, and soon I found myself questioning Asher’s motives … and my own.I shouldn’t feel this way. I fought the temptation until one dark secret had me rethinking everything, especially what I once thought was perfect. I tried to fight it. I failed. Two men are devastatingly broken by my actions—and I can only fix one. But when I make my choice, will he even want me after all that’s happened?",
