  "title": "The Equinox",
  "description": "It has existed for centuries. A dark curse held captive by ancient ritual, a creature of insatiable hunger possessing the ability to change shape at will. During spring and fall equinox it would break through the walls separating our worlds and roam the spirit woods of Chocktee to feed. Now it walks among us-unrestrained-and it’s hungry. Banished from the Chocktee Nation, and obsessed with vengeance, Daniel Blackbird has been chasing the “Walker” across North America for over 14 years. Bearing a scar from his first encounter, he feels its telepathic pull and is drawn in whatever direction it moves, but it always seems to be one step ahead of him. Until now.",
