Reunited by a miracle, they have little time for bliss as their idyllic existence is once again threatened.When an assortment of criminals and hunters come calling, the Sinclairs learn that home isn’t always a safe haven -- even for a couple of vampires!Gone are the coffins that contain a handful of dirt from the homeland. Gone too are the crosses, wreathes of garlic flowers and all the things you thought would keep you safe.Night after night the Sinclairs prowl neighboring cities ridding them of their criminal element with style, humor and marital devotion reminiscent of Nick and Nora Charles. Amid plots and subplots, Margaret Anne leads Maxwell into a world of computers and cars, he recounts tales from an earlier era and they both lead an intrepid vampire hunter on a merry chase.What Luck is a about greed, violence, unconditional loyalty and a love that refused to die. Not today’s typical vampire fare – these characters are seasoned with a pinch of humor and a dash of class.",
