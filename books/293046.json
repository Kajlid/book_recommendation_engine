  "description": "Walter Abbott has spent more than a decade searching for his lost love, but when he finally has her in his grasp, world events conspire to tear them apart again.  June Clay has been stuck in limbo for years, desperate to leave, but manipulated into staying. Only one thing could keep her away from Walter all this time, and that same thing was forever just out of her reach. Now she’s back in Clay Creek searching for answers and hoping against hope that they will lead her to the love and family she’s been dreaming of since she was sixteen years old.  But Walter returns from WWII a changed man, his confidence and swagger gone. What he forgets is that staying away from June has always been nigh on impossible and she’s going to make sure he remembers.  Together, they might find what’s missing, especially if it’s right under their noses.   This is the second book in the Abbott Family series.  Follow Walter from the Nashville music scene to the shores of French North Africa and back home again to the mountains of Clay Creek, West Virginia.  June has been on a mission of her own, from the lonesome shores of eastern Maryland, to her old family homestead in Clay Creek.  With Warren and Clara (Book 1) on love’s side, Walter and June can’t help but reconnect for a second chance.  CW for those sensitive to veterans’ issues.
