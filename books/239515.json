  "description": "First American Publication. When the two collections from which these 15 stories are selected were published by Oberon Press of Ottawa, they were greeted with much acclaim in Canada. The Toronto Star called Mr. Bonnie's work \"consistently excellent.\" The Montreal Gazette said that Bonnie \"uses the short story as it's meant to be to illuminate one event or emotion. . . . Bonnie has a deep sense of humanity, and his writing is clear and gritty.\" Books in Canada wrote, \"These stories evoke tenderness, pity, and more than a few laughs in the way that Raymond Carver's do.\" And The Vancouver Sun, reviewing Displaced Persons, commented that, \"The lead story, 'Selling Delphinium,' is a minor masterpiece, worthy of Anton Chekhov.\" In this collection, which Mr. Bonnie has revised extensively, the human experience is examined as it unfurls for people of all ages, as they become involved in minor struggles that-as we all know-can loom in major ways during the existential moment. Through obstinate wit, resourcefulness, and a modicum of luck, Fred Bonnie's people triumph, often in hilarious and unexpected ways.",
