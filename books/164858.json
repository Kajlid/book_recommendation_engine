  "description": "What could be worse than middle school? Home work, band class, bullies, a new kid who may be a new friend...Andy McBean is struggling to survive it all in the soggy hills of the Pacific Northwest. Even worse, he spent much of the past year in the hospital battling leukemia. Then one night a meteor storm devastates the county, cutting off power and phones. One giant rock crashes into Andy's neighborhood, skids up the street, and stops right on Andy’s front lawn. The towering boulder draws the attention of neighbors, the media, the army, and even the new girl from Andy’s art class. He is thrilled at the notoriety, but everything changes when the meteor opens and a towering machine steps out. Separated from his family, Andy must fend for himself and rescue his friends. Join the adventure as Andy meets an alien, devises a plan to stop the invasion, and learns how strong he really is.",
