When their very different worlds collide, can they find what they need in each other?  Stunned by what she's just seen at Peter’s house, Isabel flees to the forest. In her shock and confusion, she veers off the main track and can’t find her way back. The possibility of spending a night lost and alone in the Gila wilderness suddenly becomes very real.  Just as her panic reaches its peak, Jed, the sexy sheriff comes to her rescue for the second time. Isabel can’t help but be tempted by Jed’s easy-going charms, but it’s not long before Peter’s onto his scent, and the consequences prove explosive.  There’s no way that Peter’s going to get away without some explanation for his recent behavior, and being pushed into a corner somehow brings out his softer side. It seems like, maybe, just maybe, Peter could be boyfriend material, but the full moon is near, and disaster is following close behind.
