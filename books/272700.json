  "description": "The last thing Oliver Huang expects to see on the historic Mount Morris home tour is longtime acquaintance Fay Liu bustling up and kissing him hello. He's happy to playact being a couple to save her from a pushy admirer. Fay's beautiful, successful and smart, and if he's being honest, Oliver has always had a bit of a thing for her. Maybe more than a bit. Geeking out over architectural details is Oliver and Fay's shared love language, and soon they're touring pricey real estate across Upper Manhattan as the terribly faux but terribly charming couple Darling and Olly. For the first time since being laid off from the job he loved, Oliver has something to look forward to. And for the first time since her divorce, Fay's having fun. Somewhere between the light-filled living rooms and spacious closets they've explored, this faux relationship just may have sparked some very real feelings.",
