Incendiary.Ten years ago, Moira shared one hot night with the bear-shifter of her dreams, but when she took him up on his offer to join him at the Lone Pine Pride, reality landed with a thud. She quickly realized that he was only looking for a momentary distraction, not a happily ever after.She’s been trying to get over him ever since, but no other shifter has measured up to the big bad bear.When Hugo met Moira in a Yukon bar, he poured out his unrequited love for his alpha’s mate as he pounded down drinks. While Hugo remembers telling Moira he was emotionally unavailable, apparently she only heard his need for sexual healing.He’s always felt guilty for unintentionally leading her on. But now that the woman he thought he wanted is finally available, he’s beginning to wonder if the one he really needs is the woman with whom he shared one incendiary night—then let slip through his fingers.Warning: This book contains a stubborn old bear, mixed messages, mixed-up emotions,and lots of mixed drinks. Before reading, remember that the best cure for a hangover is NOT “hair of the bear”.",
