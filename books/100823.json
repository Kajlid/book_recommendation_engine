  "description": "It's been a year since Michael Riley was stranded in this world. A year of changes and shocks and repercussions that are still reverberating through the known lands. New technologies are emerging; new tools of production and destruction are being constructed; new schools of thought and learning; new ways of doing things; new possibilitiesâ€¦Countries that have brooded though uneasy peace for decades are stirring and starting to take a closer look at these possibilities and this stranger in their midst, and what they see both intrigue and disturb them. Questions are being asked, demands are being made, and old alliances are being tested.At the sharp end of this Michael is still trying to survive. Sent on a diplomatic trip as a peace offering to a neighboring ally he finds the balance of power in an alien world wasn't quite as he had expected. When things start to spiral out of control he finds his limits tested as he fights to stay alive, find out who his friends really are, and prove he isn't a threat to the entire known world. But his biggest problem seems to be that it's the good guys who want him dead.",
