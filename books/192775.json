  "description": "He’s not the guy you date.He’s the one night stand.You’d think the man who sends hot looks my way, who called me succulent, would want to strip me to my skin and spread me out on his bed like every other woman in Chicago.Except he passed on my offer….Just like I once did on his.He’s wary, like I am.He’s broken, like I am.And everyone knows two broken parts can’t ever make a whole. So I try to distract myself. I’m back to dating.Tahoe and I are strictly friends. He doesn’t think my new beau is good enough, but to him, no man is good enough for me. Especially Tahoe himself.But the more time Tahoe and I spend around each other, the more confused I feel. I'm trying to open myself to love.But I'm quickly realizing that the only man I want is stubborn, cocky, unattainable playboy Tahoe Roth.The one your mother warned you about.The one my body craves.The only one who will surely break my heart.",
