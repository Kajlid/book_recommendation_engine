  "description": "This is the FoxTales version of the work previously released through Samhain Publishing. Other than the cover material, the book is the same.Shattered by his lover Jason’s suicide, archaeologist Dan Logan is struggling to patch his life together again. He’s desperately following up Jason’s final obsession, a secret buried deep within the military zone on Salisbury Plain. Anything is better than facing the void of his grief.He’s convinced he’ll never love again. When unexpected help arrives in the form of a soldier named Summer Rayne, the last thing Dan could have predicted is the spark of attraction between them. And at first their relationship is fraught with so much conflict, their investigation into the circumstances of Jason’s death looks more likely to cause one of their own.But Rayne is smart, and very kind beneath his soldierly reserve. As the mystery of the Plain begins to vortex around them, dangerous secrets emerge, and Rayne and Dan have to work closely together to protect one another and the sanctity of Jason’s memory. A wild new romance takes fire against all odds in the heat of a Salisbury summer, and the soldier and the archaeologist are only on the brink of the mystery of the legendary Salisbury Key.",
