  "description": "Ailsa has just left school and should be living it up on a summer trip, but her plans are scuppered by her needy and secretive mother Lorraine. In desperation she takes up with local fishmonger Ian. He’s good for her soul and her sex-life, but their future is blighted by the shadow of Ailsa’s absent father Tom, an art-teacher who left home after hitting the headlines for the worst of all reasons... When Ian eventually blots his copy book and Lorraine is implicated in his treachery, Ailsa takes off for Edinburgh where Shane, a shady picture rights dealer, is happy to provide a job and a bed. With him Ailsa lets go of her inhibitions, but can she let go of her past? A rollercoaster family drama described as ‘harsh, gritty yet lyrical’, A Kettle of Fish moves from the East coast of Fife to the art galleries of Edinburgh, where Ailsa finds herself fishing for clues about Tom.",
