  "description": "Levi has always been on the outside looking in. When your best friends make up one of the most famous rock bands in the country, living at the edge of the spotlight comes with the territory. Levi was pretty happy with the way things were; after all, helping the Ransome boys achieve their dreams was his dream too.  But all of that changed when Levi fell for lead singer Daltrey Ransome’s girl. These days, his outsider status is a lot less metaphorical. Levi has been cast aside, no longer welcome, no longer an essential part of the Ransom machine. He’s on his own—and he has no intention of ever coming back.  His fiercely guarded exile comes crashing down the day she walks into his new life. Gorgeous, confident Karen Simpson—with her own collection of outsider issues—is the last person he expected to see in his middle-of-nowhere hiding place, but for one night they might be able to help each other to not feel so alone…even if the light of Karen’s presence does help to illuminate just how colorless and unsatisfactory Levi’s current situation truly is.  When one of the Ransome boys confesses that he needs Levi’s help, everything changes again. Now Levi has no choice but to go back to the life he left behind.  And Karen may be the only person in the world who can help him regain all the things that he has lost.",
