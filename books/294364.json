  "description": "\"I really can't recommend this book enough!\" -Book Addict, Amazon Top 500 Reviewer\nNot once did he doubt she was meant for him... \n\nA fresh start. That's all single mother Jenifer Nichols has in mind when she moves into her new home. In the wake of her estranged husband's death, Jenifer has stopped believing in happy endings. Fate, however, has different plans when firefighter Matt Barnes saves her son's life. Matt is patient, persistent, and no stranger to disillusion. He, too, has a past. Yet Matt knows that while his heart already belongs to her, winning Jenifer's heart will take more time. Redefining family is complicated, and second chances take courage and commitment. But this time, the happily ever after could just go up in smoke.",
