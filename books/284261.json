  "description": "In this charming contemporary romance, sure to delight readers of Rachel Gibson and Susan Elizabeth Phillips, a bad girl gone good meets her match when an old flame comes to town. When life goes awry for wild and sexy Julia Boudreaux, she packs up her stiletto heels and swears off guys who spell nothing but trouble. And to keep her job in television, she decides to create a TV hit—a makeover show. She’s going to turn rugged West Texas men into sensitive guys. Easier pitched than done. Undercover cop Ben Prescott is so sexy it hurts. Back in Julia’s orbit after a brush with a bullet, Ben steers clear of the woman who used to set his blood afire. She’s changed from Mae West to Mother Teresa, and she’s trying to put him in touch with his emotions. But when life heats up, will this rugged hunk risk everything for a woman who’s about to lose it all?",
