She thinks she knows all of his secrets.  She’s wrong.  For years someone else has sought Severin’s attention – a man she never suspected. When the situation implodes, she’s no longer sure where she stands.  New trouble reopens old wounds. Their unstable three-way relationship threatens to collapse. Will Severin’s two lovers be able to save him from self-destruction, or will they need to abandon the man who owns their hearts?  Warning: Dark themes. Character's memories of prior abuse may disturb some readers.",
