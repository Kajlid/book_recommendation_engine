  "description": "The victims were as different as night and an exotic dancer, a beloved teacher, and a promising law student. What was the one thing they had in common? A fetish for breath play... Homicide Detective Jillian Robichaux is smart and persistent. When a string of brutal murders hits the Big Easy's ultra-secretive BDSM community and threatens to expose high-profile members of its conservative Southern culture, Jillian rolls up her sleeves and gets to work piecing together the victims' last steps. In her search for the truth, she enlists the expertise of FBI agent, AJ Johnson III. But with each clue they uncover, the deeper Jillian is lured into the underground world of sadomasochism--and into the strong arms of the domineering criminal profiler. Only one question remains. How far will she go? In the world's first provocative thriller of its kind, bestselling author Kat Evans takes you on a heart-pounding race to catch a killer.",
