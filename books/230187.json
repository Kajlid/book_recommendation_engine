  "description": "They call him the puppet master. They say he’s dirty, dark and dangerous. And they’re right. He’s everything they say he is, and more. So much more.  Alexander Henley has no idea I exist. No idea whatsoever how much I want him. But that’s all about to change. Because if there’s one thing I know about the puppet master, it’s that he pays well to pull women’s strings. And I’m going to be his next purchase.",
