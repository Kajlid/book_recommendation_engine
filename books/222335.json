He was her second in command, her best friend...and now, she wants more.Zyren has no interest in any female. His true mate died centuries ago and his heart went with her soul to the grave. Natalia knows this, and despite his obvious lack of interest, she will stop at nothing to force him into mating her, even threatening the only female he loves as much as he loved his mate -his sister.Having survived one war to freedom to find himself enslaved and possibly bound to another was not the life he fought for. Will destiny have mercy on this warrior? Or will he be forced to live another lifetime bound by invisible chains of a loveless arrangement?",
