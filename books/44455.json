  "description": "This debut novel by Kate O Lynch is about Jill, who is a scrapbooker and recent college graduate.  She is learning to balance her first grown-up job with her social and love lives.  Every month she escapes the chaos of her life and spends a Friday night at her local scrapbook store that hosts a \"crop\". There she can work on creating scrapbook layouts with her group of crop girls. The only thing she has in common with these ladies is the love of scrapbooking. However, scrapbooking isn't all this book is about.  In true chicklit form, there is a romantic dilemma. Jill must choose between Adam (a new acquaintance) and Brian (an old high school friend) to be her love interest.",
