  "description": "Depraved DuoMichelle Michaud was a suburban northern California mother and a part-time prostitute. James Daveggio was a drug abuser and violent rapist. Together, they forged one of the most perverse alliances in criminal history - and in September 1997 - began a nightmare spree of incest, kidnapping, rape, torture...and maybe, murder.Torture VanAfter customizing Michaud's green minivan into the ultimate mobile torture chamber, the predatory pair hit the road to hell. From California to Nevada, they abducted defenseless young women, including one of Daveggio's own relatives, and forced them to endure hours—sometimes days—of unspeakable sexual acts in their orgy of terror.Rope BurnsEventually captured by police, Michaud and Daveggio were convicted on May 19, 1999 for the abduction and rape of 20–year-old Juanita Rodriguez in Reno, Nevada. They have also been indicted for the first degree murder of Vanessa Samson, 22, in Pleasanton, California. Now awaiting trial, they face a possible conviction that could condemn them both to die by lethal injection.16 Pages Of Shocking Photos!",
