When Lia wins Â£8 million on the lottery, though, suddenly everything is different.But will Lia's millions create more problems than they solve?Firstly, a resentful gang of girls at school set up a 'We Hate Lia Latimer' Facebook group . . . that soon has fans in the thousands. Her friend Shazia can't have anything to do with Lia's new-found fortune, believing gambling to be immoral. The mum of her other best friend, Jack, is threatening to sue Lia for what she believes to be his share of the winnings. Raf's behaviour is getting stranger and stranger, and Lia can't help but wonder whether there's something to the school rumours that he's not . . . well, human.And when her sister Natalie goes missing, Lia begins to wonder if a millionaire lifestyle is all it's cracked up to be. . .",
