  "title": "Heal Yourself by Clearing the Chakras",
  "description": "Many spiritual seekers know we have a personal energy field, which has several energy centers, called chakras. The chakras are openings that allow high-frequency energy to stream from our spiritual selves into our lower beings. When the chakras are blocked, our creativity is lowered, our spiritual well-being drops and mental and physical diseases might result. Each of the seven main chakras is linked to a specific type of creative energy or spiritual ray. The key to keeping your chakras open is to use the energy of the corresponding ray. In this book, the ascended masters give profound teachings on how to purify your chakras by using the seven spiritual rays.",
