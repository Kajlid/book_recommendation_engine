  "description": "Plagued by strange symbols he doesn’t understand, Prince Cleo agrees to the only path open to him—a life of solitude in the priory. But fate has a very different plan.With their kingdom fighting for survival, a wedding isn’t on the cards for Thorne. A good brother and fighter, he’s willing to do anything to protect his home. He’d be a good husband too, but he’s not the kind of alpha a typical omega falls for. His future looks lonely until he finds an omega prince washed up on the shore.Cleo always wished he’d been born a normal omega, the kind that went on the marriage circuit and found themselves a husband. That Cleo would never have fallen overboard during a storm and wound up stranded on a deserted island with an alpha prince. Maybe he can’t have the life he’s always wanted, but he can pretend, just for a little while.Alpha’s Oath is the second book of the Stormshield series. It’s a m/m shifter romance with a dash of magic. It contains mpreg and mature themes.",
