  "description": "A stranger came to town and stole her heart. Sue Pringle has never met anyone like John Darnay before. A painter who roams the countryside with brush in hand, Darnay is so absorbed in his art that he can barely remember to feed himself -- a stark contrast to the practical shopkeepers and shepherds of her tiny village. Working as his housekeeper allows Sue to observe the eccentric Darnay unnoticed as he goes about his work translating the beautiful Scottish countryside onto canvas... and Sue soon realizes that not only has she been transfixed by his arresting artwork, she has fallen in love with Darnay himself. But will he ever look up from his paints long enough to love her back?",
