  "description": "Eddy knows how to play the game. He is, after all, the writer, director, and cameraman—the mastermind, really—behind the hit online TV show Riot Grrl 16 . When it wins a contest to be aired on MTV (and it obviously will—have you seen the competition?), he'll be famous. Then there's the game of love. Eddy knows all the tricks, and his favorite girls are the ones with the fishnets and cherry lipstick and legs up to there. The ones who know he doesn't make any promises. The ones who are cool with it. But as graduation looms, everything and everyone starts deviating from Eddy's master script. Never in a million years did he expect to be facing off again with the unapproachable, perfect Lucinda Dulko. For once in his life, he's not in control—and to be with Lucinda, he's willing to get swept up in the game. But what happens to a player when the rules suddenly change? Can Eddy find a way to win it all? Or will he get played?",
