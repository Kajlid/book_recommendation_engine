  "description": "ADAMAt forty-three, I've experienced my fair share of love and even betrayal.That very same heartbreak gave me the gift of two adolescent boys, and I owe it to them to be a good example.But the proverbial girl next door has captured my attention and has me craving things I shouldn't want. Not with Everly. Itâ€™s almost shameful how much of my headspace is consumed by someone half my age.EVERLYI may be young, but I'm no stranger to failed relationships and heartbreak. In fact, the last time I fell in love, it almost killed me.But everything about Adam, the sexy and much older man next door, draws me in. I don't care that he's nearly twice my age or that he has two young sons. I would do just about anything to make him mine.Can I convince him that age is just a number, or will he shut me out because he's also my uncle's good friend?",
