Isobe, jarred by the death of the wife he barely noticed during her lifetime, is searching for proof of reincarnation.Kiguchi, a survivor of the horrific jungle fighting in Burma during WW II, wishes to bring peace to the souls of his war comrades. Numada, recovering from illness is an author of children's books about animals and nature who seeks a communion with nature. The beautiful but often cruel Mitsuko has come to search once again for Otsu, the pious Christian she first seduced during their college days. Leading the tour is Enami, a young man torn between his own passion for India and his compassion for his troubled countrymen. Endo ruthlessly probes the moral dilemmas facing each and paints a vivid picture of the river and its deep significance to the Indian culture - and its surprising effect on the five tourists.",
