  "title": "Heretics / Orthodoxy",
  "description": "This Nelson Royal Classic includes two famous classical works by G.K. Chesterton, Heretics and Orthodoxy. In response to the wrong doctrinal teaching of many of his contemporaries, G.K. Chesterton takes readers back to the \"fundamentals\" in Heretics. In the compelling work,Orthodoxy, Chesterton provides a look at what some have described as his own spiritual autobiography. Of these two books, they describe some of a Christian's core beliefs and capture the essence of the Christian experience. They remain an essential part of every Christian's library, and continue to challenge the way we conceive our faith and our world.",
