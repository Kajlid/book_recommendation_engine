  "description": "The classic future history of human intelligence from one of the fathers of science fiction.In his epic Last and First Men Olaf Stapledon decribes the evolution of mankind through the ages, reaching the very heights of civilization at one point, descending to the depths of near-extinction at the next, surviving onslaughts from other planets and overcoming the waning of solar energy, but always developing new thoughts, new abilities and new means of survival. The enormous scope of this great classic makes it one of the finest future histories ever written, a true master work of science fiction.Cover illustration: Peter Goodfellow",
