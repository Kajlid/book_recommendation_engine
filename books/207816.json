  "title": "These Are My Friends on Politics",
  "description": "It happens, every day, often without warning. Normal grown adults — completely capable ones who do things like go to work, pay bills and help their children do homework — stumble, often accidentally, into a discussion about politics. At least, it starts as a discussion. More often than anyone cares to admit, it descends into an argument, a blowout and eventually a volleyball match of personal attacks and insults these ostensibly fully together adults didn't even know they had in them.Vibrantly illustrated and sharply but warmly written, These Are My Friends on Politics hilariously lampoons this transformation, chronicling how an election year turns the reasonable adults we aspire to be into nothing better than vicious, bickering children.",
