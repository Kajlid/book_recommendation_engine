  "description": "Pierre Van Rooyen’s latest novel, Saturdays Are Gold, was nominated for The Guardian’s Not the Booker Prize 2011. Set in 1940s Johannesburg, it explores the innocence of childhood in an adult world of prohibition, superstition, sorcery, divination, child abduction and muti murder. Seven year old Maudie is kidnapped because she witnesses a muti murder and her brother, nine year Tadpole, is the only one who can rescue her.Reminiscent of the memoirs of Alexandra Fuller, Pierre Van Rooyen’s writing is filled with adventure, hilarious antics and fun-filled characters from Babs, the children’s alcoholic half-aunt who drives the local breakdown lorry and parachutes from bi-planes, to Mr Sunshine, the suave African salesman who lugs around a suitcase big enough to stuff a child inside.",
