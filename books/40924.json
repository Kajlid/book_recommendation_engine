  "description": "Lori shares openly and honestly with her audience while finding God as well as the fun in everyday situations. With her genuine spirit, She shares life as it is-the good, the bad, and the most hilarious of situations-and invites her readers to take the time to reflect with her on these things. Savor each chapter as God reveals who He is in a new and different way with each short story. Some books entertain you, others may teach you, but this one will hopefully inspire you to go out into the world and make a difference just one chapter at a time.",
