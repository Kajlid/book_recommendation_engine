  "description": "This free eBook short story fills in the gaps of Sophie Kinsella’s bestselling Shopaholic series, following Becky Brandon and her husband, Luke, as they start their luxurious yearlong honeymoon around the world. But these jet-setters are about to hit some turbulence. Becky and Luke are in Venice—the city of winding canals, gorgeous historic buildings, and, of course, exceptional shopping. To unwind from the stress of their wedding, Becky has planned an utterly blissful honeymoon where, for an entire year, they will hop from one country to the next—Italy to the Czech Republic to Sri Lanka and beyond—as they please. But lately, Luke has been more restless than relaxed. In fact, he seems (unbelievably!) like he wants to go home. Will Becky be able to save their dream vacation, or will their globe-trotting come to a sudden halt?",
