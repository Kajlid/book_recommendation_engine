  "description": "LEGEND HAS IT THAT IN 1376 THE CHILDREN OF A LITTLE GERMAN TOWN WERE LED EAST INTO TRANSYLVANIA BY THE RATTENFANGER, THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN...In bleak post-Ceausescu Romania, Dr Sasha Marcu, a psychiatric researcher absorbed with the high incidence of mental illness among the women of a remote Carpathian village, uncovers a horrific history of ritual child murder. After the latest incident, Marcu and police inspector Valentin almost succeeded in cornering their prime suspect who appears to elude justice by dying in a plane crash.Local cop Dave Durrant and his music teacher wife Diane seem to lead an idyllic life with their four children in the small lakeside town of Sunny Mead, New Hampshire. All that mars their contentment is the disability and muteness of their 13-year-old son, Pip.When Diane engages new arrival Diep Koppelberg as a therapist for Pip, Diep's charm and exceptional musical talent captivates all who meet him, and Diane, her teenage daughter and the two youngest Durrant children are gradually drawn to him to the point of infatuation.Only Pip sees Diep differently. Where others see beauty he sees only ugliness and decay. Where they see benevolence, he sees malice and unspeakable evil.",
