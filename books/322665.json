  "description": "Dear Fellow Bookworms,\nI need your help.I, Rachel Rose, am in quite the pickle with a hot-as-sin English Lit professor by the name of Ty Winslow, and I don’t know how to get out of it.Let me break it down for you:Girl meets Guy.Girl gives Guy her underwear on a dare but nothing else identifying (like her name or number) because she plans to never see Guy again.But Girl does see Guy again, in a very professional setting, where she is to be the Teaching Assistant to his Professor for an entire semester.Girl would like to ignore all events of the past, but Guy is a whole list of tempting things that are hard to resist. (See below:)#1: Insanely attractive.#2: The most fun a girl could ever have.#3: Successful and intelligent.#4: He can quote Walt Whitman at the drop of a hat—which I’m sure you know is a dangerous thing for a literature-lover.#5: Smooth with a capital S. He could charm the panties off a woman WITHOUT the help of a dare.And now, Mr. Hot Professor, the man I’m determined to resist, is challenging me to a competition—a playful, secret game, so to speak—where the winner takes all.My plan? Play the game long enough to win—long enough to walk away with the upper hand—without doing something stupid like falling in love.It’s possible . . . right?If you have any advice, please reach out to me soon—before it’s too late.XOXO,Rachel",
