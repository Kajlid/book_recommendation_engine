  "description": "One of the common sexual problems men face is premature ejaculation (PE). This happens when a man reaches his sexual peak within two minutes from the onset of sex with his partner. In extreme cases, climax usually occurs within 30 seconds of penetration. When this happens, both parties are left feeling distressed and not fully satisfied; for the woman, her distress comes from her needs not being met, especially if this is a regular occurrence. Distress for the man comes from feelings of embarrassment and humiliation which he feels at his not-too-excellent performance, especially if his partner gets vocal about her displeasure.About 30% of men worldwide go through quick ejaculation at one time or the other. A study by the National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS) places the percentage of men having premature ejaculation problems in the United States as 29%. Other studies report the following statistics:•30% of men in the UK•30.5% in Southeast Asian men•34% in African men•23.8% of men in AustraliaThe good news about premature ejaculation is that it is very treatable. Over 80% of men with premature ejaculation cure themselves either using self-help techniques or through the assistance of a sex therapist.This book details easy and natural ways Premature Ejaculation can be overcome.",
