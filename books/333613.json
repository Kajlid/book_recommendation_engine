  "title": "A Gracious Enemy & After the War Volume Two",
  "description": "This book covers the things I was forced to leave out of \"A Gracious Enemy & After the War Volume One.\" When the French forces at Dien Bien Phu were being threatened with destruction, during 1953-1954, \"Operation Vulture\" called for the US to bomb the Viet Minh positions using three nuclear bombs! It was only reluctance of the British to join in this scheme and the opposition from General Ridgeway (US) that ended that madness and operation Vulture was called off! This book also looks at the 'Tiger Cages' and the Third Indochina War during which Vietnam invaded Kampuchea and the Pol Pot administration fled into the Jungle! Also, there is an interview with Hun Sen which may help people understand more of what happened in Cambodia.",
