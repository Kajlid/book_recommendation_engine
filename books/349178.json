  "description": "In the epic conclusion to K.D. Edwards' first blockbuster trilogy in The Tarot Sequence series, readers followed Rune on a race against time as an age-old threat rose to threaten the city of New Atlantis. Now, for the first time, The Eidolon tells what really happened to Max, Quinn, and Anna as prisoners in the Hourglass Throne's base of operation.The Eidolon is a 200-page expansion to the story told in Book 3 of KD Edwards' main series, The Tarot Sequence. It begins to show the younger generation of the Sun Court coming together as a true team, which will lead to future novel-length story arcs set at Magnus Academy, New Atlantis's premier spellcasting school.The book was printed in partnership with Rainbow Crate, the world's largest queer subscription box service, which produced a limited-edition hardcover. The Audible and Kindle versions are available through Amazon. The eBook will begin appearing on more platforms, along with a paperback version, in Spring 2023.",
