In the New World what is left of humanity fights for dominance and a return to glory; because the Old World died in the Great Plague of 1666. But this plague carried a curse worse than pestilence, as the dead themselves attacked the living, adding them in their growing endless wave. Yet the truth behind the Risen plague and the Old Worldâ€™s death has never been told. In Port Royal, an old sailor is more than willing to spin his tale. Aye me lad, have a seat next to me and listen to the true story of the Black Brig. No one is going to tell you the truth in this Brave New World. Because Dead Men tell no tales. Set in an alternate historical setting, Dead Men Tell No Tales narrates the events that brought a great disaster to an end in 1676. Pirates, voodoo, and seagoing undead await you in this fantastic journey in a land that never was.NOTE: This is the short story. The whole novel is available as 'DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES - THE FULL TALE'.",
