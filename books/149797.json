  "description": "When Jackie travels to the South Downs in search of her childhood home, she uncovers a sinister secret lurking in the family closet. Her estranged brother, Chris, is her last remaining relative, but he has been transformed into something unrecognisable by the ghosts of the past. In her journey to discover the truth, Jackie enters a strange world of free-loving heathens, environmental warriors and sadistic priests, where dragons dwell beneath the streets of northern towns and demons prowl on the edge of Aveburyâ€™s stone circle. A gothic tale of love, revenge and atonement, Of Bodies Changed is an odyssey through the ancient myths that echo the human experience.",
