  "description": "The exaltation has come, the chosen have been taken and the deluge follows in their wake.It is the end of days, when the last children of darkness duel with each other for dominion.Now all hope rests in the forbidden arts, the powers of the night, the powers of the abyss â€“ for they are the only answer to the grey and hungry void.The seal is broken and the beast is loosed; cities will fall and black fires will burn the skies. And, at the last, when all truths are laid bare and no choices remain at all, that which is sacred will bring damnation, and that which is profane will save.",
