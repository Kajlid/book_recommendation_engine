  "description": "Magic And Envy In the Light of Qur'an & Sunnah By Sheikh Mohmmad M Al-Sha'rawi. Magic is a hidden force which gives the impression that something is happening when in reality it is not happening at all. Envy is lack of contentment with the decree and power of ALLAH, and we are asked to be content with what He gives us. This work, through detailed research, proves that magic is harmful and does not benefit anyone. The book explains the existence of the unseen forces we experience and the magic of the eye caused by the magician, which in fact is all a deception of the sight. The devils inspire the magicians, persuading them of their knowledge of the unseen, while in fact, they do not have any access to the unseen or sight into future. However, if the devil did have power, for example, he could have saved himself and his tribe from Prophet Sulayman's punishment. We know that although magic and envy are among the hidden forces of existence, they are forces whose existence is very real and about which God Almighty has told us. In His noble book, Allah has asked us to seek refuge with him from magic and envy by reciting Surat Al Falaq and Surat An Nas every night for protection.",
