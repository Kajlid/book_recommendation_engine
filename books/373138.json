  "title": "The Last Battle",
  "description": "For the first time, an edition of Lewis's classic fantasy fiction packaged specifically for adults. Complementing the look of the author's non-fiction books, and anticipating the forthcoming Narnia feature films, this edition contains an exclusive \"P.S.\" section about the history of the book, plus a round-up of the first six titles. The last days of Narnia, and all hope seems lost as lies and treachery interweave to threaten the destruction of everything. As the battle lines are drawn, old friends are summoned back to Narnia, though none can predict the outcome in this magnificent ending to the famous series. On 9 December 2005, Andrew (Shrek) Adamson's live-action film adaptation of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe will be released by Disney, and it is already being hailed as the biggest film franchise of all time, guaranteed to appeal to adults and children across the globe. The second film is already in development. Sporting breathtaking new photographic covers, these new adult editions of the seven Chronicles of Narnia now give everyone an opportunity to experience the adventures in their original form. Re-live your childhood fantasies or discover for the first time what everyone will be talking about by Christmas and savour some of the best-loved stories ever written.",
