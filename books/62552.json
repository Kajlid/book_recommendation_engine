  "description": "Every single day, he’s there. Waiting. Watching her. Closed in with her for a hundred stories as they ride the elevator to their floor. And every single day, for a hundred floors, Samantha simmers with banked lust. She wants him—her mysterious neighbor who seems to get off on tempting her. Whose eyes promise the kind of kinky domination she’s too afraid to give in to. And then just when she thinks she’s safe, just when she’s convinced she can resist his allure, he steps up his relentless pursuit. The passion that flares between them burns so hot and so bright it could consume them both. But that’s just on the way up. Who knows what will happen when they’re going down.Reader Advisory: Samantha’s sexy neighbor tries to drive her wild with lust, and he’ll stop at nothing to succeed. Spanking? Of course. Leather straps? You bet. Girl-on-girl action? Oh yeah. Wear your flame-retardant panties while reading this one.",
