  "title": "John Lydon's Metal Box: The Story of Public Image Ltd",
  "description": "In between fronting rock’s most iconoclastic group, the Sex Pistols, and reemerging in the twenty-first century as a reality TV hero on I’m A Celebrity , Lydon led Public Image Ltd., who merged disco, funk, and industrial punk to create coruscating soundscapes with catchy tunes—from “Death Disco” and “Flowers of Romance” to “Rise” and “This Is Not A Love Song”—and caused riots at their gigs. This is Public Image Ltd.’s terrifying story.",
