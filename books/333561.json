  "title": "Primo Levi: A Life",
  "description": "Primo Levi wrote books that have been called \"the essential works of humankind,\" including Survival in Auschwitz and The Periodic Table. Yet he lived an unremarkable existence, remaining to his death in the house in which he'd been born; managing a paint and varnish factory for thirty years; and tending his invalid mother to the end. Now, in a matchless account, Ian Thomson unravels the strands of an influential life.",
