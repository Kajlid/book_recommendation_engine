  "title": "If Only I Had a Green Nose",
  "description": "A green nose. How silly,  thought Punchinello. It wouldn't make him faster, stronger, or even smarter. It would only make him greener--and make him look just like all the other Wemmicks! Why would he want that when he knows Eli made each of them different for a reason?But when Punchinello stops visiting Eli regularly, a painted nose somehow doesn't seem as foolish anymore. Now more than ever, Punchinello needs to hear his maker say, \"I'll always help you be who I made you to be.\"Just like Punchinello, we all want to fit in. To be accepted by the crowd. But at times that may mean we either have to look and act like others--or risk being rejected.Punchinello's hard-earned lesson shows us how important it is to be who we were created to be, and why that matters. So let this wonderful tale help you remember two things: that you were made unique for a reason, and that there is one who will always help you be you--wonderfully you.",
