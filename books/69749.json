  "description": "When Jim and Emma meet late one night, instead of a romantic rendezvous they are confronted by strange sights. Shadows seen at the edge of sight turn into men who stalk them. No one else, even Abby, Emma’s twin sister, can see them. Are they ghosts, illusion, or something else? When Emma disappears, Jim must search for answers, with the help of an emotionally fragile Abby. Sometimes the answers we seek aren’t hidden in the shadows. Sometimes, although they are in plain sight, they remain peripheral.",
