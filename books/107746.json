  "title": "the daily THANKS: A daily reminder of the countless blessings in our lives.",
  "description": "Caught in the midst of a society in excess, we oftentimes get sucked into a comparison game with those whom society deems “successful” including our own family, our friends, our colleagues and public figures. Material possession, fame, influence, and beauty seem to be the standard of success, and in attempting to keep up with these ideals, we tend to lose sight of all the blessings we currently enjoy. Taking a step back and really looking at our lives, we find that riches surround us in the form of our friends, our health, our access to modern technology, and etc. If we take the time to assess our lives in comparison with those less fortunate than us, we will find that there are countless things to be thankful for. This book aims to be a daily reminder of such blessings. Beautifully illustrated, each entry conveys this simple be thankful for the bountiful joy with which you are blessed. Don’t lose sight of the happiness before you in pursuit of gaining someone else’s apparent success and joy.",
