  "description": "It isn’t easy being a high school nerd. Just ask Ren. He's a dork who gets picked on for collecting models of cheesy Japanese monsters. Of course, though, there are benefits to being nerdy. Ren's intelligence is admired by his classmates. He’s content with his secret status as a monsterphile until a very pretty girl named Kokon comes along and tells him she’s a fox-demon whose life he once saved. Now she's back to repay that debt. With “foxy” Kokon by his side, will Ren be able to realize his true dream and become the most popular kid in school? Manga master Koge-Donbo brings her trademark style — imaginative artwork, a romantic fantasy storyline, humor, and cute, quirky characters — to this worthy successor to Yoki Koto Kiku, Kamichama Karin, and Pita-Ten.",
