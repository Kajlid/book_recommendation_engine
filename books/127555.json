Danny, the man who’s been her best friend, her lover, her soul mate for the past four years vanishes without a trace. Ev is lost and confused. She doesn't know what she’s supposed to do next. The only thing she wants is to know why Danny left, but that answer isn't coming.  Ev tries to stop asking why this happened to her and fights to pick up the pieces of her life. She knows she can count on the one person who’s been by her side since childhood, her best friend, Clark. He’s the one to catch her every time she falters. His encouragement keeps her from giving up. He teaches her not to dwell on the unanswered questions. In order to rise above the despair chipping away at her soul, Ev decides she needs distractions to focus her attention on, instead of wallowing in her despair. She fights hard to put Danny behind her and make her life resemble normal again.  When life provides her the answer, she’ll need Clark’s strength more than ever, but this may be the one time her friend can’t be strong enough for her. Things are rarely as simple as they seem. When true motivations are revealed, Ev’s fragile world is once again threatened. Mixed emotions always end with a heartache. Will her heart make the right choice; the choice only Evelyn Mayer can make.  When Life is slipping away, do you fall with it…or fight for it?",
