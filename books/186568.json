Given up by her mother on the day she was born, she believes she has almost raised herself—with just a bit of guidance from her unconventional father, Taxi.When Sib finally asks Taxi to take her to meet her mother for the first time, he knows that behind the cool request lies a deep curiosity about her missing parent. Taxi, afraid that Sib won't be able to understand or forgive her mother, carefully orchestrates their long drive to San Francisco as an education in who her mother was and who she might now be. Only Sib and Taxi are in for some surprises when they arrive. And Sib learns it's not simply her music that makes her special—but the silent force behind it.",
