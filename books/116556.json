  "description": "An unexpected invite throws the Christmas plans of Bertie Wooster and his long- suffering valet, Jeeves, into disarray. Rather than the Winter sun of Monte Carlo, Jeeves and Wooster find themselves spending Christmas at Skeldings Hall, much to the disappointment of Jeeves, home of Lady Wickham, and her daughter Bobbie, thr object of Bertie's desire. Also in attendance is Sir Roderick Glossop, father of Bertie's former fianc√©, Honoria, and Tuppy Glossop, he who tricked Bertie into falling into the swimming pool at the Drones Club.First published in 1927, and previously published in The World of Jeeves, Jeeves and the Yule-tide Spirit is the perfect festive treat.",
