  "title": "The Many Deaths of Joe Buckley",
  "description": "Who is the mysterious Joe Buckley, and why does he meet so many unfortunate ends in various Baen books?Joe Buckley is simultaneously a real person and an unlucky figment of numerous Baen authors' imaginations. He's been drowned, shot, stabbed, turned into a werewolf, eaten by a shark, and put through a snow blower and had his atomized remains spewed into the air, just to name a few. He's been spindled, folded, mutilated, blown up, and autopsied.Now for the first time we have compiled the many instances of Buckley meeting a bad end, with introductions by the dastardly authors--and one artist--who did him in. Find out who killed him first and why, and how the tradition grew. With bonus material: \"The Buckley Alphabet\" by Sarah Hoyt's Dinerzens, and a filk song, \"The Twelve Days of Battle\" (to the tune of The Twelve Days of Christmas).All proceeds from this collection will support two charities near and dear to our hearts, both founded, supported, and run by Baen readers: Operation Baen Bulk, which sends books, ereaders, and other supplies to our men and women in uniform, and ReadAssist, which allows disabled readers free access to Baen ebooks.",
