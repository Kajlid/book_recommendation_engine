  "description": "Stand-up comedian Miranda Tempestini is on top of her game, until she experiences the crushing loss of a failed adoption. Miranda’s life seems to be on a downward spiral. But when her unsympathetic family stages an intervention, Miranda is sent against her will to her estranged uncle’s island resort.Upon her arrival, Miranda is agog when she discovers that her eccentric Uncle Prosser runs a Neo-Pagan grief retreat. Having been shipwrecked on the island with no means of escape, Miranda finds herself stuck with her bent uncle and ethereal Aunt Ariel for at least a month - trying to navigate grief while surrounded by maypoles, fae circles, sketchy potions, and graven images of way too many gods.More disturbing still, Miranda is expected to attend group therapy sessions with a gaggle of oddballs who are each dealing with loss of their own. (Some losses being more offbeat than others) Among them are a cocky supermodel disfigured from botched plastic surgery, and stupidly attractive Scott Ferdinand. Despite Scott being annoyingly swoony and shockingly genial, Miranda makes it clear she has zero interest in him. Like at all. The last thing she needs is to get roped into another ill-fated relationship, unable to give a man the one thing he wants… But her meddlesome uncle has other plans.",
