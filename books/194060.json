  "title": "Yum! Cooking Gluten, Dairy and Soy Free",
  "description": "A few years after MS (multiple sclerosis) walked into my life, I discovered I had also developed food allergies to gluten, dairy and soy. I had to learn to cook so I could eat because I quickly realized how little processed, ready to eat or restaurant food is available to someone afflicted with those three allergies.  Unfortunately, many recipes I made or the allergen friendly food I bought tasted like cardboard, a kitchen sponge or just plain “healthy”. I longed for the food I loved growing up but couldn’t have anymore because it makes me very sick, like put me back in the hospital sick. So I set out on a mission: to make allergen friendly food that tastes good. Not just to my standards, but by my critics: my husband and son. I only want to cook one supper; so I learned how to cook food that was allergen free, but not flavor free. I want to share these recipes and the tricks I have learned so that it may help others afflicted with the same or similar ailments to enjoy eating again.",
