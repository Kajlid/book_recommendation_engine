  "title": "The Garden Party and Other Stories",
  "description": "Written during the final stages of her illness, \"The Garden Party and Other Stories\" is full of a sense of urgency and was Katherine Mansfield's last collection to be published during her lifetime. The fifteen stories featured, many of them set in her native New Zealand, vary in length and tone from the opening story, \"At the Bay, \" a vivid impressionistic evocation of family life, to the short, sharp sketch \"Mrs. Brill, \" in which a lonely woman's precarious sense of self is brutally destroyed when she overhears two young lovers mocking her. Sensitive revelations of human behaviour, these stories reveal Mansfield's supreme talent as an innovator who freed the story from its conventions and gave it a new strength and prestige.",
