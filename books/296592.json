  "description": "Welcome to Steorrata, a world where magic is as abundant as water. Sadly, in the middle of Steorrata is a land called Larna, that despite their very heritage, has chosen,-- through mostly violent means-- to forsake magic. Or at least the kinds they say are evil, which everyone else, especially the elves that make their home there a rather short-sighted and silly-- not to mention hypocritical-- move. Enter, Quincy Manche, Mage-Extraordinaire, a mage on a mission from the soon-to-be king of Elansia to find the best of the best of Larna. Some would call it a fool's errand,-- others more aptly call it a death wish-- but Quincy has taken it upon himself to do his liege proud, for honor and not a very little amount of coin. So, join Quincy as he tries to make it out of Larna alive and still manage to convince the locals to take up his noble cause.",
