  "description": "Everyone goes to the moon in stories these days - why not a cat? So we have the ambitious young cat, Flyball, going off in a rocket and having extraordinary adventures. He is a delight in his space suit - a descendant perhaps of that famous adventurer Puss in Boots.On the moon he becomes, of course, a super-cat, rescuing his master and finding surprising things in a cave. Children will love Flyball's story - grown-ups, reading it aloud, will see in it a slight take-off on the popular science-fiction thread.",
