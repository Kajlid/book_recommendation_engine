  "description": "Mr. Glassco's second book of poems will consolidate the enviable reputation he won with The Deficit Made Flesh. In A Point of Sky he reveals himself as a philosophical poet in the classic tradition. The nobly meditative odes, 'The Autumn Resurrection', 'The Day', and 'The Crows' have a depth of feeling and a richness of expression that recall the contemplative poetry of Archibald Lampman and Duncan Campbell Scott, though the sensibility is always modern. These qualities are sustained and heightened in the long title poem that brings the collection to a close. A Point of Sky is a memorable addition to the mature poetic reorganization of values that has made Canadian poetry in recent years so significant and exciting.",
