  "description": "14-year-old Kai Koson had nothing to do with the apocalypse, thank you very much. He was just a baby the day a coven of blood witches ripped a hole in the universe and the demons fell screaming from the sky. Earth and its magic perished, witchkind was hunted and annihilated, and Kai is fed up taking the blame. So what if he’s a witch? It’s not like he’s ever cast a spell in his entire life and, besides, what sort of crazy person would dare do magic in front of the demons? Because of them he is homeless and hunted. Even his own uncle seems determined to abandon him. Well, stuff them all. With nothing left to lose, Kai runs away and joins a team of galactic bounty hunters. But instead of providing an escape, it sets Kai on a path that will destroy everything he believes about himself and the apocalypse, transforming him into the most wanted teenager in the galaxy. Witches, magic, aliens, demons, space travel, friendship, lies, persecution and an annoying 12-year-old know-it-all, the Bounty Hunter universe fuses together science fiction, fantasy, action, adventure and comedy. Written with humour and imagination, Bounty Hunter and its protagonist Kai Koson stand confidently beside Percy Jackson, Artemis Fowl, Alex Rider, Young Bond, Mortal Engines and Harry Potter.",
