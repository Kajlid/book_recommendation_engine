  "description": "It is Halloween in the charming picture-postcard town of Jericho Falls when a van-driver suffers a fatal heart attack and crashes his vehicle. Its cargo is a top-secret, utterly lethal weapon of biological warfare developed by the Government. Within hours the innocent inhabitants of Jericho Falls are dying in agony. Sheriff Jack Slater calls for help, but the telephones are dead, the radio jammed and the town so tightly guarded that no one can get in - or out. Gradually the terrible truth dawns. Help isn't coming. Instead, Jericho Falls and all its inhabitants are to be wiped off the face of the earth. A small group of survivors, including the Sheriff's teen-aged daughter and a Vietnam vet, bond together to fight their way out. With only their fierce determination and a couple of guns they wage their war against the American military and its sophisticated high-tech weaponry. The odds are heaped against them.",
