  "description": "The grand and gripping tale of sacrifice and survival begun in The Passage surges forward in Justin Cronin's masterful thriller The Twelve.The present day: As a man-made apocalypse unfolds, three strangers navigate the chaos--an expectant mother planning for her childâ€™s arrival even as civilization dissolves around her; an armed loner dodging the growing hordes of the infected; a teenage girl fighting for her little brother's life in a landscape of death. These three will learn that they have no been fully abandoned--and that in connection lies hope, even on the darkest of nights.One hundred years later: Amy and her followers continue their battle to vanquish the Twelve--a dozen death-row inmates transformed by an ancient virus into terrifying monsters, bringing the human race to the brink of annihilation. But the rules of the game have changed. The enemy has evolved, establishing a dark new order with a plan far more horrifying than man's extinction. And if the Twelve are to fall, one of humanity's heroes will have to pay the ultimate price.",
