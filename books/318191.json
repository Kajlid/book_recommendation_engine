  "description": "Every lore of every clan, across time and space, dreamed of dragons. Did you ever wonder why?\nErebu and Sorin fought through countless lifetimes of trials and tribulations to find one another again. They even conquered death.But Ere’s rebirth requires a price: he must answer the Celestial Summons when it comes and faithfully complete each task the Jade Emperor sets before him.On the bright side, he doesn’t have to perform miracles alone. Sorin will be right there with him. One the not so bright side, his Fate, the Fate of all dragon Kind, and by extension, the Universal Balance, depend on the successful execution of each quest.No pressure.His fourth task is to find and retrieve the Myth of the Pale Prince. Except, this time, there’s a sudden change of players.Location: Unknown. Time travel will be required.Clues: Too few. But there may be faeries, changelings, and mysterious noblemen along the way.Accompaniments: With Sorin battling unknown demons, and Ere refusing to leave his side, Benjamin volunteers to take up the quest in Ere’s stead. By his side is Annie, his best friend and blossoming fire witch. Two barely legal teenagers shouldering the fate of the world…What could go wrong?Timing: ASAP. Determined by an arbitrary Sandglass in the Jade Emperor’s possession.The end of the world may be just around the corner. \nAlong the way, enemies may become lovers, lifelong friendships may form, and lots of hot, desperate, this-may-be-the-last-time-we-have-sex sex will definitely be had.\nAnd who knows, you too may help discover the…\nMYTH OF DRAGONS.",
