  "description": "If there's one thing Zelda Fitzpatrick is good at, it's fandom. She can out-geek the geekiest. Her devotion knows no bounds. Her love is true, her motives pure. Oh, and she's also a talented freelance photographer, newly hired to go on the road with one of her favorite bands, Double Blind Study. All she has to do is not ruin this opportunity with her nerdy references (which are in abundance) or her devout klutziness. And she probably shouldn't fall madly in love with lead guitarist, Harrison O'Neil... who is taken. Unfortunately.",
