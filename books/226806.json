  "description": "Drake Sanders has a great life. He enjoys his job, is planning to marry the woman he loves and has a low golf handicap. An editor of a small daily on the North Carolina coast, he is investigating a bizarre murder, with possible supernatural overtones. He is also akin to Job, for the powers of darkness have been ordered to kill or destroy him. In a short time, he will be dealing with murderous locals, professional hit men, corrupt businessmen and demonic entities. Like Job, he has three friends. Harry Denton is a reporter and an intercessor who has insight into spiritual matters. Tiffany Sanderson is a broadcaster who lost a local beauty pageant because it was rigged. Tracy Sundelin is an intelligent 13-year-old girl with incredible faith. They will be drawn into the battle and their lives too will be on the line. As the vultures of evil circle, a cosmic conflict of good vs. evil will ensue. As the battle wages, there is no mercy asked and no quarter given. Even for 13-year-old Tracy, it is kill or be killed. The four desperately hope, and believe, that God will not stand silent in a time of crisis. The novel is not only a suspenseful thriller, it also re-examines beliefs about the Book of Job in light of modern revelation and provides the reader with scriptural insight.",
