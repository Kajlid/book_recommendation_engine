  "description": "Mark is a cocky, arrogant alpha male, lauded by all as an excellent rugby player in spite of his attitude. When he meets the mysterious Meleah, he expects her to behave like the legion of women before her, submitting to his every desire. But he doesn't realise that from the moment of their meeting, she has him under her spell. When she gives him a taste of her strange passions, part of him wants to run; but he follows her meekly back to her lair.",
