  "description": "Sold to a billionaire. That's not my love story; that's my nightmare. Dash Buchanan, lead singer of Pistols and Violets, risked his life to rescue me from that auction block. Once upon a time, his father stole millions from my father's motorcycle club. Now, the business he started with that money is worth billions. Because of that, Dash and I could lose more than just our lives. BDSM as a weapon. Dash would be my Dom; I would be his sub. It was the only way to get into their club, to make them trust us so we could save the others. I just didn't expect to like it so much—or want it outside of our mission. A hot rocker boy with a sultry Southern accent. A Weeping Bones Motorcycle Club daughter turned assassin. A billionaire auction gone wrong. Revenge, sex … romance. As dangerous as it is spectacular, as fierce as it is unexpected. ***BIKER ROCKSTAR BILLIONAIRE CEO ALPHA is book #1 in the HERS TO KEEP TRILOGY, a new series from international bestselling author C.M. Stunich writing as Violet Blaze.
