  "description": "To a regular person, they’re just tools. . . A chef uses them to prepare a meal. A surgeon uses them to save lives. To the maniacs in this story, however. . . Theirs is a much darker purpose. For them, the first cut is NOT the deepest. It’s just the beginning. . . This is Book 1 in the Maniacs with Knives Series. This story is from Shaun Hupp’s Unapologetic Horror Line. The author is NOT sorry this book Gore, violence, dismemberment, rape, swearing, and a dozen other things you wouldn’t want your grandmother to talk about at her Sunday church group. If you’re a sensitive reader, this book is probably NOT for you.",
