  "description": "A classic picture book celebrating all the joy a Christmas tree can bring. Christmas is here and Mr. Willowby's tree has arrived. There's just one big problem: The tree is too tall for his parlor. He cuts off the top so it will fit, and soon the top of that tree is passed along again and again to bring holiday cheer to all the animals in the forest.Kids will love watching the tree move from home to home, and families will appreciate the subtle message of conservation and recycling, as the tree top spreads joy to so many of the forest dwellers.This heartwarming story is the perfect way to start your yuletide season, and a warm addition to your family's festive holiday traditions.",
