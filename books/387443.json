  "title": "Fine...ly: My Story of Hope, Love, and Destiny",
  "description": "\"Fine..ly\" is a compelling, impactful story about hope and love that builds brick by brick from the bottom up, and then screams victory from the roof-top. The story is a touching, honest, and insightful account of the author's rollercoaster ride through life, beginning with her 1958 Baltimore birth, and continuing through age fifty. After twenty-two years of an angst ridden journey fraught with confusion, depression, and peril, the author clung to the fantasy that a chivalrous white knight would one day rescue her. To her great surprise that's exactly what happened...or so she thought. At first she idealized the romance, but before she knew it she found herself tragically enmeshed in the tangled web of codependency. Prompted by her unbearable anguish and desperate thirst for serenity, the author began searching for answers. Determined to find deeper meaning and understanding, she poured herself into reshaping her life. She healed the wounds of her past, transformed her life, and ultimately found the happiness she had always longed for.",
