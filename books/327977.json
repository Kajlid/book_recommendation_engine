  "description": "This is the End.I’ve had a really hard month. It started with my mentor, Raptor, dying and it ended… well I don’t know yet, but it looks bad.There is a chance, a small chance, I mean really really tiny, that I can stop the apocalypse before it completely annihilates the city. I just have to beat two different epicly powerful organizations, no sorry three, three different epicly powerful organizations as they battle… Well, technically four epicly powerful organizations if you count the Superhuman Suppression Agency. Well, you could argue five, but group five is working for the first group. So let's keep the number at four, but with an asterisk.I need to battle four* different organizations, each with their own goals of capturing, using, or killing me.If I fail, my death would just get the ball rolling on my problems. My city will be destroyed, and all the people I care about will die.",
