  "description": "ASIN B07L1NKGNM moved to this edition.I was always the sensible one. So how could I go and fall in love with this man?  I crushed his car but I offered him a ride. I was polite. He was rude. Later he appears at my job to pick up his son.  That smirk of his is driving me insane. He is handsome, hot, sexy as sin and takes whatever he wants.  He is filthy rich and I live in school teacher’s salary.  I try to push him away. He refuses to listen. How am I supposed to think with his hands all over me?  I can’t control this traitorous heart of mine. He touches me and it beats out of control.  His kisses? Toe-curling.  I asked Santa to send me a man, but not him. He can’t be my Christmas present. Can he?",
