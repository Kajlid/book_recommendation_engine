  "title": "Satan's Mirror",
  "description": "Satan kidnaps a young girl, forcing her vengeful mother to break into hell to get her daughter back. Emily Goodman, host of the television show Do You Believe It, has a mission--to debunk all myths and urban legends. But when she meets Satan in a haunted house and calls him a fraud, the repercussions change her life. Satan kidnaps her six-year-old daughter, forcing Emily to re-evaluate her cynicism. For centuries, devils have been abducting people and pulling them through wormholes to another dimension where the hapless victims are tortured for the devils' pleasure. Because humans are out of sync with time, they cannot die and must endure the sadistic revelry for eternity. Satan picks the wrong house when he takes Emily's daughter. She'd do anything to protect April--even break into the underworld and battle the denizens of hell. If she does rescue the little girl, can they ever find their way back home?",
