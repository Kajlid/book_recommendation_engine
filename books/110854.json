  "description": "Serenity Makepeace knows a lot about whole-grain bread, but she doesn't know beans about business. She's expanding her natural foods emporium to sell local handicrafts by mail—which she hopes will benefit her offbeat artist community in Witt's End, Washington. But she needs a crack financial adviser to make her dream a reality—so she charms her way into the office of Caleb Ventress, a handsome wolf in conservative clothing. An expert in the art of the deal, Caleb isn't sure what to make of the unconventional Serenity—but there's no doubt he's attracted. A pass from a paragon of conformity—even one as handsome as Caleb—is more than free-spirited Serenity bargained for. But when a lethal blackmailer threatens her plans and perhaps her life, she puts her whole trust in the man who seems her complete opposite—and the net result might be true love.",
