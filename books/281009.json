  "description": "I thought I'd be fighting on my feet. Instead, I'm forced to beg for mercy on my knees.  The school used to kneel before Jacob, Lucas, and Troy. Now, the only one who kneels is me. They know my secret and my shame. They know what makes me hurt.  And now they own every inch of me.  I tried to play their game. And I must face the consequences for my defiance.  I'm helpless in their grasp--a prisoner in their cage. And I don't know if I ever want to leave.  Warning: Not for the faint of heart. This slow-burn reverse harem novel of three arrogant bad boys and the girl who stood her ground contains dark themes, high school drama, teenage angst, swoon-worthy sex, and and some potential triggers.",
