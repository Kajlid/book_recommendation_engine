  "title": "The Death of King Arthur",
  "description": "This is an immortal story of chivalry, treachery and death brought to new life for our times. The legend of King Arthur has retained its appeal and popularity through the Mordred's treason, the knightly exploits of Tristan, Lancelot's fatally divided loyalties and his love for Guenevere, and the quest for the \"Holy Grail\". Now retold by Peter Ackroyd with his signature clarity, charm and relish for a good story, the result is not only one of the most readable accounts of the knights of the Round Table but also one of the most moving.",
