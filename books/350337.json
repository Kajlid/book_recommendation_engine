  "description": "Her sanctuary has become her blackest nightmare...Life is tough in the Alaskan tundra but lately something wholly inhuman has let itself loose on the territory, leaving a wake of unspeakable carnage. For bush pilot Alex MacGuire the wreckage is especially chilling - Alaska is the place she fled to after her mother and brother were brutally murdered in Florida. When the Midnight Breed is alerted to this slaughter, they send Kade to quell the danger and ensure Alex does not learn the truth behind the attacks. And soon Alex will be tested by the threat of otherworldly evil, and by her unexpected desire for Kade, a man she should fear but who has become her seductive guide into an erotic realm of blood and darkness.",
