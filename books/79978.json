  "title": "Pukka's Promise: The Quest for Longer-Lived Dogs",
  "description": "From the best-selling author of Merle's Door comes a well-researched and engaging guide to giving our dogs the happiest, healthiest lives.When Ted Kerasote got his new dog, Pukka, he found that dog culture had been dizzying choices of grain-free and raw food, conflicting arguments for and against vaccinations, and battles between positive and dominance trainers. Giving The Omnivore’s Dilemma a canine spin, Kerasote questions the common wisdom to show us how our dogs can have the best and healthiest lives today, no matter where we live. He weaves fascinating science and groundbreaking insight from breeders, vets, and animal advocates into the story of raising Pukka in the Wyoming wilderness. Fascinating and revelatory, Pukka’s Promise “might be the most important book about dogs written in a decade” (Patricia B. McConnell, author of The Other End of the Leash ).\"Packed with important, surprising information; with wisdom, compassion, and love.\"—Dean Koontz",
