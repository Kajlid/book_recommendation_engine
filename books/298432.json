  "description": "The Vatican Must Go  An American Tale of Government Power and the Glory of Faith.It’s the 1920’s, Pancho Villa is gone, and Mexico is just settling into a new, post revolution form of democratic government. Vatican influence over the psyche of the country remains an enemy and so, power brokers south of the border have written a new constitution containing articles to strangle the power of the Catholic church over the citizenry and detaching it from Vatican control. And so, Christ goes to war.Back in United States, the possibilities are a welcome sight to certain people of power in a country where Protestant evangelism is a hallmark of the American Way.If only a Mercenary Force could be dispatched to represent those American interests. Enter Soldier of Fortune, Charlie Coates, who stealthily managed the bloody John D. Rockefeller strikebreaking campaign during the infamous Colorado Coalmining Wars. The government of Mexico tried to disown the atrocities and battles of the early 20th Century Cristero War which claimed over 120,000 lives. It was a long and dirty war selectively forgotten by the official history curriculum. The Vatican Must Go is one historical fiction account of what might have brought about all-out warfare against government attempts to stamp out Catholic Church control over the soul of Mexico.",
