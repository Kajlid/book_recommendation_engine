  "title": "The Everything",
  "description": "On most planets a typical dictionary defines 'Everything, the' as 'the world', 'reality' or 'the cosmos'. Try an encyclopaedia and you get a lot more detailâ€”from everyday phenomena, such as the Firework Effect and Freewheel Principle, to the realm of space and time, levity and gravity. If what you really want to know, though, is what its inhabitants have thought about all this down the ages, then The Everything is a good place to start: it fills you in on the classic creation-myth story, The Golden Ones; today's scientific Enormous Cloud Theory; artists' ideas about the nature of reality; philosophers too; and, in particular, the writers of modern imaginative fiction (with examples culled from the vast Spoilerama archive).This is a new edition of The Everything, updated to include the very latest thinking. Its aim, however, remains the same: to give you a view of the cosmos, and of ourselves, you will never ever forget.",
