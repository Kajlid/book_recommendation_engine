  "title": "Reading from Behind: A Cultural Analysis of the Anus",
  "description": "In a playful, yet scholarly romp through \"low\" and \"high\" culture, Jonathan Allan asks why--since we all have one and use it every day--do we squirm at the mere mention of the anus? How is it that Kim Kardashian's derriere can break the internet, Pippa Middleton's behind can create a \"butt lift\" craze, and yet we cannot handle a discussion of anality? And why, given that we all have one, has the anus been caught up in the very \"ground zero of gayness\"?",
