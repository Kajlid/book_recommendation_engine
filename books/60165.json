  "description": "This is my adult short-story collection. It contains curse words and adult thematic material.“Chasing Kerouac” depicts one man’s obsession with finding a lost piece of writing by author Jack Kerouac, an obsession that takes him hundreds of miles with a friend to visit complete strangers. “Neighbors” revolves around another man’s less constructive obsession with what goes on behind a neighbor’s closed doors. \"A Perfect World\" is the story of a girl who travels to a world where everything is perfect. What would that look like? What would it mean? \"The Deity\" (unfinished) addresses the question of what a universe with a loving supreme being would look like. And what if that being died? \"Mister Negative\" is the story of a man who says what he thinks no matter what happens or whom he offends. This last one was cathartic to write. I got to get out and let go of some 'negativity' I'd been holding in for a long time--in a comedic way, of course. If only we could all be as free and bold as Mister Negative, we'd probably all feel a lot better!I hope these thought-provoking stories will stay with you after you put the book down.",
