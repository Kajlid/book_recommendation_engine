  "description": "Jax wanted his one true mate. Joleen wanted her freedom.Jax CarsonJax knew this new waitress at the Steak and Ale Saloon was different. He would know -- he had slept with almost every other single woman in town for at most one or two nights. Joleen, on the other hand, wouldn't give him the time of day. The sway of her hips made his inner bear rage with a lust to claim her. When he learned she was trapped in an unacceptable at home, his bear was ready to fight for her. Except why did she insist on refusing his help, his protection and his heart?Joleen EmeryThe first time Joleen saw Jax, he was with his firefighter buddies, and almost every woman at the Steak and Ale Saloon was draped on his arm at one time or another that night. He was a sexy, hotter than hell, womanizing bad boy firefighter, and for some reason, she was who he wanted in his bed next. She didn't need anyone like that in her already complicated life. What she wanted was to save her tips, find a place and get the hell away from the last romantic mistake she had made. Without money, she was trapped, so Jax's efforts to get her attention while she was trying to save for her sanctuary was just another useless distraction. Except why was it she couldn't get him out of her mind? Why did he insist on saving her at every turn? And why did she not want to run away screaming when she saw him change into a bear?Author's Note: This is a full-length, standalone, HEA romance. Contains mature topics and sexual content.
