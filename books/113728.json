Fate has severely tried him; first by taking away his parents when he was but a child, then destiny didn't spare him the heartache of losing the woman he loved, when she fell victim to vicious killers who were after him. He is a man, but not human. At least that's not all there is to him. There is a savage side to his nature, a werewolf like creature that most would attribute with folklore or a myth. Troubled by his own animalistic tendencies he has a hard time accepting and haunted by vicious memories, he decides to leave his home in Ireland and move to the US, where his mother was from. But the quiet town of Chastity Point, Connecticut is not what it seems. Jade Thorton is trying to lead the life she always dreamed of having. She owns a bakery, has friends, and a loyal dog, which seems to be fully satisfying after the traumatic experience of her childhood that casts a long shadow on her whole life. The last thing she expects is to find herself thrown back into the past by the events taking part in the small town when blood is being spilled in rural Chastity Point. The fascination she feels for the mysterious man with eyes full of painful secrets could be her chance for happiness, or her final downfallâ€¦",
