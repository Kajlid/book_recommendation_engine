  "description": "Life is hard when you are on the run.Just trying to survive and start a new life on my own was almost impossible. Until one night a shadow scared me into a building, a building that would change my life forever.Six months at Seduction House and I am finally ready for the auction.Tonight is the night that I sell myself to a stranger.I’m more ready than words can say, one night as their Plaything and I am flush with cash for the next 3 months. Sounds like a great deal to me. But my night in the spotlight doesn’t go quite as planned, and instead of one man and one night,I’m sold to four men for a month. Jack, Vince, Arlo, & Dimitri, four friends that know what they want and aren’t afraid to pay for it.The only problem is my heart and my body agree we want more than meaningless sex with the four men that bought us, but the past has a way of sneaking up on you and ripping all your hopes and dreams away.I’m willing to fight for love or die trying.I just don’t know if these four men will fight with me.",
