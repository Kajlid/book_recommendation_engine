  "title": "Chloe May: Daughter of the Dust Bowl",
  "description": "Chloe May's father found his wife's tactics incredulous as she dealt with their impoverished life and her own restlessness. Then came the Depression and the droughts of the Dust Bowl. It took more than their losses, near starvation, and apparent defeat to put a tear in her father's eye. In fact, even the women in the Whitehurst family were seldom reduced to tears-conniving and rash behavior, perhaps, but not to tears! The family knew laughter and fun, balancing heartaches and poverty. Chloe Daughter of the Dust Bowl is based on the true story of the author's mother, Chloe May, and her family's frequent moves in, around, and out of the Oklahoma Panhandle of the '20s and '30s. Laced with historical facts of the time, Chloe Daughter of the Dust Bowl is a must read for younger readers wishing for a glimpse into one of America's most difficult eras, and older readers who will identify with one family's modes of survival.",
