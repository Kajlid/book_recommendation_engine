  "description": "Former Delta Operator Myles Simms doesn’t know when to quit. The concept so foreign to him he can’t give up on Delilah Watts. A woman he’s never met—a woman who might be the enemy yet he’s compelled to save her. Intel Specialist Delilah Watts never imagined sending an email would be deadly. Kidnapped and left to die, yet she regrets nothing. She’d blow the whistle over and over again if it meant one life was saved—unfortunately, it just wouldn’t be hers. A man on the search. A woman in need of a hero. A race against time.",
