  "description": "\"Light in the Night contains stunning photographic evidence of the light-filled beings that medium Lois Anne Smith says have always been with her. The pictures were taken in the gardens surrounding her small healing center located in the quiet community of Valley Mede, Maryland. It never occurred to her to share them in book form until the summer of 2013 when, standing in the middle of the garden, she asked out loud, “Where is everyone?” She had enjoyed three years of capturing extraordinary evidence that she was surrounded by light and love, even in—especially in—the darkness. The past six months of barely seeing a small orb felt as though someone had flipped a switch, and it was over. The answer came immediately, “My dear, you haven’t done anything with the ones we’ve given you.” She now makes these amazing photos available to us all, along with deeply personal stories that are sure to lift your spirit and remind us all that when the journey is about love and the entire universe supports and encourages us.  Lois Anne shares her journey of opening to work in reverence and sacred space in her garden surrounding The Cottage. Thank you Lois Anne for this extraordinary account of the possibilities all around us, for your humility and for demonstrating with simplicity and trust how the spirit world is alive all around us ready to serve.—Elizabeth Cosmos Ama-Deus Healing with the Sacred Energy of the Universe\"",
