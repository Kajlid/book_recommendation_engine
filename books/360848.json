But the post-mortem reveals that this is no case of accidental drowning ...Local detective Patrik Hedström has just become a father. It is his grim task to discover who could be behind the methodical murder of a child both he and his partner, Erica, knew well.He knows the real question—and answer—lies with why. What he does not know is how this case will reach into the dark heart of Fjällbacka and the town′s past, and tear aside its idyllic façade, perhaps forever.",
