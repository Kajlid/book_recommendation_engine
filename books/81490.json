  "description": "The Consortium of Chaos: The super-villain organization semi-unwillingly thrust into the field of heroics. They’re not nice people, but now they do nice things. …Occasionally. If it’s during office hours and there’s nothing good on TV, anyway.Tyrant: Kasos Octavio Victavios IV, Head of the Consortium’s Inter-dimensional Affairs Department, has spent thousands of years trying to conquer the entirety of existence, one dimension at a time. Now, something is distracting him from his mission, though, and he’s started behaving in very strange ways. Obviously, his restlessness isn’t his fault. Tyrant’s flawless. Just ask him. No, his ungrateful, way-too-smart hostage must be doing something to cloud his mind with these strange new thoughts about how beautiful she looks. Will he be able to overcome her frustratingly attractive interference and succeed in finally killing all of his co-workers? Rayn: The Princess of the Fairy Folk of the Meadow has been Kasos’ “captive” for eight-centuries and she’s pretty happy with their arrangement. An inter-dimensional kidnapping trip with her extremely hot captor certainly beats her old life. Aside from Tyrant’s bad attitude and lousy taste in music, she’s been having a blast. But, circumstances are now forcing Rayn to enlist his assistance in saving her kingdom, even though Tyrant plans to conquer it for himself. How do you convince a man who’s so egotistical that he prays to HIMSELF, that he needs to think about someone else for a change? And to stop killing all the people, trees and family members you want him to save?",
