  "description": "Grace Peacock is a woman with a secret, and she guards it in a world inhabited by ex-husbands, loving and non-loving, a host of raffish friends, an imaginary daughter, a mother who loves her to death, and an ex-mother-in-law who still doesn't approve. The truth is that Grace longs for the world of true romance stories - those brave fables in which women sin, suffer, repent, and are always redeemed. Surely her own life would be much improved if she could be the heroine of a true confession. The sinning is easy enough for Grace, but how to get a handle on the suffering, and the redemption? By turns hilarious and deeply moving, True Confessions: The Novel charts the course of a modern woman's struggle to survive the daunting absurdities of her too modern life.",
