Tichelaar Award For Best Historical Fiction 2018Official selection of the Pulpwood Queens Book Club and Bonus Book for August 2018\"A riveting and enlightening mix of history and fiction that puts a human face on the costs of war.\" Foreword ReviewsPart Downton Abbey, part Darkest Hour, Wickwythe Hall was inspired by an actual confrontation between the British and French navies in July 1940. A story of love, loyalty, and heartrending choices, Reader Views calls Wickwythe Hall a \"whirlwind novel\" that \"will no doubt leave an imprint on your heart long after you finish reading.\"“...it had substance with endearing characters and solemn subjects. It is based on the true events of WWII Operation Catapult, when Churchill made the decision to bomb the French naval fleet at Mers el-Kebir to prevent their battle ships being handed over to Germany. Little’s characterization of Churchill is so well done. She makes his personality and presence so real. Mabry was a character to be admired for her decisions and actions. A good read with a satisfying ending.” Historical Novels Review“If you love history, beautifully rendered characters, and stories that will tug at your heart, add Wickwythe Hall to your list. ” Book Perfume",
