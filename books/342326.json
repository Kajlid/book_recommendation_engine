  "description": "What is the proper place of solitude in human existence? Some thinkers have claimed that solitude is our truest, most ultimate, metaphysically deepest state of being. Others have maintained the contrary view that it is in encounter that we most truly find ourselves. In Koch's A Philosophical Encounter, both solitude and encounter emerge as primary modes of human experience, equally essential for human completion.",
