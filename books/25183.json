  "description": "The Second Book in The Maze Cutter Trilogy Sadina and the islanders are up against both man and nature as they navigate their way to Alaska to see the Godhead, but the Godhead itself is fractured. Within the cracks of the sacred trinity, secrets are revealed that blur the lines of good and evil. One person’s God is another person’s Devil. Isaac and Sadina are forced to split up, and while Minho holds the rest of the group together, it’s his beliefs that are slowly falling apart. What once drove Minho to join the Godhead is causing him to question his past and his future. Sadina finds something life changing in The Book of Newt, and her mission to save the world becomes even stronger. But while on his own, Issac meets a new traveler with a mission and learns that the cure isn’t what it once was thought to be, the immunes aren’t as immune, and the world as a whole is evolving in a dangerous direction. In Alaska, the Crank Army awaits to unleash its fury on the Godhead, ending Alexandra’s reign before it begins but nature and evolution become an even greater threat than all the Cranks in the world. Beliefs change, futures are rewritten, and not even the Godhead knows what will happen next.",
