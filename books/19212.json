  "description": "The new administration's kinder, gentler CIA has clamped a tight lid on a horrific sequence of events in its European theater. Knowledge of the events would provide fodder for opponents of the Agency's new image and policies. Jack McDuff, the Agency's top rated covert agent over the past twenty years, has been reassigned to a desk job in Miami. Cast aside by the Agency, he has made the decision to resign when an unlikely contact makes him aware of the restricted intel and then presents a solution. Jack readily accepts the unsanctioned rogue mission, and sets out on the most difficult assignment of his career. He begins a journey fraught with danger, mistrust, uncertainty, and surprise. It will require every resource deveoped over the past twenty years to survive and succeed. Throughout his journey, he discovers new enemies, makes new friends, and uncovers secrets that will change his life forever. His search for the mastermind twists and turns through Europe and the Middle East, then halfway around the globe to Mexico, Texas, and the Caribbean to a final dramatic showdown with an ingenious conclusion.",
