  "description": "Mistress Gideon is a witch. The locals of Edda's Meadow, if they suspect it of her, say nary a word-Gideon has been good to them, and it's always better to keep on her good side. Just in case.When a foolish young shapeshifter goes against the wishes of her pack, and gets herself very publicly caught, the authorities find it impossible to deny the existence of the supernatural in their midst any longer; Gideon and her like are captured, bound for torture and a fiery end.Should Gideon give up her sisters in return for a quick death? Or can she turn the situation to her advantage?PRAISE FOR OF SORROW AND SUCH\"Of Sorrow and Such takes you to dark, unsettling places. Angela Slatter's magic is earthy, bodily and beleaguered; in the hands of tough, clever Patience Gideon it's a powerful instrument for wresting justice from a hostile world. A riveting read.\" â€” Margo Lanagan, World Fantasy Award winning author of Black Juice and Sea-HeartsAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",
