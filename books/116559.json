  "description": "A Royal HuntA Hidden ProphecyA Destiny UnveiledFae Princess Avalynn Stromm is next in line for the throne and will one day rule all of Faevenly. But instead of fussing over ballgowns and suffering through palace politics, she’d rather be out exploring and hunting. Or, better yet, competing in the highly desired Summit Range Hunt alongside the realm’s greatest warriors.Mateo Vela is a lowborn half-fae living in the dreaded Sublands. He longs for a better life where his family doesn't have to struggle for necessities. So when the High King of Faevenly opens his prestigious hunt to competitors from his province, he has his chance to change his fate at last. But whether that destiny ends in glory or death is yet to be seen.Before the hunt even begins, whisperings of prophecy and revenge begin to circulate, and Avalynn and Mateo are at the center of it. And when they are thrust into the dangerous hunt, they’d just as soon have each other’s heads than work together…until they are faced with a common threat and discover there's much more at stake than crossing the finish line first. Secrets emerge, long-buried rivalries resurface, and Avalynn and Mateo must form an unlikely alliance if they are to make it out of the hunt alive. Not to mention the undeniable pull growing between them neither one saw coming.",
