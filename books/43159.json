Then Jameson is suddenly everywhere, invading her life, school schedule, and dating her supervisor at the posh art gallery where she works. How can she survive her fresh start, when her high school bully is everywhere.The only thing that scared him about going to college was the crushing fear that he wouldnâ€™t see Nyla anymore. So after graduation, Jameson applied to Roosevelt College, her school, to try to make sense of why he felt that way. Hoping it would only take a semester to understand his strange attraction and why he tormented her during high school, instead he realized that there was something more about Nyla, and something more to the way he felt. Now he must prove to her that she feels the same way about him.",
