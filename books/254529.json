  "description": "9 hrs. 44 min.Stevie Colvin's rules are simple: Don't bother to learn anyone's names. (Why bother if they won't be around tomorrow?) Keep things light and fun. Be an equal opportunist to all sexes. And no one becomes long term. No relationships and none of those pesky things like feelings can enter. Especially with a sexy supercross rider who is as much a player as she is. From the moment she met Christopher Singer, he seemed to get under her skin like no one else could and made her feel things she hadn't in a long time. Something she will not allow. Only one person has gotten past Stevie's layers. But even Jaymerson doesn't know the full truth about the darkness and demons that haunt Stevie's past...the ones she has pushed far down. She wants to ignore every detail of the devastating loss and horrifying night that almost took her life. When an incident brings Stevie and Chris back together in the same town, their past and present crash into a struggle of grief and horrendous tragedy. Stevie needs to decide: handle the pain and break every rule she has, which might shatter her for good, or choose to protect herself and run from it all....",
