  "description": "Cataract Solutions: Prevention & Reversal Via Accelerated Self-Healing is a comprehensive guide to the science and art of healing cataracts naturally, using nutrition, herbs, homeopathy and light therapy. This book has been useful to support successful self-healing, as well as being a useful reference guide for caregivers, healers and holistic physicians. Dr. Swartwout shares three decades of accumulated knowledge, having helped hundreds of people avoid the most common surgery in Medicare. The best news is that when you improve your eye health naturally, not only is vision restored, but years and quality are added to your life. Modern surgery is wonderful, but it does not remove the underlying causes of cataract, which continue to affect the whole body. That is why the average life expectancy after cataract surgery is a mere 5 years. This is not generally thought about or talked about because the focus of our modern medical industry is on heroic intervention, with precious little time spent educating patients about health maintenance and primary disease prevention.",
