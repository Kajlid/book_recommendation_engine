  "description": "Stallbrook’s Free Spirit movement, which celebrates sex as part of a healthy spirituality, is growing, and looking to begin yet another Local Gathering in the city’s North End. But religious conservatives in the area will do their best to stop them, guided by the pastor of Our Savior Lutheran Church. One member of that church, Priscilla Rhee, disagrees with their methods, and seeks to learn more about this sex-positive spiritual community. As she seeks to learn more about the Free Spirits, she finds herself asking questions about her own lifelong faith, and soon she finds herself at odds with her pastor and other church members. But that’s not the only thing being kindled deep within … Where will this journey take her?",
