  "description": "There's no game quite as dirty as D.C. politics. The stakes are high and the rules are played fast and loose. For Juliette Morgan, budding con artist and grifter, the city is her playground. That is until she meets Senate candidate Tyler Chase. He's breathtakingly handsome with Brad Pitt eyes, McDreamy hair, and that killer Kennedy charm. Juliette may actually lose brain cells in his presence -- which might explain why she continues to find herself in a number of inappropriate situations with the ambitious politician. Juliette knows she's playing with fire, because being with Tyler puts at risk the one thing she longs for most -- learning the truth about her parents' death. Consumed by lies, scandals, and betrayals, Juliette must now decide where her loyalties lie.",
