  "description": "The Kingdom of Outremer was born of blood and pain and passion; forty years on, enemies still threaten its borders and heresy still threatens its peace.The Society of Ransom is the Kingdom's conscience, and its sword-arm too. In the Ransomer's remote border stronghold of Roq de Rancon, its walls echoing with ancient magic and forgotten secrets, a tale of love, duty and betrayal will unfold: for Marron, a young man newly sworn to the brotherhood; for Julianne, daughter of the King's Shadow, en route to her wedding in Elessi; and for Elisande, her mysterious companion.All have a part to play in the coming upheaval, for their lives are intrinsically bound up with the fate of Outremer.",
