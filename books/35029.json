Breakfast together, Bob roughhousing with Michael. Then Bob leaves for his U.S. Army unit and the nightmare begins. A criminal band abducts Michael and spirits him to Bulgaria. So begins a twenty-eight-year journey that takes the Danforth family from the kidnapping of their son and Michael’s eventual rescue, to his marriage to the daughter of his kidnapper in present day. It is the stops along the journey that weave an intricate series of heart-stopping events built around complex, often diabolical characters. The reader is brought through CIA espionage during the Balkans War, attempted assassinations in the United States, Michael Danforth’s second kidnapping--this time in Macedonia by a Serb SPETSNAZ team, and the grisly exploits of a psychopathic killer.Evil Deeds is an adrenaline-boosting story about revenge and the triumph of good over evil.",
