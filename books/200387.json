  "description": "Twist Gone. I lost my mind that day.I arrived home, to my wife’s sweet color, stripped. Her body motionless, slain in a puddle of blood, her delicate skin, riddled with multiple stab wounds. The brutality of the rape was horrendous. My precious little girl lain in the middle of the floor, pillow securely duct taped on her face. Her tiny body, left unmoving. I’ve never screamed so savagely, wishing I was dead before in my life. Hope. I’ve long given up on any light in my life, jaded. I wasn’t expecting to be blinded with friction, by a fucking ray of sunshine.  Sadie Confused I had no idea what to do with my life or my baby’s. I trusted the wrong man, who turned out to be a ghost, disappearing, leaving me scattered. I head to my brothers club, in hopes of leaning on the only shoulder I’ve ever known. Strength What I find instead, is a hunter. A fiercely loyal, broken man, just waiting for his next kill.  Come fall in love with the next installment of the Oath Keepers MC from Internationally Bestselling Author Sapphire Knight.Editor: Mitzi Carroll",
