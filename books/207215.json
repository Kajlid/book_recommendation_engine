  "title": "George Whitefield: God's Anointed Servant in the Great Revival of the Eighteenth Century",
  "description": "This fast-paced, inspirational narrative reveals how God used one man of great courage, discipline, and humility to bring countless souls to Christ.God's accomplishments through George Whitefield are to this day virtually unparalleled. In an era when many ministers were timid and apologetic in their preaching, he preached the gospel with aggressive zeal and undaunted courage. In the wake of his fearless preaching, revival swept across the British Isles, and the Great Awakening transformed the American colonies.The previous two-volume work George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth-Century Revival is now condensed into this single volume filled with primary-source quotations from the 18th century, not only from Whitefield but also from such prominent figures as John and Charles Wesley, Benjamin Franklin, and William Cowper.",
