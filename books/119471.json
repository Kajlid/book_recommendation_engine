And when one of his macabre tales is mentioned in the local paper Isobel is drawn into the depths of evil and devil worship. Her world, and that of everyone around her turns on its axis.The cause, a mysterious book, an omen, which once opened and read starts a cataclysmic chain of events and their lives are filled with tragedy and disaster. Salvation comes in the guise of three teenagers-Peter, Qswald and Ariel and the four form an alliance. A bond so strong nothing, can tear apart-nothing except maybe the devil himself...!",
