She gives one of them away to wealthy Mrs Lyons and they grow up as friends in ignorance of their fraternity until the inevitable quarrel unleashes a blood-bath. \n'Willy Russell is less concerned with political tub-thumping than with weaving a close-knit story about the working of fate and destiny â€¦ it carries one along with it in almost unreserved enjoyment\" Guardian\n\nOne of the longest-running and most successful ever West End musicals, Blood Brothers premiered at the Liverpool Playhouse in January 1983.",
