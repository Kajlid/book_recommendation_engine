  "description": "Dreams of lost past, a boy on the run, a man trying to make peace with his mistakes. Destinies intertwine in three mind-bending stories revolving around a single destructive factor, all converging in one concluding moment. They are embers, fallen from a great fire; some fade, some create conflagrations, and Atlanta burns around them.",
