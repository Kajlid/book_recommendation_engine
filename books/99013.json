  "title": "Ageless Spy",
  "description": "Ageless Spy is a literary novel that flows smoothly through the protagonist's life. The narrative is not meant to confound the reader with overtly clever twists, violence or sex. Ageless Spy simply tells a story about lives that intertwine amid the Second World War and bond closer together after the war's conclusion. The quiet narrative introduces Carl Coles and creates a wonderful tapestry of suspense and intrigue as the story takes the reader on unsuspecting paths.The narrative unfolds slowly as an aged Carl Coles and his wife Maureen begin an uncharacteristic reminiscence of a time long ago. The cozy warmth of their Halifax kitchen soon gives way to a young British merchant seaman who happens upon a tiny Halifax cafe decades before in 1939. Carl Coles puts aside his personal life and sacrifices himself for his country for years. Follow his career and find out why he became the premier agent assassin of the British Secret Service. Find out how this typically gentle man could separate career from his personal life and still maintain his humanity.",
