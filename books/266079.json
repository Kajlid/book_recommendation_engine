  "description": "The Victorian poet Robert Browning (1812 â€“1889) is perhaps most admired today for his inspired development of the dramatic monologue. In this compelling poetic form, he sought to reveal his subjects' true natures in their own, often self-justifying, accounts of their lives and affairs. A number of these vivid monologues, including the famed \"Fra Lippo Lippi,\" \"How It Strikes a Contemporary,\" and \"The Bishop Orders His Tomb at Saint Praxed's Church,\" are included in this selection of forty-two poems.Here, too, are the famous \"My Last Duchess,\" dramatic lyrics such as \"Memorabilia\" and \"Love among the Ruins,\" and well-known shorter works: \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin,\" \"Home-Thoughts, from Abroad,\" \"Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister,\" and more. Together these poems reveal Browning's rare gifts as both a lyric poet and a monologist of rare psychological insight and dramatic flair.",
