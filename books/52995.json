But after a vicious beating shakes his world, he descends into the realm of hardcore bodybuilders and boxing gyms, seeking to become a real man. Rob Tully, a working-class teenager from upstate New York, is a born boxer. He trains with his father and uncle, who believe a gift like his can change their lives. But he struggles under the weight of their expectations, fearing his own ability to inflict pain. Their disparate paths lead to an underground bare-knuckle fight venue where men brawl for hard cash. When two fighters step into a ring where anything goes, sometimes only one walks out. Craig Davidson was born in Toronto and now lives in Iowa City. His short story collection, Rust and Bone, has been published in the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom.",
