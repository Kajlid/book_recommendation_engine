  "description": "They are the first line of defense against the things that go bump in the night.  They are the keepers of a centuries-old legacy of The Church defending the world against the forces of darkness.  They are a bunch of highly armed rednecks, internet video celebrities, soccer moms, and assorted broken nutjobs.  They are the new Templars, and things are about to get weird.  From the pages of Bubba the Monster Hunter comes a new series featuring the Hunters from around the United States hunting down monsters, fighting off supernatural baddies, and making life really, really bad for the things that hunt people.  Now Mason Dixon is back, and this time his problems are bigger than ever!  Like, dino-sized!  The sasquatch is on his side, the zigmals are cute, and the gowrows are downright adorable, but when Mason Dixon and his sidekick Emma run afoul of not only a dinosaur, but also MoMo the Missouri Monster, he's in for the fight of his life!  The New Templars novella series is a new series of short novels.",
