  "description": "From the James Beard Foundation:Listen to Beard describe his own book, which included some 1,500 recipes, from Blushing Bunny (tomato rarebit) to Cracker (mock apple) Pie: “This is not a book of regional cookery, it is not a collection of family recipes, it is not primarily a critique of American cuisine. It is simply a record of good eating in this country with some of its lore.” Beard went on to express the hope that “we are now in another epoch of gastronomic excellence.” In a New York Times review, Nika Hazelton praised the book as “the value of the year, and as good for us as it will be for our children. The author, who has done more than anybody else to popularize good food in America, puts a lifetime of experience into the page.” Book history:1972 published1975 new cover *unable to verify date1980 new cover1996 new cover2009 released as an e-book with new covernote about the author:Books would be released not only as \"James Beard\", but also \"Jim Beard\" and \"James A.
