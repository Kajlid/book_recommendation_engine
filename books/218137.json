Then they’ll leave the Sunolians, the spirits, and all the magical creatures here to die.”Alyssa pulled the Key out of her pocket and held it up. “Unless I protect this little thing?”“Yes.”Alyssa McCaw is a normal fourteen-year-old girl, perfectly happy with her life. But when one little key falls into her hands, her whole world is turned upside down. She suddenly finds herself whisked into a world full of the one thing she never would’ve thought possible: magic. At first, it appears to be a beautiful thing. But as Alyssa and her sister soon discover, magic, like all things, has a dark side. When her best friend Hazel is taken captive by a land of dark magic, it is up to Alyssa and her friends to rescue both Hazel and the world. A classic tale of light versus dark, this book will pull you into a universe of love, betrayal, and, most of all, magic.",
