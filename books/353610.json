  "description": "Edgar Allan Poe's only novel, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket is a pivotal work in which Poe calls attention to the act of writing and to the problem of representing the truth. It is an archetypal American story of escape from domesticity tracing a young man's rite of passage through a series of terrible brushes with death during a fateful sea voyage. Included are eight related tales which further illuminate Pym by their treatment of persistent themes--fantastic voyages, gigantic whirlpools, and premature burials--as well as its relationship to Poe's art and life.ContentsThe narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket -- (1838)MS found in a bottle -- (1833)Loss of breath -- (1832)Mystification -- (1837)How to write a Blackwood article -- (Nov 1838)A descent into the maelstr√∂m -- (Apr 1841)The pit and the pendulum -- (1843The balloon hoax -- (Apr 13, 1844)The premature burial.
