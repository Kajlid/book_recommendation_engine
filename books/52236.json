  "title": "Mrs. Tim Flies Home",
  "description": "The countless readers of D.E. Stevenson's delightful novels will be especially engrossed by this one, the final book of her four-part \"Mrs. Tim\" series, and will find Hester Christie, herself, more lovable than ever. Humor, charm, and a superb talent for storytelling are the hallmarks of D.E. Stevenson's work.Leaving Tim (now a colonel) in Kenya, Mrs. Tim flies home to her children for the summer in her beloved North Country. A stopover in Rome allows for the unexpected renewal of an old friendship with Tony Morley—a friendship regarded as highly suspect by fellow passenger Rosa Alston.Once installed in The Small House in Old Quinings, a host of local characters—some familiar to followers of Mrs. Tim's adventures—brighten and shadow Hester's life. Tony Morley turns up, but so does Rosa Alston with her gossipy innuendos. Mrs. Tim has a trying time with a singularly unpleasant landlady, but two young romances enliven the village, and Mrs. Tim closes her diary on a note of infectious happiness.",
