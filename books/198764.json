Meet the League: They rule the school, and their queen is oh-so-mean Fiona, who doesn’t exactly appreciate Amy’s individuality.  Amy is doing her best to fit in at her new school, but Fiona and the rest of the League aren’t making it easy for her. If she can pass their tests, she’ll be part of the in crowdbut what will she have to give up to fit in?",
