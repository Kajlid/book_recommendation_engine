  "description": "Spending the summer with the now forty-year-old straight man, who made me realize I was bisexual, was a very bad idea.HendrixMy mom had me when she was young, and it was the biggest mistake she ever made. I know that because she’s never had a problem with reminding me. It made me turn to the only one who cared—her best friend, Grant. He was my very own human shield, my voice when I didn’t have one. But when I was twelve, he left us, and it has all been downhill from there. GrantTwenty-one years ago, my girlfriend, Cynthia, left me for a bigger life in the city, but she came back a year later with a baby. Most people in our small town thought I was useless; but I helped her get back on her feet anyway. Now she needs my help again. She expects me to whip Hendrix into shape, but it’s proving to be more difficult than it should be. Hendrix is different now, and I’m just a sad excuse for a man. Ever since Cynthia left, every other woman has followed suit. But with Hendrix looking up to me with the type of admiration I could never hope to live up to, things begin to change.",
