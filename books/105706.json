And where did it get her? Her father has a secret family, her grades are in the toilet and her perfect boyfriend left her… for her own half-sister. But even running away to Europe for six months doesn’t help Hannah put a lifetime of lies in the past.Now it’s time to get wild…As soon as she returns home, her wealthy, image-obsessed parents are determined to shove her back in their mold of tedious society parties and dates that feel more like corporate mergers. Well, Hannah’s having none of it. Instead, she goes after Boone, a drop-dead gorgeous bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks. He’s exactly the kind of guy who will drive her family insane, and he seems more than happy to do so.Yet underneath the beat-up pickup truck and well-worn jeans, Boone has secrets of his own. Hannah’s had enough of lies. What will she do when she finds out about his?",
