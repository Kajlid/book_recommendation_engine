  "description": "When Johnny thinks about Loraine and her touch, it's as if the Holy Spirit is tickling his spine. But Johnny is more than tickled when he finds out Loraine is pregnant with his child. An almost-saved Christian, a not-quite-sober alcoholic and part-time lover of Loraine, Johnny is not sure where his wife Charlene fits into this complex love triangle of women, men, desires and truth. He's even less sure where Chris, Loraine's teenaged son, and Melody, Chris' pregnant girlfriend, belong in his life as a husband, lover, and volunteer coordinator of the town of Lesser's teen drop-in center.A feed supply salesman whose history extends only as far as he can remember, Johnny longs for a spiritual salvation, but finds beauty and truth in the soft, warm flesh of the women he loves. Charlene's final, fiery truth lies in her inability to come to terms with Johnny's earthly morality.An extraordinarily talented new author, Bergen achieves a finely tuned balance in his work: his tone is realistic, shot with ironic insight, replete with astonishing, but seemingly casually placed universal truths, seamlessly woven into an absorbing story of people struggling with their souls in a small prairie town.",
