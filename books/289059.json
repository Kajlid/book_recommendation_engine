  "description": "DaphneContrary to popular belief, being an internationally acclaimed rock star wasn’t all glitz and glamour. Time was not a luxury in my life when every second of every day was accounted for. I even had to watch my friends’ lives from afar. And everywhere I turned, people seemed to want things from me.One more autograph.One more interview.One more tour date.Now, I had a stalker who seemed to want something much more terrifying: me. All to themselves.EzraWhen I started my job as Daphne DeVille’s new head of security, I was expecting a nightmare. I mean, I already had an eight-year-old daughter at home. The last thing I needed was to be a babysitter for a spoiled brat who had fired half of her crew in the middle of a tour.And then I met her, and she was the complete opposite of everything I expected: sweet, down-to-earth, and even a little shy. In an industry dominated by fake, she was refreshingly real.Daphne was a job. Just another person I was supposed to protect. But, as I fought to keep her safe from a faceless terror, the line between personal and professional quickly started to blur.How was I supposed to keep her at arm’s length when what I really wanted to do was just keep her in my arms?",
