  "title": "Lust and Cashmere",
  "description": "Fiction. Things can happen when a man falls in love with a sweater. This book is about an unrequited love limited to self-imposed doctrines of propriety. Any number of intellectual conclusions can be drawn, but even the most serious will have to negotiate the gutter, which plagues Jon McManus and eventually the reader. It is divided in three parts, beginning with a Cinderella story. The first part is a straightforward narrative, the second a play of absurd humor and the third a choose your own adventure.",
