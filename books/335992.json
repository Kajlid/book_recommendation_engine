  "description": "From the foreword by editor Laura Mr. Mesler's work has a feeling of history residing within. Spirits flutter here and there, telling of fairy tales and of that which once was. It is this juxtaposition of past presented in minimalist form which speaks of the poet's place in history. His work is not only accessible, but relatable as well.The act itself of reading poetry is tremendously intimate. Mr. Mesler's work here lends itself to this intimacy with its immediacy. There is no pretense here, but rather a quiet invitation to breathe and drink in.",
