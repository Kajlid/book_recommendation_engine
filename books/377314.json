  "description": "Though they are both classmates at the same high school and live in the same town, Rick and Steve have grown up in different families with different values and religions. Brought together through school, they find themselves attracted to each other and one night, let go of everything they've both been taught about love.  Set in the late 1990's California suburbia, Where I am Now depicts the issues that young people face when confronting their sexuality and sexual orientation. Told through the points-of-view of not only Rick and Steve but their parents, we see the story unfold for both these families as the boys grapple with life and love.",
