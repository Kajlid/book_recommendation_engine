  "description": "It's hard enough coming to terms with being a xenofreak, but now Bryn discovers that the nanoneurons in her brain have left her vulnerable to attacks on her mind, forcing her to hide underground to block the devastating signals. Scott is ready and willing to protect her, but non-xenos all over the city have begun falling victim to a deadly mutated form of typhoid that someone seems to be deliberately spreading. He teams up with Dr. Mia Padilla, an infectious disease specialist, to help the XIA contain the contagion before it causes city-wide panic. Meanwhile, a new agent is assigned to protect Bryn. But Jason Alton has his own agenda, which includes a reckless determination to ingratiate himself with the queen of the Mad Eye gang, the main rival of the XBestia.",
