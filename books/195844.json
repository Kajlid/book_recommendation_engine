  "description": "Mina's Revolution, a historical saga set in Iran and the US. The story covers the life of an Iranian-American woman, before, during, and after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran through to the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. Mina Sha'abani, born a year before the 1953 CIA-backed coup d'etat in Iran and raised during the Shah's White Revolution, gets involved in the Islamic Revolution in her early 20s. While pregnant with the illegitimate child of a political leader, she escapes to the US, in the hopes of a better life for herself and her child. In Los Angeles, in the midst of the hostage crisis, she faces the Americans' animosity against her and her daughter Shirin. When she finds and meets one of her political mentors from Iran, Zary, her life begins to go through yet another series of changes and she has to make some more hard choices. Mina's Revolution is about growing up, making choices under pressure, struggling with morality issues, and finding grace against a backdrop of rebellion and revolution. It is the story of a life roiled by political and personal upheavals, the story of a woman who keeps trying to achieve inner peace while living in turbulent times.\"",
