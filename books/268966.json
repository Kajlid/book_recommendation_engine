  "description": "HumanAlien is a tetralogy, women fiction that invites you into the life of Vic, a half human half alien that explores life, feelings, Earth and the Universe. Take her hand, follow her path of healing and get ready to question everything you ever knew, starting with a heartbreak.. This story has so much more to offer than raising awareness about mental health; it is also related to subjects we all go through in our daily life that we all can relate to. Every chapter starts with a quote and a first paragraph that offers the reader to question their own life, their personal feelings and also let them questions about their own individuality. What makes this novel more special is that it is made of 4 smaller books named Dragonfly, Wolf, Goldfish and Honeybee. They all represent their own element and all have their different vibe, but together they make one full story.",
