There is no room for that woman in our life anymore.”Austin Pearson found everything the day she walked back into the small town of Point Arena. She found forgiveness, love and the life she had grown up to believe she was destined for with Tyler. Even with scars that remind her of the past, Austin is empowered and forthright. No longer afraid to hide her feelings, or ignore what she knows is right. She trusts in her husband’s love and her family and nothing can change that.When Natasha Truman begins to strike up an appearance in their lives again, still evidently living with a grudge and the belief that Tyler will love her again, Austin finds her entire life under threat. Even behind bars, Natasha is unstoppable at her attempts to make Austin doubt her life, her love and her future with the man she belongs with. What Natasha doesn’t realise is the girl she victimised years ago, no longer exists. What happens when Natasha takes her plan to the next level, and finds that Austin is now a force that should not be reckoned with? What about when Tyler proves how little he cares for Natasha in order to protect his family?After all, a lot can change in three years.",
