  "description": "The smoke and dust settle, and the fires go out. Alma leads a normal life; it’s what she’d always wanted. Blending in with others her age, she could be just a regular girl; phoning her friends, tormenting boys, not caring about the little things. A far cry from the girl that helped bring down the skyscraper of a mega-conglomerate, that wriggled out the world of the dead by the skin of her teeth and defy Algor Mortis. Now it’s a different kind of problem. Her new school, rife with bullies, picking on her and her friends because they’re different. Intent on causing misery. But she won’t have it; they’re messing with the wrong girl. All this to worry about and still her powers won’t leave her alone, still the freak in her itching to get out, no matter how hard she tries to forget. Those she defied haven’t forgotten the name Alma. She might have defeated them, vanished somehow with her companions from right under their noses, but they can’t forget. Won’t forget. The smoke and dust have settled, and the fires may have gone out. But revenge was always a dish best served cold.",
