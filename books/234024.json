  "description": "Power is patient, power is kind…No, wait. That’s not right. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely… Just ask Nate’s ex-fiancée.It’s almost this wizard’s birthday, so, he can cry if he wants to. That is, if he lives to see it…Because a lot of people want him dead: his fiancée, his long-lost ancestor, the good wizards, the dark wizards, and… Look, it’s easier to list who doesn’t want to kill him.To prevent a Shifter vs. Wizard War, Nate steps in to draw a line in the sand, picking a fight with the deadliest magic slingers on the planet… and then he tries to rob them.And with Achilles angry at Nate for crashing his Fight Night, the Horsemen of the Apocalypse breathing down his neck, Gods hiding behind mortal skins, and an accidental shifter infection with a cheerful Swedish male dancer, Nate has his hands full.But when his enemies decide to wake a God, the only way for Nate to level the playing field is to open an early birthday present from the Mad Hatter… And that’s when he finds out that nothing is ever simple, and that no one was ever who he thought they were all these years.",
