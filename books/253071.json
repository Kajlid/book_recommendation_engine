With an impressive collection of whips and high heels to her name, she sure has some kinky ways of showing affection. But Julia's been searching all her life for a man who won't be tamed too quickly - and when she meets rugged dude rancher Zach on a business get-together in Montana, she thinks she might have found him.He may be a simple countryman, but he's not about to take any nonsense from an uppity city woman like Julia. Zach's full of surprises: where she thinks he's tough, he turns out to be gentle; when she's confident she's got this particular cowboy broken in, he turns the tables on her. Underneath the big sky of Montana, has the steely Julia finally met her match?",
