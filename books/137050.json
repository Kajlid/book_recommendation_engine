  "description": "NEW AND NAÏVE…When Nell starts her new job with the Cassidy Corporation's marketing team, she doesn't expect to give offense to the CEO's gorgeous, enigmatic son during her first day. Sure she'll be fired by the end of the week, she instead finds herself pinned to the wall, captivated by his ravenous kisses…CONFUSED, YET CURIOUS…It seems there are two sides to tall, dark and delicious Marc Cassidy, and something in Nell has called the Dominant in him to the fore. He wants her for his own, and he's not afraid to show her how he can rock her world when he blindfolds, spanks and takes her. Though she tries to resist the intense chemistry between them, it's not long until Nell is plunged into the heady, unfamiliar world of sexual submission. Marc pushes her boundaries in every area, from crops and canes to bondage and public play. Even as she falls deeply in love with Marc, surrendering every part of her being to him, her new Dom is concealing an unfathomably dark family secret. TRUST AND DETERMINATION…When the tension finally reaches breaking point and Marc's carefully laid plans fall to pieces, Nell must find the strength to demand the same unfailing honesty from her billionaire Dom that he expects of her—whatever Marc's reaction might be. If she can unearth his dangerous secret, is she strong enough to walk a knife’s edge for love?",
