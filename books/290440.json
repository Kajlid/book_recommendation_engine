  "description": "Now what?Everything has changed, and not for the better. The not-so-perfect life I had as VP is gone, along with the team that’s been by my side each step of my political journey. Every move I make, every breath and thought, now affects millions, and the weight wears me down without Trey as a welcomed distraction. They tell me war is coming, and I’m the one who has to stop it. But how is the question no one can answer. Past enemies lurk in the shadows while new ones hide in plain sight, stalking, watching, and waiting for the right moment to take me out. I need Trey back. I need them all by my side and ready to fight for me.Can I undo the mess that my predecessor left in his wake, or will I break under the burden to save the world?No pressure, right?Power Surge is the fourth book in the five-book Power Play series and is a continuation of Randi and Trey’s epic love story. The books in this series cannot be read as standalones. All five books follow one main couple's relationship as it grows through a five-year time period. It's suspenseful, steamy, and oh so unputdownable. If you're a fan of Tiffany Snow, Meghan March, and Skye Warren, then this series is for YOU!",
