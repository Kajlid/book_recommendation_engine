Symone Esquire realized this the hard way when her contract with the sexy and brooding rocker, Sid “The Cherry Popper” Cooperton ended abruptly, forcing her to choose between her developing feelings for Sid, and the feelings she's always had for her best friend Trevor.

It didn’t take him long to realize that the nerdy virgin was going to turn his world upside down, but nothing could've prepared him for what happened after their contract ended. Now he's faced with an even bigger problem than falling for the girl who wears Yoda shirts for fun--a problem that is sure to change his life forever.Both desperate to find themselves and running from the decisions that will alter their futures, Sid and Symone embark on a spontaneous road trip where they continue their lessons, and explore their connection once again.But even fun road trips have to come to an end, and sometimes running away from your problems only makes them chase after you faster.",
