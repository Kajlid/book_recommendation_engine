  "description": "Germany has defeated the Allies, won WWII in Europe and cleansed the territory of undesirables. Yet the war in the Far East still wages on. Welcome to the future of Germania.  16-year-old Stella Engel has lived her entire life in a sheltered, but comfortable middle class existence within the Reich where she has made lifelong friends and fostered her love of science. For most of her childhood, she has hoped to grow up to serve the Reich as a doctor. Her high achievements have earned her a place at the annual Eugenics Competition, where only the best and brightest students in science are invited to compete, securing their future in a high ranking medical school. However, her trip is marred when her best friend Pia, and Pia's entire family suddenly, go missing. After searching for her friend to no avail, something even stranger happens: the Eugenics Competition is interrupted by the mass arrest of all of the contestants. They are now under suspicion of carrying \"dirty\" genes, or the genes of those the Reich has convinced the public have long been eradicated. Stella's mother helps her manage to flee from the SS temporarily, where Stella learns that nothing in the Reich is as it seems; and that includes Stella herself.  This is a test version of the novel on soft release with an anonymous author name. Please note there may be spelling errors as this work is not final.",
