  "description": "A Paper MaskISBN-0-533 28501 7​A nailbiting thriller in the tradition of \"Ripley's Game\". Hospital orderly Matthew Harris is every bit as smart as the junior doctors he works alongside. He's also trapped, bored, ambitious and ruthless. When a medical intern dies, Matthew assumes his identity and takes the dead man's next job, on the far side of the country, as a junior Emergency Room physician. As the deception starts to unravel,  the young nurse who falls for him is the one person standing between the newly-minted bogus doctor and the exposure of his lethal charade. \"Newcomer of the year. .... with complete believability the plot keeps twisting right up to the final words\"   Time magazine             \"First Rate... Fast paced and entertaining... Great technical panache\" - Newsweek \"John Collee has a masterful hand at narrative and a fast sure pro style... His work is clear, artfully unaddorned, and paced like a race hose\"  - News Day",
