  "description": "He needs her help. She wants his heart. Both will get more than they bargained for. SWIRL is a steamy New Adult story about a girl in love with a guy who's off limits at a time in her life where things are very much outside of her control. After a handsome jerk publicly humiliates her because of her weight, 24-year-old Brianna “Bri” Davis hits an all-time low. With no career, no place to live, and no self-confidence to speak of, Bri has reached rock bottom. The only stable thing in her crumbling life is the Drip Drop Coffee Shop, where she drowns her sorros in danishes and mugs of delicious coffee, served by an equally delicious barista. 28-year-old Jayce offers Bri a job, but it comes with strings attached: Bri must help him recapture the heart of his ex-girlfriend. She will remake him into a most irresistible specimen so that his ex has no choice but to take him back.Excited to finally have an income, Bri jumps at the opportunity, especially if working next to Jayce all day is part of the deal. Who cares if the man she's been pining away for has the hots for someone else? And the ex he's trying to win back? She's more interested in what he can buy her than a real relationship. Why can't Jayce see there's a more deserving woman right in front of him? Bri can't take any more disappointment. So, going after Jayce is probably a bad idea. But then everything changes, and soon, the steam in Jayce's lingering stare is hotter than the coffee they swirl.",
