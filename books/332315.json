  "description": "She was a beloved princess. I was a heartless bastard. I was supposed to save her. I wanted to ruin her. My need for her was sick. Twisted. It came from a dark and dangerous place. But I wasnâ€™t the only one with sadistic desires. The Brotherhood had plans of its own- a game they wanted to play. They wanted to break me, break her, break us. I dared them to try. This is not a love story. You've been warned. This is a dark secret society series which may contain content triggering to some people. PLEASE READ CONTENT WARNING. Darkest Hour is book three of an interconnecting series. While it may be read as a standalone, it is highly recommended that you read Mischief Night and Hallowed Eve first.",
