  "description": "While Mark’s body lies motionless in a Zurich clinic, his spirit has become very active and in a way that no observer could possibly suspect. On a journey through time and space, he is led by Zachri, a spirit guide, to relive three experiences that altered his life. A changed Mark is given a glimpse of the near future when corporate super-powers use their wealth to transport and store food off-planet by using space elevators. Mark’s final stop is Paradise, where he witnesses angels and spirits intervening in earthly conflicts. Now he must decide: will he come back to the woman he loves or cross over and rally heaven to change her future.",
