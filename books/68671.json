  "description": "There are days it just doesn’t pay to throw off your sheets, roll out of your hand-carved bed and answer the phone. Jericho Mason is about to have one of those days.The cops have called him to consult on a serial killer investigation. As a private investigator, he’s not beyond doing them a favor…for a price. The trouble starts at the scene of the crime and his Gift – the ability to touch objects and see details through the previous handler’s eyes – fails him. His only witnesses, the horrifically eviscerated dead girls, think their killer was inhuman. If only he could be sure they were right.Mason makes a habit of insulating himself from his cases and his clients but from some crimes there is no protection. After he runs across the true focus of the magical slayings he has to make a choice: keep living life on the sidelines, protected and unaffected, or commit to a course of action that could end his career and possibly his life?Definitely a bad day to answer the phone.",
