  "description": "Psychic powers, espionage, and unquenchable passion combine in this paranormal Regency romance by the New York Times bestselling author. Lady Alethea Vaughn Channing is haunted by a vision of a man in danger—the same man who she has seen in her dreams time and time again. She doesn't even know his name, and yet she feels an intense connection between them. And she knows with an inexplicable certainty that she is the only one standing between him and disaster. Rakish Lord Hartley Greville is capable of protecting himself, as he has proven more than once in his perilous work as a spy for the crown. If he's to carry out his duty, he'll need to put aside the achingly beautiful woman with the strange gift. And yet, when Alethea's visions reveal a plot that will pit innocent children in danger, Hartley will not be able to ignore the destiny that binds them together—or resist the passion burning between them.",
