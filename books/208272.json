  "title": "A Hole in Science: An Opening for an Alternative Understanding of Life",
  "description": "Problems have always existed for the scientific understanding of life, in particular with unusual behaviors. One such area is prodigious intellectual abilities. Explanations there are expected to be largely based on a person's DNA. More broadly, that logic is fundamental to the fields of behavioral genetics as well as personal genomics. Very surprisingly after much searching through relevant DNA, though, a number of the presumed DNA origins have not been identified.This book considers this quietly unfolding heritability mystery along with some amazing behavioral challenges to the logic of science. The book also introduces some alternative explanations available from a common traditional understanding of life. Some relevant commentary on the Religion-vs.-Science situation is also offered.The third edition contains some small changes plus a new big final chapter. That chapter contains discussions of some work that followed the second edition, including 2 books (S. Mukherjee's \"The Gene\" and S. Carroll's \"The Big Picture\") and two important articles. The books provided contradictory backdrops to the unfolding missing heritability situation, as well as to some behavioral enigmas. The final chapter also considered the very significant - and mysterious - conditions autism and schizophrenia; the famous Siberian foxes-to-dogs experiments; some remarkable phenomena reported on in E. Mayer's \"Extraordinary Knowing‚Äù; and the studies of individual cases suggestive of reincarnation.",
