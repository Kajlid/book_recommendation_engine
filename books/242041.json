  "description": "When two young children head down to the docks one day, they get much more than they bargained for! They meet the crew of \"The Greatest Captain in the World\" and hear stories of how their captain got them through run ins with giant waves, storms, pirates and more! Written by a real-life tallship captain (the book is not an auto-biography!), containing real sailor vocabulary (with a glossary and history explanations in the back!), with stories from a master story-teller (that were improvised on the spot!), and beautiful illustrations drawn by a professional artist (... they're really good!); this will be a truly unique experience to inspire the inner sailor, explorer and adventurer in all of us. Check out our video at www.greatestcaptain.com to learn more.",
