  "description": "After a rousing battle against unknown opponents, Annie Talks To Horses and her compadres continue guiding the Amish pilgrims toward their destination in the unexplored desert of post-apocalyptic Arizona. The hit and miss snipers struggle with obstacles of their own. Sir Jacob, Buzz and Hoss all have big parts to play. Annie, Wolf and Spud continue to explore their Injin heritage. A few surprising twists can be expected in this sizzling western adventure. The humor and sex are thrown in for free. The action takes place on a wilderness planet five hundred years in the future. Horses are the primary means of transportation. The planet, recently revealed as possibly being the post-apocalyptic remains of the original planet Earth, is sparsely inhabited. There are less than four hundred hardy pioneers. No community utilities or amenities have been created on its surface. The Rock, as it is now called, is home to hardy, self-reliant individualists who should probably be packing heat.",
