  "description": "This play is the story of an autistic adolescent who finds himself at a complete existential loss on the stage, with but a single sentence to call his own. Drilled by prompters who use terrifyingly funny logical and alogical language-sequences, Kaspar learns to speak \"normally\" and eventually becomes creative \"doing his own thing\" with words; for this he is destroyed.In Offending the Audience and Self-Accusation, one-character \"speak-ins,\" Handke further explores the relationship between public performance and personal identity, forcing us to reconsider our sense of who we are and what we know.",
