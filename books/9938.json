Emergency Laughter shows that it’s OK to laugh at yourself and the world around you.Mike Cyra spent twenty years working in Emergency Medicine and Surgery as a Surgical Technologist, an Emergency Medical Technician on ambulances, a Bering Sea Medic and an instructor of Basic Life Support and Maritime Emergency Medicine.",
