Angry and betrayed, Landry still wonders if she can save Delaney, or if she’ll have to pay the ultimate price. And then there’s Jade, her beautiful, strong girlfriend. Can Landry really have it all, or is she putting Jade’s heart, and life, at risk? When the inevitable battle with Delaney finally comes around, will Landry act with her heart or her head?",
