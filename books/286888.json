  "description": "Set in the semi-arid backlands of northeastern Brazil and spanning one century and three generations, this family saga is a complex psychological portrait of family life, intertwined with Brazil’s history from the birth of the republic to the end of the military dictatorship in 1989. Liberty Farm is a chronicle of family and society, history and geography, life and death, loyalty and justice, truth and connivance. It’s also a tale of paternal and filial love in all of its forms: strongly felt, unreciprocated, withheld, yearned for, never obtained. “Father, please look at me...”The death of the favorite son creates a love black hole that sucks away the father’s entire love. Invisible like the ones in the sky, this love black hole will rule the family for decades, its existence only revealed by the odd behavior of the three older sons. “The family must always stay together...”",
