  "description": "Eight people escape decimated New York. They have only one thing in the alcoholic gene. The same genetic quirk that makes alcoholics and addicts susceptible to booze and drugs gives them a mysterious ability to evade detection by the undead. But one gene in common isn’t enough to unite them. They’re an unlikely A Botoxed Upper Eastsider; a drug dealer rescued from lockup; a resentful daughter of addicts; an insecure AA guy; a Japanese ex-dope fiend; an addicted Ivy Leaguer; and a Mexican immigrant. Dodging natural and unnatural disasters, drugged lunatics, and the living dead, they struggle to face their personal demons, accept one another, and find a new life. They think they’ve reached the end of their trek when they encounter a settlement that takes A.A. to fundamentalist extremes. They have to make a choice…one they may not survive.",
