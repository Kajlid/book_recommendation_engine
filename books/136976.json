  "description": "In life and business, Trey Miller has always been the good guy. Nothing wrong with that, since it’s gotten him everywhere he has needed to be. His startup company is a success and growing so much that he is gaining the attention of larger corporations. By all accounts, Trey has it all, but the one place he fails is love. He thought he might have had something with Emogen Kane, but she was taken before he even had a chance. Now, he hides behind work, unwilling to take any risks in the love department. When Trey finds himself vying for a huge account against Faith Young, he knows he’s going to have to play it tough to win. Faith is smart, attractive and rumor has it, she lands every account she goes after. When Faith is thrown into his path at every turn, Trey starts to feel that it is more than a coincidence. Seeing Faith with her boyfriend douses the flame that he was starting to feel, until he realizes that the guy might not at all be what he seems. Trey let go once, but he’s determined to win it all this time. Does he have it in him to roll up his sleeves and get dirty? And if he does, will he finally end up with the girl?",
