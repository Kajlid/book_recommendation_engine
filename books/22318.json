  "title": "The Last Giants",
  "description": "An illustrated fantasy, told as fact, with a message for children and adults. The tale of a lost race of giants and what happens when their existence, and their location, becomes known by the outside world.After finding a huge tooth on the docks, English explorer Archibald Leopold Ruthmore sets out to seek the race of giants to whom the tooth belongs and discovers nine giants, the survivors of a singularly gentle and kindly race. He lives among them for ten months, and on returning home he makes a mistake that he regrets forever―he writes a book revealing their existence and location.School Library Journal said, “Part fable, part fantasy, and part morality tale, this unusual French import takes the form of a 19th-century explorer’s journal, illustrated with intricate watercolors… The powerful and thought-provoking messages require reflection and may be used to spark lively discussions.”",
