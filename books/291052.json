  "title": "Believe Me",
  "description": "Is there anyone who is too perfect? Of course, there must be in books, movies, daily soap operas, and web series. Unfortunately, I am also one of those characters. In this story, I am a perfect employee, perfect daughter and the world's number one sister (courtesy of the mug Purab gave me on sister's day). That shouldn't count, right? My life's goal is to have a successful career, get married in my late 20s and take care of Ma, Pa and Purab. A simple life with simple goals. Nothing like going to Mars or looking for aliens. In short, achievable. But that will change when a certain someone whom I hate, like I hate that tiny error in my sales report, whom I want to swat like a mosquito, will start making too many VIP appearances in my life. He is anything but perfect. Still, everybody loves him (sometimes more than me! It must be the smile). My beautiful, plain-vanilla life will start resembling a circus. In which I will jump through hoops. By the end of the story, you will find out how a girl who is a perfectionist turns into an impulsive daredevil. I will quit my well-paying job and plan on becoming a baker ( I liked baking, but baking as a career sounds as crazy as looking for aliens), fall in love with this flirt and become the victim of a scheming creep at gunpoint.",
