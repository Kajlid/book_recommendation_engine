  "description": "Alex was just an adventurous kid when he saved a young girl's life. Years later, sudden bouts of recurring nightmares drove him to find her, only to have her ripped from his life by a lunatic. The one time he needed help, he was forced to call on a criminal. Stolen from the banks of the Tennessee River, she was swept to the war torn streets of Old Montr√©al. Was his love strong enough to protect her once more? Not from the grip of the madman who took her, but from the arms of the criminal who saved her.",
