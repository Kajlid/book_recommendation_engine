  "description": "Monsters and ghosts, madness and murder, fear and suspense - this third volume in the 3VIL series features an all-new trilogy of original, spine-tingling horror stories which cover the entire spectrum of darkest evil: 1. A bickering couple drives together through a dark desert at night. When they enter the domain of a vicious monster, can they survive its carnage until morning? 2. An old man buys a dream. When the product is defective, is there a warranty to cover the nightmare? 3. A pair of defenseless children are trapped alone in the worst part of town. Can a young boy lead his baby sister to safety? Each story is crafted with punishing intensity and merciless brutality, and few readers will survive the experience unscathed.",
