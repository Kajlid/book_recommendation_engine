  "title": "The Fabulous Feminist",
  "description": "It was on a sabbatical in England in the late 1970s that Suniti Namjoshi discovered feminism – or rather, she discovered that other feminists existed, and many among them shared her thoughts and doubts, her questions and visions.Since then she has been writing–fables, poetry, prose, autobiography, children’s stories– about power, about inequality, about oppression, effectively using the power of language and the literary tradition to expose what she finds absurd and unacceptable.This new collection brings together in one volume a huge range of Namjoshi’s writings, starting with her classic collection, 'Feminist Fables', and coming right up to her latest work.",
