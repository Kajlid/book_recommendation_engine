  "description": "Ethan, About last night... I could blame the bourbon. I could say I let things get out of hand, that I should have never called you, but I'm done lying to myself—to you. I know what you're going to say. You're not very good at keeping your opinions to yourself, but this can't happen. It's inappropriate, at best. I'm your boss. Not to mention, you're clearly still hung up on him. I'm not a consolation prize. Anders~ ** Anders, You didn't think it was inappropriate when you had your tongue down my throat, but I digress. As for your accusation, I'm not the only one stuck in the past, but at least I'm not running from it. I can't believe I'm about to say this… Maybe you're right. You shouldn’t have called me. Especially if you never intended to own it. Own that you wanted it to happen. Admit that you wanted me. Not so sincerely, Yours Not So Sincerely, Yours is a 97,000-word standalone HEA, enemies to lovers, light on angst, MM office romance, featuring southern sass, words of the day, Happy Meals, and one unforgettable weekend trip to Manhattan.",
