  "description": "Justice Labelle always had her life perfectly planned. Her goals were to graduate from the University with exceptional grades and get into the best law school Canada has to offer.Then one day, Justice tried to kill herself. Well, not her technically. It may have been her body, but those actions weren't intentional and the suicidal thoughts were not hers. Or, so she keeps telling her therapist and family.Justice is afraid she’s losing her mind and just wants to forget everything. But when her best friend is murdered, another one is being mind-screwed by a Vampyre, and her ex is back in town, looking as scrumptious as ever and very suspicious, maybe she isn't all that crazy!Just when she thinks that life couldn't throw her anymore curve balls, Justice figures out that she is Vampyre Doll and there's a vampyre who seems very familiar to her, but she can't figure out from where.Justice is suffocating and drowning in a dark world she's been tossed into, forced to survive. It’s a world she never wanted to know about and would love to ignore, like it doesn't exist. But, with every passing day, she's pulled deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole, wishing for everything to go back to the way it was.",
