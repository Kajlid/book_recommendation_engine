  "description": "DOGWOOD BLUES is a work of sassy southern fiction. Told through the voices of its eccentric characters, DOGWOOD BLUES depicts life in Dogwood, Georgia, a small town near the Alapaha River that is struggling with change. When Kevin Kilmer, award-winning New York author, moves back to Dogwood's historic district to write his memoir, he crashes headfirst into his heartbreaking past.Boone Marshall, a farmer and blues pianist, stirs gossip when, mere months after the suicide of his first wife, he brings home a new bride, a nightclub singer from New Orleans.  Every week, the women of the Honeysuckle Bridge Club gather to play cards, share gossip, and argue about local issues. Lines are drawn in Dogwood over the upcoming liquor referendum, a vote that threatens to turn dry Creek County wet. And Nell Sauls creates gossip and drops it like bird poop over the town. Brimming with opinionated and irreverent characters, and told with the mournful sound of the blues, DOGWOOD BLUES is a story of betrayal, forgiveness, and redemption.",
