  "description": "The game was supposed to be easy… enter the door, find the object, collect the prize money.But nothing is ever that easy for Meg Covington. Her dad keeps a roof over her head, but college is out of the question. Her best friend, Brek, will leave for school, and she’ll be trapped in her hometown—that is until she discovers the flyer for Rosenbaum’s game hanging in the entryway of the record store.Within the basement of the mansion lies the white passage, a hallway lined with colorful doors. When each door turns out to be a portal to another world, things get complicated quickly. If Meg and Brek find the object within the world, she will take her first step towards freedom. But is it really just a game, or a one-way ticket to something much more dangerous? The Green Door is the first book in Heather Kindt’s young adult fantasy series. If you like strong female leads, adventure, snarky attitudes, and sexy sirens, then you’ll love the first installment in the Eternal Artifacts series.",
