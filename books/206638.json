  "description": "Earth and fire unite in paranormal ritual so hot that sand melts to glass and meteors fly across the sky. Jace Fialko decided long ago he’d never try to mate again. He knows firsthand how the magical foreplay–the duel for sexual equality can turn deadly. He tempts fate when a stubborn, sinfully tempting earth-witch gets into trouble and can’t resist being her hero. She’s prickly as a badger, lives in an Earthship, and has secrets deeper than the crevices she carves into the sand. Terra needs to hide her talent. Alone in the desert for years, she knows better than to fall for an arrogant, sexy, flame-throwing alpha male. Her potent dark power could destroy them both, yet every moment she spends with him, makes her desperate to join with him. When an evil clan tries to take her mine full of turquoise, she must learn to fight back or lose everything, including Jace. Haven’t read book one yet? No worries. Read the series in any order.WARNING: Book contains mature themes, steamy, sexual scenes and graphic language.",
