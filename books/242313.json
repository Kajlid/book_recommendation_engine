When temptation lives just around the corner, who knows what wicked wonders will result?Shea Dresden doesn't need her PhD to know she's more brains than bod—too much bookworm, too little bada-bing!—but this is getting ridiculous.

She's flirted, asked him out, done everything but beg—and still come up empty-handed.Tired of waiting for what she wants, Shea hatches a scheme to snag the stubborn ATF agent once and for all. It's the perfect plan, and she's willing to do anything to make it work. But when her little strategy backfires, Shea finds she's being rescued instead of ravished. And she still wants her mind-shattering night of sexual ecstasy. What's a desperate woman to do?Rock his world, of course! Shea's not about to take another no, especially when she's already got the sexy stud in her bedroom. She may have to swallow her pride to get what she wants—but by the end of the night, it's Ryan who's paying all the lip service.Ryan McCall's been burned before, and he knows better than to play with fire. Too bad the shy little scholar living right nextdoor affects him like gasoline on an open flame. He's done his best to stay the hell away from her, but once he gets that first taste, he knows he's in some serious trouble. Shea may be looking for wild times between the sheets, but Ryan soon finds he's ready to convince her to take a chance on a bad boy like himself—forever.",
