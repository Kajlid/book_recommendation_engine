Simon is a community college professor who is starting a trial course to train emergency medical technicians. He's nervous because before this he's only ever done first aid courses for companies, but now people are going to be trying to save lives based on what he teaches.  After the first lesson he meets two of his students, Chris and Brian. Both men are at least half his age but he can't stop thinking about them, even thought it's inappropriate. He tries to avoid descending into this taboo way of thinking but it becomes harder as he gets more involved in their lives, for they have their own problems that require private tuition, and Simon finds that he has to put a lot on the line for them.  But his life has been empty and these two men have awakened something inside him that he thought had long since died. Feeling passion for the first time in years Simon wonders if it will only remain a fantasy, or if there's a chance that he will get to experience it for real.   \nCONTENT NOTE: This is a short story that may be read in under 2 hours.
