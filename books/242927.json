  "description": "Trouble.  That's how everybody described Destiny O'Neill. Trouble wrapped up in a smart-assed bow. The first black witch born to the Celtic gods in a thousand years, Destiny's tongue was as poisonous as her magic and her parties were the stuff of legend. Until two stripes on a pregnancy test changed everything.  Now all Destiny wants is a normal life. She wants to pass her exams, graduate university, and look after the only people that matter in her life--her daughter and her aunt. She doesn't want to hear about the magical police division or how much her skills could help them. And she's sorry about those missing kids on the news but it's not her problem.  All Destiny needs to do is get past her twenty-first birthday without using her powers, and she will be approved to join the ranks of the free witches and escape The Family, for once and for all.  No problem. Until the boy with the blue eyes crosses her path again...
