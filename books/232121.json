  "title": "George: A Novel of T.E. Lawrence",
  "description": "In May 1935, T.E. Lawrence – better known to the world as Lawrence of Arabia – was killed in a motorcycle accident in Dorset, England, bringing to a sudden end a complicated life of adventure, influence and tragedy.At least, that's what the public was told.Awakening in a Dorset hospital with grave injuries and no memory of his former life, the man once known as Thomas Edward Lawrence begins his life anew as George Patrick, a penniless, simple-minded laborer at a decrepit country estate near the Welsh border. With only a handful of people aware of his true identity – kept a secret for the havoc it could wreak upon the public – George attempts to make sense of his confusing new world while struggling with the legacy of a man he has no memory of having ever been.But when a dangerous man claiming to know his secret and threatening to undo the carefully woven web of concealment, George must confront not only his past, but fight for his own future.“For the comfort of his friends a statement was issued declaring that had [Lawrence] survived he would have been dumb and paralysed, and all his memories of the great issues he lived for would have been lost in the blank unconsciousness through which he had lived. 'In view of the immense activity and energy of T.E. Shaw [then-alias of T.E. Lawrence],' the statement continued, 'it is felt that this may be of some consolation to those who had entertained anxious hopes for his recovery.'”From The Western Gazette newspaper, Somerset, England, dated Friday, May 24th, 193511 days after the accidentBlending historical fact and imagination, George takes readers on an extraordinary journey alongside a rich cast of characters to explore the limits of human resilience and whether our identity traps us – or sets us free.",
