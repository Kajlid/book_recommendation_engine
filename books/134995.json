  "description": "I looked down at my hands. They were broad and strong, callused and worthy. I was a man of great valor and little fear, and yet I dared not speak the truth when Adorian erred in his assumptions. “You know that I did not leave you, my prince.”Adrik the Huntsman has loved Prince Adorian for as long as he’s known him—far beyond the love of a man for his liege and far longer than he served him as right hand and guardian.Stoic, strong and all too silent about matters of the heart, Adrik does the job required of him until he can no longer bear it.Leaving the kingdom, he travels and plies his trade as a huntsman-at-large, shooting “wolves” and wrangling unfortunate stepdaughters, until a chance meeting brings his Prince into his life once more…and back to his campfire.The Huntsman is a novella of homoerotic romance that both defies and embraces fairy tale conventions.",
