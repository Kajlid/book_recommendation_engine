She’s dated five of them.On top of her failed romantic life, she’s trying to keep her SoHo boutique ahead of the creditors and on top of the trends. When an old friend offers her a consulting job on a new gay makeover show, she snatches up the golden opportunity faster than you can say, “Never wear stripes with paisley.”Color her déjà blue when one of the cast members turns out to be her latest ex. Well, she doesn’t believe for a second that he’s gay. He’s a lying louse and she’s going to prove it, even if she has to stalk him to get the proof.In the meantime, she’s battling a growing attraction to the show’s kitchen god, Chris, despite knowing beforehand that he’s gay. He’s sweet, sexy, and funny. The perfect guy. And things only gets worse when he joins in on the stalking. Long, late nights in the cramped quarters of her car are not exactly fostering emotional distance.As the stalking and her attraction to Chris escalate, can Bethany prove to herself, once and for all, that she’s not the closet cleaner she fears she’s become? Can she stop falling for unavailable guys and find one that’s a lifetime keeper? Only time—and stalking—will tell.",
