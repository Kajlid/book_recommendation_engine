  "title": "Voices from the Other World: Ancient Egyptian Tales",
  "description": "Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz reaches back millennia to his homelandâ€™s majestic past in this enchanting collection of early tales that brings the world of ancient Egypt face to face with our own times.From the Predynastic Period, where a cabal of entrenched rulers banish virtue in jealous defense of their status, to the Fifth Dynasty, where a Pharaoh returns from an extended leave to find that only his dog has remained loyal, to the twentieth century, where a mummy from the Eighteenth Dynasty awakens in fury to reproach a modern Egyptian nobleman for his arrogance, these five stories conduct timeless truths over the course of thousands of years. Summoning the power and mystery of a legendary civilization, they examplify the artistry that has made Mahfouz among the most revered writers in world literature.Translated by Raymond Stock",
