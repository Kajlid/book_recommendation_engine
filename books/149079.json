  "description": "Michael and Jamie have one simple rule to DON’T. Don’t touch. Don’t share rooms. Don’t even look at each other. But the music is the chemistry that made the band is gone, together with their happiness. What they need now is an innocent front, something to make people think they've broken it off. But when they ask Sapphire for help, they may just get more than they bargained for.",
