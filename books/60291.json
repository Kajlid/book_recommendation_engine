  "description": "Daniel is a fireman with a full moon secret, and his job turns flaming hot when he saves a sexy stranger who turns out to be his destined mate. Vincent feels trapped living the Santa Monica street life thanks to a secret of his own, but at least he’s in charge of his own destiny—or so he thinks. When he realizes he’s in danger of far more than losing himself to the erotic yet frightening animal power of his heroic rescuer, he must give in to the mating bond he fears in order for their passion—and Vincent—to survive.",
