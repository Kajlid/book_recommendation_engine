  "description": "Erotic thoughts of the stranger who knocked her off her feet the day before she left Brisbane, two years ago, has prevented Loren Hillier from forming a worthwhile relationship with other men, so to meet him again, the same way...on the same corner, the day after her return, seems like fate. Although she had tried to forget him she found that it only took a look, a touch and she was his for as long as he wanted her.Ben Tyler enjoys the competitive thrill of his work to the utmost, until the woman he has fantasised about, re-enters his life. Can he satisfy his desire with unlimited sex in the four days before he must leave on a business trip or will the awareness of her touch, her taste, drive him to distraction? Slaking their thirst has never been so enjoyable but is it only lust that forms their growing bond?",
