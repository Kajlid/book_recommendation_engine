  "description": "Only one man in England grasps the threat of the evil rising in Germany, but Winston Churchill is still in the political wilderness and without power to awaken the world to Hitler and the malevolence of his Third Reich. Another man only has finding an heiress to marry on his mind—that and avoiding work whenever possible. A handsome and engaging rogue, Lieutenant Lowell Brady of the U.S. Navy has the great advantage of having a powerful senator pushing his career upward. The White House wants a junior officer in London to quietly liaison with Churchill and his circle, and in slapdash fashion Brady is chosen to pose as an American cousin and live in the great man’s home. He can’t avoiding picking up the crumbs of insider knowledge that fall from Churchill’s table and develops an undeserved reputation in Washington, D.C., as a first-class intelligence asset. This proves a two-edge sword when he returns home, as he relates to a Smithsonian oral historian who thinks she is a Plain Jane but isn't. Like a cork riding the surge of history, he is drawn into the conspiracy that leads to Pearl Harbor, the necessary act that put America into World War II. Because of what he knows, Brady is sent into the hottest battles with the understanding he won’t come back. When it is learned he did, the government still wants him kept quiet—one way or another. He must go on the run and she goes with him.",
