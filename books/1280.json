Developmentally delayed as a result of his birth mother’s abuse, Lucas Daniel Boyce struggled out of the gate and ended up failing kindergarten. His adoptive mother didn’t cast him aside as another tragic statistic however. Instead, Dorothy Boyce instilled in Lucas two very important principles that drove his determination to overcome the cards he’d been dealt and enabled him to eventually serve at the White House, fly aboard Air Force One, and become an executive for the NBA’s Orlando Magic at the young age of 29.",
