  "description": "Everyone in the galaxy wants the Plot Device…especially the looming orange supervillain Big Vicious Dude, Lord of All the Galactic Places He Feels Like and his Vice Lord Whinin the Finger Pointer. Clearly, the galaxy needs a hero! Too bad all they’ve got is man-child Quitter Pill, Grapesoda the space babe, Bunny Foofoo, Dweeb the world’s biggest raspberry gumball, and a treelike creature who keeps saying “I am Grout.” Together they’re the Mockeries of the Galaxy, and they’ll save everyone, no matter the cost…as long as it’s not their collectables.",
