  "description": "Carlos Castaneda takes the reader into the very heart of sorcery, challenging both imagination and reason, shaking the very foundations of our belief in what is \"natural\" and \"logical.\"Fire from Within is the author's most brilliant thought-provoking and unusual book, one in which Castaneda, under the tutelage of don Juan and his \"disciples,\" at last constructs, from the teachings of don Juan and his own experiences, a stunning portrait of the \"sorcerer's world\" that is crystal-clear and dizzying in its implications.Each of Carlos Castaneda's books is a brilliant and tantalizing burst of illumination into the depths of our deepest mysteries, like a sudden flash of light, like a burst of lightning over the desert at night, which shows us a world that is both alien and totally familiarâ€”the landscape of our dreams.",
