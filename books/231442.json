  "description": "The tales colleted in this volume reflect the dynamic character of Mexican folklore, created and perpetuated by a vital people. Mr. Paredes has prepared a scholarly collection of the Mexican tales that still thrive in oral literature and i the famous Mexican fiestas, which combine legend, dance, ritual, carnival, and drama in endless recombination.\"All levelsof Mexican social strucrture are represented in the tales since Dr. Paredes has included tales from modern, cosmopolitan Mexico Cty as well as narratives from the campo. Aside the usual stereotyped characters of much of the world's folktale tradition, we find Aztec dieties and monsters, charismatic caudillos, psychiatrists, and such famous personges as Kim Novak and Pedro de Urdemalas.... The miraculous and the mundane, the fictitious and the historical arae present .... Dr. Paredes has done an outstanding job of translating these tales into an English which retains much of the flavor of Mexican Spanish without falling into the trap of allowing the narratives to sound as if they were written for utterance by Mexican bandidos of a spaghetti western. His Introduction traces the history of the folkloristic scholarship within Mexico and points out the successes and failures of some of that scholarship. This Introduction, coupled with Dr. Dorson's Preface, which sketches the major events and influencs in the development of modern Mexico, serve to give a background against which the selected tales can be better understood. Folktales of Mexico stands as one of the few works available to non-Spanish speakers and readers which portrays with relative accuracy a Latin American tradition of oral narrative.\" - P.
