  "description": "Book Two in the MY BEST FRIEND'S BROTHER Series ( YA Contemporary Romance / Romantic Comedy ) - CONTENT WARNING Recommended for ages 16+ due to bawdy humor, non-graphic sexual content and some strong language. - Meeting Luke was the best thing to ever happen to Adonia Morrison. Just one look at him makes her knees wobble--he's sexy, smart, funny, literally every girl's dream! And her father's nightmare. As senior year draws to a close and everyone prepares for a change of scenery, Lilly Jacobson's boyfriend, Gino Barone, backs out of moving to Hawaii with her. Distraught, Lilly tells a \"little white lie\" to make him reconsider. Or maybe it's not so little. Luke and Adonia's chaperoned trip to the Alps offers at least some distraction from Lilly's plight. And, for a while, all goes well ... until Adonia discovers the frequent texts Luke receives but never mentions. Adonia can't help but feel her average self may be in for some serious competition. Upon their return home to Alaska, Adonia's shocked to learn that Lilly's not-so-little white lie has snowballed into a fictional reality. Caught in the middle, Adonia must choose between her best friend and her best friend's brother. And, sadly, Lilly's lie is bound to not only wreck her own love life, but to drag Adonia's down with her. Can Luke's secret really be that bad? Who thought a new hottie would cause such chaos? How far can one little lie go? And will anyone's relationship survive this arctic blast?",
