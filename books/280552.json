  "title": "Slaughter of Innocents",
  "description": "When a virulent flu vaccine brings a high fatality rate, the leaders of several nations fearfully turn to weapons of last resort. America's population centers are destroyed outright while the population continues to decline from the virus. Jensen Carlson, fresh from another tour in Southwest Asia, is an Advanced Scout Light Cavalry instructor chosen for his experience with the Army's newest armored scout vehicle. When the first nukes hit, he headed for the hills. It didn't take long for him to reach out to his best friend, an Air Force intelligence asset named Daniel Benton. Together, they flee from the devastation and head for the northern Georgia mountains. As food and resources become scarce, they run into militant groups of survivors who are happy to shoot first and ask questions later. With senses honed by combat and an edge in weapons, they fight their way to a remote cabin they think will be safe. This book contains violence and profanity and is intended for more mature audiences.",
