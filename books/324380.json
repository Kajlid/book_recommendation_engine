  "description": "The creators of the children's classic Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? team up again in this special book about a very important topic—endangered animals. A bald eagle soars, a spider monkey swings, a macaroni penguin struts, and a red wolf sneaks through Bill Martin Jr's rhythmic text and Eric Carle's vibrant images, and all are watched over by our best hope for the future—a dreaming child.",
