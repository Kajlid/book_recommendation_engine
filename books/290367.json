  "description": "Strong.Kind.Forbidden.Guys like him didn’t want girls like me.Or did they?My life was a battle, one which I was losing.Each moment I struggled to keep everything on lockdown.And yet all it took was the man with the enticing eyes to draw me out.He thought he knew my secrets, but he had no idea the pain I felt.The torture I suffered.The agony I held deep down inside where no one else could see.Dancing had been my only savior.But now he was too.The marine who knew the deepest part of my soul.The tattoo artist who turned my black and grey world into full color.The man fourteen years older than me.He’d vowed to protect me. To shield me from the evil I encountered.But there was a dark cloud hanging over us.One which promised to rain terror.The battle had turned into a war, and there could only be one winner.",
