  "description": "*This is the start of a series. It may contain triggers and ends on a cliffhanger.*This empire is built on the bones of our enemies,surrounded by shadows that hide our twisted deeds and quiet wealth.SiennaAfter a decade, what remained was a lone pendant and a shattered heart.If not for the photo, I’d think he was a ghost.With no other choice, I redefined my life, mending the broken pieces.But like all things that haunt us, he’s back, engulfing my once simple life into a raging storm surrounded by crime and bloodshed.The trouble he brings is more than just his secrets; it's the weakness he brings out of me.But just one taste can’t hurt, can it?ElioMy existence is tangled with darkness and mayhem, where we live by a code—family, power, loyalty, and protection.Until her.She was the light.And I left.Everything I’ve done has been to protect her.She resists our connection, consumed by the betrayals of the past.Too bad. I refuse to stop until she becomes mine again.",
