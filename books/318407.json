Not to mention discovering where her new adult emotions are coming from. But as Lenora uncovers more of Elpax's terrible secrets, she realizes that fighting the system might be the only way to save her family, her country, and her first love.The first in an epic series perfect for fans of Victoria Aveyard's Red Queen and Lauren Oliver's Delirium, The Crossing Gate combines the tropes of classic YA dystopia with a Greek-inspired setting and fantasy elements that will whisk readers away on a journey like no other.",
