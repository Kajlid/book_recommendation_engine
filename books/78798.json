  "description": "In this collection of his funniest and most outrageous newspaper columns, irreverent, opinionated Lewis Grizzard gets down to the serious business of humor and everybody comes away laughing. Nothing is sacred, not even \"I figure I have spent five minutes every morning for the past five years blow-drying my hair. That is six days of my life spent with Flash Gordon's ray gun pointed at my brain, which probably has windburn by now!\" Whether he is commenting on politics, women or sports, bemoaning technology or mocking Southerners who try to talk like Northerners, Grizzard, \"the Faulkner for just plain folks,\" has never been funnier. Other Lewis Grizzard titles available on Sound Editions from Random My daddy was a pistol and I'm a son of a gun Elvis is dead and I don't feel so good myself if love were oil, I'd be about a quart low don't bend over in the garden, Granny, you know them taters got eyes.",
