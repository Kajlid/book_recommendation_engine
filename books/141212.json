  "description": "Sometimes you need to cut and run and sometimes the ties run too deep to abandon.  Bonnie’s job at Purgatory keeps her on edge in more ways than one. Every day the pain of her grief over losing her Dom threatens to consume her. Her only escape comes at the hands of the resident tattooed bad boy who likes to keep things light and loose with a variety of women. He may not be the Dom of her dreams, but he chases away the darkness if only for one night…  Dex is used to unattached submissives coming to him for a chance to feel the kiss of his flogger or the sting of his whip until they find their own Doms. With his busy life of ink and kink he likes keeping his women at arm’s length. Except one night a month when Bonnie shreds him every time she asks him to hold her close.  When an unexpected invitation to an island resort arrives, is it the answer to their problems? Or their worst nightmare?  *Author's Note: While HOLD ME CLOSE can easily be read as a stand alone story, you'll likely enjoy reading the earlier Purgatory Club books, too.",
