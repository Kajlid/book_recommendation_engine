  "description": "Twice the Prince Charming, twice the happy ever after. Right?  They’re rich, gorgeous, and dominantly possessive. Their name is Charming, and they’re actual, honest-to-goodness royal princes.  Oh, and they’re twins.  It’s every princess’s fantasy to think about finding her prince charming, but what happens when she finds two of them? Literally.  They both want me. And they’ve made it perfectly clear that they come as a package deal. Two mouths. Four demanding, powerful hands. Two huge -uh- crown jewels?  “Scandalous” doesn’t even begin to cover what the tabloids would say about this.  I was burned one time before, but maybe “one” is my problem. Maybe it takes twice the man, or men, to make this fairytale complete?  Maybe I’m about to take on more trouble than I know what to do with, and maybe I’ll just end up getting royally screwed.  No, scratch that. I’m definitely about to get royally screwed…   *Please note that each of the Possessing Beauty books are completely standalone stories centered around one couple, with no cliffhangers.  Sharing Beauty is a quicky modern fairytale involving two utterly obsessed alpha heroes and enough insta-love, kindle-melting steam, and sugary-sweetness to keep you up far past your bedtime. This mfm romance is all about her – no m/m. If you love over-the-top, slightly unrealistic, and wildly dirty stories, this one’s for you! HEA with NO CHEATING!",
