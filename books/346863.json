  "title": "The Philosophical Inquiry: Towards a Global Account",
  "description": "The Philosophical Inquiry develops a \"global theory\" on the nature of philosophy. This study compares the philosophical process to other cultural activities including, science, religion, and art. What this study reveals is that the philosophical inquiry is a conjectural inquiry, similar to science, which anticipates consensual results. The innovative concepts and diagnostic evaluations of major systems of thought found in this book look to the future of philosophy as we move into a scientifically oriented culture.",
