  "title": "Destroying Declan",
  "description": "Declan Gilroy is an assh*le. Eight years ago, he pushed his way into my life and made himself at home. Made me believe he was different. Made me love him. And then he destroyed me. Left me. Broke my heart. And I’ll never forgive him for it. Never. I’ve spent the last eight years watching him move on. Live his life like what he did to me meant nothing. Like I meant nothing. He might not love me anymore, but he still wants me. That much I’m sure of. I can see it in the way he looks at me. Feel it in the way he kisses me. I’ve waited eight long years to get even but it’s finally here. The chance to make him hurt. To destroy him. And I’m going to take it. Even if it destroys me, all over again.",
