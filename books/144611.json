  "description": "Rachel is 19. She doesn’t know how to handle her new stepmother, let alone the end of the world. But after finding her stepmother dead, Rachel is suddenly racing against time—and terrifying, unnatural forces—to survive a gruesome apocalyptic event. Outside her door, the college town of Fort Collins, Colorado, is filled with corpses, and something unfathomable is happening to those bodies. And it’s only just begun. As Rachel struggles to comprehend her horrible new reality, she’ll need to find answers to questions she never thought she’d ask—all while desperately searching for her lost father, on whom she pins all her hopes for coming out of this phenomenon alive and intact. But nothing will be as it seems. Tom Piccirilli says “Blood Red gets seriously under your skin. It’s a whole new kind of horror novel.” Grant Jerkins says it’s “unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. It starts as a slow-burn freak-out and culminates in a series of horror-show set pieces that will forever be etched in my mind.” Alden Bell calls Blood Red “an epic addition to the genre. Ranging from the gritty to the surreal, the story delivers a nonstop, real-time experience of the End Times—replete with visceral terror, buckets of gore, and, ultimately, a redemptive humanity.” Robert Devereaux says the book is “guaranteed to creep you out!” The beginning of an epic trilogy telling the real-time tale of an apocalyptic event, Blood Red is a nonstop thrill ride from the author of The Naked Dame and the publisher of Skull Full of Spurs and Santa Steps Out.",
