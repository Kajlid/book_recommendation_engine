  "description": "It's early days in the rambling big old house that Jamie has moved to with his dad and his partner Sue, but Jamies feels unsettled. Unhappy about leaving the farm, Jamie is also less than thrilled to learn that Sue is going to have a baby. And when he finds that the bedroom he has chosen beneath the witch's-hat roof is always cold, Jamie begins to suspect a ghostly presence. Nobody else seems to notice it, but Jamie becomes convinced that Marion, the elderly lady next door, knows something. Together with Ros, a keen rower, Jamie must overcome his fear of the river to solve an eighty-year-old mystery.",
