Why? Because after waking up in Europe with pop princess Krissy Doucet wrapped in his arms, he knew his life had changed forever. Out of work dancers were a dime a dozen. However, for Keenan, dancing was his way of life and as tempting as it was, he would not allow Krissy to use her influence to send him to the top. From the moment Krissy set her sights on Keenan, she knew he would be amazing in bed, and she was right. Choosing him at the club had been one of the best decisions of her life. Sex, drugs and rock-n-roll might seem like a great theme for a seventies movie, but for Keenan and Krissy it was their way of life. The paparazzi said they were in lust, not love. However, for them, lust and love went hand in hand.*************************************************************************************************",
