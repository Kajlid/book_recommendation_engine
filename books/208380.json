  "description": "Leah's Way is that rarest of novels, one that combines an inspirational story with unapologetic realism, where characters come alive and fill the heart with experiences as unforgettable as life itself. The tale of one woman's quest to find the meaning of her life, Leah's Way examines the soul at search, set against a world full of human weakness and misgiving. It is in this seeming despair that Leah's Way becomes a story of personal triumph, the kind of singular determination that inspires the reader toward a greater appreciation of all the soul struggles to achieve. Above all, Leah's Way is a testament to the irrepressible will of the human spirit and a tribute to an indomitable faith that guides the soul homeward.",
