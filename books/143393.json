  "title": "Loving Mr. Daniels",
  "description": "To Whom it May Concern,  It was easy to call us forbidden and harder to call us soulmates. Yet I believed we were both. Forbidden soulmates.  When I arrived to Edgewood, Wisconsin I didn’t plan to find him. I didn't plan to stumble into Joe's bar and have Daniel's music stir up my emotions. I had no clue that his voice would make my hurts forget their own sorrow. I had no idea that my happiness would remember its own bliss.  When I started senior year at my new school, I wasn’t prepared to call him Mr. Daniels, but sometimes life happens at the wrong time for all the right reasons.  Our love story wasn’t only about the physical connection.  It was about family. It was about loss. It was about being alive. It was silly. It was painful. It was mourning. It was laughter.  It was ours.  And for those reasons alone, I would never apologize for loving Mr. Daniels.  -Ashlyn Jennings",
