  "title": "Laurel Canyon: The Inside Story of Rock-and-Roll's Legendary Neighborhood",
  "description": "Michael Walker’s Laurel Canyon presents the inside story of the once hottest rock and roll neighborhood in LA.In the late sixties and early seventies, an impromptu collection of musicians colonized a eucalyptus-scented canyon deep in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles and melded folk, rock, and savvy American pop into a sound that conquered the world as thoroughly as the songs of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones had before them. Thirty years later, the music made in Laurel Canyon continues to pour from radios, iPods, and concert stages around the world. During the canyon's golden era, the musicians who lived and worked there scored dozens of landmark hits, from \"California Dreamin'\" to \" Judy Blue Eyes\" to \"It's Too Late,\" selling tens of millions of records and resetting the thermostat of pop culture.In Laurel Canyon , veteran journalist Michael Walker tells the inside story of this unprecedented gathering of some of the baby boomer's leading musical lights―including Joni Mitchell; Jim Morrison; Crosby, Stills, and Nash; John Mayall; the Mamas and the Papas; Carole King; the Eagles; and Frank Zappa, to name just a few―who turned Los Angeles into the music capital of the world and forever changed the way popular music is recorded, marketed, and consumed .",
