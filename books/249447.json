  "description": "Sometimes things that go bump in the night make the best bodyguards. When Iliona is attacked by a demon, help comes from an unexpected source… Cal, the hot gargoyle from her local coffee shop. Her stone hottie has some secrets of his own though, namely a ‘twin’ born of stone and just as hot as he is. With everything from a demon to redcaps trying to kill her, can Iliona track down a serial killer before she becomes his next victim? Born of stone to protect . . . They’ll stop at nothing to keep her safe. Freed from their curse Cal and Gran relish their new freedom. Working at Frankie’s Coffee Shop isn’t the most glamorous, but it beats sitting on the roof of a church. And for Cal, Frankie’s has another advantage . . . the curvy beauty who comes in for coffee. He feels a pull toward her he can’t explain, especially not to Gran, who hates anything human. When the chips are down, Gran comes through, but will the secret he’s kept close to his heart for centuries destroy them all?* * ~ * *Please note: This book is an extensive rewrite and combination of \"Hard as a Rock\" and \"Between a Rock and a Hard Place\", formerly the first and second stories in the bestselling series, Paranormal Protection Agency",
