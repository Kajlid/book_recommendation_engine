  "description": "Cutting across class, race, religion, and gender,  A Woman's Worth  speaks powerfully and persuasively to a generation in need of healing, and in search of harmony.With A Woman's Worth , Marianne Williamson turns her charismatic voice—and the same empowering, spiritually enlightening wisdom that energized her landmark work, A Return to Love — to exploring the crucial role of women in the world today. Drawing deeply and candidly on her own experiences, the author illuminates her thought-provoking positions on such issues as beauty and age, relationships and sex, children and careers, and the reassurance and reassertion of the feminine in a patriarchal society.",
