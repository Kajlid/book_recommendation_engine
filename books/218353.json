The only way to stop the carnage is to face Hera and her army in a no-prisoners battle to determine the fate of the human race—and Alena’s future.In a sweeping voyage from the Seattle bar scene to a netherworld populated by murderous gods and monsters, Alena confronts one adversary after another on a quest to set the world right for both humans and Supes and demonstrate her power—to the gods and to herself—once and for all.",
