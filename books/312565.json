  "description": "A secret desire\nBy day, Finn builds houses on the coastline of Maine. Afterhours, Finn dreams of the hot older guy who walks his chocolate lab on Goose Rocks Beach. The man of his dreams ticks all his boxes. Salt and pepper hair. Strong jawline. Blue eyes.His dream man is perfect fantasy material. As for actually speaking to him?As if. Their paths won’t ever cross, and the guy is probably straight.\nA new chapter\nRecently divorced Joel is finally living as a gay man, but he’s not sure he’s ready to jump into a relationship. That doesn’t stop him from noticing his new contractor’s muscular build, hewn from hard, physical work, or his storm-colored eyes. Or the way he wears his tool belt slung low on his hips. The icing on the cake? There’s more to Finn than good looks. Maybe he’s the perfect guy to share long walks on the beach and warm nights in front of a fire.But it’s been twenty years since Joel was with a man. While he’s not forgotten how to flirt, he’s nervous about making a move.Especially with Finn.",
