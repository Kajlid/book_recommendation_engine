  "description": "Born into a prestigious family and groomed to be the next Beaumont to take over the family business when my cold-hearted father retires isn’t as glamorous as it seems. My entire life mapped out by the one person I loathe—my father. But instead of obeying my dad’s demand to return to Harvard and complete my college education, I enrolled at the police academy with my best friend, Deacon Winslow.Deacon has always been like a brother to me, and now, we’re brothers bound by the badge and blue uniform we wear, and the oath we took to serve and protect. I’d lay down my life for him and him for me. There was only one rule between us—stay away from her. Britney Winslow, my best friend’s younger sister, is off-limits because of a silly agreement I made with her brother when we were kids. Now that we’re older, that promise is proving to be more challenging to keep. Britney’s kind heart and beauty are hard to ignore, and the way she makes me feel whenever she’s near is blurring the line I vowed I would never cross until a horrific incident turns everyone’s lives upside down. Weight of the Badge is book one of a duet. The storyline is an angsty, forbidden friends to lovers, contemporary romance, set in K. Bromberg’s Everyday Heroes World that will shatter your heart and piece it back together again.",
