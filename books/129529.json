  "description": "The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three is the second volume in Stephen King's remarkable cycle of the Dark Tower, inspired in part by the Robert Browning narrative poem. The first volume, The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger, relates how Roland, the last gunslinger in a world that has 'moved on', pursues and eventually catches up with the sorcerer known as the man in black. It is a tale of science-fantasy that is unlike anything Stephen King has ever written.The second instalment on the long and difficult path to the Dark Tower commences less than seven hours later. The man in black is dead, and The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three picks up the thread of Roland's odyssey upon a deserted beach of the Western Sea in that strange other world that is so like—and yet so unlike—our own. Before he can find a doorway to sanctuary in our world, the gunslinger is savagely torn by weird creatures out of that menacing sea.",
