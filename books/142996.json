  "title": "Zombies from the Pulps!: Twenty Classic Stories of the Walking Dead",
  "description": "ZOMBIES! From The Walking Dead to World War Z to Plants vs. Zombies , they have become a multimedia pop culture sensation. But this isn’t the first zombie boom—in the 1920s and 30s, stories of voodoo zombie masters, mad scientists animating corpses, and evil sorcerers raising undead armies first began to appear in books, in movies, and in the pages of the pulp magazines. This volume collects twenty creepy tales from pulps like Weird Tales , Dime Mystery , and Terror Tales by writers like H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, August Derleth, Manly Wade Wellman, Henry Kuttner, and E. Hoffmann Price. From genuine horror classics like “Herbert West—Reanimator” and “Pigeons from Hell” to rare and hard-to-find tales from the notorious shudder pulps, this anthology edited with an introduction by Jeffrey Shanks is one that no zombie fan should miss!",
