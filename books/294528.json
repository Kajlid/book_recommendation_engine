  "description": "As Riley Shaw begins her final year of college, she's facing more challenges than just getting through her exams.Her homophobic parents have cut her off and thrown her out, and to make ends meet, Riley starts playing in a local poker tournament every Friday night.A bartending job would probably have been easier, but playing poker only took a few hours once a week, and with years of online experience, Riley wanted to at least give it a try.One thing she hadn't counted on was finding herself at the same table as one of her professors, Ms. Harper, the woman she'd been crushing on for the last three years.After five years of teaching accounting at the same college as her brother, Lauren Harper was finally settling in.She'd left behind a high paying, high stress job at an accountancy firm, and although teaching didn't pay nearly as well, she was starting to enjoy the simpler things in life, like sipping on a whiskey while she played cards at a local casino.When one of her students sits down at her poker table, it piques Lauren's curiosity. It wasn't unusual for students and teachers to mix in such a small town, but for some reason, she didn't expect to see Riley playing poker.Lauren had been badly burned by a student in the past, and there was no way she was going there again.No way. Under no circumstances.That's what Lauren keeps telling herself anyway, but as the two get to know one another, Lauren finds herself being drawn to the younger woman.How bad would it really be to date a student?",
