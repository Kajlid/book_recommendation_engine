  "description": "When her abusive father swears an oath on her thirteenth birthday that could destroy her family, Coreen Shell prays to a God she doubts even exists. The next day, a flood washes through their coal camp in southeastern Kentucky, sweeping away the life she's known. Now Coreen, her mother, and her crippled grandmother must climb the mountain to find refuge in a small, backwoods church. Coreen is about to learn that the sins and lies of our past can leave a legacy of pain and destruction for generations to come. \"This is a great story, real and hard, lightened with some happy moments and giving people. I loved it. Because of some thematic elements, Above the Fog is for older teens and adults, not children. There is no cursing, and sordid details are not elaborated.\" ~ Amazon review General Content (G) (I): Contains little or no; sexual dialogue or situations, violence, or strong language. May also contain content of an inspirational/religious nature.",
