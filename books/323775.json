There was Kara beside her, and Simon below with his room that looked out to the road - two roads actually so you had a choice as you were leaving or arriving, which way to take. But anyway, Esma at the beginning saw only one way...When Esma moves into 22 Starling Street, she knows she's come to the right place. A place to become someone new. A place to belong.As the seasons change, she finds herself falling deeper and deeper in love. But not in the way she expects. . .A remarkable new novel about friendship, trust and hope - and what it means to love.",
