  "description": "William Hope Hodgson (1877-1918) was a leading writer of weird fiction whose career was tragically cut short by his death in World War I. During a span of less than fifteen years, Hodgson wrote four novels and dozens of short stories, establishing himself as a pioneering writer of sea horror tales — many of them inspired by his own experiences as a sailor.This volume features two of Hodgson’s best short novels, The House on the Borderland and The Ghost Pirates, along with an array of his best short stories. These include such classic tales as \"The Derelict\" and \"The Voice in the Night,\" along with several tales revolving around the psychic detective Thomas Carnacki. The most accurate and authoritative texts are used, and the volume concludes with a bibliography of first appearances of all the items included.The volume is edited by S. T. Joshi, a leading authority on weird fiction. Joshi is the author of The Weird Tale (1990), The Modern Weird Tale (2001), and Unutterable Horror: A History of Supernatural Fiction (2012), and he has prepared editions of the work of H.P. Lovecraft, Lord Dunsany, Arthur Machen, Ambrose Bierce, and many other weird writers.",
