  "description": "In this compelling first-person account, Daniel Joseph explores systematic racism in the 21st century. From the impact of the wealth gap that exist between black and white people, to the interaction between black lives and the blue line. Reliving his experiences, including being called \"Evil Aliens with Afros\" in his youth, Joseph examines the overwhelming effects of racism throughout his, and his father's generation. Referring to the misinformation and fear of black people in the generations leading up to the early-90s, racial stereotyping has been put on trial as the most significant actor in the collective behaviour of negativity towards black people. However, offering some hope for a better future, Joseph reflects on the lessons learned over the years, how to fight for racial equality, and what we can do to engage more collaboratively.",
