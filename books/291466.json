  "description": "In this, Pearls Before Swine treasury, you'll know you're not in Kansas anymore.The Pearls Before Swine crew are at it again in their new book, Lions and Tigers and Crocs, Oh My! But even the wonderful Wizard of Oz couldn't help this bunch of merry misfits. Collecting strips from his last two books, and , cartoonist Stephan Pastis takes you on a magically malicious journey over the rainbow and into the rat trap of Lions and Tigers and Crocs, Oh My! As in the previous Pearls treasury collection, , the comic strips are annotated, as only the smart-alecky, misanthropic-but-lovable Pastis can do. Following his yellow brick road of notes, readers gain great insights into the making of such classic Pearls bits as Rat's stint as a New York Times reporter, Angry Bob, Pig's plastic surgery, the Mallet o' Understanding, Mrs. Bootyworth, and the fraternal order of the Zeeba Zeeba Eetas.A special bonus feature included in Lions and Tigers and Crocs is \"The Good, the Banned, and the Ugly,\" a section of never-before-published and unedited Pearls strips.So go, as fast as lightning, to the Emerald City-or the cash register-and buy this book, before a twister drops a Box o' Stupid People on you!",
