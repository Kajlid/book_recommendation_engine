  "description": "The breathtaking saga of the second generation begins! It is difficult growing up in the shadow of heroes revered throughout the galaxy. But that is the lot of young Khorii -- daughter of the legendary Acorna and her lifemate Aari -- who must now follow her own destiny through a fantastic universe of wonders and perils. On a journey, Khorii's trip is delayed when her ship encounters a derelict spacecraft floating aimlessly among the stars, its crew dead in their seats. Suddenly a planned visit by her parents has turned into a terrifying race against time as a deadly plague spreads relentlessly across the universe. Even the healing powers of the Linyaari cannot slow its horrific advance. And now Khorii, one of the few unaffected by the outbreak, must find an antidote -- before the scourge consumes everyone and everything in its path . . . including those she loves above all others.",
