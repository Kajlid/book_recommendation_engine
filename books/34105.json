He’s way out of her league in more ways than just looks. Angus MacInnes knows his time as Enforcer of his vampire clan is slowly driving him mad. When his brother sent him on a date, he assumed it would be a bust from the beginning. He didn't expect to find the one woman he's been hoping would appear for the last few centuries.
