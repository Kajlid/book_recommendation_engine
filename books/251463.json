  "title": "My Conversations with the Christ: The Annihilation of Damon Black",
  "description": "This is the last installment of the Damon Black Trilogy. In this volume Peter Grant is given the task of recording end time prophecy as it unfolds. To the utter frustration to Blaze, unfortunately, the only thing Peter knows about End Time Prophecy is that the number “666” is not good.  To Peter’s amazement, Damon Black comes to an end-ish. Jesus answers Peter’s question as to why He will release Satan again?  In this final volume, we learn that the “End” is not as close as we have been led to believe because the journey is more important than the destination.",
