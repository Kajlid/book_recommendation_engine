  "description": "A group of school friends from the heady days of 1968 France take center stage in this racy account of horse racing, public corruption, and criminal intent. Agathe Renourd and her protege Nicolas Berger are in charge of the communications network of a major European insurance consortium. Christian Deluc has become a council member at the Elysee Palace, and Amelie raises thoroughbreds. Now, in 1989, their paths cross in an unexpected fashion as events begin to spiral out of control. Racehorses die under mysterious circumstances, unimaginable quantities of cocaine appear at Parisian parties, and the dashing Nicolas Berger meets a violent end when a bomb explodes in his car. The search for resolution produces a dark ride filled with political intrigue and mystery.",
