  "description": "Critically acclaimed d√©but novel of bestselling author, Iain Rob Wright.What would you do if it started snowing in every country in the world? Would you panic? For a ragtag group of strangers gathered at a dilapidated English pub, the best solution is a pint of beer with a hearty shot of denial. The truth is too strange to admit; but, one by one, they will be forced to accept reality - that something sinister is lurking outside in the snow. Something no one could imagine.Amongst those at the pub is Harry Jobson, the local drunk. Nobody would ever look to him during a time of crisis, but as things deteriorate he is forced to get a grip on his past and be the man he was always meant to be. It will be up to Harry to find answers to questions like: who just threw a body through the window with the word SINNER carved into its chest?Not everyone is going to make it through the night - and those who do will wish they hadn't. Special edition bonus content - seven additional short stories set during the events of The Final Winter, plus one additional stand-alone tale: The Peeling of Samuel Lloyd Collins.",
