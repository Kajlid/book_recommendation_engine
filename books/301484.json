  "description": "Only a fool with a death wish would steal from the Townsends.And my older brother? He’s a fool. But instead of making me an orphan with the snap of his filthy rich fingers, Royce Townsend gave my brother a choice: three months. Three months to pay back what was owed and all would be forgiven.You know that saying, “if it sounds too good to be true...”Yeah, this is one of those situations.Because the Townsends never do anything out of the goodness of their hearts.Enter Phoenix Townsend. Beautiful golden boy. Filthy rich womanizer.S-O-C-I-O-P-A-T-H.He's already the king of our new school, but I heard his name well before Ravenwood and Thornhaven merged. Still, I never trusted the rumors.That was my mistake. Phoenix really is a terrible, royal beast who wrecks lives and ruins girls. And now, thanks to my brother, I belong to that beast for the next three months.Crown of Thorns is a full-length, 90,000-word new adult/mature high school academy romance with enemies-to-lovers and bullying themes. It is not recommended for readers under 17, as it contains dubious situations and triggers that some listeners may find offensive. It is not a stand-alone and ends on a cliff-hanger. While Thornwood Prep is a new series, it is recommended to read the Angelview Academy series first, as Crown of Thorns contains major spoilers and characters from Saint, Malice, and Eden.",
