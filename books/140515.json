  "description": "Love is waiting on the wrong side of the tracks.Bryce Ellington has been keeping a really big bomb of a secret. And the platinum-blonde detonator is wearing five-inch heels, standing next to a broken-down Maserati.His fellow Hot Rods have never pried into the past that forced him from the only life he'd ever known, from the girl he loved. But as recognition dawns in Kaelyn DuChamp's eyes-just before those eyes roll back in a dead faint-he realizes he's going to have a lot of explaining to do. And a ton of damage to control.When Kaelyn's great escape from her controlling family fizzles-complete with a face-plant in the dirt-she's relieved to see the flash of tow truck lights. Then shocked to recognize the man behind the wheel. The best friend she's been missing for too many years.Once Kaelyn collapses in Bryce's arms, he never wants to let her go. But if she spills his secret, the resulting scandal could destroy everything he and the Hot Rods have worked for, built, and loved.Warning: Contains abuse of designer heels, bubble baths gone wild, an inexperienced heroine who can kick some serious ass, smokin' hot sex as many ways as you can imagine it...and some you haven't.",
