  "description": "‘So…we’re still together?’ ‘Forever.’ He smiled at that and stroked her cheek affectionately. ‘Forever…’ he said, with a sigh, ‘to the moon and stars…’ Nick Alexiou was born into an abusive family. Regularly beaten by his father and neglected by his hapless alcoholic mother; he is taken into care, and grows into a bitter, angry and aggressive teenager. Bearing the scars of the unthinkable horrors he has suffered and sinking further and further into depression, he decides to take his own life. On Christmas Eve, his sixteenth birthday, he takes himself up to the roof of a block of flats, his intention to jump. Instead he meets Jude Kinsella, a girl he has harboured a secret crush on for years, purely by chance and he finds in her a reason to live. Brought together by tragedy and fate, they begin a complicated and passionate relationship. The road ahead is far from smooth as Nick’s inability to deal with his demons creates problems for the lovers at every turn. Torn apart by his insecurities they live their adult lives separately, going in dramatically different directions but can they ever find happiness apart? And will they ever find their way back together?",
