This morning I was a princess of hell.Now I'm it's most wanted.After a coup in hell, Lucifer's niece, Jynx Morningstar, is on the run with the king of hell in her back pocket (in handy stone doll form) and a hellcat with delusions of grandeur. To save her uncle and by extension, hell and the world above, Jynx must evade the legions of hell, master her human magic and track down her a healer witch.Simple. Yeah, right....What she doesn't expect is to walk into the middle of a shapeshifter/vampire turf war, a sexy as sin alpha werewolf who claims she's his one true mate, or to actually care what happens to the residents of small town, Boring.But when Death comes a'knocking she must make a choice. Go big and reveal what she is, or go home and leave them to their fates... A demon would leave them in a heartbeat, but can Jynx rise above her demon blood and prove what a true princess of hell is made of?Please contains high amounts of snark, an adorable werewolf looking for true love, a demon princess trying to avoid 'feelings' and a viking-wearing hellcat.",
