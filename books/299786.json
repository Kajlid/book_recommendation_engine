  "description": "He wants to marry the perfect woman … ha! A bad relationship left Madison Holland older, wiser, and with goals of her own. She’s determined to get the job she wants and eventually grow a profitable interior design business. And why not? She’s finally in charge of her own destiny. She’ll make it happen by depending on herself this time around. When she’d drawn to England, a priest gifts her a pair of earrings and announces her soulmate will marry another if she doesn’t hurry and claim him! Well, she has finals on the horizon, so … She’s thrust into the past and given The Twelve Days of Christmas to get to know him so she can make an informed decision. She doesn’t need time! She relinquishes her rights! She isn’t interested, anyway, is she? Lord Thomas de Woodville has a castle to run and he’s going to marry so he can check it off his to-do list. He likes his world neat, ordered, and run on a time schedule. Honor is everything and his future wife, already in his sights, must be above reproach. When a priest drops Madison off for Christmas, Thomas is taken by surprise. She’s different. Beautiful, intelligent, and witty, she will best him at every opportunity if he doesn’t stay sharp. It’s just as well that she wants nothing to do with him. He’s already made his decision, and is honor-bound to keep it. Everything changes with a kiss. Can he admit what he’s really looking for is someone perfect for him?And if he does, will it change anything? When Modern meets Medieval, can there be a happily ever after?",
