  "description": "After being cheated on, Kacey decides to take a break from relationships and have a few harmless one night stands in order to rebuild her crumpled confidence. Things go really well until she falls asleep one night, then has the most realistic sexual dream about her ex, yet can't work out in the morning if it actually happened or not. One dirty dream leads to two, two leads to three, then before she knows it, she's caught in a frustrating whirlwind, where her raunchy nights control her daily life.  An erotic story of a woman's desire to find herself after a break up, then her mission to stop her dreams becoming her next nightmare reality.",
