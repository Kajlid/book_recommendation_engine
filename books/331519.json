  "description": "High school. Love. Drama. Blondes. Brunettes. Friendship. Coffee. Grease. As a normal, high school freshman, Carrie Dawson has been thrown into a whole new world, following the tragic death of her father. Her cousin, best friend, second-mate, partner-in-crime, Jess, is behind Carrie in all aspects of life. They share a friendship that is unique and unlike any other. Carrie finds herself lost emotionally on how to feel when it comes to a confusing moment in every person’s young First love. She’s torn between dating the guy that is “perfect” for her by everyone else’s standards and that unforgettable, tingly feeling that she gets from her other indecisive, best friend Ben. Her Grease, coffee, and sarcasm addiction certainly do not help herself achieve her goal of finding the perfect, movie-like relationship.",
