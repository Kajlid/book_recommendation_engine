  "description": "Harold Halpert is the pastor of Hope Christian Fellowship, a church and school that he helped build from the ground up. He is also a strong opponent of gay rights. Drake Halpert is a teenager who feels trapped in this community of people blindly following his father. He is also gay and deeply hurt by his father's outspoken beliefs. But Pastor Halpert isn't aware of his son's sexuality, and Drake has no idea that his father's ideas aren't shared by everyone. How can these two know so little about each other? And what would happen if father and son were to change places - literally?",
