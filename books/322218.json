  "description": "From the author of To Break a Covenant comes an edge-of-your-seat read that will leave your heart pounding.One week ago, Riley Kowalski joined a team of four other teens for an internship on climate change research in the Antarctic, sponsored by one of the world's largest tech companies. It was just the opportunity she had been searching for—an escape from the ridicule she'd received after a panic attack at school, a fresh start.But their small team isn't alone in the remote, frozen reaches of the polar south.In the eerie haze of evening sunlight, Riley sees something out of the corner of her eye—something that's watching them. She writes it off as the effects of her anxiety, but when their expedition leader begins to change—her limbs elongating, her body contorting—and grow violent, Riley knows the danger she feels is real. Something is stalking them, infecting them, and slowly infiltrating the team.There is more to this research trip than any of them bargained for, and if they aren't careful, none of them will make it out alive.",
