  "description": "Everyone in life will face trials or circumstances that may hinder their faith. These times are part of everyone's spiritual journey. In the Bible Jesus tells us that in the world we will have trials and tribulations (John 16:33) but He also instructs us to be of good cheer because our struggles will not overcome us. Despite Jesus' words, some people in the Church struggle with their faith in times of crisis. They mumble, they mummer, and give up on God after basing their faith on what is happening to them and around them. The key to overcoming the challenges of life is to keep our eyes on Jesus and His unconditional love for us. When we begin to understand Jesus love for us we began to inwardly develop the strength we need to make it through any challenge. When we make Jesus the object of our faith, the center of our attention, our faith spontaneously grows. That is because as we focus on Jesus we can see His track record, where He has so ever remained faithful in seeing us through. Relying on Jesus is the key to sustaining our faith and maintaining our Christian walk. Be inspired as you read this masterpiece.",
