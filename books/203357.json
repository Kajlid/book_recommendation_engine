  "description": "In the summer of 1924, the Honourable Daisy Dalrymple Fletcher is off on a summer holiday by the sea with her step-daughter Belinda and Belinda's chum Deva, and her husband, Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher of Scotland Yard. Daisy is anticipating a relaxing, non-dramatic holiday. But Daisy doesn't have that kind of luck. It seems that a local low-rent Don Juan has been busily seducing the local womanfolk and, in a town this small, no secret is kept for long. A fact that is amply illustrated when the Fletcher's simple picnic is interrupted by the discovery of a broken body at the foot of the cliff--that of the philandering local innkeeper of bad memory. Like Jacqueline Winspear's much praised novels about Maisy Dobbs, Carola Dunn vividly evokes the life and times of 1920's England wrapped in a classic mystery to delight her many fans.",
