  "description": "Eight-year-old Mandy Berr is spirited, sassy, and determined to shine—even if she’s not the center of attention!After learning the hard way that polka dot underwear and white pants are not the best combination, Mandy Berr has gotten over that fashion faux pas, and has (almost) recovered from not being named George Washington in the recent Presidential Pageant. But just when things seem like they might be back in her favor, her former nemesis, Natalie, manages to steal Mandy’s spotlight—again. A broken wrist for Natalie means a cool cast and the attention of Mandy’s classmates…even from Anya, Mandy’s BFF. Can Mandy figure out a way to get back into the center of attention, win back her best friend, AND snag a pair of fancy-dancy periwinkle sunglasses?",
