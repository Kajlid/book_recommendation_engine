  "title": "A Kiss Before You Go: An Illustrated Memoir of Love and Loss",
  "description": "After the loss of his wife in a tragic accident, beloved artist Danny Gregory chronicled his grief in the medium he knows bestâ€”the pages of his illustrated journals. This intimate volume reproduces these journal pages in a stirring visual memoir of Gregory's journey towards recovery. Uniquely sincere, and by turns tender, raw, and hopeful, Gregory's idiosyncratic text and illustrations capture the darkest and lightest moments of his \"year of magical drawing.\" Gregory's process reminds us that creative expression offers its own therapy, and that living each day to its fullest may be as simple as putting pen to paper. Anyone who has experienced loss will take solace in this refreshingly candid look at grieving, while art lovers will marvel at the artist's beautiful celebration of the power of creation.",
