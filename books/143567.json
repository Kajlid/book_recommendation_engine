  "description": "Lt. Commander Hrothgar Tebrey finds himself assigned to an archaeological expedition as a military attaché because of his knowledge of alien technology. It should have been an easy assignment, light duty to recover from the disaster of his previous mission, but things quickly begin to go wrong. Someone, or something, is manipulating events to sabotage the expedition. When the science team becomes marooned on the planet by the tides of war, the sinister force reveals itself, and Tebrey must fight against a seemingly unstoppable enemy to save not just himself, the expedition, and the woman he loves, but his very soul. Some things are worth dying for, but it’s the things worth living for that matter.",
