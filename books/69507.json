Even though she’s terrified of getting burned by the backdraft, Aria can’t seem to ignore the tempered blaze buried in her heart.After a disturbing vision, Aria withholds a deadly secret in order to protect her Kingdom. Her people, her friends, not even Clay knows the truth as she makes peace with her destiny.
