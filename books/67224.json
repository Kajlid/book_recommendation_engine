  "description": "Hal Kailas was truly flying as the dragon dove for speed, then climbed high, banking, rolling. . . . Above were the moons and the stars, and below the world he had little use for. . . . Hal is a runaway pauper in a kingdom where peace is uncertain. But long ago, he had the breathtaking experience of bonding with a young dragon, and the memory of the beast’s great strength and power consumes his thoughts and dreams. When war comes, only the most daring and ruthless men will ride these fearsome dragons—monstrous weapons that rule the sky. Few men can bend a dragon’s will, but Hal believes he may be one of them. Squadrons of men will fly into battle on the fiercest creatures the world has ever seen, and Hal Kailas will be the greatest dragonmaster of them all. “A vast and intricate tapestry woven by a writer who knows both history and war.”—David Drake, Author of the Lord of the Isles Series “Slam-bang excitement, lusty action, and military magic . . . fast-paced and ferocious.”—Julian May, Author of The Many-Colored Land",
