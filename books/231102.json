  "description": "At the front of the ruined castle, I hesitate. Can I dare do this? How can I not? I will do all I can to protect her, she, Isabelle Mercier, the woman I have loved since before I could walk. A slight exaggeration, to be sure, but nevertheless, my love for her is pure and undying. If my own life should be forfeit to keep her happy, then I should be grateful for the chance to bring a smile upon her face.  A horrific beast. A desperate man. A woman willing to do anything for her family.  This tale of a beauty and a beast is one that will make you wonder if perhaps the curse is well deserved.  Once Upon a Darkened Night reading order:  Of Cinder and Madness The Cost of Love The Cost of Grief The Cost of Power Of Slumber and Discord The Cost of Magic Of Rose and Cruelty The Cost of Rage - coming soon!",
