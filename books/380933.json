  "description": "About this How do I find peace of mind in my stressed-out life? It can be hard to hold on to trust in God when we're stretched and stressed by responsibilities, deadlines, and expectations. Caussade gently yet persistently tells us not to fret over the past, nor worry about the future. We are given only the sacrament of the present moment in which God reveals himself to us. God is secretly at work for our good in the midst of every duty and every event. Each volume of the Classic Wisdom Collection provides time-tested spiritual guidance for living a Christian life.",
