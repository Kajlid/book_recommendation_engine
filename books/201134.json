  "description": "Hatchling’s Mate continues the tale of the dragshi, a human who can exchange bodies with a dragon. Talann’s future was far from assured. Although the son of two dragon lords, none of the old ones sang a welcome at his birth. And now years later there was still no sign of the awakening of a twinned dragon soul. From his birth, it was expected he would marry the only other child born to the dragon shifters, the Lady Lexii Beylnea. However, fate had other intentions. Talann and Lexii could not stand to be together.  Haldric hated all shifters but one—the Lady Lexii Beylnea, whom he meant to possess at any cost. His one tool to achieve both his goals meant risking all. Although his uncle, known to his followers as the Parant, possessed the ability to turn men and women into his willing slaves, the older man was as apt to turn on friend as foe.  Pledged to protect Lexii until the dragon lord’s intended mate appears, Glyn must fight to keep hidden the secret no one could never learn.  The freedom of the skies comes with a price.",
