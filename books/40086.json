  "description": "Book 3 in the Arda series \"It's my turn,\" has been Krysta Tul'Mar's deep-hearted cry to find love and her soul's mate, even as she aids in the defense of her homeworld. As Captain of the Ardani Home Guard, she's always been able to take care of herself. But now, she's in serious trouble. She's been kidnapped by a fire-eyed outlaw, a man rumored to be ruthless in his rule-and his tastes. His passion and fire draw her to him, even though she knows he is her enemy. Darkyn Weil, chief of Arda's rebellious Outlanders, knows only duty, responsibility, and destiny. He's bound to battle an ancient evil, to fight a fight likely to cost him his life. He can't fall in love, and he certainly can't mate. No woman could be asked to bear what lies ahead for him. But once he sees Krysta, once he touches her-he can't turn away from such passion.",
