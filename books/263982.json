  "description": "When a sassy and disillusioned phone operator gets a hold of the power of Cupid, watch out!A mysterious caller…Locke Casey is nothing special. Sure, her job as a phone operator job is a little unusual, but it pays the bills, and as a broke, twenty something college student, she doesn’t have much room to be picky. She is used to odd calls from strange men thanks to her job, but when one begins quizzing her about love, she finds her life turned upside down.An unbelievable turn of events…Turns out the creepy caller might actually be Cupid. For some unknown reason, the god of love passed on his powers to Locke, which makes no sense considering she’s never been in love and considers the whole concept overrated. Talk about an unlikely candidate!A mission to save the gods…Having Cupid’s powers alone might be more than she can handle, but with her godly benefactor doing a disappearing act, all the gods are in a flurry, and it’s up to Locke to save Olympus. All in a day’s work, right? Battlefield Love is the first in a series, a slow burn reverse harem romance with sexy, godly avatars and steamy scenes.",
