  "title": "Meaning, Self and the Human Potential: An Appeal for Humanism",
  "description": "Does your life lack meaning and purpose? Have you ever wondered how we create meaning in our lives? Do you turn to religion or spirituality to fill this need? The question of the meaning of life is a philosophical one, for which there is no single answer. But there are ways in which we can achieve a meaningful life if we understand the ways by which we lose meaning. This book demonstrates that losing meaning in life is an opportunity, not a crisis. By exploring the psychological and cultural factors which contribute to the formation of values and meaning, we come to understand why their loss causes us such anxiety. This acts as a window through which we might discover our true human potential. The author explores our ability to achieve self actualisation and the capacity to lead a moral and meaningful existence without the reliance on transcendental sources. She suggests that this may be the greatest platform through which we may achieve our human potential. Central to her message is to overcome the fear of death and believe in the human capacity for good.",
