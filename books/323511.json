Through me, the Goddess heals, yet I am treated like the lowest servant.In the wake of an attack, a young beta hunter is mortally wounded. I lay with Eric to heal him upon the forest floor. Everyone saw. Now an alpha, a beta, and a shifter pack all have me in their sights.And all the while, Petra, my lord’s spiteful daughter, despises me for taking a man she saw as her own.Trapped in a life of drudgery and cruelty, my only hope is to take a mate to escape Petra’s tyrannical rule before her jealousy takes a deadly turn. But why would her lord father let such a valuable asset leave?I may be at the mercy of their whims now, but I have allies waiting in the dark, waiting to make their move and claim me as theirs.The only question is who?And will they be too late?Bound to the Pack is a spicy reverse harem, including MM, with classic omegaverse meets shifters in a fantasy setting.",
