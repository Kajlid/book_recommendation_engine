  "description": "In the second book of The Deadly Flower Series, Poppy:Awake, Poppy has a feeling that there is something important she needs to do, but she just cannot remember what it is. After being nearly killed at the hands of Holly, Poppy slowly regains consciousness as a prisoner of the Seelie Court. At least thatâ€™s what Poppy believes at first. She cannot help but to wonder why she is being treated so well. She has a luxurious bedroom instead of a cell in the dungeon and a hand maid by the name of Willow who is assigned only to her. To anyone else this would seem to be a perfect arrangement, but it becomes quite clear that the Queen and the entire Seelie Court has a secret. Unfortunately this is not the only problem. Poppy wakes up every morning from horrible dreams that she just cannot seem to remember. But they leave her with a sense of urgency to see her friends Reed and Rho, who she now believes are in trouble over at the Unseelie Court. Will the Queen let Poppy in on the secrets of her Court? Will she ever be allowed to return home? And will she reunite with Reed and Rho and finally discover what is happening with them?",
