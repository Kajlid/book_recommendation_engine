  "description": "Woodsman Felix Immler reveals how to build a comfortable camp in the wilderness using nothing more than a pocket knife. Simple natural materials are used for making a waterproof roof, a chair, a bed, a table, a fridge, and an oven, as well as for carving spoons, knifes, and bowls. You can even grill a chicken on a self-made, water-driven skewer. The Swiss Army Knife BookÂ is full of ideas for exciting activities, suitable for families and teens as well as adult explorers.",
