Dev Cameron joined the military to fly a starship, but is rated unsuitable and grudgingly accepts an assignment with the ground forces piloting a massive walking tank- a warstrider. But Cameron may yet get a chance at glory when he makes a discovery about their alien foes that could change the course of the war. The first book in Ian Douglas's classic Warstrider military sci-fi series, originally published in 1993 under the name William Keith. The six-book Warstrider series is being re-issued by War Planet Press.",
