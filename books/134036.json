David Gilman, award-winning author of the Master of War series, The Last Horseman and The Englishman.'I have been waiting for this second novel in Charles Cordell's series, and am not disappointed. He evokes the experience of the Civil War soldier, in every branch of arms, more vividly than ever before.' Professor Ronald Hutton CBE FRHistS FSA FLSW FBA'From page 1 Cordell plunges you into the fast-flowing battlefields of 1643, full of fear, tension and the relief of surviving. He brilliantly captures the plight of soldiers in realistic detail in and around battle.' General Richard Nugee CB CVO CBE'A remarkable and unique talent. Charles Cordell holds his reader transfixed in a book that simply cannot be put down.' Jeremy Fowler, Adjutant General of the Sealed Knot SocietyThe second novel of the visceral Divided Kingdom series sees the action turn westwards to Bristol, where a Royalist army is determined to wrest the city from the forces of Parliament.

Also caught up in the conflict are Moussa Dansocko, an African slave accused of sorcery, Kendall Tremain, Cornish fisherman and tinner, Abel Cowans, a former naval gunner from Newcastle and others, all with their own diverse reasons for siding with one cause or the other in Englandâ€™s bloody civil war.",
