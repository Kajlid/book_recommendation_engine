  "description": "Collection. Lyric and satiric poetry.Psicocromo is a collection of texts bound together by the theme of representation of thought and feeling. The experiencing perceptions contrasts with the subjective and the objective in an investigation of the emotional reality and the word that evokes and plays it. The personal dimension reflects the glow of emotions of all loves becoming universal in the transposition of typical images yet unique and fascinating; and the writing in verse allows the immediacy of enjoyment and at the same time the possibility of a reading joined in reflection.Psicocromo opens unexpected and unusual scenarios with respect to the Italian literary tradition: self-irony and nostalgia mingle in the intellectual automythography of the author- character.PsicocromoRecensito ne La Nuova Venezia, 24 settembre 2003. Non ha partecipato a concorsi e premi letterari.Edito per i tipi di Tracce, Pescara, 2003. Esaurito. Versione gratuita in pdf in lingua italiana ed inglese scaricabile da Academia.edu.",
