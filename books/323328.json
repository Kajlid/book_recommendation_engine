  "description": "This is the second edition of a series of books that will follow \"PLWHCCPUSHPRESS\". This book was created to educate, engage, empower our young leaders, researchers, and innovators to become candidates and promote cultural awareness and bridge the gap to encourage discussions no matter what the child's ethnic background is, they are our future. This book was created to educate families on the awareness of how children from other cultural backgrounds face challenges surrounding cultural diversity so we must always ask their children how they are doing today? As an educator/advocate it is my strong duty to encourage our children, to treat our friends or peers like a beautiful flowers that we see, and always express and communicate your strong feelings to your parents or whom you find comfort in. The book is to also engage our readers that if you are having challenges with someone in your class or community, kindly walk away and seek help. Affirmation: You are special, You are beautiful, You are loved, You are talented, You are strong, and You are valuable. Translations are in Spanish, French, Chinese, Arabic, and Latin in this book.",
