  "title": "The Growth of the Spanish Inquisition",
  "description": "The second volume of Jean Plaidy's compelling trilogy on the Spanish Inquisition charts the life of a man more powerful and more merciless even than Tomas de Torquemada, father of the Inquisition; Ximenes.Ximenes was an ascetic, a stern man of God who had scourged his own flesh and had no sympathy for the suffering of others. When Isabella made him Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain in 1945, the way was clear for him to call his bigotry virtue and persecute the Jews, perpetrating hideous acts of inhumanity in the name of God.But when Isabella died, and her mad daughter Juana became Queen of Castile, it was Ximenes who steered Spain through a time of crisis and uncertainty.",
