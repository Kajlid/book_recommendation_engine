  "description": "I love living life on the edge. The Diamondback MC is my world.I never thought about settling down—until Raven.  Raven was a dancer at one of the clubs the Diamondback’s own. As their VP when things started going sideways with our manager, I came in and Raven stepped up to the plate, helping us out. I took one look at her and I knew she was special. She may have deserved better than me, but I wasn’t about to let anyone else have her. When her past catches up with her, you better believe I’m going to shield and protect her with everything I am. Because when a Diamondback claims his old lady— it’s forever. Who doesn’t love a rowdy biker who finds a woman who will bring him to his knees? Tory is back with a brand new series of rough and rowdy bikers who are about to meet the one woman they can’t tame. So get ready for a wild ride! As always you’re going to get insta-love, with an over-the-top alpha and scenes to make your kindle melt.",
