  "description": "At night, the trees whispered.Told ghost stories, their leaves trembling.Remembered the fallen.Joked.Dry laughter rustled the dark.A Small Fiction is what happens when a writer wants to tell a hundred stories but doesn't have the time to write a hundred books. Instead, he writes the seeds of them and casts them to the wind.What started as an exercise in creativity on social media has grown to become a wonderful compendium of thoughts on humanity, storytelling and finding the absurd in the everyday. Every story in the collection is distinct, and while some play on common themes each story stands on its own. Through the genre lenses of science fiction, fantasy, contemporary fiction, folklore, and humour each of these small fictions is a peephole that reveals a bigger story.",
