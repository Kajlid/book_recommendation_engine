The slightly shorter man is reaching up to kiss other, and his left hand, just hovering over the taller manâ€™s collar, is tentative. There is an uncertainty there, but an obvious desire. You can almost tell he is wondering whether he is doing the right thing.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love Has No Boundaries\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.",
