  "description": "For more than a thousand years, Kasim al-Jinni has suffered a string of masters who used his jinni powers for their own selfish desires. Kasim has resigned himself to his deserved fate, for he failed young Prince Hajji and allowed evil to enslave the land of Zharinda. But when his new master Lindsey McCullough releases him from his magic jar, he discovers she has a kind heart. He longs to give her the one gift her miraculous, modern world cannot do— restore the use of her legs.After ten years in a wheelchair, the thought of being healed makes Lindsey nervous. Her overly critical parents have finally accepted that Lindsey will never achieve greatness like the rest of her family. She long ago abandoned dreams of love and family, taking solace in her own small, safe world. When Kasim tricks Lindsey into wishing her injury healed, she meddles in his life¾ wishing him free of the curse that enslaves him. To her shock, her wish sweeps them both back to ancient Zharinda. Worse, Kasim has lost his jinni powers and can't return Lindsey to her own time unless he overthrows the malevolent power which holds the land in thrall. Thrown into the heart of an Arabian adventure, Lindsey and Kasim are soon embroiled in magic, court intrigue, and a prophecy that promises Kasim to a lovely Sultana—despite the yearning he feels for Lindsey. He cannot change his fate, which has been written in the stars for more than a thousand years. He cannot abandon his homeland to the hand of evil. Yet Lindsey deserves a true Arabian Knight...",
