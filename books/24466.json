  "title": "Suffer the Child",
  "description": "On the bestseller list for Walden Books and required reading for psychology classes, Suffer the Child was first to link Satanic child abuse with multiple personalities/dissociative disorders. The story chronicles with unblinking objectivity the harrowing experiences of Jenny, reared in a satanic cult, in a life so untenable as to fracture the self. In the healing process, these experiences, made of nightmare stuff, are assimilated, with the help of therapists with little to guide their committed and necessarily innovative treatment. The horrifying revelations of Jennys healing journey will shock, inspire, and give caution to us all.",
