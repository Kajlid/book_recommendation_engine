  "description": "After uncovering and writing in a three-thousand-year-old book, eighteen-year-old Ava Baker escapes through a portal that she believes is nothing more than a vivid dream. Her urge to write isn’t solely based on her journey, but also by an alluring man named, Collin, whom she meets between the pages. Their mutual unabiding affection has them bound to each other in ways much deeper than either one can explain. When Collin divulges secrets to Ava, and reveals that the book is being hunted by rival secret societies, it sends their relationship and Ava’s life into a tailspin. The very thing that brought them together is also what threatens to tear them apart. Are Collin and the revelations only figments of her imagination? Or, is it all, a reality and her divine destiny?",
