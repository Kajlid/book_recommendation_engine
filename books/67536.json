Can you imagine feeling as if you don't belong in your own body? Life is hard when you don't know who you truly are, or what you are capable of.Who can she trust, and who will end up betraying her?Everything was changing, even herself and she could feel the influence of the Moon Goddess pushing her to the edge of her emotions, and if she didn't maintain some sort of balance; some sort of self control, she was afraid of tipping over the edge and losing herself. And she was scared that she would like it.\"Do not swear by the Moon, for she changes constantly. Then your love would also change.\" ~ William ShakespeareNOW AVAILABLE ON AMAZON!!!",
