  "description": "In this classically written tale, a young girl is all but abandoned by her mother and left to navigate the world with little guidance. She repeatably reaches out for solace and love, but rarely finds any.Instead, she is often met with harsh words and rejection. Fleeting moments of happiness, give way to long periods of quiet bewilderment as she struggles to find answers even to life's most basic questions. Even after the loss of her childhood innocence to her best friend's brother, she has no one to turn to and heeds his warning to tell not a soul.As tragedy and bitterness surround her, a fascination with life and death's elegant yet delicate dance is always on the back of her poetic and analytical mind. She recalls the ebb and flow of excitement, fear, loneliness, and despair throughout existence yet never ceasing living until the music finally ends.",
