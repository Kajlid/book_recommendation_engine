  "description": "Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea cycle has become one of the best-loved fantasies of our time.  The windswept world of Earthsea is one of the greatest creations in all fantasy literature, frequently compared with J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth or C.S. Lewis' Narnia.  The magnificent saga begins with A Wizard Of Earthsea ,  continues in The Tombs Of Atuan and The Farthest Shore , and concludes with Tehanu --each book a treasure of wisdom, wonder, and literary wizardry.  The magic had gone out of the world.  All over Earthsea the mages had forgotten their spells, the springs of wizardry were running dry.  Ged, Dragonlord and Archmage, set out with Arren, a highborn young prince, to seek the source of the darkness.  This is the tale of their harrowing journey beyond the shores of death to heal a wounded land.",
