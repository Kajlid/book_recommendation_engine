  "description": "“I don’t want to live like this either, only ever being despised.”Life in hard mode for “villain” Penelope Eckhart means with every step forward, she’s shoved five steps back. Just when things seem to be stabilizing between her and the brothers, she finds herself coming to blows with Reynold, who insists on dredging up the past―an affront Penelope refuses to take lying down. To make matters worse, she’s forced to attend the hunting tournament hosted by the crown prince…and Callisto + weapons = a recipe for DANGER!",
