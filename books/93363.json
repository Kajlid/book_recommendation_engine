  "description": "The first book in Maytee Aspuro y Gonzalez's trilogy, Hesed tackles one our most controversial modern-day issues. Hesed is the story of two very different women, Reverend Elizabeth (Beth) Kelly, an Episcopalian priest and Nicole Thera, a respected business woman and the owner of a popular local nightclub catering to the gay/lesbian community. Despite tempestuous beginnings and at times against their better judgment, the women establish an unorthodox friendship that will eventually challenge the young priest to rethink all she's ever believed about her religion and about herself.",
