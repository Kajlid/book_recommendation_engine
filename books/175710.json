  "description": "Most people cringe when they hear that my name’s Pisces, but I happen to like the name. As a love warrior, my mission in life is to find the man I’m supposed to unite with. Yeah, love might sound boring, but choosing evil is a death-wish.  When Nick, my evil enemy, kidnaps me, only my soulmate can save me. However, I don’t know who he is. I can’t exactly use my power of breathing underwater to find him. If we don’t unite while I’m alive, Nick will end love on earth for good. Will my soulmate find me in time?",
