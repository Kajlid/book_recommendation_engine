  "description": "This. Book. Is. About. OBSESSIONIt is NOT a traditional romance. It deviates from the norm. It defies...EVERYTHING.  This. Book. Is. About. OBSESSION__________________________________________________A TRUE-ly fabricated story about Love & Obsession...I’m an idiot. I’m too stupid to be human. Too stupid to live.I lack common sense. I used to be a normal human being. Until the guy in the red hoodie. Just a glance, and I was owned. Enslaved. What’s worst? He didn’t even notice me. Yep. You guessed right: I’m delusional. I’m obsessed. I’m a stalker. A martyr. A masochist.I’ve allowed my obsession to lead me down into a deep, dark pit, selfishly hurting everyone around me, and only his requited love can pull me out of it.But I won’t apologize for it. I won’t apologize for being in love with Jahleel Kingston. I’ve loved him at first sight. I’ve loved him for five empty years. I’ve loved him through all his bullcrap and asshole-isms. I love him even now. My name is Saskia Day. I’m British. I’m famous. I’m stinking rich. And this is my pathetic story. Read at your own bloody risk.",
