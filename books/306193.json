  "description": "The legacy of the evil witch has left Meg with a heck of a lot of power and influence in the southwest United States. Much to her dismay, this means that just about everyone thinks she's a shoo-in to be the next grand dame.What they don't get is that the last thing Meg wants is to be grand dame. She grew up watching her mother rule the paranormal community in the northeast US and it was enough to show her that she didn't want that kind of responsibility.Terrance B. Sharpe proclaims himself to be the man for the job, however. He's even leashed the matriarch of L.A.'s very powerful lion's pride as a display of his prowess. It's through him that Meg meets an actor she's panted after for years. One of the lions, Logan Lockhart, not only makes her girl parts happy, he also fills her in on a thing or two about Sharpe that she'd rather not know.But what the heck is she doing paying attention to Logan when she's already got two luscious shifters to call her own? Michael and Rudy are doing all they can to help her out, but Michael, as usual, has his own goals that don't always mesh with Meg's.What's a girl to do when she's been handed a lion's share of power on a silver platter?Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Anal play/intercourse, m√©nage (m/f/m), male/male sexual interaction.",
