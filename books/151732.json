The one that flaunts your firmed-up cleavage and newly discovered collarbones.)Don't make a spectacle of yourself. (Translation: Don't get drunk and make out with a really cute stranger for the whole company to see; he could turn out to be your boss's roommate.)I didn't follow those tips, and here I am with a hot new man in my life, Jack.But my friends are asking if I really want to bump into my boss in his boxers in the hallway of their apartment. After all, I am aiming for a promotion. And now, not only does my ex want me back, but the guy I used to think was Mr. Right just kissed me!Three months ago I couldn't hold on to one guy. Now three want me. When did my life become so complicated?",
