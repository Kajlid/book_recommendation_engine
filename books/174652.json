  "description": "D-Day 1944, Voices from Normandy is an oral history of D-Day where the stories of that long and violent day on the Calvados Coast of Normandy are told in the words of the men who were Americans, British, Canadians, French and German. Follow these men ashore, up the beach, and into the battle for Normandy. The men who landed on UTAH and OMAHA beach, cracked the Atlantic Wall at Arromanches, parachuted into Carantan or Ste Mere Eglise, or stormed Pegasus Bridge and the Merville battery, tell the reader what it was like to be there, in the midst of the most important single battle of World War II. The view from landing ship, tank turret, parachute harness or infantry fox hole has never been better told than in the pages of this absorbing book.",
