  "description": "A spellbinding trip of a novel about three friends breaking apart in their quest to stave off boredom and sameness.It's not about the drugs. It's not about the girls or the fights or the fading streetlights. It's about two nights that weren't going to be different from the rest but then took a turn. It's about trying to find out who you are and who your real friends are. It's about everything being the same, the same, the same. It's about nothing being the same again. It's about Brendon, Will, and Kevin -- three friends on different paths -- and the weekend that put them to the test.",
