  "description": "David Marks has a secret life. At home he's a sharp-minded international consultant, a easy-going suburban dad and do-it-yourself home hobbyist. But when business calls and travels unfold David becomes his inner self, a woman named Evie.Travel with David and his better half, Evie, as they discover the comedy and trauma, the titillation and humiliation of becoming the same person.\"My name is David Marks, and I may live next door to you. There’s a good chance that we nodded silent hello’s on the morning train, rode together like tightly packed sardines in the elevator, or perhaps even joined forces to solve complex corporate problems in the Executive Suite.During my “daytime hours” I’m a suburban dad with a wife, two kids in elementary school and a new, family-toting, environmentally green hybrid. I make my living by traveling around the country and the world, analyzing business problems and offering expert advice. I shop at the high-end grocery store, change my own oil for entertainment.And--oh yeah--I frequently transform myself into a woman and go out on the town.\"",
