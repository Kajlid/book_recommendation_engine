  "description": "Jake is just an ordinary boy looking forward to an evening at the fair. A mix of rainbow colours fills the sky as he follows small groups of children and families, all looking forward to a fun-filled evening. He is now eleven years old and has grown two inches over the past twelve months; a significant fact in itself. He is now tall enough, and old enough to shoot rifles at the funfair, without his mum having to watch over him. That was all he wants; to win a few prizes against his mate, Joe. Unfortunately for Jake, Joe was a crack shot. That makes Jake even more determined to win a prize!However, his plans goes horribly awry when Joe is delayed.So what happened - a coincidence, an accident or an experiment? Could it be a mix of the three?Jake finds himself somewhere he has never been to, or even heard of, before. How does he know? Amongst other clues, he tries to call Joe, but his phone acts up. How can he choose from three mobile network selections he had never heard of?As Jake's adventure gets underway, one thing is certain, there is nothing like this place on Earth! Then he realises something sinister is happening and he is in the thick of it. Who are the Grimwatchers and why are they after him?Furthermore, can Jake get home safely and will he ever be “normal” again?This book is an imaginative, twisting, turning tale of a quest for technology and change, with strange places and odd creatures. Superbly illustrated, it’s a great book for boys and girls of the 9-12 age range alike!.",
