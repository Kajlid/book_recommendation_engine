  "description": "In this lively look at quantum science, a physicist takes you on an entertaining and enlightening journey through the basics of subatomic physics.Along the way he examines the paradox of quantum mechanicsâ€”beautifully mathematical in theory but confoundingly unpredictable in the real world. Marvel at the Dual Slit experiment as a tiny atom passes through 2 separate openings at the same time. Ponder the peculiar communication of quantum particles, which can remain in touch no matter how far apart. Join the genius jewel thief as he carries out a quantum measurement on a diamond without ever touching the object in question. With its clean, colourful layout and conversational tone, this text will hook you into the conundrum that is quantum mechanics.",
