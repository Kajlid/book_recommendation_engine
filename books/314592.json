  "description": "Flynn You know that voice in the back of your head telling you not to do something? Well, I don’t have one, at least not one that functions properly. Mine eggs me on, daring me to do my worst. Which is how I’ve found myself in my current situation—on the verge of being traded from my team. Coach gave me one last chance to prove myself, so I begged my agent, Nadia, to help me out. Nadia When I suggested Flynn find a woman to “fake date” as a solution to his image problem, I never imagined he’d want me to fill that position. As his agent, I already had my hands full trying to keep him in line. But when he made an offer too good to refuse, I found myself accepting. Now I’m committed to spending two months in the bad boy of football’s company. His very attentive company. He smells like sin and looks like every woman’s fantasy come to life. How many stolen touches can I endure before I’m begging for more? I’m supposed to be changing the player, not falling for him. Author's This is a full-length, swoony, heartfelt, standalone sports romance. HEA. Opposites attract. Friends-to-lovers. Slow burn. Fake relationship. Age Gap. Laugh-out-loud banter, a troublemaker hero, and a strong heroine.",
