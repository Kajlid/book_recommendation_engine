  "description": "You might never see my name in lights, or flashed across the stage, but my roots were southern, my eyes bright, and my sass a mix of feisty-sweet. I was ready to take on anything life had to throw at me, until it did.I used to be a romantic, hopeful someday I’d fall in love with my Mr. Right. After a slew of romantic disasters, though, I convinced myself I was cursed.Now, almost twenty-six, I found myself working at a tattoo shop, and wondering if it was time to try again. If only the men in my life would get a clue.Slade—the bossnemy—who liked to push my buttons.Simon—the one who got away—who wasn’t even an option.Thane—the perfect guy—who swooped in to rescue me.It began so innocently, our inked confessions, a modern-day love story unfolding between us, but when the line between truth and lies blurred, how was I to know what was real?It was hidden somewhere between all the riddled deceit. The question was, was I even brave enough to unravel it? I'm Lennox James, and this is my story. *This is a why choose novel, meaning the main female character doesn't have to choose between love interests.
