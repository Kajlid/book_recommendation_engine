  "description": "5-star Foreword Reviews' 2014 INDIEFAB Book of the Year Awards Finalist in Religious Fiction: “Outstanding, Sophisticated, Mesmerizing...A spiritual intrigue similar to Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code.\" The Peace Corps, along with mystery, danger, and romance, takes a young American woman, Jessie, into the heart of Africa and halfway around the world to Europe and South America. This new life may not be what her heart seeks, while a positive-negative force, deeper and disturbing, consumes her mind. A brilliant interplay between cultures, beliefs, lightness, and darkness make this spiritual adventure truly exceptional. ***DO NOT BUY USED COPIES SINCE THE BOOK WAS UPDATED IN 2015. BUY THE NEW VERSION WITH MANY IMPROVEMENTS AND THE MOST COMPLETE FINISH. THIS IS A CLEAN BOOK FOR ANY AGE GROUP, A COMPELLING CHRISTIAN JOURNEY.***",
