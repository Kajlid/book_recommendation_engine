  "description": "Sophie  Aren't one night stands supposed to stay in the past? Aren't they supposed to be with a stranger whom you never have to see again?  Yeah. I thought so too.  And then one of my best friends asks me to be the maid-of-honor at her wedding.  Wanna take a guess who the best man is?  I'm screwed.   Nathan  I don't do feelings. I don't do relationships. And I sure as hell don't do love.  And then I was stupid enough to sleep with Soph. The girl who screwed with my head in ways I never could've imagined.  So I left.  I ran.  And I'm going to continue to run as soon as my best friend's wedding is over.  It's one weekend. How hard can it be?",
