  "description": "Long, long, and very long ago, when the gods of Asgard were many, the giants and their allies waged war against them on the plain of Ida. The gods were confident of victory: the Raven Banner had spread to the wind, and its magic was such that any side that bore it into battle was assured victory, though the bearer was certain to die.",
