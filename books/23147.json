  "description": "This parody skewers the best-selling novel about the sparkly undead. Whether you're a \"Twilight\" lover or hater*, you'll laugh out loud. The scribd preview generated over 50,000 hits, a 5-star rating and rave reviews including:\"GOLD!\"\"I love Twilight. But I swear I think I almost love this even more.\"\"This was hilarious!\"\"boi i luv this book!! amazing\"Whether you're a \"Twilight\" lover or hater, you will enjoy the non-stop humor and subtle commentary on that best-seller's view of the world. (If you haven't read \"Twilight,\" you'll just say, \"Hunh?\" If you've seen the movie, but haven't read the book, we're not sure what you'll think...let us know!)People ask whether it's worth reading all 498 pages of \"Twilight\" just to truly appreciate \"TwiLITE A Parody.\" That's a tough question. \"Twilight\" is a page-turner, but you'll never get those hours back. However, if you really, really love to snicker, it's worth it. Do not confuse this parody with fan fiction. This is a true parody. It follows Stephenie's book non-event by non-event, exposing the ridiculous every step of the way. Its stars are Edward Sullen and Bella Swoon, and boy is she clumsy.Because author, Sue Knott, believes Twilight's endless descriptive passages of vampire hunkieness could not possibly be rendered more absurd, only the \"meat\" of the original novel is mocked. That makes this parody blessedly shorter than the lengthy vampire tome it skewers...but you'll wish there were more! This is the perfect gift for friends who don't understand why you don't like Twilight.Read it. Laugh. And come back to share your review. *Disclaimer: haters find it funnier than fans.",
