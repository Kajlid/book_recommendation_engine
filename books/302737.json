  "description": "An ogre, a troll, and a witch walk into a bar...yeah, it would be funny if the joke wasn’t on us. Without warning, the three of us are thrust into a new magical world where winging it is the name of the game. All this talk about our other forms? Yeah, we really need to figure that out. This witch business is a lot to take in, and the black hat and broom are really cramping my style.We’ve gotta work fast because under the surface of this fantasy world, trouble is brewing. No, that’s not my cauldron I’m talking about...ninety-nine percent sure I don’t even have one of those. What we do have is a pack of wolves that want to eat us and a king who wants nothing more than to see us gone for good. On top of the crazy we’ve landed in, the gigantic ogre and the hairy troll are starting to grow on me...much like the warts on my extremely large nose. Can I risk letting them in? My heart’s not sold on the idea, but this traitorous green body is all for it. Well, whether it’s in the bedroom or the enchanted forest, this ogre, troll, and witch aren’t going down without a fight. Here’s to toil and trouble - the likes of which this kingdom has never seen before. If The Broom Fits is novella one in a medium-burn, quirky menage trilogy. It’s full of insta-love, sarcasm, and troll dick. It started out as a writing prompt but turned into a tale even the author herself wasn’t prepared for. Guaranteed HEA by the last installment.",
