  "description": "I was a good girl once, but now I dance with devils.Some people wear their heart on their sleeve. I wear vengeance like a suit of armor.I’ve got a list with six names on it. Six people who wronged me, who hurt me, who took everything from me. Six people who turned me into the monster I am now.And I’ve crossed off every name but one.One more name. One more death. Should be simple, right?Yeah, you’d think so. But it turns out revenge is a messy business, and when I end up in the wrong place at the wrong time, I royally piss off four brutal, twisted, gorgeous men.Gage, Priest, Ash, and Knox.Lucky for me, the last name on my list is someone they’ve got their own grudge against, so instead of killing me, they offer me a deal. They’ll give me a chance to exact my vengeance, and in exchange, all they want is…Me.I’m not stupid. I’ve played this game before. Even though they've agreed to help me, I know they want to punish me too. They want to toy with me. To let their demons loose on me.But maybe these Kings of Chaos have let my pretty face fool them.Because I'm just as vicious as they are. And I’ve got demons of my own.Kings of Chaos is a full length dark new adult romance with enemies-to-lovers/love-hate themes, featuring a slightly psycho heroine and four even more psychotic men. What happens between these pages will be dirty, dark, and delicious, so read at your own discretion.",
