  "description": "Senator Davis Hudson has a silver tongue that has so far kept the stress off those lesser political organs, the heart and the brain. But he's just made a political speech that will transform him from a Senate back-bencher to a public figure and presidential contender-whether he's ready or not-and suddenly he wants his words and actions to mean something. It's a crucial time in his political career, and Davis needs all the publicity he can get. He just doesn't expect the highlight of his first CNN interview to be the conversation he has with makeup artist Kurt Lamb. Kurt is smart, politically savvy, and uninterested in being part of a congressional sex scandal, which is why he tolerates being Davis's dirty little secret. Despite the poor timing, Davis falls for him hard. But Kurt isn't the only skeleton in Davis's closet. Davis's ex-wife isn't happy that he's pursuing the presidency now, after all her years of hard work, and he has at least one more enemy on the Hill. Between them, they have all the tools they need to ruin a presidential candidate-and maybe his shot at happiness too.",
