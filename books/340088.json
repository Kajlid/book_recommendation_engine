His wife calls on an acquaintance of her friend Madame the Mesmerist Pierre Pain. Pain, a timid bachelor, is in love with the widow Reynaud, and agrees to help. But two mysterious Spanish men follow Pain and bribe him not to treat Vallejo, and Pain takes the money. Ravaged by guilt and anxiety, however, he does not intend to abandon his new patient, but then Pain’s access to the hospital is barred and Madame Reynaud leaves Paris….

Meanwhile, Monsieur Pain, haunted and guilty, wanders the crepuscular, rainy streets of Paris...",
