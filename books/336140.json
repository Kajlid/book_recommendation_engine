  "description": "Imprisoned by fate-and the FBI-in a strange town with a new identity, Lara Mason longed to escape the painful memory of her father's murder. Playing Rapunzel in a local production would distract her, she hoped-until broodingly sensual Devon Shane was chose as her prince in the play...and cast himself as her bodyguard when shadows from her past threatened her. Captured by his sapphire gaze and a voice that compelled her surrender, Lara had trusted no one with her secret, but Devon drove her wild with sensation, demanded and took what belonged to him. Furious at being a pawn in his dangerous game, Lara told Devon she wouldn't run anymore--but could he keep her safe? Desperate to end the limbo that denied them a future, Lara was willing to gamble with her life ... but not his love. Devon had scaled her tower and won her, but now he had to set her free. Could she show him that taming his savage heart was the only happy ending she wanted?",
