  "title": "Wesley's Unexpected Bride",
  "description": "Widower Wesley Briggs is content to raise his son and work his ranch alone, until one of his cowhands, Rory Wise, who has already ordered a mail order bride, breaks his back in a fall. When Wesley fetches Rory’s bride from the station, he encounters a lovely, vulnerable woman.  After her father’s death, Frances Brewbaker and her four sisters must find husbands at once. Agreeing to move to Montana and marry a stranger, she embarks on the adventure. She is met at the depot, not by her intended, but by his employer, who she finds appealing and ruggedly handsome.  Faced with the prospect of losing her intended, Frances must decide if she will stay in the Montana Territory. The widower and his son, Jason, are much in need of a woman’s touch to soften their rough edges. Jason adores her, yet Wesley’s feelings are infinitely more complex, because he has fallen in love with Frances. Can he convince her to stay and marry him?",
