  "description": "Michael Asher is a prodigy for hire, born with the unexplainable ability to read someone’s thoughts through their eyes. Truth-seekers venture from all over the world to his small California hometown, desperate to know the truth about spouses and business partners, willing to pay the highest price for his gift. But the same whispers that made Michael an underground celebrity reach someone who has been hunting for him. What should have been just another work night sends Michael running for his life from a madman assassin—a killer who isn't human—and a global secret society who wants him dead.",
