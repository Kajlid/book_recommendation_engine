  "description": "Meet The Australian.His name's Jace Knight. He's powerful. He's charming. And he's baffled by his new personal assistant Charlie Sykes. The American's absurdly literal, obliviously beautiful and his ideal match. The hitch: how do you seduce a woman whose definition of flirting comes straight out of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary? Charlie Sykes takes everything at face value, and believes life would be a lot easier if everyone else did, too. The intelligent yet social awkward brainiac moved down under on a whim (maybe the first she's ever had) after dedicating much of her life to caring for her deadbeat mother. And while her new employer, Mr. Jace Knight, admittedly, makes her stomach somersault, he is not a suitable mate. One simply does not have coitus with one's boss.However Jace didn't build up a hotel empire by giving up easily, and Charlie's already finding ways to justify giving in to temptation. As if that weren't stressful enough, Jace's alleged criminal past draws her into a dangerous game of international espionage that plays out in the hip streets of Sydney to the majestic Great Barrier Reef and the wild, desolate outback. A terrible trap's being laid. But how will Charlie protect herself and prevent a devastating betrayal when she can't even sort out what her heart's telling her?This is a stand-alone book in the Jet-setters & Jeopardy Series, which contains strong language and sexual content. For mature readers only.",
