  "description": "The first book in the new Hope Valley BBW dating app romance series  What if your fated mate was just an app swipe away?  Curvy Dina Taylor hates the idea of online dating. It’s something kids do, not 36-year old women, whose boyfriends have left them for the office intern. But her best friend Lauren has a secret she’s bursting to share: there are men out there who absolutely love voluptuous girls like her. All Dina has to do is tap Shiftr, the cute little paw-print app that Lauren has just installed on her phone.  In the time it takes Dina to get over her shock that there are guys who can shift into animals, she’s hit up by Logan – a dark-eyed bear-guy with a torso like sculpted marble and eyes like pools of lust. He tells her that he feels a magnetic connection to her, but before she can tell him that the feeling’s mutual, her clumsy thumb swipes the wrong way, and he’s gone.  Dina is distraught, but Tamika, the creator of Shiftr has a cunning plan that may just bring them together again. Will Dina find the sexy Logan in the midst of the eccentric matchmaker’s beautiful, opulent summer garden party? And will they discover that they’re fated to be together?  This is a short, sweet, steamy read, perfect for a lunch break, bath time, or a little dose of me-time, wherever you are. HEA and no cliffhanger!",
