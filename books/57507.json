  "title": "The Well of Tears",
  "description": "More than five hundred years have passed since the legendary age of Camelot and the Stewardry, the magical order charged with protecting the old ways of power and magic, has fallen into decay, disorder, and distrust. Now Hywel, a new king promised by prophecy, has come to claim his crown. But as he journeys toward his throne, those preparing the way are besieged by agents of destruction - from within and without. A great evil stirs at Hywel's coming, unleashing a corrupting power intent on his destruction and opening the gates to a hellish army that will sweep across the land and plunge it into an era of terror and darkness. As a sorceress born of an ancient bloodline sworn to defend the Stewardry at all costs, Alwen is determined to fulfill her oath. Yet when black magic begins claiming those closest to her and traitors plot to steal the Stewardry's source of power, she realizes that the king's survival - and that of all the realms - may require that she sacrifice her own.",
