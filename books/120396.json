  "description": "Jane Burrows is the girl next door, well actually, five doors down from the new kid. She's happy with her life: she's got One True Friend, a set of wheels, and the best job ever, newspaper delivery girl! She's not even super annoyed when William McLeod starts following her around like a puppy dog. He's hot, after all. Except, what's with the spooky overprotective thing? What's with his stern opinions on ancient warfare? What's with his evasive answers to the most simple questions? Just...what's with William? If Jane's honest with herself, she wants it to be her! William's living on borrowed time. He's got three lives left before his number is up, and his dad is forcing the issue. No fighting again. Never mind the Lochspawn are hot on their tails. Nevermind they might be incriminated in four grisly murders. Nevermind the girl of his dreams is monster bait. He's supposed to sit on his hands and watch while his world goes up in Warloch flames? Yeah, no.",
