  "title": "Dominant Encounters: One",
  "description": "Clara has had submissive fantasies all her adult life, but has never found anyone to make them come true. Now, as she approaches her thirtieth birthday, with everything else in her life going well, apart from relationships, she decides to take control of her destiny and seek out the experiences she craves to finally satisfy her curiosity. Turning to the Internet in the hope of arranging an anonymous liaison, for a few brief hours, with an alpha-male who might help her explore her secret yearning, she does not anticipate becoming involved with the handsome and uncompromising man who responds to her profile.Daniel is an experienced Dominant, with his own reasons for avoiding emotional attachments. He engages with Clara on-line, and arranges to meet her, only in order to warn her of the danger she may be putting herself in, but finds himself drawn to the naïve young woman whose strange mix of beauty, sass, feminine vulnerability, and dogged determination, appeals to all his masculine senses, so that he finds himself unusually affected by her, and keen that she should accept his offer of training, and sign the contract that will make her his for six months.Will Clara agree to Daniel’s terms?Can she meet his demands?This first instalment finishes with a ‘happy for now’ ending, as Clara’s training begins… and she and Daniel embark on a journey of discovery that will test them both.Explicit language, sexual content, and activities relating to BDSM, make this book unsuitable for persons under 18 yrs of age.",
