  "description": "Winter arrives, and with it the Storm. Snow piles up, turning the landscape into a white prison. The survivors of Wrathchild's plague struggle to survive. With loneliness and doubt creeping in, they must choose: stay in isolation with their dwindling resources, or journey south, taking a chance in a realm where the undead walk. This is the terror facing the characters in Dead of Winter, the sequel to The Fall. With darkness all around them and the mystery of humanity's unraveling growing deeper each day, they must delve deep into their reservoir of strength to move forward. The coast of Florida lies hundreds of miles away, and with it the possibility of salvation.",
