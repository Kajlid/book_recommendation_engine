  "description": "Childhood pals and terminal losers Mickey Donnelly and Dell Dolan have come up with the ultimate pension plan. A series of madcap snatch and grabs that go off course until it dawns on them there just might be a better way. Pursued throughout by longtime nemesis and gangster Huey Evans they barely survive the mishaps and wrong turns.Between uncooperative husbands, tell all mistresses, and a mob contract, success doesn't come easy. Still, Mickey manages to find time to become romantically involved. In the end, only their stupidity and comic ineptness can save them.As usual, Mike Faricy has spiced this comic romp with a cast of riveting, not to mention, bizarrely quirky characters in a plot that winds and twists its way to a breathtaking conclusion. Careful, once you pick this up you won't want to put it down.",
