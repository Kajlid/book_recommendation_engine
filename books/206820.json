  "description": "Rainbaux Le Blanc appears to be a hipster artist, but she is a Remote Viewer for the Defense Intelligence Directorate. While doing her job as a spy using her psychic abilities, she comes face-to-face with a demonic Entity that horrifies and frightens her. Curious, she does some research and discovers that there is an Entity that is possessing the minds of RV’s driving them insane. Moreover, the Intelligence community wants to use this force to create psychic assassins. This knowledge freaks her out enough that she quits the DID and runs to Austin Texas. She buys a house, works a retail job, and stays to herself. But she can't hide forever. When she meets a handsome young policeman and tries to help him on a case, she discovers that The Demon has a cult of assassins operating in Austin. Now the Demon is coming for her and everyone she loves. With nowhere left to go, she must face her Demon. But she won’t face him alone.",
