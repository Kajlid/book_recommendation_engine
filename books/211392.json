Through the clouds and even beyond the gates of her owner's yard lies the possibility of friendship, motherhood and happiness â€” they are for the taking if Scraggly can just hold on to them, bring them home and build the life she so desperately desires.The Dog Who Dared to Dream is a wise tale of the relationship between dog and man, as well as a celebration of a life lived with courage.",
