  "description": "In 1880, Fancy Williamson fled an incestuous marriage arranged by a drunken father. She was sold by her parents for a few dollars, her virtue valued at the price of a few pretty dresses. She had little education and no money. But with her beautifull and the priceless gifts of courage, honor and high personal integrity, Fancy won out against all odds and wrenched from life a position of respect and security... a life that was secure against everyone except her husband. Court Brantley, had already killed one man for her and Fancy knew that if he ever found out about other man he would do so again. Men offered everything they possessed to posess her -- but there was only one man she wanted.Four men loved her… And the bustling, caste-ridden town of Augusta, Georgia couldn't forgive her. Duke Ellis -- To get Fancy's love, he was ready to shatter her beauty with violence… Wyche Weathers -- He made Fancy a carnival girl, and offered her the kind of love every woman dreams of… Jed Hawkins -- Rabble-rouser and woman-chaser, he alone understood Fancy's kind of ambition... and Court Brantley -- sensitive and temperamental, he had a fatal weakness for the wrong woman…These were Fancy's men. Their love for her brought scandal and society's ruthless mockery. Violence and blood sprang from their competition. But in the end, there was triumph too. For in winning, finally, the one man for her alone, Fancy battled the world with the kind of shameless courage that can only bring victory… proud, final and unassailable!",
