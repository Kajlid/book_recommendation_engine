  "description": "Some might view Olympus as the glittering palace of the Gods, but Hera sees it for what it truly a prison. After being tricked into a marriage she didn't want, with a God she didn't love, Hera is now the Queen of Olympus. In order to protect those she loves, she must find a way to become a shield between others and the volatile fury of her new husband. Zeus is the King of Olympus and he wants Hera to be his in all ways. He is a God that takes great pleasure in exerting his power over others and while he succeeded in securing her hand in marriage, Hera's love and obedience prove frustratingly elusive. Zeus intends to make every effort to correct this. Hera must learn to navigate the escalating danger as Zeus does his best to drive away her allies and bring her to heel. If Hera is strong enough to truly fight back, she has the chance to change the fate of Olympus forever.Â  Content This book contains scenes involving abuse (physical, emotional, psychological, non-explicit sexual), pregnancy, birth",
