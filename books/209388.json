  "title": "The Other Elizabeth",
  "description": "What was Elizabeth the 1st really like? Beneath the veneer of cold calculation and emotional aloofness she displayed to the world lived a flesh and blood woman not unaffected by the horrors of her childhood or the emotional disappointments of her adult life. One woman knew her sorrows and shared her innermost thoughts, her closest, most trusted confidant and secret kinswoman, Bess, the other Elizabeth. Like her father before her, Elizabeth finds sanctuary at the isolated estate of Coudenoure, as the epic saga of the de Grey clan – ever fiercely loyal to the crown – continues, charting their loves and loses, their triumphs and tragedies, lived out in parallel to those of the royal family with whom their blood is forever intermingled.",
