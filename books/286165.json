  "description": "Zap Powers, an electrician with Earle Electric, has just come off a double shift restoring power to a small Southern town. Exhausted and hungry, he stops at a pub for a bite to eat on his way home. But the BW&S isn't an ordinary pub. As Zap tucks in to his \"Beastie Burger\" and Uncanny Stout taking in the ambiance of the place, eight stories of unease weave through his experience.  Uncanny Stout has the flavor of a Victorian ghost story with notes of The Twilight Zone.",
