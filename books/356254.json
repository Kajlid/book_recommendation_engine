  "description": "Perfectionist Erin usually loves Christmas, but this year things aren't going exactly as planned. Lost gifts, too much work to do and organizing the office Christmas party are stressing her out. When Dex Mitchell, the gorgeous Director of Finance, who she's had a crush on forever comes by, she turns into a stammering klutz. What more could go wrong this Christmas? How about too much to drink at the Christmas party, a sexy encounter in the ladies' room and an embarrassed hangover the next day? Can anything turn this around so Erin gets what she really wants for Christmas?",
