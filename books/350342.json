Not when the duke was the Duke of Mitford, known to her as a lustful libertine who would be a horror of a husband. Josephine did the only thing she could. She ran away. Unfortunately the gentleman who helped her, the terribly handsome Mr. Porterhouse, turned out to be no gentleman at all. And Mr. Paul Villiers, who rescued her from ravishment, turned out to be worse.",
