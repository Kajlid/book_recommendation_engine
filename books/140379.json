  "title": "Fort & Da",
  "description": "Friedrich Errado is problematized by an obsession with the event of the WTC collapse. He grants the towers their figurative appellation of Fort and Da, and chronicles the emergence of an immense phantom tower known as Fear that issues from an infinitely replicating ground zero. As well, two recurrent types are transfigured in the characters of Jonkil Calembour as Da and Louis Legare as Fort--instances of the megalomaniac and paranoiac type, creating the space of a Nietzschean politics to come.",
