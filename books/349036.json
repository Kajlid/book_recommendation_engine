  "description": "Award-winning author Toon Tellegen has whipped up an enchanting collection of short stories, all centered on a series of poetic letters written by his animal protagonists. These fantastic, dreamlike, and even philosophical tales conjure up a world where the creatures of the earth can send mail to the sun (and get an answer); where you can actually write a letter to a letter; and where just writing something down can make it come true. Jessica Ahlbergâ€™s alluring artwork captures the unique spirit of the whimsical, charming fables.",
