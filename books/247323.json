  "description": "It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for naturalist Theodora Gordon. Leaving her affluent New England home, the bookish, gently bred beauty headed west to join a government expedition across America's last frontier—and to face the wrath of the drive's rugged, irascible leader, Captain Blade Roberts.The handsome son of a French-Canadian trapper and a Cheyenne princess, Blade feared for the life of the innocent, pampered Easterner he was duty-bound to protect. But in a cruel and magnificent wilderness—on a perilous journey plagued by treachery, tragedy and deceit—Theodora would win the virile half-breed's grudging respect with her courage and stamina…and win his heart with the passionate promise of an irresistible and eternal love.",
