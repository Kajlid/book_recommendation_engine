  "description": "Lana Turner Tuttle - better known as Laney - has just been dumped by her overbearing girlfriend and moved into the ugliest house in town. At least she still has her job screening classic films at the Alcott Theater, and her faithful canine companion, Rita Mae. But before she has a chance to begin wallowing in misery, her new housemates sweep her into a chaotic world filled with reformed lesbians, fascinating new uses for Saran Wrap, and Ena, the alluring, redheaded lead singer for Girl Group. Only a potent sense of humor and a tendency to imagine how her favorite silver-screen stars would handle it all keep Laney on track.",
