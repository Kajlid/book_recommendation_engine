  "description": "When death is all you have to offer, what's truly at risk? Jackson Winters is just your average twenty something year old going through life as it throws curve ball after curve ball. I mean, nothing could be worse than the most recent thing God has thrown his way. Instead of living bed ridden for the rest of his days he sets out on a journey with a bucket list in hand and need to accomplish something significant. Avery Masters was the 'it' girl of her high school. Now she's a nobody, a woman plagued by her own fears and guilt, praying that someday the pain will leave her if only she could move on with her life and finally breathe again.They say that you don’t truly know what life is about until you see your life flash before your eyes. I believed that Jackson was that flash, he had come into my life like a shooting star demolishing everything that made me who I was in his wake. As our friendship grew, so did my feelings. He told me not to try, that he could never be more than a friend to me. He told me there was no way for love to form in something that was dying… After all nothing could grow from death. He was wrong. I was wrong. Neither of us realized that for things to grow, something had to die.Two people set out on two very different paths. One to death, and the other to live. Love has its own way of turning even the darkest moments into the brightest.",
