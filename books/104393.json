  "description": "When Eliah Al-Saud and Matilde Martinez meet on a flight to Paris, they have little in common. Eliah is the rich and powerful son of a Saudi prince, and the owner of a French security company—actually a front for mercenary and espionage services—while Matilde is a pediatric surgeon from Argentina, whose only dream is to work in Africa helping children in need.Despite their differences—and current relationships—an undeniable attraction swallows them whole, driving them into a whirlwind romance and irreversibly intertwining their devastating secrets, powerful friends, and nefarious enemies. Soon Eliah and Matilde find themselves at the center of a geopolitical nightmare, and not only is their love at risk, but their very lives.",
