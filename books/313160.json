Rick has fought through the fiery depths of hell and come out on the other side. It’s the only way for someone with a past steeped in loyalty to the mafia to live. Finding Christine would become his salvation and he would do anything to keep her.Christine’s life is full of heartache. So full that she doesn’t know where her life is heading. Forward would mean dragging her demons along with her but going back is never an option. A lifetime of suffering and torment has taught her to rely on only herself. But what happens when one man has the courage to show her just what love is all about? She would soon find out that love is stronger than the devil, and she would do anything to keep it. Can they overcome the battle to stay together long enough to build something that they both have spent a lifetime hoping for? Or will the demons of their past threaten to tear what they have finally found apart?",
