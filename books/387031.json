  "description": "Remember the first time you saw Japanese comics? The excitement. The buzz. The sales. Here comes the next big thing - storytelling and comics from India. Devi (pronounced Day-vee) is India's first super-heroine. Tara Mehta, an unsuspecting young woman in the futuristic Indian city, Sitapur, is the Devi. She has no idea that she is about to become the centerpiece of a divine battle between the Gods of Light and the demon Lord Bala. Devi is a powerhouse of a story about a young woman battling for survival in a landscape of ancient legends, duty and fate. She walks the line between tradition, destiny and free will. Where will she fall? Between the Divine and the Diabolical there is Devi.",
