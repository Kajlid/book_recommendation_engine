  "description": "For some, dreams really do come true.For others, dreams are nothing but fantasies.For Calum, dreams are his only hope.Calum longs for something more than the life of slavery he has lived since the death of his parents. But recently, he’s had dreams filled with light, echoing with the voice of a mysterious entity, calling upon him for release.When a Saurian—a huge lizard person—named Magnus is brought to the quarry as a new slave, young Calum is faced with a choice: live out his days as a slave, or shed his shackles and embark on a new life of adventure.Joined by his adventure-craving friend Axel, Magnus, a Windgale girl trying to get back home, and a sarcastic wolf, Calum travels through the fantastical world of Kanarah in search of a way to free the mysterious entity speaking to him in his dreams.But a journey of that scope is fraught with danger, both from man and monsters alike. Pursued by slave traders, vengeful bandits, and the King’s men, Calum makes a series of desperate decisions that lead him to the dark and terrible places of the world. If he can’t reach the valley and cross to the other side, his quest will have amounted to nothing.Can Calum and his friends escape the clutches of those pursuing them? Or will they be forced to brave the ancient horrors deep within Kanarah so they can reach their destination?The Call of Ancient Light is an exhilarating coming-of-age fantasy series.
