  "description": "Welcome back to the Velvet Glove, the most exclusive men's BDSM club in the galaxy! This fifth installment of the Velvet Glove series features In Three to Heal, where Jean is a broken man. He's been practically blinded and terribly scarred by an accident. Alone and angry, he turns to the Glove to take him out of himself for awhile. Club social director Kestrel introduces Jean to committed pair Noel and Richard. Can these two devoted men find a place in their heart for Jean? And can Jean accept them in return? Rock Stars and Size Queens finds famed singer Angel at the end of his rope. Manager Jax has brought him to the Glove, sedated and undercover, for some rest and a little therapy that only the Glove can provide. Jax hires Dom Roland to take Angel under his wing, then Jax dallies with Minuet, one of the club's best subs, and a bit of a size queen. Can these four men find what they need? Finally, in Fits Like a Glove, we learn more about Hercules, the owner of the Velvet Glove. The Glove is exclusive, hot and all his. Malachi is the club's head trainer and an extraordinary top. The man has a secret, though, one that Hercules discovers. If it gets out, Malachi's reputation could be ruined, and possibly the Velvet Glove's too. Can Malachi and Hercules maintain a relationship as well as their roles at the club? Or will their needs and desires bring their world crashing down around them?",
