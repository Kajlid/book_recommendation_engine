  "description": "The last time we saw Simon Garth, the bank teller single-handedly stopped a gang of murderous robbers and got shot, bitten by zombies, and med-evac-ed straight into Army custody for scientific experimentation as death and the necrotic infection overtook him fast. No problem, right? Find out how Simon got out of THAT one - assuming he did - and check out his further adventures battling the undead - unless, that is, he's one of them now - in a brutal, gory, disgusting, and awesome re-imagining of one of Marvel's strangest horror heroes that could only be dreamed up by artist/co-writer Kyle Hotz (Zombie) and Eric Powell (The Goon)! Collects The Simon Garth #1-4.",
