  "description": "Jasper Jones fell in love with Dean McQueen at fourteen, but at twenty-three Jazz would like nothing better than to see the rock star choke on his own vomit. After a catastrophic reunion, Dean seems bent on destroying Jazz's life. It all started when an impromptu bar performance ended up on YouTube and Jazz became an internet sensation overnight. The name \"Jazdean\" keeps popping up in headlines and the paparazzi stalk his every move. To make matters worse, Jazz is about to end up on the streets for the second time in his life.In a desperate attempt to keep his home, Jazz signs a deal with Dean's band, Black Hurricane, to perform at a couple of concerts. It feels like one of Dean's feeble attempts to get Jazz back, but painted into a corner like he is, Jazz has no choice.",
