  "description": "Revolt is seething among the native Indians in the colonial settlement at Uttar Pradesh, and desire is storming the heart of memsahib Devora Hawthorne, wife of the local British diplomatic officer.Awakened by her lustful young husband to passions that she cannot ignore and he cannot satisfy, Devora retreats increasingly from the hollow formalities of her social station as she seeks out the sympathy of the sultry, enigmatic Rohan, the trusted Indian manservant who heads her household. While Rohan willingly educates Devora in the political realities that threaten the stability of the world her husband upholds and represents, he more passionately introduces his eager mistress to a way of loving that far exceeds her English imagination.",
