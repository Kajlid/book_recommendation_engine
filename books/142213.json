  "description": "From the Gold Rush to the Baby Boom, women struggled against social custom, restrictive laws, and limited career opportunities. Under the Almond Trees is the novelized account of three ordinary women who lived extraordinary lives in early California. One learns independence when she is widowed and must lead men. Another desires a career in a man’s field. The third wants only a traditional family—until her husband refuses to pay for their daughter’s college education. Their legacy resounds beyond the family. I am proud to be their relative and honored to share their story.",
