  "description": "After thirty years of marriage, can there be any secrets left? The charming new novel from the author of The Dressmakers of Yarrandarrah Prison Diana Forsyth is in the midst of planning the Big Party, a combined celebration of her husband Will's 60th and their 30th wedding anniversary. The whole family is flying in and unbeknownst to Will, Diana is planning a Big Surprise.But then she finds a torn scrap of paper hidden inside the folds of one of his cashmere sweaters, with the words, I forgive you. And all of a sudden, Diana realises she's not the only one keeping Big Secrets.As empty nesters who have just downsized from the family home, she and Will are supposed to be embracing a new promise of glorious freedom - not revisiting a past that Diana has worked very hard to leave behind.A witty, poignant and insightful exploration of marriage: the choices we make - or don't make, the resentments we hold, the lies we tell and what forgiveness really means.Praise for The Dressmakers of Yarrandarrah Prison:'A heart-warming tale of friendship, forgiveness and redemption, written with a warmth and intimacy that is immediately engaging' The Australian'Funny and moving' Sun-Herald'Overflowing with humour and heart' Natasha Lester'A warm, deft and funny story where unlikely people show us what's important' Rosalie Ham'This deliciously original, immersive and darkly funny novel is full of hope and heart.
