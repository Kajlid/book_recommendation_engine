  "description": "Welcome to the world of strong US Marshals, offbeat criminals, and unusual settings from Arizona to Honduras to south Florida. Simon Pack, former Marine General and Montana Governor, now leads the largest fugitive Task Force in the Marshals Service. The main characters interlock in three big cases. Pack’s boss is jealous of Pack in the extreme, stamping a bull’s eye on Pack’s back. But when the US Attorney General assigns a case directly to Pack, it’s clear the Director of the Marshals Service cannot fire Pack. The final case addresses a current event in today’s headlines, and how Pack handles it may surprise the reader. In attempting to save the lives of his antagonists, Pack puts his own life in grave peril. Pack’s Posse is rife with chaotic action, compelling characters, and pithy insights on modern America. Watch as the action steamrolls to a dramatic conclusion.",
