  "description": "\" Dutchman  is designed to shock—its basic idea, its language and its murderous rage.\" — New York Times Centered squarely on the Negro-white conflict, both  Dutchman  and  The Slave  are shocking plays—in ideas, in language, in honest anger. They illuminate as with a flash of lightning a deadly serious problem—and they bring an eloquent and exceptionally powerful voice to the American theatre. Dutchman  opened in New York City on March 24, 1964, to perhaps the most excited acclaim ever accorded an off-Broadway production and shortly thereafter received the  Village Voice's  Obie Award.  The Slave,  which was produced off-Broadway the following fall, continues to be the subject of heated critical controversy.",
