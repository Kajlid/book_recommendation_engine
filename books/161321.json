A thirty-nine-year-old woman named Pampinea leads the ten on a ten day journey by stealing her brother's unfinished ship. She has one thing on her mind. Her fortieth birthday is nine days away, and she is required to take her life and join the Stellae in Spheria 1. But, she finds herself trapped between two spheres, two lives, and two lovers.
