  "description": "When restaurant critic Charlie McLean and his son, Martin visit the little town of Allen's Corners in rural Connecticut, little do they realise what they're letting themselves in for. In the mood to try something different they stop at Le Reposoir, unaware that most of the meals on the menu are not the a-la-carte range they're used to, but more a mixture of mundane dishes and human Hors d'oeuvre.",
