  "description": "The freedom of the range, the bawling of the longhorns, the lonesome night watch beneath a vast, starry sky--they got into a man's blood until he knew there was nothing better than the life of a cowboy...except the love of a good woman.IsabelleBorn and bred in Savannah, Georgia, she was the kind of woman Jake Maxwell avoided at all cost. \"Neat as a pin and stiff as starch,\" he classified her when she and her wagonload of orphans pulled up to his Texas ranch. But without any men of his own, the boys under her care were Jake's only chance of driving his beeves to market. Still, he couldn't help wondering if he could teach a gang of outlaws-in-the-making to herd cattle...if he could keep his hands off the oh-so-proper belle...if there was any way at all to stop Isabelle from branding his heart as her own.",
