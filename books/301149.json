  "description": "Elgaard, year 320. It was the eve of his sixteenth birthday and the royal ceremony in which he would receive his crown as heir to the throne. Everything was going according to plan until his wicked older brother returned. Banished from his kingdom by a power-hungry enemy, a prince embarks on a dangerous journey to return and take his rightful place as king of a land cursed in a never-ending winter. After an enchantment causes him to forget, Prince Rykus is raised far outside of the kingdom by peasants, remembering nothing of his royalty or his wintry powers. While working as a swordsmith, he befriends a pirate with a secret of his own and a bear who help to remind him of who he really is. Thus, he begins the adventure of returning to the barren kingdom and to fight for the crown, exacting justice for his brother’s betrayal and cruelty and he must do so before Elgaard is overrun by an even bigger enemy. Murder. Revenge. Dragons. Winter. “The White Prince” is Frozen meets The Lion King meets The Pilgrim's Progress for a new generation of readers with a mind for fantasy and adventure.",
