  "description": "All she ever wanted was a quiet life doing what she loved. Her family had other plans.Being the Omega daughter of Slate City’s favorite politician is exhausting. Everyone in our family is perfect. Good jobs, good images, no scandals, and smiling at all times. That’s not me, and it never will be.No matter how hard I try.All I’ve ever wanted was a simpler life—to choose what I want to do, have a pack who loves me, and be happy—but that’s not an option. My entire life is already planned out for me. Every step carefully curated to make sure my family stays at the top, in the spotlight, and in power. Of course, I will be their dutiful Omega daughter. That was before I got trapped in a closet with an Alpha whose scent made me want to misbehave. And before I found out that he’s my new bodyguard. His pack smells like paradise, drowns me with passion, and doesn’t care about my family’s plans. They only want me.From the outside my life seems perfect, but I know better than anyone that knot all that glitters is gold. I want to break out of the cage I’m in, and I want these men to help me do it. But when you’re on a pedestal to the entire world… there’s a very long way to fall.Knot All That Glitters is a standalone reverse harem Omegaverse. No choosing, no cheating, and a guaranteed HEA!
