She fears he's a predator, but it's worse than that. The man, Daniel Kazan, believes Maddy is his granddaughter, abducted as a baby—and he's obsessed with getting her back.Susan insists on a DNA test to disprove Daniel's claim, but the result is one she can't understand or explain: it says she's not Maddy's mother. Then Maddy vanishes. Susan's convinced Daniel has taken her, but he has an alibi, and two searches of his house turn up nothing. The hunt is on—police are on full mobilization, and Susan fears the worst.",
