  "title": "White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism",
  "description": "Groundbreaking book exploring the counterproductive reactions white people have when discussing racism that serve to protect their positions and maintain racial inequality\nAntiracist educator Robin DiAngelo first coined the term \"white fragility\" in 2011, and since then it's been invoked by critics from Samantha Bee to Charles Blow. \"White fragility\" refers to the defensive moves that white people make when challenged racially. These include emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors including argumentation and silence. In this book, DiAngelo unpacks white fragility, explaining the underlying sociological phenomena. She'll draw on examples from her work and scholarship, as well as from the culture at large, to address these fundamental questions: How does white fragility develop? What does it look like? How is it triggered? What can we do to move beyond white fragility and engage more constructively?",
