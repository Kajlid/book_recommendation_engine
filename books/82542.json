  "description": "89-year-old Isabelle McAllister has a favour to ask her hairdresser Dorrie Curtis and it's a big one. Isabelle wants Dorrie, a black single mother in her thirties, to drop everything to drive her from her home in Arlington, Texas, to a funeral in Ohio.As they drive, Isabelle starts to tell her story: as a willful teen in 1930s Kentucky, she fell deeply in love with Robert Prewitt, the black son of her family's housekeeper-in a town where blacks weren't allowed after dark. The tale of their forbidden relationship and its tragic consequences makes it clear that Dorrie and Isabelle are headed for a gathering of the utmost importance, and that the history of Isabelle's first and greatest love just might help Dorrie find her own way.With tenderness and searing emotion, Calling Me Home illuminates the hardships, passions and dreams that link women across race, generations and time.",
