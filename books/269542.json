  "description": "Humanity lies on the brink of disaster, but hidden in the shadows, another society's plight is even more desperate. Beth and Ysabel are ageless, powerful, and losing hope. After waging war for over a century against the feral vampires stalking the land, the tide has turned against them. Their only chance to save their people is an unlikely alliance with an ancient enemy – humans. Captain Michael Beck is reeling from the fall out of a disastrous battle. Broken and unsure, he is called back to his duty and asked to do the impossible; lead a single unit of elite soldiers against a seemingly endless hoard of immortal foes. His only help – an advisor who isn’t what she seems. When the lines between enemy and ally are blurred, and the stakes become ever higher, how can they know which threats are real?",
