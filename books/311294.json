  "description": "A compilation of four Happy Ever After novellas, from the popular, bestselling Ice Planet Barbarians series. Book 1.5 Ice Planet Honeymoon: Vektal & Georgie What happens after happily ever after? Quite a bit, actually. Georgie and Vektal are mated, but Georgie has a few things on her mind before she settles into her new life...why not have a honeymoon? Book 2.5 Ice Planet Honeymoon: Raahosh & Liz Newly-mated (and grudge-holding) Liz wants nothing more than to be away from the tribe that’s exiled her man. Raahosh wants to prove to Liz that he can be a good mate, even if he’s ugly. On a honeymoon, they can get to know each other better. Perfect, right? Book 3.5 Ice Planet Honeymoon: Aehako & Kira Kira and Aehako are happily mated and waiting for their baby’s arrival. Everything is great...or is it? Because carefree Aehako has turned into the most hovering of spouses, and he’s making everyone at the cave crazy. Kira thinks it’s time for a vacation...of sorts. Book 4.5 Ice Planet Honeymoon: Rukh & Harlow Rukh and Harlow are starting over at the beach, away from everyone else. Newly mated, they’re just now realizing what a monumental task it is to create a home when you’ve got nothing but the leathers on your back. It’s even worse when you can’t talk to your mate. Will misunderstandings ruin everything? ---Note: These stories are extended epilogues for readers who want a little more of their favorite couples. But hey! Don’t start here . . .
