  "description": "Kelly Everyone has their kryptonite, mine just so happens to be him. The womanizer, the male whore and the sexiest man you’ll ever lay your eyes on. With his dark hair, penetrating eyes, and his god like body beckoning to be touched, you can’t help but be hypnotized by the man. He makes me want things I don’t deserve, makes me feel things I didn’t think I’d ever experience again, not after the hurt I’ve caused, the damage I’ve done. Yet, when I’m with him or he’s around, I feel free, light, like I can finally live.  He’s everything I swore to stay away from, yet, like a moth to a flame, I know I’m about to get burned.  Dante  I’m not a fan of the word no. Well, that was until the little vixen Kelly Dean said it to me. Not just once, but over and over again. I used to think of her ‘‘no’’ as foreplay, now they make me feel the total opposite.  One night was all it took for me to become addicted to her. One night for me to screw up the best thing that had ever happened to me and one night for my world to start falling apart piece by piece.  My mission to make it up to her isn’t as clear cut as I thought it would be. How was I to know two people from my past were going to make it difficult? Thankfully one is here to make amends, but unfortunately, the other is here for revenge. Now I’m praying like hell that at the end of this battle, she’s my gift. After all, it’s her I’m fighting for.   Reading order  Book One ~ Better left forgotten Book Two ~ Obsession",
