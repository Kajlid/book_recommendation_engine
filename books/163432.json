  "description": "Caroline Anders spent her entire life playing it safe. After losing everything she'd thought she wanted, she decided to take a chance. She settled into a new life in Detroit, content to not have to rely on anyone for anything. When she needs help, the first person she thinks to call is Buster, a frequent customer at the bakery where she worked and president of Nightshade MC. Buster always thought that he'd lead Nightshade one day, but when that day came sooner than anyone could have imagined, he finds that the title carries a heavier weight than he could have ever foreseen. Old enemies are now new friends as a new drug hits the streets, leaving death and destruction in its wake, and Nightshade faces a threat it hadn't seen coming.",
