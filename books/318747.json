  "description": "Given my reputation, most people wouldn't think of me as romantic. I'm tough. I can be gruff. A hard ass. I know being a Captain with the Gainesville Police Department has probably gotten me more than a few dates. I have a reputation for being a ladies' man. Truthfully, all I've ever wanted is to settle down. I've just never found the right woman to do it with.Until Mariah Marie comes into my life. She's an author who just moved to Gainesville. Her popularity has grown exponentially in such a short period of time. Wherever she graces with her presence, a call for service is sure to follow. I can't blame those that flock to her. She's enchanting. Beautiful. Sweet. Intelligent. Fierce. She has a wicked sense of humor, and a tantalizing way with words.I find myself falling more and more in love with her the longer she allows me to be a part of her life. I'm thankful that she trusts me enough to let me in, despite the abusive past she came from. I love that she's fiery as hell in all aspects of her life, but soft and submissive with me.When the attention of one of Mariah's adoring fans becomes more than innocent adoration, all of my instincts go directly into a territory I'm completely unfamiliar with. Suddenly, we're both thrust into a dangerous world that threatens to destroy us. When it's over, what will be left of us when we emerge from the carnage?",
