  "description": "A MAFIA ROMANCE  “Head of the family” is not an easy job title. There is a darkness within those words, a common set of traits the boss of bosses must possess and codes he must follow in order to fulfil his duty. Famiglia first. Always thinking of the family. But now, I find myself thinking of her. Sitting at my desk, calling the shots, even pulling the trigger has become a daunting task. Not because I don’t want to or can’t, but because all I want to do is imagine what it would feel like with my body wrapped around hers.  Should I feel as though this is the life I want? Should I see the good for all it is and accept the bad as it comes? He’s different, I’m different. Maybe it’s the way his eyes glisten now or the fact that they are even darker at times. I can’t help but wonder what it would be like if Jax could love me. I know that I’m imagining things at night when he asks me to stay with him in his bed. I feel him watch me. But what if I wasn’t imagining it, what would that mean?",
