  "description": "It's been two years since Cora and Elena of LEARNING CURVES discovered how easy it is to learn to love--but with Christmas just around the bend, they're going to have to learn to cope when both their families descend on their household for the first time ever. With her brothers and parents underfoot and a million dishes to cook, it's hard enough for Elena to plan her double surprise for Elena, even harder when she has to corral her wayward brothers into it--but when Cora's own surprise plans tangle with Elena's, it may be impossible to tie up the holiday in a neat little bow.There's mayhem and laughter, warmth and unexpected turns--and even if it all doesn't go according to plan, neither Cora nor Elena care so long as they can stay wrapped up in each other.",
