  "description": "This is an alternative cover edition for ISBN 0671023187/9780671023188.TAKING AMERICA BACK...ONE POLITICIAN AT A TIME.What if America's leaders were held accountable for their broken promises——and made to pay for their corruption? With a unique flair for heart-pounding dramatic tension, meshed with the technical precision of Tom Clancy, author Vince Flynn brings to life a chilling scenario of Washington under siege——in a provocative, edge-of-your-seat political thriller.In a night of shattering brutality, three of Washington's most powerful and unscrupulous politicians have been executed with surgical precision. Their assassins, vanishing without a trace, have delivered a shocking ultimatum to the American government: set aside petty, partisan politics and restore power to the people, or be held to deadly account. No one, they warn, is out of their reach——not even the president. A joint FBI-CIA task force reveals the killers are elite military commandos, but no one knows exactly who they are or when they will strike next. Only Michael O'Rourke, a former U.S. Marine and freshman congressman, holds a clue to the violence: a haunting incident in his own past with explosive implications for his country's future...Delivered with the dead-on impact of a sniper's bullet, TERM LIMITS is a tour de force of authenticity and suspense, an all-too-realistic and utterly compelling vision in which the ultimate American ideal——a government of the people——is taken to a devastating extreme.",
