At forty-three, it’d been twenty-four years since I’d last seen him—after I’d foolishly kissed him—and depression was threatening to suffocate me.Not even my wife and two children could lift the fog. I was riddled with guilt and self-hatred, and I knew I was slowly but surely fading away.Then one day, Kelly was back in town.\nThis story takes place in Cara Dee’s Camassia Cove Universe, a fictional town where all books stand on their own, unless otherwise stated, and the reader can jump in wherever they want.",
