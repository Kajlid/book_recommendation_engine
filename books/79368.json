  "description": "THE UNIVERSE NEXT DOORWhat would have happened if history had been different -- if the major events that shaped our times had occurred in a different way ... or had not occurred at all? In this stellar collection, twelve of science fiction's most imaginative minds have altered the past to reveal a present of astonishing and startling possibilities...a rare glimpse of what might have been. From a Germany that won the war to a modern exodus from Egypt, from the death of ancient Greece to the true secret of the Soviets, these hold excursions in time depict bizarre new worlds -- oddly familiar, disturbingly different.Summary:Poul Anderson's \"In the House of Sorrows\" Gregory Benford's \"We Could Do Worse\"George Alec Effinger's \"Everything but Honor\"Karen Joy Fowler's \"Game Night at the Fox and Goose\"Barry N.
