  "description": "A fun little treat adapted from my first novelette Brie’s First Day of Submissive Training When I wrote this, I thought, “What would have happened if Brie had been born a man instead of a woman, and she/he met Sir at the tobacco shop?” This is what resulted. Two men who are normally attracted to females find themselves curiously drawn to each other… Enjoy an alternate universe where Brian and Sir explore their hidden desires. I found it to be a surprisingly sexy read as I penned it, I hope you will too. ~Red Brian’s First Day of Submissive Everything changes the day Sir comes in to Brian’s tiny tobacco shop. This steamy novelette follows a young man as he is introduced to the erotic world of submission and his own true desires. Brian Bennington studied to be a serious filmmaker, but finds himself working retail just to make ends meet. In walks Sir, a charismatic individual who leaves a business card. Brian becomes curious about The Submissive Training Center, but fights the urge to join. Irresistibly drawn to the mysterious world and to Sir, he enrolls in the six-week course. One thing is certain, Brian is about to learn more about himself in one day than the previous twenty-two years... Adult Material (18+) This book contains sexually explicit content including M/M.",
