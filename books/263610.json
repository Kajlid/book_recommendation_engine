  "description": "When Redwall was published in 1987 it catapulted author Brian Jacques to international stardom. And small wonder! This enthralling tale is jam-packed with the things we long for in a great adventure: danger, laughter, escapes, tragedy, mystery, a touch of wonder, a truly despicable villain, and a hero we can take to heart.That hero is Matthias, a young mouse who must rise above his fears and failures to save his friends at Redwall Abbey. The villain is Cluny the Scourage, one of the most deliciously despicable rats of all time. The unforgettable cast of supporting characters includes the stalwart badger Constance, an irrepressible hare named Basil Stag Hare, and the elderly wisemouse Brother Methuselah.But most of all there is Matthias, seeking his true destiny in a journey that will lead through danger and despair to true wisdom.",
