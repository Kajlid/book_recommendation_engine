  "description": "As Frank discovers more about the government’s project on Planet Muta, encountering several new settlements as he does so, his confused decision-making starts to be questioned from all sides. Still unsure of the project’s intentions, and after taking several heavy hits to his floundering emotions, a revelation about the driving force behind the project then jolts him further. The magnitude of the situation dawns and a return to Earth becomes a distinct possibility. Far from launching an offensive aimed at overthrowing the government, a startling incident then inadvertently thrusts him into the spotlight as the man to potentially head up a new parliament back on Earth.",
