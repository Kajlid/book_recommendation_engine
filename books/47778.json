  "description": "The Bastard Pleasure is a dark novel. It concerns itself with the mystery of identity and individuation, its destruction and the brutal way in which it is reclaimed in an emerging act of intuitive will and self-affirmation, that is both obligated and free, in the circumstances, to be either good or evil - more plainly, it is about terrorism, in its concrete and seemingly incomprehensible forms, that eminently reveals existential \"border situations‚Äù in ambiguity and contradiction.",
