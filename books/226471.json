  "title": "Winter's Absolution",
  "description": "***Warning. This book is for mature audiences only and has many triggers including strong language, sexual/fetish content and rape/ abuse flashbacks. This is a work of fiction about surviving and is not for the faint of heart. *** This is an MC Romance with dark edges...Reality can be more terrifying than the strange tales that sometimes circulate. When inky blackness creeps and crawls into every internal recess of a human being, it can be a recipe for living hell on earth. But sometimes, even in the most desolate, frigid terrains… absolution can be found.LunaSerpent tongues, slithering all around, hissing violent, toxic things, choking the very life out of me… There is no light here, yet I cling to a formless hope that may not even exist. Even as this personal prison tries to wring the last bit of breath from my cold body, I can’t help but think that a lifeline will be thrown to me through the barrage of taunting shadows that tempt me with whisperings to simply end it myself.LeoThe voices of past deeds and experiences never stop, no matter how hard I work to get over the scarred bits that are always on the verge of being picked open like a sore that will never heal. Most days, I’d rather bang my head into a concrete slab until they all just shut the fuck up. That all stopped the day I found her, a broken, quivering mess who was afraid to leave my property. Her personal demons shone through her sunken eyes, and I knew I had found someone familiar. She scared me to death, but through her, my purpose in this godforsaken world came into focus. She needed me to be a beacon… to show her the way out of the desolate pit of hell that I had only recently figured out how to climb out of.",
