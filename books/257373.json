His days are completely mapped out – what he eats, when he trains, when he sleeps, even the air he breathes.There was never room in that vision for a girl, especially in the lead-up to the Nationals. Yet fate works in funny ways, and when Hendrix literally bowls Emily over on a training run, he just can’t get her out of his head. His life and priorities take a turn as he falls for her.But Emily has a deadly secret that she’s scared to share even with Hendrix. As their bond grows and Hendrix strays further from his father’s strict regime, the tension builds to a heart-wrenching climax.",
