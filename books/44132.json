  "description": "Set in the French countryside, Toby's Tails relates the first year in the life of the author's Border Collie, starting with his earliest recollections on the farm where he was born. His life changes when Susan Keefe adopts Toby and he bonds with his new human family, their goat, Molly, and Lucky, the old Golden Retriever who becomes Toby's mentor. Toby's lessons about the world around him include the changing of the seasons, his interaction with other animals, and what he learns from them about birth, death and other inevitable life events. \"Based on her experiences as an animal lover and smallholder, and featuring her own animals, the author has created in 'Toby's Tails' an enchanting book to educate children about the needs of animals and the importance of kindness to all living creatures. In this delightful story, Toby the lovable Border Collie relates in a lighthearted manner the adventures of his animal companions, both domestic and wild, and touches sensitively and gently on the occasional inevitable small tragedies that are a part of their life cycle. I believe this is a perfect book to inform and entertain younger readers about the wonders of the animal kingdom.\" - Susie Kelly, Author \"We have a naughty sheepdog too and our nine-year-old farming-crazy grandson loved this book; he was totally absorbed by Toby's story.\" - Anne Loader, LÃ©onie Press. A garden designer and qualified herbalist, Susan Keefe grew up in Essex, England.
