  "description": "Erimentha Parker is a chronic overachiever, bookworm and perfectionist. Joining at Lady Nightingale's School in Year Seven, she is excited and anticipating the term ahead; however, when she gets on the wrong side of Kimberly, one of the most popular girls in her class, everything starts to go wrong. In light of the girls' cruel and relentless behaviour, Erimentha begins to doubt herself, unwilling to confide in anybody and convinced that she can sort it out for herself. 'Erimentha Parker's To Do List' follows the story of a young, ambitious girl and her struggles with one of the greatest hardships for bullying. Ruby Granger has a YouTube channel where she posts Study Tips videos and book reviews. She has created Erimentha for her viewers, more than anything, in the hopes that the protagonist can act as a point of motivation when studying and as a guiding force for all those children who are picked on for loving to learn.",
