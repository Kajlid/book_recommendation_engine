  "description": "Because sometimes you have to be the one to make a difference.\nAbout this book:Brian Yi knew what it meant when he showed up with super-powers one day. He was Infected.Doomed to be hated and reviled for simply existing. A monster. But Brian is special, a rare Infected person willing to fight for those that can't, not uncontrolled or insane. In fact, thanks to his power of taking the place of those about to die and the bizarre overriding sense of self-sacrifice he suddenly develops, he doesn't really get a choice in the matter.Now he has to either fight for the IPB - a government organization designed to contain the Infected threat - or end up lobotomized, living the rest of his days in a psych ward.In the end though, he knows there's only one real option: save all he can.Even if it kills him.Because the world is about to change, and the only thing standing between the lives of millions and certain death, is one man with the unlikely power to take a victim's place, when there is no other hope left.Proxy",
