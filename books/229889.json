  "description": "Would you give up your best friend for one night of passion?From the author of the Legal series comes a hot and hilarious new STANDALONE.I met him on the luckiest day of the year.Of course, I wasn’t aware of his true identity at the time. I only knew him as the arrogant blond god who gave me a shamrock necklace. For luck.As if I needed it.Okay, maybe I did. But it was presumptuous of him to assume I wanted his help – all because he made it his business to pry into my personal conversation.I, Perry Sommers, want a life makeover.I want to stop being so impulsive and start acting like a grown up. I want to settle down and have a real relationship, instead of a series of clusterf*cks.I want to fall in love. Just not with this man.But love isn’t fair. It doesn’t care if someone is off-limits, and Stephen Davidson definitely is. I can handle that. Our intense chemistry tests me on a near constant basis. I can handle that too.What I can’t handle is how much I’ve come to need him in my life. I never expected this infuriating hard-ass to become my best friend, but now that he has, I never want to let him go.I can’t destroy the bond we share, but there is only so much a woman can take before she breaks.Before she throws it all away for one perfect night.** This friends to lovers standalone takes place six years before Legal. It does not need to be read in conjunction with the others in the series. **",
