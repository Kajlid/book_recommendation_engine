  "description": "From zipless action in Fear of Flying to jolly romps with Jilly Cooper; from transgressions with a priest in The Thorn Birds to mischief with Mellors; from a gentle first encounter with Ralph in Forever to anything and everything but gentle in The Story of O . Even Keats, Chaucer, and Shakespeare are up to no good. These are the stories that taught us about sex, volumes pilfered from our parents’ bookshelves, favorites passed girl to girl, hidden in desks, whispered and wondered about.",
