  "description": "Since the 1968 publication of Nancy Friday's outspoken erotic masterpiece, My Secret Garden, women's sexual lives have undergone a revolution - and so have their fantasy lives. No longer ashamed to express the wild, exciting and sometimes outrageous thoughts that bring them so much sexual pleasure, the women who reveal their sexual fantasies in Forbidden Flowers are even more explicit than those in Nancy Friday's first international bestseller and iconic erotic book.Forbidden Flowers is a celebration of a new sexual and social freedom, where today's women rejoice in the awareness of their own inner erotic lives. Nancy Friday's ground-breaking work adds an exhilarating new freedom to the ever-changing relationship between the sexes; it is a revealing and empowering insight into female sexuality and psychology.",
