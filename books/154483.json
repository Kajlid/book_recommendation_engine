  "description": "Axton I thought I had everything I needed in life. More money than I would ever spend in my lifetime. A successful band that traveled all around the world. Girls throwing themselves at me on a daily basis. A kind of pseudo family in the Demon’s Wings guys and Emmie. And then she fell into my life. The second my eyes landed on the blonde bombshell with her sassy mouth and those hot piercings and tats, I knew that I’d finally found someone I wanted for life. Dallas I fell hard for a Rock God. When it was over, I was left shattered. But I was stronger than anyone—especially my mother—gave me credit for. I picked myself up and worked my ass off to get through nursing school, putting the rest of my life on hold to finally fulfill my dreams. When tragedy strikes, Dallas and Axton are thrown together again. Dallas is along for the ride as OtherWorld goes on a three month tour. Will Axton finally be able to convince her that his feelings go deeper than he first let her see? Or will Dallas be left wondering if Axton Cage was just THE ROCKER WHO WANTS Me? ***Mature Content***",
