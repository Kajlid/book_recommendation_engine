  "description": "Jonathan Meredith doesn't like Robin, the English master at his school. It's not his inability to control his classes that he dislikes, nor even his incompetence as an instructor, but rather his indifference to the feelings of anybody but himself. Nevertheless, he's stunned by news of Robin's death - drowned in the river close to the school. Suicide was the coroner's verdict, but Jonathan soon comes to have reasons for doubting this ... This exciting thriller is being reissued as part of the Oxford Children's Modern Classics series.",
