  "description": "Christopher Stubbs does not have the ability to fly and cannot move objects with his mind. He is not an ancient spirit reborn from the grave, has never battled throngs of reanimated zombie warriors and the closest heâ€™s ever come to seeing the living dead was at his not-so-deceased Aunt Bea's open-casket funeral.What Christopher Stubbs can do, he discovered only four short months after his eighteenth birthday when he also learned that contrary to the old adage, lightning can in fact strike the same place twice.His gift came unexpectedly, giving him a purpose in an otherwise empty existence... but that wasn't all it brought. Darkness has fallen on the town of Moss, Colorado, and it's up to Chris to find a way to challenge it, before it destroys everything he holds dear.",
