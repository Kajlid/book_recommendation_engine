  "description": "Ages ago, in a mysterious event known as the Fall of Rainbow, the world lost all color. And now, a weak silver sun shines over a monochrome realm of infinite shades of gray....In Tronaelend-Lis, glorious and decadent City of Dreams, of guilds and gods, courtesans and assassins, the Regent and Regentrix, sister and brother, rule a court of elegant debauchery, perverse desires, and secrets.And into this wanton place comes Ranhéas Ylir, an eccentric and androgynous warrior woman, sworn to serve the mysterious Lord Elasand Vaeste, a man of impossible beauty, tormented by occult dreams and an unrequited love for a goddess.Soon, loyal Ranhé is willing to fight for this one man unto death...Meanwhile, another is willing to die for her.But time is short for them all—out of the world's twilight rises a being of utter darkness, the one absolute source of black, whose armies approach, in an epic invasion, to claim forest and wilderness.The only thing that stands between the darkness and the City of Dreams is an antique secret—a flicker of ancient memory of those who had once filled the world with an impossible thing called color...",
