  "title": "Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe",
  "description": "How did a single \"genesis event\" create billions of galaxies, black holes, stars and planets? How did atoms assemble -- here on earth, and perhaps on other worlds -- into living beings intricate enough to ponder their origins? What fundamental laws govern our universe?This book describes new discoveries and offers remarkable insights into these fundamental questions. There are deep connections between stars and atoms, between the cosmos and the microworld. Just six numbers, imprinted in the \"big bang,\" determine the essential features of our entire physical world. Moreover, cosmic evolution is astonishingly sensitive to the values of these numbers. If any one of them were \"untuned,\" there could be no stars and no life. This realization offers a radically new perspective on our universe, our place in it, and the nature of physical laws.",
