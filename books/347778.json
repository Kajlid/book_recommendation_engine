  "description": "'Hill is an instinctive and complete novelist who is blessed with a spontaneous storytelling gift' Frances Fyfield, Mail on Sunday If you've already met Dalziel and Pascoe, you're in for a treat. If you haven't yet had the pleasure, you're in for a revelation! Here in four stories we track their partnership from curtain-up to last act; from the mean streets of Mid-Yorkshire to the mountains of the moon. The Last National Service Man reveals the truth, hitherto buried in police files, of their momentous first encounter, while Pascoe's Ghost is a chilling tale taking us deep into Poe country. Dalziel's Ghost, meanwhile, finds the man who normally wouldn't be seen dead in a graveyard expressing a surprising interest in the 'other side'. And finally, One Small Step takes a giant leap forward to 2010 and the first murder on the moon.",
