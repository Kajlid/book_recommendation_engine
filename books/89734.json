  "description": "One woman. Two men. And a passionate hunger too long denied. It's Gabriel Harrison's thirty-fifth birthday. His quiet night at home, spent alone with a glass of Scotch and a novel, is about to be shattered. Gabriel's best friend, Jonah, comes knocking at his door, bearing a present unlike any other, a blindfolded Denny Abbott, the lush little assistant Gabe can't get out of his mind. He aches for her with a primitive, physical lust and tearing emotional hunger that eats at his soul, and yet, he will not touch her. He will not reach out for the one thing in the world he wants above all others. For Gabriel has a secret, one he believes makes him unworthy of the \"sexy sweet\" Denny. What Gabe doesn't know is that the gentle Denny has a backbone of steel and the sheer determination of a woman in love. With Jonah leading the way, the three embark on a provocative, sensual assault to shatter that infuriating wall of ice surrounding Gabriel's heart. Before the night ends, Denny is determined to melt his resistance and make the \"Ice Man\" burn.",
