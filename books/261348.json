  "title": "The Dark Swallows: A Novel of the Spanish Civil War",
  "description": "The Dark Swallows begins in the period just before the Spanish Civil War and ends 25 years after it and is a small jewel of characterization and story development. All the people are flesh and blood. One lives through the horror of war with the young lovers, Elvira and Bernardo, in the helplessness of their situation. Manâ€™s capacity for selfishness and cruelty is movingly depicted, first in small ways and then in the sweeping flood of war, in which cruelty and betrayal are rampant. The portrayal of the two small, feuding Spanish villages, in their remoteness and isolation, is like a sombre painting relieved only by flashes of colour which are the three days of celebration during the year. This is a powerful account of the involvement of the small and innocent in the destruction of war.",
