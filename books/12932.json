  "description": "With luminous artwork full of elaborate detail, the acclaimed Jane Ray brings new life to a classic holiday song.In this lushly illustrated interpretation of the familiar Christmas carol, each spread offers surprises for the eye as nostalgic city scenes depict a multiethnic cast of characters bustling with packages and sprucing up their homes for the holidays. But at one home in particular, an endless succession of gifts keeps arriving: birds of all stripes, ladies dancing aboard a brightly bedecked boat, lords leaping on rooftops, and pipers piping up and down stairs. Filled with intricate patterns and whimsical flourishes, Jane Rayâ€™s gorgeous artwork is the perfect match for this wonderfully cumulative tale.",
