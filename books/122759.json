  "description": "Kelly Turnbull is back in his eighth People’s Republic adventure, and this time everything is on the line for him and for Red America. A rogue general who wants Kelly in a grave has escaped into Blue America to execute a treacherous plan that will get him the revenge and the power he seeks. But Kelly Turnbull – and his loyal dog Gibson – are coming for payback, and they are bringing hellfire (and a lot of guns) with them.From the jungles of West Africa to post-Second British Civil War London, from a desperate fight on a New Orleans causeway to riding the Underground Railroad backwards into the People’s Republic, and through a bloody rescue mission during a full-scale invasion of the island of Manhattan, Overlord delivers the action and the humor that People’s Republic readers demand.",
