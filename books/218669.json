  "title": "100 Days in the Life of Rutherford Hayes",
  "description": "The greatest tragedy in all of American historical biography is that President Rutherford Hayes has been thrown in the trash. Ignored-or worse-dismissed as an average president, Hayes has, since he left office in 1881, become one of the least regarded presidents in United States history. It is time for the tide to turn. He was not flashy. He was not loud. He did not beat his chest and demand attention. He was a man who has received little if any of the recognition to which he is entitled. In this consolidated biography, presidential enthusiast Eric Ebinger selects 100 days in the life of Hayes which, he believes, best represent Hayes' character. Employing the dramatic and revealing Hayes diary, Ebinger walks the reader through a remarkable, passionate, and ultimately, noble life. One thing is guaranteed--Rutherford B. Hayes does not disappoint.",
