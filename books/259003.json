  "description": "Our fears creep in at the most unexpected times. Inspired by these fears and our mind's own curiosity, 20 tales of terror take readers on a voyage into the world of several unfortunate characters. Utilizing dark humor and the macabre, readers will relate to the character's plight while wincing throughout. From tales of haunted houses to serial killers to deranged demons that attack, The Spirit of Glassboro and Other Tales of Terror is filled with a variety of topics sure to please any thrill junkie. The characters are so real that when you're reading this book alone on a dark, cold evening, you'll second guess that chill on the back of your neck. While driving on the highway, you'll wonder what's in the back seat of the pick-up truck or really hidden behind the darkened windows of the unmarked van. Spooky and delightful at the same time, this book provides a welcoming dose of Halloween no matter what time of the year it is.",
