  "description": "\"You must remember, Aussie, there is only one thing a child owes its parent ... nothing. A child does not owe a parent respect. A child does not owe a parent gratitude. These are gifts the child chooses to give. But only if the parent deserves them.\" NELSON MANDELA WAVEMAN is the true story of a modern-day 'ronin', the Japanese word for masterless samurai. Literally translated a ronin is a 'wave man' - a soldier tossed by the waves of fortune.Robert Redenbach takes us on an extraordinary journey from a small town in country Victoria through the jungles of Malaysia, the townships of South Africa and Baghdad's Red Zone. Along the way he brushes up against Nelson Mandela, the FBI and an assortment of larger-than-life characters.",
