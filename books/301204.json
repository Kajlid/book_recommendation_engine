  "description": "Jonathan Blake had an appointment with an unknown man near midnight in a disused railway station - but nobody came to meet him. After a long wait, a woman appeared with the unusual excuse that her train had broken down and she had come to catch a relief train. But no passenger trains had run on the line for years. Then, the station began to thunder with the sound of trains and shots from pistols, rifles and machine guns, though it seemed nobody knew who was shooting at whom or why.",
