  "title": "Bullies & Drugs",
  "description": "Drugs are being sold and used around small children or at schools across the US.  Reasonable people, adults or even youth feel betrayed when the business of drugs endangers children or safe places like schools.  And, yet, every day our news outlets inform us that the problem is more prevalent and occurring in our back yards. How do we expect students to react when classmates bring these dangerous items into their lives? Are their lives endangered by trying to protect other students or children?  Administrators feel like failures when they determine that otherwise good students are using drugs or selling them. There is a reluctance to purge the students because it does not seem to eliminate the demand and ruins the lives of those removed from the school.  Drew Leighton, a high school sophomore, who was born male and experienced a case of gynecomastia which resulted in real breasts which do not seem to be going away. He is under a doctor’s care now and is attending school as a female student with a doctor’s note explaining that he is transgendered in his pocket. No one at the school is aware of Drew’s true gender except for his friend Lacy. Drew is trying to understand his body and his sexuality in different ways than all the other high school students around him.  Together, Drew and Lacy have encountered a number of cases of bullying.  In this book, the drug users and sellers are the focus. They bully people to keep quiet and manipulate situations and people.  Drew and Lacy are more worried about others who might get hurt.  While this book can be read as a standalone, it is the fourth book in the Drew Leighton series.  Thank you for reading on Daring Diane",
