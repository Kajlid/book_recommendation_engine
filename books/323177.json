  "title": "Go Forward With Faith: The Biography of Gordon B. Hinckley",
  "description": "President Hinckley made his own time available for interviews and feedback and allowed Sheri to interview his family, personal friends, and colleagues, including both of his counselors in the First Presidency and each member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He also made available personal writings, including talks, records, and journals, as well as personal and family photographs. Sheri Dew has traveled extensively in the process of preparing this biography, including making a trip to the British Isles and Asia for the dedication of the Hong Kong Temple. Go Forward With Faith shares a behind-the-scenes look at a spiritual leader who has spent a great deal of time in the forefront. Readers will soon learn that the tremendous service rendered publicly by President Hinckley is only a small part of his life story - a story filled with work, humor, dedication, and testimony.",
