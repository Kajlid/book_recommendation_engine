When lifelong friends Ginger and Susan took their first bellydance class on a dare, they never dreamed they'd end up performing in public--let alone getting mixed up in murder! Now a famous dancer has been stabbed to death with her own sword, and the police believe a good friend of theirs is guilty of the crime.
