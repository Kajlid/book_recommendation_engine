  "title": "Approaching Zion",
  "description": "Approaching Zion is LDS scholar and social critic Hugh Nibley's most popular book. More accessible than many of his scholarly works, it is replete with Nibley's trademark humor and startling insights into history, religion and life. Well known and beloved in its text form, most of the essays in this book were originally delivered as speeches. This audio version, read by the author's son, Thomas Hugh Nibley, evokes the original delivery of Hugh Nibley the speaker with his slashing wit, profound scholarship, and burning faith. In Approaching Zion, Hugh Nibley gives thinkers reason to believe, and believers something to think about.",
