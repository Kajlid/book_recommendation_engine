  "title": "Ladybug and Caterpillar: The Way to Friendship",
  "description": "When a lonely caterpillar asks to be friends with a ladybug, he is upset when she answers that he is too ugly to be her friend. Soon after that he turns into a gorgeous butterfly and Ladybug, not realizing it is the same insect, wants to be his friend. Ladybug is surprised and ashamed when she realizes her actions. She apologizes and they are both happy to be friends. The lesson here is that choosing a friend based on his appearance is not the right way to finding true friendship. Beauty also comes from kindness and goodwill are not visible on the outside, but the beauty of the heart is what really counts.",
