  "title": "Collected Poems of Sara Teasdale",
  "description": "Teasdale's work has always been characterized by its simplicity and clarity, her use of classical forms, and her passionate and romantic subject matter. In 1918, she won the Columbia University Poetry Society Prize (which became the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry) and the Poetry Society of America Prize for Love Songs. She later committed suicide. Collected Poems is an anthology of lyric poems which spans Teasdale's career and expresses her concerns with unfulfilled love and an ineffable longing for the unknown.",
