  "description": "NiceJacques Bertrand Kirstie Fox was all I ever asked and wished for in a woman. The Australian spitfire was sexy, independent and artistically gifted. She was everything… I shouldn’t be yearning for because she was my cousin’s girlfriend. Still, I fell for her. Hard. For years, I loved her from afar, not uttering a word about it. I came to terms with my unrequited love. She wasn’t mine to have… but when an opportunity presented itself, I couldn’t resist temptation. That one drunken night changed it all.",
