  "description": "Rolf Geiger leads a charmed life. Handsome and charismatic, he has seen his awesome talents as a piano virtuoso rewarded with worldwide fame, fabulous wealth and the love of a woman he adores.  But Rolf is about to learn that genius has an enormous price. Poised to embark on a stunning world tour, he is slowly and savagely tormented by the spirit of his recently deceased mentor, Isador Rabinowitz. From far beyond the grave, Rabinowitz's spirit returns to torment Rolf day and night, filling him with a paralyzing fear unlike any he has previously known. Rolf descends into a mental hell that is too terrifying to imagine.  Now, prompted by a ghost, dark impulses rise up in Rolf. He must fight for his sanity, his humanity and his very soul. He is locked in a horrific dance of death with his dark angel, a spirit that commands him to pay one final price for greatness --- to murder the woman he loves.  “Noel Hynd is one of the few authors that have succeeded showing us what we sense in the deepest reaches of our minds. He is a master because he is willing to go where we don’t want to go in regards to the supernatural.”  —Tobe Hooper, Director of Poltergeist, Salem’s Lot and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",
