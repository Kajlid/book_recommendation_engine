  "description": "It was bad enough working a dead-end tech support job, but for Catherine Sharp, the real hell is being owned by Eris, the Greek Goddess of Discord. Since that fateful day almost 10 years ago, Cat has performed random tasks--most of them quasi-legal--for the goddess in her free time in hopes that she'll earn her soul back. When Coyote, the Native American trickster himself, claims to have won her own soul in Mayhem’s weekly poker game, Cat decides to get in on the action. With five sneaky gods upping the ante, Cat will need to find a way to collect the winning chips that could save her soul.Marius, a snarky satyr with his own debt to Eris, might finally come in handy for something. If they play their cards right and work together, Cat and Marius may just get their freedom back. Assuming they don’t kill each other first.",
