Multiculturalism, praised by many contemporaries, has become an absolute and indomitable force in a future where a tyrannical regime hands down the ultimate penalty to anyone accused of politically incorrect actions or attitudes.Liam Eustace is a lonely corporate nobody struggling to get by day-to-day in a world that rejects him. But when he's mistakenly identified as a seditious military rogue he becomes swept up in a maelstrom of danger, deception and intrigue. Suddenly, Liam finds himself among a motley crew of rebels and patriots, not knowing whom to trust, and in possession of secret information that could bring down the most powerful man in the nation. He's scared, desperate and running for his life in a utopia that's more Hell than Heaven.",
