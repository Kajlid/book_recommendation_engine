But the crossing may well prove the least of their worries. For though the eastern continent appears to be a haven of stability and prosperity, this image of paradise masks an underlying corruption that threatens the very essence of the human spirit. And the three are soon forced to flee south into realms long since abandoned to the dark fae and its creatures.Lost in a land where those who offer hope of salvation may prove to be the true masters of treachery, and steadily drawn towards a rendezvous which may rob them of that which is even more precious than life, will Damien, Tarrant, and Hesseth find their own fragile alliance shattered by a power out to possess or destroy all of humankind?",
