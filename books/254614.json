  "description": "A siren who's terrified of the ocean...with a destiny that involves a hunky shirtless dude.  Ever meet a mermaid terrified of the ocean? The closest I get to saltwater is in my bath.  As for singing? My siren heritage left me with a killer voice. Literally. Some people can charm animals out of trees. Me? They jump to their deaths rather than listen to another note.  I know I’m different. And I’m cool with it. What I’m not cool with is the meathead who decides that he’s my fated mate. Just because he’s tall, handsome, and muscle-bound doesn’t mean I’m going to fall into bed with him. We might do it standing upright first.  Don’t judge. I deserve a little fun, especially since I think my time on Earth is limited.  The nightmares are getting stronger. The mood swings nastier. The ocean is calling, but I don’t think it wants to give me a gentle embrace.  Can a misfit who doesn’t belong anywhere find a way to survive the future—and maybe even fall in love?",
