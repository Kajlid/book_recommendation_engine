  "description": "Things are not well in the kingdom... While Skeeve and Aahz are preoccupied with the aftermath of Gleep's shooting, the M.Y.T.H. Inc. crew faces its biggest challenge yet-not one, but multiple challenges to the king and his court sorcerer! Word on the street is that the kingdom is under the control of a mighty sorcerer. It's obvious that this magician dabbles in the black He consorts with demons. He has a dragon for a pet. He's connected to the criminal underground, trading political influence for their assistance in keeping the populace under control. And for most citizens, all this could be overlooked, except that this villain has committed the greatest crime he's raised taxes! Clearly something has to be done! The citizens are beginning to ponder and mutter, both individually and in groups, about how this tyrant can be brought down. And while they vary greatly in skill and intelligence, certainly the sheer volume of them virtually ensures the eventual downfall of the scoundrel that's currently growing fat off the kingdom...the man called Skeeve the Great. Can the M.Y.T.H. Inc. gang protect Skeeve from these attacks and still convince him that everything is business as usual? **New!** In a last-minute change in plans, Something M.Y.T.H. Inc. will now also include a brand new short story by Robert Asprin and Jody Lynn Nye! <!-- ul.linkBullets { 0; } ul.linkBullets li { none; 1em; 1em; } ul.noteBullets { 0; } ul.noteBullets li { none; } span.darkRedWarning { #990000; } -->",
