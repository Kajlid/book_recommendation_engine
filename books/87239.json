  "description": "When David Palmer graduated from high school, married his high school sweetheart, and enrolled in the University of Chicago with enough college credit to be a junior, he was well on his way to live the rest of his life in normalcy. Settling down, having three children, and earning a middle-class household income were all the adventure David wanted. In the wrong place at the wrong time, David becomes captive to a tragedy that steals any hope that he will lead a normal or quiet life. A victim of the latest public massacre, David is left in a coma for ten months, only to wake and find that the shooting has taken more from him than he imagined possible while leaving him with an epileptic disability.With everything taken from him, David resigns himself to a life with no purpose. At least, that is how he planned to live until he finds that, in place of what he has lost, he has been given a new gift â€“ an extraordinary gift that provides him with visions of the future and compels him to pursue justice against those who altered his life. The Triangle is the first book in The Visions of David Palmer series.",
