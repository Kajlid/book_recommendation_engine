  "title": "Nobles: The Musical",
  "description": "Featuring songs such as perennial non-favourites “When Will My Landlady Die?” and “They’re Buy Two Get One Free,” the much maligned The Musical was performed twice, at St. Peter’s Community Church in Cliftonville, before the offending theatre troupe was run out of town.A select few saw the show, mainly local critics, perverts and homeless people given free tickets. Those who could bring themselves to recall the experience spoke of the show as being “the worst thing they had ever witnessed,” “a travesty” and “perhaps the end of musical theatre as an art-form.”The show follows the misadventures of a group of friends in Margate, unified by a dedication to work-avoidance, as they congregate at a seafront arcade to navigate such challenges as the Job Centre, CV writing workshops and coffee promotions, and to sing about them.The book and lyrics are presented here for those curious as to how low musical theatre can go, for the first and the last time. The Musical.",
