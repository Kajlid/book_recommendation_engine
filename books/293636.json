  "description": "Do you ever think about your body and how it all works? Like really properly think about it? The human body is extraordinary and fascinating and, well... pretty weird. Yours is weird, mine is weird, your maths teacher's is even weirder.This book is going to tell you what's actually going on in there, and answer the really important questions, like:Are bogies safe to eat? Look, if your nose is going to all that effort of creating a snack, the least we can do is check out its nutritional value. (Yes, they're safe. Chew away!)and...How much of your life will you spend on the toilet? About a year - so bring a good book. (I recommend this one.)So sit back, relax, put on some rubber gloves, and let a doctor take you on a poo (and puke) filled tour of your insides. Welcome to Kay's Anatomy*.*a fancy word for your body. See, you're learning already.",
