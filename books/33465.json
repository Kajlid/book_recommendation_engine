This is the story of one man's emotional and psychological journey, in which he tries to make sense of the terror that has befallen him. For Carl was bitten by a vampire. He was left for dead, but that mercy did not happen. Instead he was propelled into a dark unknown, where unimaginable horrors force him to realise his sinister nature. Now, he is determined to find the girl that destroyed his life so easily. He believes that only she can make sense of his destiny, and give him the answers he needs. But his quest is hindered by powerful reflections and the unwavering love of Sarah, a ballerina. That dominant emotion keeps him bound, it forces him to hear the echo's and bear witness to the life he left behind. Carl must find a balance within this time, without destroying his one true love, and his destruction can easily come about, if not from the modern world, then from another vampire. But loss is inevitable, and when",
