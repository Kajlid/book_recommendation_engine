He’d vowed never to cover for his maintenance tech again, especially after he got tased and knocked out with a frying pan for his efforts.Izzy thought she was safe. She’d dyed her hair, changed her name, and moved 1,500 miles away. And still they’d found her.

Not only have they found her, but they will soon discover she has a daughter. Aka, leverage. She needs time to think. To plan. To figure out how to keep the sexy neanderthal quiet. But she has no idea how, short of murder. Can she win him over to her side? Or will he be just like all the others once he finds out what she is capable of?Michael has one chance to convince Izzy he doesn’t want to harm her or her daughter, but more than that, he wants to know who does. And why. And where he can find them. After all, how else is he going to make sure the two sprites who have wound their way into his heart are safe?",
