Milne’s four world-famous books for children, When We Were Very Young introduced Christopher Robin to innumerable friends and has probably been read more widely than any other book of verse for children published in our time. Now We Are Six followed, becoming a modern classic in its own right.For sheer delightfulness, the children’s rhymes of A.A. Milne are in a class by themselves with their charm, humor, understanding, and irresistible rhythms.",
