  "description": "Magick demands sacrifice, and as Gene Law is about to find out, so does family. For Eugene Law, one of West Florida's few active Magicians, the Sunshine State is a great place to raise a family. It’s got pleasant winters and plenty of opportunity—that is until an army of the damned rise up to ruin his little slice of heaven. It isn’t long before Gene finds himself neck deep in the Restless Dead, Hell Fleas, Minor Demons, and a daughter that’s a magnet for the dearly departed. Along with a less-than-helpful apprentice, our Magician will discover it’s going to take every ounce of Magick he’s got, and more than a little he doesn’t, for him to survive this one intact. When the darkness falls, will Gene find a way to save the ones he loves, or end up just another member the Dead Set?",
