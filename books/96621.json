Even her fortune cookies are shooting blanks. She can’t do it herself, but her Death-Wish is not in vain. Something hears her plea and means to derive purpose from her erasure: a man-made demon meant to save the world. She can’t return to the life she decided to leave and so takes the first step on a path darker than death.",
