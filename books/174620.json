  "title": "Help For The Haunted: A Decade of Vera Van Slyke Ghostly Mysteries",
  "description": "About the time when Houdini and Conan Doyle feuded over spiritualism, a journalist by the name of Vera Van Slyke attended and upended a séance led by Lida Prasilova.  The results of this fortuitous meeting would be the formation of a lifelong friendship centered upon the exploration and explanation of when ghosts are not real, but also when they are!  Vera and Lida’s many adventures are documented here, in this wonderful collection of stories that will bring about as many smiles as hairs standing upon the back of one’s neck.  Join Vera and Lida as they prowl lonely mansions, bustling theatres, and underground train tunnels to unravel that fine line between everyday life and the spirit world and provide HELP FOR THE HAUNTED.",
