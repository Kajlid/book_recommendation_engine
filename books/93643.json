  "title": "Voices From Kibuli Country",
  "description": "This collection results from the author’s experiences in Hamilton, Ontario, where he has a home, and his travels over several Caribbean islands and in the United States as a person of multiple locations and origins: Canadian, African and Ghanaian.The Hamilton poems also look at the experiences of immigrants, their disrupted lives and loves, their broken dreams. The history of Africa Village in Hamilton Mountain, now known as Concession Street Housing finds its way into these poems. The Caribbean poems, based on visits to St. Croix, St. Martin/St. Maarten, and The Commonwealth of Dominica, as a West African person, questions the poet’s assumptions within the historical realities of these islands.The poetry focuses on the present realities and how they are influenced by the past. The author’s visit to Athens, Ohio, enabled him to reflect on the Appalachian Mountains. Voices from Kibuli Country is profoundly inspired by the African experience both in the homeland and in the Americas, where many Ghanaians ended up.",
