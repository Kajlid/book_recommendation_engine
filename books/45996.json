  "description": "Published in 1997-2002, Warren Ellis and Darick Robertson’s TRANSMETROPOLITAN became famous for its foul-mouthed protagonist, Spider Jerusalem, and his “filthy assistants.” But it’s also a long-form comics masterpiece, a sci-fi comic that succeeded despite the odds, and an examination of journalism and politics -- and how they intersect, or fail to do so. This book explores all these topics and more, from multiple points of view. It also includes interviews with both Ellis and Robertson.From Sequart Organization. More info at http://sequart.org",
