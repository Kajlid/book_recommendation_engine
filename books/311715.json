  "description": "Death is cruel. It’s unforgiving and brutal. It robbed me of the life I wanted to live and stole what little hope I had for the future. I was supposed to be something great. I was supposed to have it all … But a single bullet changed everything. I always thought I'd go down fighting, but instead, I faded away while watching the overwhelming guilt tear through Carver faster than his bullet tore through me. Like I said—death is cruel. King. Cruz. Grayson. Carver. How am I supposed to leave this world knowing what mess I’ll be leaving behind? There’s a war brewing, and this time, it’s personal. I can’t die. Not yet. Luckily, a bitch like me doesn’t stay down for long. Boys of Winter is a Dark, Enemies to Lovers, Reverse Harem Romance. It contains explicit sexual content, graphic violence, and coarse language.",
