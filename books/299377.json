  "description": "She's got fangs and she knows how to use them. Alexandra Van Helsing wasn't expecting to walk in to work one day and see her boss laid out across the shop's counter like a prime selection of freshly dripping dinner, or for her dying boss to shove a magical ring in her hands with one order. Don't let Laos have it. When the murdering vampire takes her by surprise and steals a long sip of her own blood, Alex wakes up in the offices of FBUST confused, sore, and instantly attracted to the handsome vampire who saved her life.  Now it's a race against time as the vampire who's determined to get the ring back threatens her at every turn while Charles Le Roux, the lead hunter for the Federal Bureau of Unwanted Supernatural Threats, threatens to steal her heart. What's a girl to do besides besides bite back?",
