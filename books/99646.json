  "description": "There are ten rules to a summer fling.Rule one, if he doesn’t belong to the country club he doesn’t belong in your pants.Rule two, never say the L word, unless it’s loser and you’re kicking his butt to the curb.Rule three, no eating off each other’s plates. So that means if he was mine last summer, you will avoid him.Rule four, ho’s before bros. If I call shotgun you leave him the hell alone.Rule five, see rule four, don’t try to date my brother, or Aubrey’s or Claire’s or Rachel’s. I saw his junk when we were kids, I don’t want to hear your filthy summer sexcapades and imagine it’s him.Rule six, everything has an expiry date, from tan lotion to condoms to boys. We do not go to university this fall with the boy we let dry hump us at prom.Rule seven, condoms are your friend at the party but the pill is the bouncer. You need that at every party.Rule eight, we don’t pay for anything, ever. If I hear you went Dutch, you are out.Rule nine, there are two kinds of boys in this world. The kind you let take you out for dinner and then there are the ones you let take you in the backseat of their car. Try not to confuse them or get caught. If you get caught slumming you’re out.Rule ten, end it nicely on August 31st. This date is not an option or possibility, it’s firm and set.Some rules are made to be broken...Let the summer begin!!!",
