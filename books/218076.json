  "description": "Now in its second edition, It Crawled from the South is an encyclopedic, non-linear, mostly non-hagiographic book about those enigmatic guys from Athens, Georgia. Marcus Gray furnishes thumbnail sketches of each member, as well as chapters on the band's recording history, politics, album packaging, and regional accent. The author is also fearless enough to venture into the black hole of Michael Stipe's lyrics. He doesn't, to be sure, make sense of Stipe's associative rambles, and the singer himself lets Gray off the hook by confessing that \"three-quarters of my lyrics probably come from overheard conversations. I steal a lot, basically. Someone will say something really interesting, and I'll write it down.\" Okay. But we'd still like to know what a moral kiosk is.",
