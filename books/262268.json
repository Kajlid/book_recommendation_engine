  "description": "Flying on fairy wings, befriending a dragon, and being the captain of a pirate ship are just some of the adventures one little girl and her puppy discover as they climb into the pages of a fairy tale. Is the best part of their story swimming with mermaids? Enjoying a cup of tea with Snow White? Flying a hot air balloon? Or is it something even more magical? Each enchanting moment of this delightful tale is told on top of a cake. With every character, creature, and castle sculpted out of sugar and frosting, this is truly the sweetest fairy tale ever created!",
