Honoured.But life is not what it seems...The island of Wánměi has a strict set of rules. Be a model Citizen and all will be rewarded. Disobey the law and the consequences are dire. For Selena, the urge to defy is in her blood. Out of boredom? Or something else? But she never knew just what penalty she'd have to pay for her latest stunt.Trent Masters is a Citizen, born and bred. The leader of a small group of revolutionaries desperately trying to free their beloved city of Wánměi. He knows a world exists beyond the island's borders. He knows a life exists without the heavy handed manipulation and tight fisted control of those in charge.What he didn't know was that an Elite would have more chance of challenging the Overseers who control Wánměi than a rebel ever could. And he certainly wasn't expecting her to capture his heart as stealthily as she moves under the darkness of a hot and humid night.Citizen versus Elite. The battle has begun.",
