  "description": "In these ten stories, Crisp takes us from the spectral purlieus of the ghost of a suicide, searching in vain for a mortal confidante (‘Troubled Joe’), to the future melancholy of a world in the early stages of human immortality, where a holographic environment is replacing the non-holographic (Karakasa), and through a variety of intimately portrayed worlds, both familiar and fantastical, to a final cri de coeur in the form of the novelette ‘Suicide Watch’, in which, against the background of the doomed present age, one suicidal loser attempts to save another.Contents1 Troubled Joe2 The Were-Sheep of Abercrave3 Ynys-y-Plag4 Karakasa5 A Cup of Tea6 Asking For It7 The Fox Wedding8 Mise en Abyme9 Italiannetto10 Suicide Watch",
