  "description": "Mark Miller’s One is a spiritual anthology examining True-Life experiences of Authors and their Faith. As the series evolves expect to discover what it means to have faith, no matter what that faith is and no matter where they live. Remember that we are all part of this One World.In the debut story, Miller shares his personal story of how he met his wife and the extra-ordinary circumstances that led to his long-lasting marriage and beautiful relationship.  About Mark A Kansas Native, Mark currently resides in Florida with his wife and four children. Since moving to Florida, he has pursued a lifelong aspiration of becoming a published author. He believes he has always been a writer and strived to follow in the footsteps of his namesake, Mark Twain.His education started early as his father was a newspaper writer, editor and photographer for both the Kansas City Star and Kansan. Formal development started in high school writing classes at Sumner Academy where he completed the International Baccalaureate program. Additional teaching came from both Kansas City Kansas Community College and the University of Kansas. It was at KU where he received his Bachelor’s Degree in Film. Informally, he was educated by the writings of C.S. Lewis, Lloyd Alexander and as he matured Stephen King and Tolkien. His interest in fantasy did not end on the page as some of his favorite movies include The Dark Crystal, Excalibur, Star Wars and Krull.Professional experience dates back to the 1990’s. Mark has co-written four screenplays, two of which were produced as ultra-low budget direct-to-DVD features by East of Hollywood Productions. Through his relationship with East of Hollywood, Mark also became co-creator of an educational and entertaining children’s program. The Kidz Klub Tree House used the talents of a local radio personality and a group of child actors to update classic fairytales and fables. Each of the episodes brought a twist to the familiar stories and conveyed a positive message. On his own, Mark has completed three other novels and a screenplay. The first two books of his Empyrical Tales have been published by Comfort Publishing, LLC out of North Carolina. Book The Fourth Queen and Book The Lost Queen are available now. Book The Secret Queen will be released in Spring 2012. He is currently lending his talents to a faith-based movie production company called Faith & Power Pictures, while working as a Teacher’s Assistant at a local elementary school.He believes being a father of four makes him uniquely qualified to write The Fourth Queen, the first of an eight story series that comes out of his world of Empyrean. He hopes his writing sends a positive message. And every day is an adventure with his children as they continue to teach him as well. His two young daughters unknowingly provided the models that helped create the main character sisters in The Fourth Queen. Many of their phrases and behaviors are shared with their fictional counterparts.Mark Miller is the author of The Empyrical Tales, available in paperback from Comfort Publishing. In addition to One with Trestle Press, Miller has participated in the Author’s Lab series. His turn with Giovanni Gelati, A Prince in Trenton, Seriously?, received high praise as a family-friendly story. Miller is also the author of Trestle’s upcoming release Daniel’s Lot. Daniel’s Lot is a novel adaptation of the faith-based movie of the same name starring Emmy Award winner Gary Burghoff (Radar on M*A*S*H).
