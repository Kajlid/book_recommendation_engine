Along with a handful of survivors, she finds refuge in the fiery city of Caldera alongside its Fire Valos inhabitants. But the sadistic experiments performed on her by the prison's scientist make the heat intolerable for her. When the opportunity to go to the frozen city of E’Lek presents itself, Kira believes she’ll finally find her new home.Duke is confused by the strange human female. Like him, she’s cold, made for the icy lands of the Northern Valos. Her resemblance with the Creators and questionable friendships raise their collective suspicions. Yet, only she can save their lost tribes condemned to an eternal slumber. As his heartstone warms for her, Duke is determined to prove to his people that despite appearances, Kira belongs with them… belongs with him.This can be read as a standalone, but Book 11, Inferno also has this character before she treks to the land of the Northern Valos.",
