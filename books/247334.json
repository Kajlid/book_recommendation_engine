  "description": "A troubled woman, a guilty conscience, and a mariachi band in jeopardy add up to Mariachi Meddler!Andy Veracruz is the leader of a band in Southern California, but when his boss goes out of town, the restaurant where he performs turns to chaos. Andy tries to avoid the boss’s flirtatious wife, but when Yiolanda is accused of murder, Andy isn’t sure whether to help her or to run the other way. Andy’s problem is that he is too observant. While he’s performing standard requests for songs such as “La bamba,” his attention wanders. The more Andy learns, the more havoc he gets himself into. He's a sleuth only by accident! He would rather spend afternoons working on new songs instead of following leads or trying to decipher Yiolanda. He goes to his lookalike brother for advice, but why is he too stubborn to listen?The light-hearted mystery is also a primer for those who are interested in learning some basics about mariachi music, a popular musical form that originated in Mexico but that has become increasingly common in the Southwest and across the U.S.",
