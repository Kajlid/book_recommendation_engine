  "description": "Nell MacInnes can spot a forgery from a mile away. After all, she learned from the best--her father is one of the art world's most notorious thieves. His brutal beating by the very authorities who claim to keep the world safe from harm taught her one more valuable lesson--trust no one.The last thing rugged Navy SEAL Dakota Smith needs on his mission is a tempting woman he doesn't trust. But a sketch by Leonardo da Vinci has gone missing, and the art conservator's skill in detecting forgery would be invaluable, if only her ties to the criminal world are as dead as she says they are.Soon an edgy partnership and white-hot attraction are forged between Nell and Dakota as they race to Draycott Abbey to track down a ruthless criminal with terrorist ties before time runs out--and the da Vinci is lost forever.",
