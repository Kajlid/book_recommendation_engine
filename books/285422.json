  "description": "\"Melanie Ting can always be counted on for laughs, sexy romance, and unusual heroes that you end up falling in love with.\" USAToday bestselling author, Kate Willoughby.   \"Every time I read a story by this author I’m impressed with her ability to combine exciting hockey with genuinely likeable characters.\" All About Romance   My Hallowe’en Heartbreak  It’s officially the worst Hallowe’en ever.  First, Sophia Ando gets a demotion at her big law firm. Then she discovers her boyfriend making out with another woman at a Hallowe’en party. The cherry on top of her disastrous evening is that her rideshare home is driven by Henry MacDonald—her childhood friend and secret crush. Dejected and dressed as a goofy anime character was not the look she wanted when she saw Henry again.  Henry MacDonald isn’t thrilled to see Sophia either. He’s just quit the indie rock band he spent the last decade with. He’s turning thirty, has zero career prospects, and worst of all—he’s lost the spark that inspired his music. Being her chauffeur won’t impress the most accomplished person he knows—even if she is dressed as a rain-soaked Pikachu.  As a distraction from her disastrous life, Sophia decides to make Henry her next helping him find work, a recreational hockey team, and even a girlfriend. The only problem is that Henry prefers the matchmaker to the matches.  My Hallowe'en Heartbreak is the second book in the Holiday Hat Trick trilogy. The first book is  My Viral Valentine. These romcoms feature three close girlfriends, crazy hijinks in the pursuit of love, and beer league hockey—all set in the wintry capital city of Ottawa. Each story is set around a holiday.",
