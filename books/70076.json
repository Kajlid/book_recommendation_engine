  "description": "Wendell Parkens is privileged and more than a little naïve. He’s refined, a man of means, an unfaithful husband and uncaring father; he’s a businessman, an accomplished liar and a killer. He lives in a world left to him by a father he despises, a world on the brink of war that is neither of his doing nor of his choosing, a world which he must soon depart if he is to escape a German’s misspent bullet or the hangman’s knot",
