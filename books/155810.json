  "description": "Kellie JOYce suffered unspeakable terror at the hands of her father. Youthful years lost, scarred by abuse, poverty, alcoholism and neglect. Fearing her siblings would meet a similar fate, at fifteen, Kellie reported her father to authorities and stood alone in Supreme Court of Newfoundland, Canada, to testify against him. The aftermath was severe PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). As a way to cope she lost the ability to visualize images in her mind. However, Kellie's ordeal with mental illness was only just beginning... This book advocates change in the way that we, as a society, continue to shun and stigmatize mental illness. For Kellie, that process of change started from within. Now, through the lens of her own experience, Kellie shares her journey with the world. The Wait is based on her life story, one of redemption and inner strength. \"You are not alone,\" she says to all who have been neglected by the short comings of our social systems. Her fight for fairness and justice will prove to be an inspiration to all. A poignant story that will touch your heart... For Kellie, 'the wait' is over. Excerpt from Dale Curd's Foreward: \"Reading this book will be a challenge for many and some I know will put it down thinking that it is too much too soon. I ask you who are struggling to reflect on the strength and courage of a young girl to endure, cope, confront and eventually process and heal tremendous pain. This is no extraordinary child-this is not an especially gifted or privileged individual rather, Kellie JOYce is a human being like you-a human being with a remarkable life story that has the power to reach inside you and touch what is precious inside everyone; our hope.\" - Dale Curd, Host, Life Story Project Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) Canada",
