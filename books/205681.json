  "title": "Roots and Wings",
  "description": "Welcome to Wynne, population 3,401.  No billionaires. No professional athletes. No celebrities.  In this small town, current events are pondered in mirrors at the local salon or around crowded tables at the diner, and there’s a new couple to gossip about. A rough and tumble woman who works in her dad’s garage, not yet ready to spread her wings, shows the new guy in town what it’s like to finally have roots.  It’s your run-of-the-mill, sexy, Astro van driving dentist meets smart-ass, bass fishing tomboy in a story of real-life romance.  Low on drama. High on love.  Pull up a chair and stay a while.",
