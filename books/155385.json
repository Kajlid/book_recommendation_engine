  "description": "Finally, the historic groundbreaking Guy Instructional Manual, breaking the ground as we speak, featuring a bonus, low cost, low calorie (but maybe not better) alternative to the upcoming X-Rated College Girl Cookbook, plus, free of charge, the unreadable \"How to be a Best Man\" and the shocking and forgettable, \"Guys Who Knit.\" Contains no information on how to rotate your tires. Also, (there's more?) an incredible short dissertation on the meaning of life, as if you had nothing better to do than think about THAT!",
