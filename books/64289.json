  "description": "The bird king. The heart bell. A mechanical penguin.And a portrait of the artist as a (very) young man.What do they all have in common?Nothing! Except that they all inhabit the unique world of Shaun Tan. Collected here for the first time are the fascinating beginnings of stories yet to come, illustrations for books and films, drawings from life, and creative doodles from working sketchbooks. Together with commentary they offer a special insight into the imagination of one of our most celebrated contemporary storytellers, the internationally acclaimed creator of The Arrival, Tales from Outer Suburbia, and Lost and Found: Three by Shaun Tan. A must for budding artists and authors everywhere, and those who appreciate art.",
