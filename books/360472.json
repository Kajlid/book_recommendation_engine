  "title": "Shut Up About...Your Perfect Kid!",
  "description": "From trips to self-centered therapists, to mothers experimenting with Ritalin, to the harsh reality of school calls (no good can come from them), Shut Up About . . Your Perfect Kid! bravely ventures where other books haven't, featuring humorous, heartwarming stories from a wide range of parents of \"imperfect\" children. Narrated by two \"imperfect\" sisters and mothers of children with Asperger's syndrome and bipolar disorder, the book features a compilation of stories that demonstrate the sheer humor and absurdity of raising imperfect children in a perfection-preoccupied world. It will have virtually any parent laughing out loud and appreciating the gifts and beauty that every child has to offer (yes, even imperfect ones).",
