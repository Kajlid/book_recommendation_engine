  "description": "Multicultural Shape-shifter ParanormalAmanda Jo Spoils needed some major alone time. She was tired of Pride life and the pampered, self-indulgent attitude of its male members. To think that she was expected to find a mate among the shallow pool of men, most of which had at least one possessive female already! She hadn’t spent four years in Special Forces and completed two tours in Iraq to come home and cater to the wants of any man. No, Amanda had some serious thinking to do about her future, and the wilds of Alaska seemed to be just what the doctor ordered.But, boy, are the shifters restless in bear country! Not only has she fallen into the middle of a mystery surrounding an ancient artifact, but now she has not one, but two Alpha shifters determined to make her their mate. She can play them off against each other, but what happens when one wins? Amanda doesn't want a man, or a shifter, especially not a dominant one… But oh, how she secretly longs to be a submissive, the spoils of their Alpha war.Publisher’s This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations some readers may find Ménage (m/f/m).",
