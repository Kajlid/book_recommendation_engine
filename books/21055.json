From a ghost story that takes place at theheight of the Industrial Revolution, to a noir thriller of terrorism inthe early 21st century, to a tale of a future New York overwhelmed by alienrefugees, Specimen Days is a genrebending, haunting novel ofmetamorphosis. Acclaimed by critics and readers, this is a literary work ofaudacious power and beauty by one of the most original and daring authorswriting today.",
