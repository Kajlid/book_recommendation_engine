And now I am trapped—captured—between hell and him.  Heart.  DALE  Just when you think you have it all, it vanishes with one bullet. Her hands hold my baby. Her hands rule my world. Her hands brought everything crumbling down that night.  Forcing me to question her allegiances—who is she here for?  I will fight to protect us both. But I cannot save the girl who doesn’t want to be saved. We have been tested—time and again. But now, her hands belong to a monster of a girl I do not know.  The battle is on in the love affair of Mae East & Cyclone Blonde.",
