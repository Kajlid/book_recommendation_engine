  "title": "Dancing Otters and Clever Coyotes: Using Animal Energies, the Native American Way",
  "description": "In many Native American traditions, animals are considered to be our older, wiser brothers and sisters. Their behavior can teach us to better understand ourselves, heal old wounds, adapt to new situations, or warn us of dangers. Dancing Otters and Clever Coyotes shows us how to interpret our physical and spiritual encounters with animals in ways that enable us to achieve balance in the natural world.This colorfully illustrated, easy-to-reference book presents little known facts about the habits of fifty-eight North American animals, including their strengths and vulnerabilities. By using these ancient animal energies, we are guided gently through life's challenges and obstacles. We may soar with the eagle and run with the wolves, yet even the earthworm has something to teach us.Gary and Sherry share what they've learned from Native American elders and from their own personal journeys to remind readers of the inherent bond that humans have with all things in nature.",
