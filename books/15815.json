  "title": "The Lives of Rachel",
  "description": "A sequel to the \nBooks of Rachel\n that follows five more Rachels through earlier turbulent times in history.  Each part takes place in a different era. Namely Judea, 168 B.C., Rome, 63 B.C., London, 488 B.C., the Byzantium empire in 756, and Mainz during the year 1096. Each Rachel is unique and has a different story to share; yet similar in her nobility, strength, spirit of conviction, perseverance, courage, beauty and in being either gifted in healing or in the possession of second sight. While excellent historical fiction, these tales are drawn from real historical events transporting the reader using vivid detail into the era of each story.",
