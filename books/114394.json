  "title": "The Exchange Student",
  "description": "She was from a back woods village in Russia. The exchange program she entered was supposed to send her to a family in America, where she'd make a new girlfriend, and study at an American school. But there were bureaucracies involved, and that means there's always room for error. And boy, howdy, was there ever an error. Through a clerical error she finds herself in a family with a boy instead of a girl. But she remembered the last words of advice she got from her \"Do whatever they tell you. Their customs are different than ours.\" So that's just what she did.",
