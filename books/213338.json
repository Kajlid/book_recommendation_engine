  "description": "Trigger Warning:  THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION. Contained within the pages of this book are scenes that may make some readers uncomfortable. Scenes of sexual instances, both consensual and non consensual, blood, and intense violence are described in detail. Reader discretion is advised. In no way does the author condone such behavior.    There are three.  Each wear the mask of death and each have a reason to kill him. One he already has hidden in a place where no one will ever get to her. In a hell he created himself solely to destroy them.  There were two.  Each with the same face, same mind, same purpose in life. One died at a young age and the other hid the secret for as long as he could. But vengeance is near and there's nowhere to hide.  There is one.  Driven by madness; the evil that lurks within. He knows that the only way to survive those who wish to see him dead is to play the game as they would have it.  Rules were meant to be broken. Lives were meant to end. He was meant to be their prey, but the darkness has taken over and the only way to escape the past is to destroy their future.",
