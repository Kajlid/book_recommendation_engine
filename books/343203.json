  "title": "Pogo's Will Be That Was",
  "description": "Positively Pogo\" are comic strips from around 1954 first published in newspapers. This part starts with the start of the television media with various characters doing things to break into commercials and shows. The strip then meanders into a plan by Churchy (the turtle) to make money by making money. We have a long appearance by a non-regular character (in the form of a pig) which just happens to look like a certain Soviet leader of the time (part of Kelly's political humor). The book then ends with the Olympics in Australia.",
