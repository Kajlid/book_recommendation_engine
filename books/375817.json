  "description": "“A sweet read even a Wuthering Heights fan can love.” — Entertainment WeeklyYoung scholar Sara Frost’s unsuccessful search for the lost love letters of Charlotte Brontë hasn’t won her any favors at her university, particularly now that the glamorous and self-promoting Princess Diana expert, Claire Vigee, has introduced her media-savvy exploits to the staid halls of academia. But it’s not until Sara’s fiancé suddenly leaves her that she begins to question her life’s vocation.Sara’s jolt brings her to an unusual new world, one populated by a cheerfully amoral Frenchman, a pair of New York eccentrics who pretend to live in the nineteenth century, a lapsed methadone addict and screenwriter, and a Hollywood producer who mistakenly assumes that the short, sad life of Charlotte Brontë has the makings of the next “feel good” movie blockbuster.The Brontë Project is an irreverent and comic look at love, loss, literature, and pop culture, and a guide to reconciling the mythology of romance with the reality of modern love.A Redbook Magazine Book Club PickLook for the reader’s group guide at the back of this book.",
