  "description": "If home is where the heart is, where do you go when your heart is torn in two? When Charity Bright intercepts a Christmas card, she’s astonished to discover a secret: she is not the sole surviving woman in her Old Order Amish family. Once, her father had a sister—a shunned aunt Charity never knew she had.  Charity and her friend, Daniel, venture out to Manhattan on a purposed Rumspringa, in an effort to bring Charity’s Aunt Hope back to the fold by Christmas Eve. They’ll have just three weeks in New York City with Hope, and Leanne, a pregnant runaway they find under Hope’s wing.  The English world has its allures, but none proves more powerful than the developing bonds of love between Charity and her Aunt Hope, threatening Charity’s blossoming romance with Daniel, and compelling both women to decide which place to call home. From the author of bestselling novel ‘Merry's Christmas: a love story’ comes this pure, redeeming romance. Have you ever had to choose between those you love? How do you come to terms with your faith when loved ones differ in ways that tear them apart? Will she be able to continue shunning her Aunt Hope or risk being shunned herself? That is the road Charity travels in this heartrending coming of age adventure across the Advent season, leading up to Christmas.  Will Charity make peace with a choice that could jeopardize all she holds dear, including her heart’s desire of becoming an Amish bride? Will she return home for Christmas or will she embark upon an entirely new life? 'Redeeming Romance' is an anthology series, a variety of clean, inspirational novels adapted from Susan Rohrer's original movie scripts.",
