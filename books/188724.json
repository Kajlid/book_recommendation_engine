  "description": "One kiss from the boss is all it takes! When producer Ryan Jackson kisses a beautiful stranger to save her from a lecherous investor, he doesn't know she's his newest employee…or that she's also his best friend's little sister all grown up. Now the only way to save his business deal is a scorching, hands-on, make-believe affair with the one woman who is absolutely off-limits. So why is he thinking more about seducing Jaci Brookes-Lyon than toeing the corporate line? When sexual ruse becomes reality, can faking it save his business and lead to love?",
