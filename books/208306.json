  "title": "Marx Engels Lenin Trotsky: GENOCIDE QUOTES: The Hidden History of Communism's Founding Tyrants, in their Own Words",
  "description": "Stalin and Mao were butchers, Marxists admit... \"But Stalin and Mao betrayed the original Communism of Marx and Engels!\" \"Lenin freed the Russian People and if Trotsky had won the power struggle with Stalin, things would have gone differently!\" So say the Marxists. But a dispassionate examination of the lesser-known writings of Communism's founding tyrants, things they wrote in books, articles, letters, documents, briefs and telegrams, indicate this benign view simply isn't true. Comrades Marx & Engels advocated war, slavery, racism, ethnic hatreds & genocide. They mocked justice, freedom, democracy & equality, and had only contempt for the poor, workers, farmers & moderates. Comrades Lenin & Trotsky put Marx & Engels into practice, instituting a reign of terror, assassinations, slavery, mass-murder & genocide. They promised democracy but usurped it & imprisoned or murdered dissenters, opponents & \"counter-revolutionaries.\" They seized food from starving farmers, executed surrendered & wounded soldiers, along with random prostitutes, alcoholics, factory workers, tradesmen, peasants, villagers & ethnicities, with massive deportations of men, women and children to the Siberian Gulag - a prison system begun by Lenin, not Stalin. In this exacting review by historical scientist James DeMeo, PhD, the Hidden History of Communism's Founding Tyrants is exposed, in their Own Words. \"Marx Engels Lenin Trotsky: Genocide Quotes\" is a must-read book for every thoughtful student and adult, about the false \"peace-justice\" agendas of the Marxist movements which once again threaten the world's democracies.",
