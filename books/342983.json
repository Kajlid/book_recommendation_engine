  "description": "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of it is the gift of God (Ephesians 2:8).The \"prince of preachers,\" Charles Haddon Spurgeon, led thousands of people to a saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. In this work, a revised and updated version of one of his best-selling classics, we learn the key to his success as an evangelistâ€”a total reliance on God's grace. Spurgeon shows us that salvation is totally of grace, by grace, and through grace, and he helps us see our absolute dependence on God for everything that really counts in life.Grace enables us to be what we could not be, to do what we could not do, and to receive what we could not receive on our own. Grace is the infinite love of God at work in our lives. He writes, \"Personally, I could never have overcome my own sinfulness. I tried and failed. My evil tendencies were too much for me until, in the belief that Christ died for me, I cast my guilty soul on Him.\" It was then that the amazing grace of God transformed his life.This faith-building and inspiring book will lead you to Christ, the One who has the power to bring change to your life and your circumstances and to provide you with the answers to all your needs. You will encounter God's grace on every page of this book, and His grace will lead you to cast all your care upon Him, as you realize that without Him you can accomplish nothing of eternal value.Spurgeon concludes his book with this \"Again I charge you, meet me in heaven,\" and, as you will soon learn, it is God's good grace that will enable you to do so.",
