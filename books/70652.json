  "description": "Her first year away from home at Catholic college has been a disaster for shy, awkward Emily, falling in with the wrong crowd, just trying to fit in with the other girls. When Father Mark, the campus psychologist, takes her under his wing, she’s more than grateful, and under his tutelage, Emily blossoms into ripe, luscious fruit, just ready to be plucked. By the time Father Mark realizes his mistake, it’s too late—Emily has fallen for him, and he for her. God help them both.",
