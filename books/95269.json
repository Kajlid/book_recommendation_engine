  "description": "He waited seven hundred years to find her. For what seemed an eternity, Julen endured a nightly punishment that never should have been his. Descended from a line of ancient warriors, he vowed not to become the creature his persecutors claimed he was - the creature they did their best to make him into. Now that he has found the healer who can end his nightly torment, the stirring she creates in his Agathyrsi blood threatens to bring more danger than redemption. She was sworn to destroy him. Sofia Evan, owner of Fortune's Cup coffeehouse, had been raised on family lore and responsibility passed down through generations on a rare parchment. She never believed the darkness and pain in its tales to be more than myth, never questioned the reasons for the gifts that set her apart from all the rest. Until one winter morning changes everything. Now the breathtaking man who haunts her waking hours is the very being whose curse she must put an end to - one way or another. \"If the following books [in the Quinguard Immortals Series] are as good as the first, it will be an excellent series and a must-have for those who believe in soulmates. I for one will never look at gargoyles in quite the same way again.\" Janet Davies Once Upon a Romance \"An extraordinary tale with memorable characters, a fresh premise and solid writing. Ms. Jones crafted a winner.\" Janalee Ruschhaupt Paranormal Romance Reviews \"A riveting tale of love, lust, hate and magic... a must-buy!\" Rosemarie Brungard Romance at Heart Magazine",
