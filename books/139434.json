  "description": "Tamsen Mack, a successful children’s author, discovers her husband’s reclusive uncle in his study with a letter opener in his neck. Scattered around the room are a set of clues he left a seventy year old photo, one page from his autobiography and over seventy yellowed newspapers from 1938 each dated April 1. An eerie quote from Edgar Alan Poe and a friend’s bloody shirt push Tamsen’s writer’s curiosity into over-drive. Aided by her friends and armed with sugar and caffeine, Tamsen plunges into the murder investigation. When she discovers a long forgotten crime her curiosity leads her to a connection between two chilling murders and the ties they have to her own circle of friends. When everyone has something to hide and someone to protect Tamsen wonders who among her friends she can really trust.",
