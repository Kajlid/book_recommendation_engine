  "description": "Gannon and Wyatt might make the discovery of a lifetime--if they can outlast danger in the land of the pharaohs! After winning a prestigious fellowship from the Youth Exploration Society, Gannon and Wyatt set off on a journey to Egypt. There they study with world-renowned archeologist Dr. Mohammed Aziz, joining him on a quest to find the long lost tomb of the Pharaoh Cleopatra, rumored to hold priceless treasures and secret scrolls containing answers to some of ancient Egypt's greatest mysteries. But Gannon and Wyatt aren't the only ones interested in Cleopatra's secrets. Ruthless tomb robbers are hot on their heels, and the brothers must brave venomous snakes, deadly booby traps, and ancient curses as they find themselves on the verge of a magnificent discovery that could rewrite history. In the tradition of the historic journals kept by explorers such as Lewis and Clark, Dr. David Livingstone, and Captain James Cook comes the adventure series Travels with Gannon & Wyatt. From Africa to the South Pacific, these twin brothers have traveled the world. You never know what they will encounter as they venture into the wild, but one things is certain--wherever Gannon and Wyatt go, adventure is their constant companion. You can find Gannon and Wyatt's blog, photographs, and video footage from their real-life expeditions at travelswithgannonandwyatt.com.",
