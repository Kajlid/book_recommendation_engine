  "description": "With over a hundred million viewers, Jack Barron is a media star of the highest celebrity―think Jerry Springer crossed with Ted Koppel―and his call-in talk show is the perfect platform for reform. But every man has his price, and when a cryogenics millionaire makes Jack an offer he can't refuse―immortality―anything can happen. Bug Jack Barron, Norman Spinrad’s fourth novel, was first published in 1969, and is commonly acknowledged to be the book that established Spinrad’s brilliant style and made his name. Its exploration of the timeless and universally relevant theme of big business corrupting democratic process, stands out now as an unforgettable and bitingly satirical work of imagination that remains as relevant as ever to today’s television and media obsessed culture.",
