  "description": "In real life, people make both good and bad decisions. Bad ones often cycle back to bite us when we least expect it. And sometimes people feel forced to make decisions contrary to their desires and beliefs. When Claudia Goodwin's father issues an edict--you'll marry David Van Buren so I can merge our two companies--naturally she balks. That's where the bad decisions begin, especially when she learns she's pregnant by David's brother. In a moment of panic, she gives up the baby for adoption, believing that, in 1954, it's best for him to grow up with two loving parents.Then she spends the next forty years searching for him, trying to undo her most horrific bad choice. The long, uphill road does finally level off. She lost much through the years, but gained even more--herself.",
