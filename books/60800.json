Adam’s eldest son, Matthew, has earned such an influential reputation that throughout England he is known as The White Lord of Wellesbourne.\nUpon the eve of the Battle of Bosworth field, Matthew finds himself forced into a contract marriage that he has been avoiding for ten years. He has no desire to wed the Lady Alixandrea Terrington St. Ave, but his father is insistent. The lady comes with a dowry of 400 fighting men, most important in these warring times. But a strange thing happens to Matthew the moment he meets his future bride; he is actually attracted to her. The Lady Alixandrea is surprisingly beautiful, intelligent, and kind.

In this world where the politics of rival men vying for the throne control the fortunes of a nation, The White Lord of Wellesbourne is torn between the unexpected life he never thought to have and the warring life that he’d always known to be.\n\n\nWill lovely Alixandrea win him or will King Richard?",
