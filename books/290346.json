  "description": "Dear People: I love you all, and desire you to be happy, not only in this world, but in the world to come. - Grace Gold  So many have good resolutions they intend to carry out sometime in the future, but how few are doing their best today. Many neglect present duties and spend their time building for the future castles without foundations. Dear ones I entreat you to attend to the duties of today, which if faithfully performed will make a foundation so strong no misfortune can sweep it away.  The author of this work does not claim they have discovered a new method whereby one can step from misery to happiness at a single bound, but the author does claim there are certain laws which govern our lives for good or evil as we will, and in a sense we make our own destiny.",
