  "description": "It had started with two words on a blank piece of paper with a phone number taped to a wall: Submission training. Once she called it, Meghan heard HIS voice. Deep and hypnotic, his resonant tones led her through a three-step application process. Now she's officially his student. But after performing a public act for him, and in the process setting free her inhibitions, she is no longer sure about who she really is and what she truly wants. The stakes are raised when she receives instructions for her next task. She must steal something naughty from an adult store following dirty but tantazing instructions. As she progresses down the dark path he commands, she discovers his true identity. But what surprises her the most is his ability to see into the hidden parts of her soul, pulling out her most secret desires... and releasing her into a world of pure joy.",
