  "description": "The sands of time never fall the same way twice.\n\nJessie thought he’d lost it all, but what if there was a chance to save Scarlet, however slim? There is a time machine in the subterranean levels of the Tower. The only problem is that it kills everyone that tries to use it. If he could figure out how to activate it without being turned into a gelatinous mass of quivering flesh, he could go back. He could fix things. Deep in the zombie-infested wastelands, hidden in a military base inside area 51, is the operator's manual. Going after it is suicide but it’s also the only shot he’s got. If he can find it and survive the jump, he might be able to save her life. He might be able to prevent the outbreak. He might even be able to save the world.\nIf you’re looking for a hair-raising thrill ride through hell itself, then look no further. Full of blood, guts, and carnage, this post-apocalyptic series will keep you on the edge until the very end. Get ready for tragedies in time.\n\nScroll up and grab your copy today!",
