  "description": "Necessity and Other Tales Odd people inextricably caught in odd situations, this collection of tales places the weight of individual choice and character on airy fate and circumstance. They are populated by the gullible, madmen, lonely women, fools, and heroic losers.The stories in this collection are written in the style and fanciful purpose of John Collier's \"Fancies and Goodnights\" and Thorne Smith's \"The Night Life of the Gods.\" Twisted romance, unrequited love, unbound mania, and the unexpected turns of fate are the relentless backdrop of these sorrowful tales told in breezy prose.",
