  "description": "Everybody likes to take a vacation now and then, and perhaps on the rarer occasion, people like to take an extra-special holiday. In the more likely case of the wealthy – and less frequently, the extremely lucky – this means a cruise off-world on one of those really fancy star-liners that go from one system to the next, picking up and dropping off glittering and excitedly chattering passengers along the way. ‘Paradise between the planets’, they call it. Most of the time, that’s how it is. But not this time. How could a holiday in space turn into a murder mystery involving vampires? Yes, you read that right. Vampires. On the last voyage of the Demeter – a deep space star-liner with the Red Star Line, passengers and crew got more than they bargained for. Way more.",
