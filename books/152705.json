  "description": "***PLEASE NOTE THIS NOVEL WAS RE-TITLED AND RE-BRANDED AS HIGHLAND RAVEN ***Something wicked this way comes . . . Gruoch is born to rule, but long before she becomes Macbeth’s queen, ancient forces claim her soul. Marked from birth by the old gods, Gruoch is initiated into the ancient religion of her ancestors and begins learning the mysteries of the Goddess Cerridwen. But not everything is as it seems. Soon the Battle Goddess Morrigu imposes her will, and Gruoch finds herself at the mercy of the Wyrd Sisters. With King Malcolm plotting, the Wyrd Sisters schooling her in arcane craft, and haunted by dreams of a raven-haired man she’s never met, Gruoch feels her fate is not her own. That is, until she meets a druid named Banquo. Gruoch’s heart is swept away when Banquo awakens something in her more powerful than duty, magic, or destiny: love. This retelling of Shakespeare’s classic work leads readers through an unforgettable saga of one woman struggling to escape her fate without blood on her hands. Begin the Lady Mabeth Saga with Lady Macbeth: Daughter of Ravens.",
