  "title": "Awakening",
  "description": "The town of Willow Creek is seemingly free after Remy’s sacrifice set off a life-altering chain of events that resulted in the demise of most of the world’s vampire population. Sabine flees to her home afterwards, except her family has disappeared and a “For Sale” sign is planted in her front yard. Just when she thinks she’s lost it all, she’s summoned back to Willow Creek Manor. Confused, and almost certainly walking into a trap, she reluctantly returns, only to find that the king of vampires still lives… and he is none other than her Remy. The dead love of her life is alive, but he doesn’t quite seem like the same man. With the help of a witch, a ghost, and a longtime enemy, can Sabine bring back the man she fell in love with… or will she lose him forever?  Awakening includes the prologue and first two chapters of Stephanie's upcoming novel, Take Me On. Once you've read The Willow Creek Vampires Series, you might remember a certain rock star Sabine has been obsessed with named Ash London. Take Me On is his story.",
