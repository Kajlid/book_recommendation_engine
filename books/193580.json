  "description": "The concluding volume of the Generic Vampire Novel #937 story, picking up directly where the first book left off (contains SPOILERS for Part One). When last we saw them, Liv Tempest, and her boss, Don Wiebe, were fleeing for their lives in a stretched Hummer, after the movie premiere of Horrorcaust turned into a bloodbath which claimed the lives of the principle actors and the director. Stephen was being hauled off to jail after nearly getting executed in the street, having intentionally broken Martial Law curfew in an attempt to get protective custody. And whatever happened to Shamus Ohio? Against all probability, vampires are real, and this latest manifestation is a result of the popularity of Shamus Ohio's \"Horrorcaust\" novel and its multimedia adaptations. How can a writer cope with the realisation that his literary creation is destroying the world? How can the US military hope to fight an enemy they can't even see? If the vampire problem has always been caused by popular fiction, can fiction also provide the solution? What can two hack fantasy and science fiction authors with two very polarising viewpoints offer as the key to mankind's salvation?",
