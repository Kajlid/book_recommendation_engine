  "description": "When stress-headed Mad Harry spontaneously books a flight for Egypt, he doesn't know he's about to embark on a mad-as-fuck pot-smoking pilgrimage of adventure.In fact, he's not even sure why he's going, or what he's going to do when he gets there. All he knows is he's got to get away.Guided by signs in numbers, names and otherworldly encounters, Mad Harry's trip often seems to be a magical manifestation of his fragile mind.This good-humoured true story is told in a frank, rhythmic and playful voice. Set in 2010, shortly before Egypt's revolution, it's a backpacking odyssey through tremendous temples, towering pyramids, chaotic cities, small villages, dirty beaches and deceitful strangers... with a backdrop of ancient spiritual gnosis!A crazy-headed, hassle-driven, sleep-deprived, dope-smoking journey with non-stop tests of trust and temptation......A holiday this is not.",
