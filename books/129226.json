  "description": "Victoria was a very pretty girl, but with three sisters even prettier than she was, Victoria had developed a bit of a complex about her looks. So when attractive Alexander van Schuylen made it clear he liked her, she really didn't expect much more from him. How could she, when he was so impressed with her sisters' beauty? But if his feelings for Victoria actually did run deep, she could be in danger of losing him -- entirely through her own fault!",
