  "description": "** Winner of the RomCon 2015 Readers' Crown Award for Best Contemporary Romance **Uber-organized Polly Malone leaves nothing to chance. Running her web design company on a shoestring, she's determined to make it a success. Her career plan doesn't include a man or a family. When she's approached by a stranger with an unusual request, she hasn't the heart—or the bank balance—to refuse. Sexy, wealthy, top London games entrepreneur Julian Ripley is battling for control of the company he built and picking up the pieces of his post-divorce life. But his sister makes a plea he can't refuse. When Polly and Julian meet in a dusty post office, feelings spark to life, but each harbors a secret—one that both binds and repels. Caught between family and commitments, can their love survive or is it inconceivable?",
