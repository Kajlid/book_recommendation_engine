This powerful, true account of the action he saw, fighting desperately to push the Nazis out of Italy, evokes the terrible reality of war with an honesty and clarity fiction can only imitate. In scene after unforgettable scene, he describes the agony and antic humor of the soldier's the tedium of camp life, the savagery of the front, and the camaraderie shared by those who have been bloodied in battle.",
