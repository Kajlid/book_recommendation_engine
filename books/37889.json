Just weeks after Jaron has taken the throne, an assassination attempt forces him into a deadly situation.

Soon, it becomes clear that deserting the kingdom may be his only hope of saving it. But the further Jaron is forced to run from his identity, the more he wonders if it is possible to go too far.
