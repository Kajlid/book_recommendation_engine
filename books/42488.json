  "description": "Keeley Thomson likes to think of herself as a perfectly normal, if slightly too forgettable, sixteen year old high school girl. Except that she isn't. She's a freak, an outcast that knows the whole of a person's being with a single touch.When Darla Gibson, the far too good looking head cheerleader for the school, takes a sudden interest in her, Keeley is left baffled in the extreme. She may be many things, but gullible isn't one of them, which leads her to conclude one simple fact. Darla Gibson isn't a high school cheerleader at all, but an ancient demon as she has jokingly said. One with a strange fixation that will change both of their lives forever.",
