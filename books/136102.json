  "title": "Ada & Eddie: A Novel",
  "description": "Finding the body of a young woman on the North York Moors creates a dilemma for Eddie, a reclusive homeless man who would rather commune with wildlife than tolerate humans. Ada, a feisty widow living nearby with a secret past, comes to the rescue. Together they embark on a mission to discover the identity of the young woman - a pursuit that unwittingly brings them towards a collision course with political corruption, murder, and betrayal. Written from Eddie’s point of view, the many conflicts are seen through his naive and simplistic view of the world around him. In contrast, Ada brings a more realistic, assertive approach to the perilous twists and turns they encounter while the presence of a deeply entrenched mole within their group of confidants keeps the reader guessing his identity. Ultimately, Ada, Eddie, and their cohorts successfully bring down an unscrupulous British government official, and in a shocking finale, the enemy’s unthinkable retribution is disclosed",
