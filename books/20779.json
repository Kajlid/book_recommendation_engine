  "description": "If you could trade one year of your life to be the most beautiful woman in the room, the woman that every other woman wishes she could be, the woman that every man wanted, what would you be willing to pay? What would you do to have a perfect body, to have a perfect face, to be thoroughly connected? What would you be willing to give up to make it all happen, your mind, your family, your soul? Experience a world solely created from the broken mind of one girl. Where torture and pain and sex became tools and nothing else mattered but beauty. SPA was a place of transformation, where the fat little caterpillars entered through one door and the beautiful butterflies flew home. SPA is a place of complete transformation where the beautiful butterflies fly home. Warning: This book includes descriptions of erotic scenes and should not be purchased by children or more sensitive readers.",
