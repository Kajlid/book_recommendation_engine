  "title": "This I Believe: The Personal Philosophies of Remarkable Men and Women",
  "description": "Based on the NPR series of the same name, This I Believe features 80 Americans--from the famous to the unknown--completing the thought that begins with the book's title. The pieces that make up the program include essays by celebrity contributors such as Isabel Allende and Colin Powell; selections from the original 1950s series by Helen Keller and Jackie Robinson; and pieces by a man who serves on the state of Rhode Island's parole board and a woman who sells yellow pages advertising in Texas. The result is a stirring, funny and always provocative trip inside the minds and hearts of a diverse group who reveal the American spirit at its best.",
