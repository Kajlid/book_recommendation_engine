  "description": "The Pulse Historia #1A Sword For His WomenI would like to add a light warning for this series. I did so on my other pages so I thought I should do so here. In PULSE HISTORIA we follow real historical events, meaning I will not sugarcoat facts. History is brutal and not always \"politically correct\", but as a history teacher it is my duty to present facts without fear of what others might think. Also we follow more personal stories of our much loved heroes- and they are grown men and will be doing grown men things-so things might get steamier. In The Pulse Myth series we see our immortals living in a very soft world compared to how things were... A SWORD FOR HIS WOMEN tells the story of how several of the immortal heroes from The Pulse Myths series first encountered one another while fighting alongside Vlad Dracul (Vlad The Impaler) against the Ottoman Turks in the mid 1400’s. It follows one of the heroes and his personal story of loss and heartache, and redemption.The Pulse Historia is a series of short stories chronicling various episodes in the lives of A Jacob Sweeny’s beloved Immortals from the smash hit trilogy The Pulse Myths. Each Pulse Historia narrative can be read and enjoyed on its own, but for a deeper understanding of what and who these characters are and how they fit into the trilogy, check out Pulse of Heroes, a 200,000 word epic paranormal romance set in modern day.",
