  "title": "The Swiss Corridor: Espionage Networks In Switzerland During World War II",
  "description": "During the Second World War Switzerland was a gigantic corridor of espionage and intrigue, a clearing-house of information passed by agents working for several countries, particularly Soviet Russia, Germany and the Allies. Dr Garlinski has had access to the archives of Swiss Intelligence, has conducted interviews with people who worked in Switzerland during the war, and on the basis of this and other extensive research he makes important new revelations about the Russian network known as the Red Orchestra and the German anti-Hitler network called the Black Orchestra. He presents a new picture of the contacts between Canaris and the Allies and argues that information derived from Bletchley Park could have been passed to a Soviet spy network in Switzerland.",
