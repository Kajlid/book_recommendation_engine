  "description": "The club took me in.Even though I was a cop.The moment I handed in my badge, I knew becoming an outlaw would change my life forever. As an ex-cop turned biker, my job is to stay loyal. To the club and my brothers. That is my sole purpose. Even though the reason I joined is no longer with us.Losing love is hard, but life must go on.Especially for my kids.Even if they're just out of reach. Now I'm a fugitive, an outlaw, a ghost.But I've run into someone I didn't see coming.A ray of pure sunshine. Just when I'd given up on family, now I'm ready to stand and fight.But perhaps the battle is not where I think it lies.Maybe my ray of sunshine will warm my life.Or maybe the darkness surrounding her will freeze me to my very soul. From International Bestselling Author K E Osborn comes the highly anticipated third book in the Houston Defiance MC Series.",
