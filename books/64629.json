  "description": "This beautifully written story, loosely inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale “Thumbelina,” was created in response to the gorgeous award-winning art of Nasrin Khosravi.Author Uma Krishnaswami’s sensitive and poetic tale opens when Lina, a tiny girl no bigger than a thumb, is found in a flower by her mother. Because she is so tiny, adventure and mishap easily befall her — a giant frog leaves her stranded on a lily pad, she is freed by curious fish, then pestered by crazy bugs. Lina lives by herself in the depths of a forest until the cold of winter approaches and she begins to feel lonely. She encounters a mouse, who is happy to have someone to dust and sweep for him, but one day in the back room of his house Lina comes across the body of a swallow. The mouse is convinced the bird is dead but Lina, thinking she sees a wing tremble, brings it food and water. Amazingly, the swallow revives and the two of them fly together to the garden of wishes…Iranian-born illustrator Nasrin Khosravi won the Grand Prize at the Noma Concours in Japan (2000) and was selected as best illustrator at the Tehran International Biennial of Illustration (1999) when these paintings were first published in a Farsi version of Andersen’s tale. They now grace this new Thumbelina story, giving young readers in North America an opportunity to delight in her work. Uma Krishnaswami’s text perfectly captures the spirit of the luminous illustrations, creating a book that is beautiful, magical and mysterious.",
