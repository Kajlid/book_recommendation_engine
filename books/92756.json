  "description": "Few people, let alone women, have made as many unconventional journeys in the twentieth century as Christina Dodwell has. She travelled alone through Africa, Papua New Guinea, China, Eastern Turkey and Iran, Kamchatka and Madagascar. She travelled on horseback, by camel, dugout canoe, by horse-cart, bicycle, by microlight and by driving reindeer and dogs. She shared meals with witchdoctors, pygmies and hermits, was attacked by would-be rapists and bandits, arrested as a spy and flung in gaol. So if you are planning an adventure of your own, you can be sure the advice you find in this extraordinary book is the best available; Christina shares her hard-won experiences and gives many useful tips on how to survive. Need to know how to cook crocodile? Look no further. How to buy a camel? How to deal with the head-man of the native village? Christina tells you all this, and much more. She livens up the instruction with tales of some of her adventures, all told with modesty and a charming dry humour.",
