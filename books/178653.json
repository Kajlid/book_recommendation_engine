What you might not know is, she took an oath years ago with her brother Seth, vowing to lock their hearts and throw away the key. She has spent years keeping up the happy facade and not letting anyone get close. It's not until a chance meeting that Tabitha meets her match in Carter Northwood. Here's a man whose life has been filled with lies, threats, and tangled webs of disaster. Carter knows that if he takes this chance at true love, the world around him will tumble down like a spiral staircase. Two hearts meld to form a single beat from the start. A test of trust, infinite love, and a longing for each other's passion.",
