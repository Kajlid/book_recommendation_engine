  "description": "YO-TE. A story, where a spirit of justice led to the massacre; where a soul has survived hiding in a gap between iron walls.A story, where machines not always follow a will of their operators.A story, where wrong circuits can be fixed by themselves.A story, where techno magic appears to be organic (plus The Metamorphosis has occurred). And, finally, this is a story, where true love comes from the sky with a bucket of industrial lubricant. And, finally-finally, all this fuss is present in pictures! And, finally, finally, finally- This story was originally written in the Proto-Mediterranean language and translated to English by the great and kind magician Vehos, who had preserved the beauty of the antique grammar style in his introduction, correcting and enriching dull and slightly confusable regular English. Enjoy!",
