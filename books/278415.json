  "description": "Author CommentsVintage Blood and the Sacred Scepters was an incredibly enjoyable story to write. In The Mark of the Werewolf, my first novel, I spent the evenings writing it for I wanted it to have a dark, sort of black and white feel to it. With Vintage Blood and the Sacred Scepters, color and brightness were what I wanted to capture, so, I spent the days writing it. What is most important to me about this novel is the fun I had writing it, and being told that this joy came through in the story, characters and, the magical creatures and objects I created. And I can only hope that those reading this novel will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it. Thank you for your time!",
