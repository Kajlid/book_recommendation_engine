It's what she wants, what she thinks she needsâ€”until she meets Joe Boone. Contracted to replace the plumbing along the property, Joe is first to arrive and last to leave. And to Laney's surprising disappointment, he never has much to say. But the more Joe comes around, the more she learns about him and soon finds the man is as flawed as the house he's fixing. A fact that only seems to draw her closer to him.",
