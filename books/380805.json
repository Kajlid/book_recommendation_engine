  "title": "Tiny Giants",
  "description": "Only 23, Nate Powell has for years self-published his comics, including the popular Walkie Talkie series. Using a bold, stark graphic style and storylines that recall the moody world of a David Lynch movie, he fills traditional comic strip panels with outre characters and inexplicable happenings. Spanning 1998 to 2002, the stories in Tiny Giants are about awkward silences and miscommunication, growing up in the Midwest, and fighting to hold onto the sweetness of life by any means possible. These “true stories that never happened” build on vignettes into an otherworldly narrative of disturbing intensity in this debut collection of work from this talented underground comic artist.",
