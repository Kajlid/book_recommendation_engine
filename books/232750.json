Just a few short years later, run she does—fleeing the unspeakable repercussions of her father’s gambling.

But can he also prove he’s a changed man worthy of her forgiveness?As Victor preaches of freedom in faith, will his words spark Bridget’s once-hopeless heart and lead her to the life she’s been seeking?",
