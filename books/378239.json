  "description": "Wildstorm's top superteam retires their tights and starts saving the world from the vantage point of high-stakes corporate activity! Jack \"Spartan\" Marlowe, the WildCats leader, decides that instead of fighting alien menaces dressed up as a Super Hero, his team of super-powered allies can do more for the people of Earth by being responsible corporate citizens. He uses the god-like Void's powers to access an alien dimension to create never-failing batteries, and sets out to take over the world for the greater good. Meanwhile, others on the team aren't adjusting to the stuffy suit-and-tie lifestyle so well as Grifter begins wishing he could go back to kicking butt. So even though he's a Vice President in the new WildCats endeavor, he routinely disappears to do so until he breaks his back and decides to train a mild-mannered accountant to take his place! The top superteam in the WildStorm Universe continues turning traditional genre tropes on their ears with this exciting new direction that fans have been clamoring for for years!",
