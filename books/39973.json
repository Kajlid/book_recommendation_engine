  "description": "Lucky Strike is a light-hearted laugh-out-loud mystery with a cast of characters who epitomize life Down East. Eric Spratt, a conservative accountant from Toronto, is forced to flee to the remote Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia and there, become Charles Trenchant, reclusive writer. He knows that anonymity and discretion are the only weapons he has to protect himself from the retribution of the Mafia dons whom he helped to send to jail. Surely, fifty years of a quiet, unassuming existence would prepare him for the life that he must now lead. However, the steamroller hospitality of the rambunctious locals overwhelms any hope that Charles has to keep his profile lower than low. Within days he is embroiled in their nefarious doings and wild antics. The resident rector, Father Donald Peasgood, and his redoubtable sister drag a reluctant Charles into the fold, while his disreputable next-door neighbor involves him in a scheme to burn down the house for the insurance money. Despite his best intentions to remain aloof, Charles lurches from crisis to crisis as this rollicking tale hurtles like a runaway train to its inevitable disastrous climax. When one very unpleasant lady ends up dead, and Charles is the prime suspect, it looks like the only way he can save himself is to flee the humble sanctuary and the open-hearted people he has come to love on the Eastern Shore. Lucky Strike is as full of fun as a Cape Breton kitchen party and as refreshing as a dip in the Atlantic Ocean.",
