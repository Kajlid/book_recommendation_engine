  "title": "The House of Make-Believe: Children’s Play and the Developing Imagination",
  "description": "In the most thorough attempt to cover all aspects of children’s make-believe, Dorothy and Jerome Singer examine how imaginative play begins and develops, from the infant’s first smiles to the toddler’s engagement in social pretend play. They provide intriguing examples and research evidence on the young child’s invocation of imaginary friends, the adolescent’s daring, rule-governed games, and the adult’s private imagery and inner thought. In chapters that will be important to parents and policymakers, the authors discuss television and the imagination, the healing function of play, and the effects of playfulness and creativity throughout the life span.",
