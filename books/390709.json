  "title": "Male Sexual Abuse: A Trilogy of Intervention Strategies",
  "description": "Adolescent and young adult male victims and perpetrators of sexual abuse are focused upon in this clinically sophisticated volume, which examines three intervention approaches to working with these client populations. Drawing upon adaptations of self-psychology, Gonsiorek describes assessment, treatment planning and individual psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioural techniques. For working with perpetrators, Bera explores a type of family systems therapy and a victim-sensitive therapy. Finally, a model for working with an ignored population sometimes viewed as untreatable in therapy - young male street prostitutes - is presented by LeTourneau.",
