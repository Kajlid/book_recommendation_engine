  "description": "It’s forbidden... but that just makes it hotter.  Courteney Clarke is the kind of girl who rock stars like me write songs about.  She’s beautiful, but she's totally off-limits. Because she’s my best friend’s little sister.  Now she tells me she’s a virgin—and she wants me to be her first. But she’s just f*cking with me. I know she is. She just hates me that much.  She knows her brother would freak if I touched her.  And if she plans to keep putting it in my face so I’ll give in… we’re both in a world of trouble.   This is cold war, but I’m not giving in. Problem is, neither is she.  I know I need to do the right thing here… But the wrong thing might just be way too filthy to resist.  Filthy Beautiful is the second full-length novel in the Players rockstar romance series, and the tenth book in the Dirty/Players series world.",
