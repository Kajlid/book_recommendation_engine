  "description": "Five young New Yorkers brought together on the verge of greatness - by the chance of fate - do battle to transcend through pangs of city grit and pleasures, to achieve. Helen, a modern woman caught between professions, men and fears has a stark choice to make. Jacob, a violin prodigy, frantically writes a symphony to win his love and prove himself. Conrad, ambitious Texan in New York, catches a break beyond his wildest dreams, with just one caveat. A childhood sin he can't expunge takes playboy-at-his-peak Lisandro from dream life to damning nightmare, half a world away. Senator's son and journalist Aidan risks everything to grab the story that will make him great. In the dark heart of Africa, against the Russian winter and the heel of influence, in the East-West bazaar of choice and genius mind of Jacob Frenkel, the mettle of a generation will be forged.",
