She will need the help of Tengo and his gifted misfit friends to escape The Complex’s control and help realise the destiny of generation Alpha.In Monkey Man, translated by Lisa and Daniel Lilley, Ichikawa creates a page-turning story about the children of tomorrow who will be called on to heal the world from spiritual and environmental decay.Red Circle Minis: Original, Short and Compelling Reads Monkey Man like all the others books in the Red Circle Minis series is a first edition written specifically for the series and is being published in English first before any other language including Japanese.",
