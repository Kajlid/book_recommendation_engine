  "title": "Jane Austen: A Life Revealed",
  "description": "Jane Austenâ s popularity never seems to fade. She has hordes of devoted fans, and there have been numerous adaptations of her life and work. But who was Jane Austen? The writer herself has long remained a mystery. And despite the resonance her work continues to have for teens, there has never been a young adult trade biography on Austen.Â Catherine Reef changes that with this highly readable account. She takes an intimate peek at Austenâ s life and innermost feelings, interweaving her narrative with well-crafted digests of each of Austenâ s published novels. The end result is a book that is almost as much fun to read as Janeâ s own workâ and truly a life revealed. Includes bibliography and index. Â",
