  "description": "A storybook for all ages and cultures illustrated by weebeastologist Micah Linton. After years of exhaustive research and physically challenging expeditions, finally enough intangible facts have been discovered and journal notes with detailed watercolor paintings have been archived to prove the existence of the fictional species weebeasts and that they are called by many things in different regions around the world such as gremlins, pixies, goblins, elves, trolls, gnomes not to mention a variety of other names depending on geographical mythology and local folklore. Watch the weebeasts and other creatures come to life on the page with this epic series.",
