  "title": "Tango Gourmet – Waltz of Salsa: Wellington’s Tale",
  "description": "A game with mixed messages. A recipe perfectly danced. A perfectionist chef in hot water. Industry giant Tornado Tech has unleashed a cult phenomenon upon the gaming world with the Tango Gourmet series and dancer Wellington is diligently practicing his best moves to try and one day become a professional chef. But some mixed genre games are a bit more mixed than others and Tango Gourmet hides a dark sexual plot within its layers of flaked pastry. When Wellington bakes himself into a corner he must hustle his way through a perfectly musical mess. As the terrible colossal food harbinger of doom approaches an important question remains unanswered. Can the powerful avatar that put players in sexy peril in the first place be stopped? More importantly to Wellington is his own personal question, “When did this cakewalk become a full out grind dance?” Warning: Contains m/m situations and frosted monster banging. While part of a series, this novelette can be read as a stand alone story!",
