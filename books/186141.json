  "description": "The year is 1944.  After five hard-fought years, the Allies are close to victory.  But Germany still has one last secret - and one that could still turn the war in its favour.  Travelling on a U-boat to Japan is a highly explosive uranium bomb, the first of its kind.  But why are the Nazis giving such a precious weapon to the Japanese?  And where might the Japanese use it?  In London, Special Operations Executive Captain Maddox is given a simple task.  Stop the U-boat at all costs.  A British, French and American team is assembled for the mission.  They will strike a mysterious island controlled by the Nazis where the U-boat is scheduled to stop.  But nothing about this job is what it appears to be.  The British, the French and the Americans all have their own agendas -- and so do the Germans.  And none of them involve Captain Maddox making it to the end of the war alive.  ‘Blood Red Sea’ is the second in a series of full-throttle World War Two thrillers featuring Captain Maddox that combine meticulous research with gripping story-telling to create memorable tales of action and adventure.  It is perfect for fans of Jack Higgins and Alistair MacLean.  'An explosive action thriller that throws new light on WWII'.' - Tom Kasey, best-selling author of 'The Dante Conspiracy'.  Jack Hayes is an author and journalist living in London.  Endeavour Press is the UK's leading independent publisher of digital books.",
