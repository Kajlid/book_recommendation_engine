  "title": "The Art of Perspective",
  "description": "The Art of Perspective contains a unique collection of poetry and reflections blended with compelling photography of various landscapes of nature and architecture. The book explores a personâ€™s deep need to look within, while simultaneously developing an awareness of the surrounding world which beautifully complements this particular style of literary expression. The tone of this book begins with the deep internal struggle where the mind can often lead and at times to the difficult corners of our thought processes. It takes you on a journey of exploration and hope to strive to create confidence for the prospect of internal change. These poems and reflections end with encouragement coupled with the motivation to aspire to a greater understanding.",
