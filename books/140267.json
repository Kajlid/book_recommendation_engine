  "description": "Frannie is so shy, she thinks she might go all the way through high school without even being kissed, much less finding that one boy who would make her feel special. Then her girlfriends create The Plan, and Frannie has so many boys after her that she can't keep track of all the parties and dances.Not everyone falls for the plan, though. Ronnie, the quiet, talented boy in art class, is the boy Frannie wants, the one she's always dreamed of. But since everyone else started paying so much attention, Ronnie seems to be avoiding her. Will Frannie have to give up The Plan and go back into her shell to show Ronnie how much she really cares?",
