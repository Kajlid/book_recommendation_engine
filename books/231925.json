  "description": "Katherine Whittemore has been shielded her entire life from the haunts of Bethlem Royal Hospital, the notorious asylum of Victorian London. The daughter of one of Bethlem’s doctors, Kat was kept from madness until urged by her father to visit the hospital as a distraction from her household duties. It is at Bethlem that Kat falls for her father’s best friend and colleague, Dr. James Blair, even though many in her household warn against him. He has secrets, dark ones, and soon Kat discovers he’s not the only one.  Visiting Bethlem forever changes Kat’s life and what she believed to be true. Kat suspects that something is amiss in her home, the house she must now try to save. Not even her relationship with James is enough to quell this suspicion, especially as those around her begin acting erratically. As Kat prepares for a Christmas Ball at the insane asylum where her father once worked, she can’t help but wonder if her household may mirror Bethlem in ways she hadn’t before imagined.",
