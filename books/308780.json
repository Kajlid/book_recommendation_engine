  "description": "Ape’s-Face tells the story of a well-known writer, Armstrong by name, who is invited to visit a remote country house in the Wiltshire downland for the purpose of examining certain ancestral documents belonging to the Delane-Mortons, a family beset by a curse, but one not of traditional form. Once in a hundred years, at the winter solstice, the evil takes its toll of the people who conquered its ancient worshippers, the prehistoric folk of the downs.Reviewing Marion Fox's remarkable Ape's-Face at the time of its publication, the critic and essayist F. T. Dalton wrote in The Times Literary 'Marion Fox has an aim identical with that which was openly acknowledged by the most celebrated youth in fiction. But her methods for the inducement of flesh-creepiness owe very little either to him or to any of her predecessors.'",
