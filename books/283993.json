  "description": "Fergal is a self-confessed nerd with an eccentric tin collecting. He likes the lucky dip aspect of buying tins that have their labels missing - after all, you never know what might be inside. It’s Fergal’s idea of living dangerously. That is, until the day he innocently opens up a tin to find... a bloodied human finger. Everyone thinks it’s a joke. But not Fergal - and when his next tin discovery is a note with the word ‘Help’ scribbled on it, he feels compelled to track down the factory responsible for these mysterious and macabre products. Fergal might be hungry to play detective, but has he opened a can of worms... ? This Dahl-esque black comedy will have readers squirming on the edge of their seats. Funny, frightening and totally gross - Alex Shearer taps into the repulsive-but-appealing tradition of urban myths that are perennial playground fodder.",
