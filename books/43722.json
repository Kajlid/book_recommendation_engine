  "description": "Hank Cooper pretended an average bull rider, going from town to town trying to get those elusive eight seconds. But when he and his best friend, Sam, come to the cowboy town of Clovis, California, he meets a woman destined to be his. Hank can’t run away from what he is any longer, but will she? Tammie Flint is just a girl who wants to have a good time at the rodeo with her best friend--maybe even meet a few cute guys. She didn’t expect to fall in love with a cowboy or to put the lives of everyone she holds dear in danger. Will any of them survive the Cowboy Moon?",
