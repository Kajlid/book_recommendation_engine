It is nothing short of a miracle when the Queen allows Isobel's marriage to the enemy, albeit at a hefty price.All around Isobel and John rages a lawless war. It is only their passion that can see them through the violent madness of Queen Marguerite and the devolution of Isobel's meek uncle into the Butcher of England. For theirs is an everlasting love that fears not the scratch of thorns, from either the Red Rose or the White.",
