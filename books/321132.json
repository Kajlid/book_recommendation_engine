  "description": "A dull-eyed girl, broken and alone,living in a world drenched in violence.Her story begins with bloodline sins,and no one to save her from the echoes of silence.WrenI haven’t spoken in four years. Not a scream, not a cry, not a whimper. I learned a long time ago—the punishment for speaking out against my tormentors isn’t a price I’m willing to pay.Not again.Forged in darkness and controlled in silence, I was caged for other’s twisted perversions. It wasn’t until four dark knights swooped in and sliced through the ropes binding me that I was finally free. They were supposed to be my saviors, but I was wrong. So. Incredibly. Wrong. The men who purchased me from my father are monsters—worse than those who haunt the shadows of my past.At first, they whispered sweet promises of freedom, but now they say I’m theirs to keep. To own. I’m nothing more than a prisoner once again. Only this time, I might not need saving. Especially when their brand of darkness soothes the shattered pieces of my poisoned soul, and sets my desire for vengeance ablaze.*Echoes of Silence is a DARK contemporary retelling of The Ugly Duckling, and 1 of 13 novels releasing in the Twisted Tales collection. It's a depraved, gritty, and raw reverse harem romance that contains scenes that may be triggering to some. Including : sexual assault, graphic violence and explicit steamy scenes. The FMC is beautifully broken, yet undeniably fierce. Her dark knights are depraved and possessive, delighting in pushing her past her breaking point. This novel comes with massive triggers, so please heed the warning. It is not suitable for readers under the age of 18.",
