  "description": "Chaos had been wrought by the short cycles of the Universe’s timewave, and those cycles were spiraling toward an ever-quickening ending. In its wake, Alterra’s surface has been reduced to a barren wasteland. Earth has been devastated by a comet. With Alterra no longer a utopian garden, it falls upon Anu to lead. Sinister forces confront him at every turn. Can he defeat his enemies and reinvigorate his people to ensure their survival? Anu’s most trusted ally, his son En.Lil, faltered on Earth and must now prove his worthiness to serve as Alterra’s future leader. Supreme Leader Ama demands it, and he won’t forgive. En.Lil is torn. There must be a deep meaning to his suffering, some vital task left undone. Earth is the key to their survival, and he must discover the entrance to the spirit world and learn its meaning. The lives of his Earthling son and the families who followed him to Khamlok depend on it. Don’t betray them. You can take it—advice of the ancient Anunnaki Wise One. Would he?",
