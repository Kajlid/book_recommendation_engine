  "description": "When the Grand Jury indicted abortion doctor Dr. Kermit Gosnell in 2011, it wrote: \"This case is about a doctor who killed babies... What we mean is that he regularly and illegally delivered live, viable babies in the third trimester of pregnancyâ€”and then murdered these newborns by severing their spinal cords with scissors... Over the years, many people came to know that something was going on here. But no one put a stop to it.\"Filmmakers Ann McElhinney and Phelim McAleer (FrackNation, Not Evil Just Wrong) have spent the last few years investigating the case and raising money for a feature documentary about the man they call \"America's biggest serial killer.\" Now, in Gosnell, McElhinney and McAleer report their shocking findings, taking readers inside the grisly case the mainstream media hesitated to cover. What really happened in Gosnell's Pennsylvania clinic? And perhaps more importantly, how did Gosnell get away with infanticide for decades?",
