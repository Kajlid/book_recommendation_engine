  "title": "An Unfinished Woman: A Memoir",
  "description": "Caustic, brilliant, uncompromising, accomplished, Lillian Hellman, one writer noted, can \"take the tops off bottles with her teeth\". Her career as a playwright began in 1938 with The Children's Hour, the first of seven plays that would bring her international attention and praise. Thirty years later, Hellman unleashed her peerless wit and candor on the subject she knew best: herself. An Unfinished Woman is a rich, surprising, emotionally charged portrait of a bygone world -- and of an independent-minded woman coming into her own. Wendy Wasserstein's introduction to this new edition provides a fascinating literary and historical context for reexamining Lillian Hellman's life and achievement.",
