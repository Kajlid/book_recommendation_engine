  "description": "\"Hear the Sunshine\" is a true story about the author's progressive hearing loss (Nerve Deafness) and how his family missed all the warning signs while he was growing up on an active Georgia farm. Charles' parents, six siblings, and dozens of close relatives were suspicious but totally \"dropped the ball\" discovering his handicap. A dangerous encounter with a deadly Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake proves the suspicions correct and makes everyone a true believer that Charles has a nasty hearing problem.",
