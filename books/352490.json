  "title": "Herodotus and the Road to History",
  "description": "Best-selling author Jeanne Bendick takes us for another informative—and amusing—journey into places and events of long ago.  Herodotus and the Road to History , written in the first person, details the investigative journeys of Herodotus—a contemporary of the Old Testament prophet Malachi—as he takes ship from Greece and voyages to the limits of his own ancient world. His persistence, amidst disbelief and ridicule, in the self-appointed task of recording his discoveries as \"histories\" (the Greek word meaning \"inquiry\"), means that today we can still follow his expeditions into the wonder and mystery of Syria, Persia, Egypt and the \"barbaric\" north. Jeanne Bendick's lucid text, humorous illustrations and helpful maps entertain and instruct as they open the way for readers young and old to once again join Herodotus . . . on the road to history. Illustrated.",
