  "description": "Katie Wellingtonâ€™s morning run is interrupted when she stops to assist an apparently stricken runner. As he tries to straighten up he seems to lose balance. Katie steps closer to steady him. With sudden speed, he grabbed the back of her neck and pushed a saturated cloth over her mouth. She tried to scream, but instead gagged on the sickening smell of the cloth. In the next instant, blackness claimed her. Katie finds herself at the Mint, where men and women are conditioned to constant sexual arousal and the appreciation of all the sexual arts. Despite the enticements of the Mint Katie never loses the will to resist. Readers of Erotic will finding The Mint full of compelling characters, plots, sub-plots, and a delightful smorgasbord of debauchery. THIS BOOK IS FOR LOVERS OF DARK EROTICA THAT ARE 18 or OLDWARNING: The Mint is different from the typical abduction novel. It is intentionally more erotic. It is not as dark. I have received accolades for originality, while being condemned for not living up to expectations. The criminals behind the Mint are pros rather than sick. They are motivated by money. They prefer the carrot to the stick, but carry a big stick. They are effective at getting the abducted guys and girls complicit in their own sexual training and conditioning. The abducted men and women have professional backgrounds. They surprise the reader by often reacting rationally rather rather then giving in to emotion.",
