  "description": "Chato, the coolest cat in el barrio, loves to party--but not his best buddy, Novio Boy. Birthday parties always make him blue. \"I'm from the pound,\" he tells Chato. \"I don't know when I was born. I never knew my mami. I never even had a birthday party, or nothing.\"So Chato plans the coolest surprise party for Novio Boy, inviting all of el barrio, and cooking up a storm. But he forgets the most important thing--inviting Novio Boy! Luckily, just as everyone starts remembering all the things they used to love about their long-lost friend, the birthday boy arrives with his own surprise--himself! In a starred review, Publishers Weekly called Chato's Kitchen \"Wickedly funny...Guevara's cats are delicious send-ups of barrio characters, and Soto's words glisten with wit. Salud to this magical pairing of talents.\"",
