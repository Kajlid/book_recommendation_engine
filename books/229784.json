She also happens to be one of the deadliest assassins in the world.The pride of her mentor, Willow has never botched a single mission or failed to eliminate a target, no matter what she has suffered in the process… and she has suffered. Greatly. Compared to some of those missions, this one will be a piece of easy in—one bullet—and easy out.In spite of her best laid plans and careful execution however, Willow finds herself overpowered by and at the mercy of her target. Rather than taking her life he presents her with a staggering gift. And when she is brought to a luscious island in Croatia, it is her own vulnerabilities and feverish desires that she uncovers.Willow cannot escape the knowledge of whom she is—her training, her purpose, and her mission—but she cannot deny the inner longings she never knew existed.Faced with a choice between the only family she has ever known and the only chance she’s ever had at happiness, Willow finds herself dangling between the two men and her loyalties to both.In The Last Mission, Vol.1, Z Lundy takes us on a brilliant journey through Eastern Europe and a titillating tour of Willow’s sexual awakening. She expertly blends intrigue and suspense with toe-curling delight and sexual sizzle. The Last Mission, Vol.1 will prove, without doubt, to be one of the best erotic novels of the year.",
