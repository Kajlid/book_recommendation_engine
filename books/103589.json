  "description": "From the same hilarious wellspring of failure as the bestselling F in Exams and F for Effort comes this all-new collection of inventively wrong—yet totally real—test responses by students who don't know the answer, but come up with something better instead. Featuring crucial academic subjects including English ( Name a key theme in Madame Bovary ; Cows), Geography ( Where can you find the Andes?; Google Earth), Science ( Describe the properties of a meteor; An animal that only eats meat) and more, F this Test rounds out the curriculum with an extra-credit section for those tricky elective courses, and demonstrates that it's more fun to laugh when faced with an absolute fail.",
