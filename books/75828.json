  "title": "Greetings Earthlings, My name is Appleton and I come from the Planet Reginta",
  "description": "My name is Appleton and I come from the planet Reginta in the Omega Centauri Globular cluster.I would like to thank J. Jack Bergeron for co-writing this book with me since as an intelligent being from another planet I am not trained in audible communication. This book has been written because we have officially decided to reveal ourselves as having visited your planet.This should resolve all the controversies that have been going on for ages on Earth as to whether extraterrestrial life actually exists.We tell the truth about the following topics: - How humans got out of Africa. - How humans migrated to the Americas. - How the Egyptian pyramids and Great Wall of China were influenced. - What Stonehenge and the Lockness Monster was about. - The truth about Noah's flood, Roswell, the Face on Mars, Bigfoot/Sasquatch and others. - As of Nov 6th we guarantee that we have no more \"representation\" in the Democratic and Republican parties. - Our technology is so advanced, it has allowed us to travel to heaven and back. - All atheists should read this book. - God has an opinion of this book, we're just not sure what it is yet.",
