  "description": "In an unnamed asylum, a patient without any memory or identity is being treated by an unnamed specialist. The treatment is very experimental. The patient is asked to read a series of documents detailing a horrible crime. It all suggests that he was the one who committed a grotesque murder. But who is the specialist, then? And what is the treatment really for? The document turns out to include a novel-in-progress and suggests a great effort on the part of a writer to solve the mystery of the atrocity. Is the patient the murderer? Or the specialist the author? The game of identities becomes a philosophical puzzle. Is it possible to lose your identity in order to escape from guilt? Or can you accept the guilt of a stranger’s crime in order to establish an identity? A murder mystery becomes a big labyrinth of human enigma. What does it mean to be ‘I’?A veteran writer in Japan now shows you the very strange world of human motivations. A murder mystery with a big twist.",
