Jacynth, who prefers to be known as Jack, is generally popular, although one member of her form takes an instant dislike to her.

This leads to several practical jokes, and Jack soon finds herself in trouble with the staff and prefects. Len Maynard is Jack's dormitory prefect. She feels responsible for her behaviour, and tries to help Jack stay out of trouble, but is not always successful. Jack is blamed when a trick goes wrong, and many of her form turns against her. With Len's intervention, the misunderstanding is sorted out, and Jack learns a serious lesson about the difficulty of shaking off a bad reputation.
