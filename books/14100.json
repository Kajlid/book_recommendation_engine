  "description": "The Aliens had come a long way from mere cactus hoppers. But their next step was murder--in the First degree!Murder most alien. Something flashed and a great roar deafened the audience.When the smoke and green-tinged vapor cleared, a lamviin alien--what was left of it anyway--lay dead before the horrified gaze of several hundred eyewitnesses. Responsibility for solving the crime lay squarely on the three shoulders of Bucketeer-Inquirer Mav. But--the windowless room had been locked, no one saw the killer, and the murder weapon itself was a mystery.",
