  "description": "Halldorr never did get his warm hearth and plump wife. Each time he came close, Odin, Providence, or Glooskap saw fit to change his path.Older now, feeling no wiser, he finds himself in the midst of a new people, the Beiuthook, a captive demeaned to the point of performing the drudgery of the village women. But he has fought, bled, and killed in a life thrust upon him. His mind has adapted to his lot so that he now longs for the adventure and camaraderie of war.The Beiuthook have forever struggled against their more numerous rivals, the Mi’kmaq. Halldorr arrives at a time when tensions are high with a new, aggressive sachem controlling the opponents of the Beiuthook.Will Halldorr’s experience on the killing fields and aboard the pounding longboats see that he is returned to a place of honor among men? Or, will he toil his life away in chaste misery mindlessly scraping at the hide of someone else’s kill.Norseman Chief is the final installment of The Norseman Chronicles, each of which detail the heroic life of Halldorr from the icy fjords of Greenland, to sweeping battlefields in England, and now to the foreign shores of Vinland and beyond in what he calls the merki.",
