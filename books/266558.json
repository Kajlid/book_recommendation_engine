  "description": "The only reason I'm still alive is because of the baby growing inside me.  My baby saved my life.  Now I'm a prisoner inside Cato's fortress. He's pissed at me, livid every time he looks at me. He refuses to sleep with me because now I'm the enemy.  But I miss him...and he misses me.  I only slept with Cato to save my father, but now he means something to me. I care about him, and I know he cares about me.  Can I earn his forgiveness? Can I earn his trust?  But even if I do, will he shoot me anyway?",
