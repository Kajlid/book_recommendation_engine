  "description": "Derek Ballentine and I have always been on opposite sides of everything. I went to a public Savannah high school. He went to a private Catholic school. I went to Duke on scholarship. He went to UNC as a legacy. When we both end up at Harvard for graduate school and we’re finally on a level playing field, I think it’s all going to change. I was wrong. The only thing that changed was ending up in his bed. Now my grandma has passed away, and Derek is the attorney helping the people trying to steal her legacy. I’ll do anything to stop that from happening. Even take on my lifetime enemy. I hate him at first sight… but I also want him at first hate.",
