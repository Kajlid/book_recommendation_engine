  "description": "From the author of Never Eat Anything Bigger than Your Head , Whack Your Porcupine , Tiny Footprints , and, of course, the legendary Cat , here is a Kliban doubletake-over 100 line drawings, plus the illustrated serial thriller Cornish Game Clams . Brilliantly drawn and bitterly funny, these cartoons thoroughly demonstrate better living through plywood, reaffirm that what's good for business is good for America-even if Your Government in Action has taken to the streets-the Madonna is out of order and Yoga has been made silly. 122,000 copies in print.",
