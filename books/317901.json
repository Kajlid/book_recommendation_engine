Phylus is still lost in Tanelen, and the ultimatum of war is fast approaching.But The Avatars of Fate have suffered blows of their own. Most of The Named have been eliminated. Their recruitment efforts have been stonewalled. And a critical line of communication has been severed.The revelation of a turncoat, however, brings The Coalition's very foundation under scrutiny. This apostate breathes new life into The Avatars' operations. Though perhaps it's a life that's been present all along. The prophesied arising draws near.Eldritch beings herald the return of one more power for the Hybrids' arsenal. Buried deep underground for millennia, it may be the last hope against The Avatars' enigmatic Goddess.Even though it failed once before.",
