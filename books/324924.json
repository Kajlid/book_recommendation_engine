  "description": "Fake date. Real trouble. Fall for a new trope-tactic, fake dating rom-com series from USA Today bestselling author, Lila Monroe! Ex-pro athlete Austin Banks is cocky, charming, and the ultimate player… at least, that’s what I think when he makes me an offer I can’t refuse for my dream job. Except, it’s not technically me he’s offering it to...Other Jennifer Walker is the bane of my existence. We may share a name (and a similar email address) but that’s where the similarities end. Other Jenn is bold, confident… and off having wild adventures on the other side of the world. So, she won’t mind if I borrow our identity back and prove I’ve got what it takes to have Main Character Energy, too. Right? I figure I can put up with Austin’s playboy shenanigans long enough to level up my career, but I’m not expecting the sparks between us to be quite so sizzling, or for there to be a sweet, driven guy buried under all that charm. Soon, my one little white (not-quite) lie is spiraling, and I’m in way over my head (and out of my underwear). Can I find a way out of this mistaken identity mix-up? And will Austin’s past keep us from scoring a home-run - on, and off the field? Find out in the hot and hilarious Billionaire Bachelors rom-com from Lila Monroe!
