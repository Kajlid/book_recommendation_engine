  "description": "Billionaire shifter Morgan Rosemont’s family just showed up in Silver Peak for a surprise visit, and he’s in big trouble. Morgan had lied and told them he was engaged, which means he needs a mate, fast The last person he should turn to is is smart-mouthed curvy secretary Valerie, because she’s the only one who threatens his hard-won self control. So why does he find himself calling her in to his office and making a deal with the devil? Valerie Dickinson has had it with working for shifters – and working for Morgan Rosemont, most of all. He’s rude, he’s arrogant, and he can’t see that his full figured secretary is secretly in love with him. She’s already accepted a new job when Morgan makes her an offer she can’t refuse. Pretend to be his mate through the holiday season, and he’ll bail out her grandparents failing business. Now, all she has to do is sleep chastely in the same bed with the sexiest wolf in Montana, prevent his snooty mother from starting a war with the local humans, and figure out who’d rather see her dead than mated to Morgan Rosemont.",
