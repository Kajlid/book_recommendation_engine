  "description": "In the summer of 1983, Caroline was recovering from her thirty-two-year-old sister's untimely death, working as a consultant in rural Tennessee, and writing her sister's story. Then, in one startling moment, she was struck by lightning. Its message? Develop a relationship with Al Gore, Jr, then a US congressman, for the purpose of ending the threat of nuclear war. Although she had had little political experience, Caroline heeded the message of the lightning bolt, albeit reluctantly. In time, she moved her family to Washington, DC, where she could work to affect policy. In an era in which the US and Soviet Union had 50,000 nuclear weapons between them, she found herself surrounded by politicians who wanted to build even more. Hundreds of dreams and the voice of Spirit led Caroline ever deeper into the political arena, urging her to build relationships based on love and respect with members of Congress and the Supreme Soviet, defense analysts, peace activists, scientists, and vice presidents of both the United States and the USSR. Love Changes Things is a David and Goliath story where \"David\" included millions of people working to end nuclear test explosions worldwide. In this extraordinary story, what tamed the dragon was love-an ingredient that is often missing in social change work, but essential to creating a world at peace. The premise is simple, and the tools are easy to use.",
