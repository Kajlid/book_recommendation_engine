  "description": "After a whirlwind romance in Paris and a wedding on top of the Eiffel tower, Akimi and his new husband return to Tokyo. Though his husband’s family starts out rather cold to him, the young housewife is determined to make them fall in love with him... Unbeknownst to him, he is a little too successful in this endeavor. When he realizes how his new family feels about him, how far will the sweet-natured boy be willing to go to make everyone happy?  This is a fun, filthy romp that stretches the limits of male-on-male romance (and the uke’s anatomy). Please enjoy responsibly!  ~35,000 words",
