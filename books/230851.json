Fun on the Job explores one such industry—America’s burgeoning aerospace trade—to give us an entirely new perspective on what really went on when some of the largest advancements in aviation and defense technology were developed.This book is a collection of hilarious and entirely true essays from people who have worked at General Dynamics, one of the leading producers of planes, aircraft, weapons, and other technologies that played a pivotal role in America’s military success throughout the twentieth century and beyond. These employees boast incredible accomplishments that cover everything from producing thousands of B-24 bombers for World War II combat to influencing Cold War tactics to sending the first US astronauts into space.Spanning more than eighty years in this field and featuring stories from everyone from entry-level engineers to major executives, Fun on the Job is a down-to-earth recollection of a high-stakes industry that every worker—employed or retired—can relate to. More than that, it’s a testament to how day-to-day humor begets extraordinary success.",
