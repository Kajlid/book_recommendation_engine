  "description": "Hello, My Name Is… looks at the fascinating subject of our personal names. Of course, we are particularly interested in our own names. Dale Carnegie, author of How to Win Friends and Influence People, says our name is our ‘sweetest and most important sound’. However, your name is just one in an ocean of names, many of which have a fascinating story to tell. Using examples from Anglo-Saxon kings to today’s celebrities, it charts the history and importance of personal names—given names, surnames, name titles, and professional names.",
