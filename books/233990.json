  "description": "Lady Darksome! Thought I was gone, didn’t you? So did I. But apparently slipping into that good night wasn’t my plan.  I just wish I’d have left myself a note. Or a Facebook message. Hell, even a Snapchat…chat. That way I could have prepared everyone, including me, for what was to come.  And I could have saved my love from so much heartbreak.",
