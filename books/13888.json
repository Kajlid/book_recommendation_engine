  "title": "The Guadalupe Saints",
  "description": "Tony Guadalupe feels out of place at his high school. He soon learns that his life is ineluctably woven with one of the great visionaries of Mexican history, Juan Diego, the indigenous peasant who first envisioned Our Lady of Guadalupe. A direct descendant of Juan Diego, Tony Guadalupe must confront his unknown past and accept both his burdens and gifts, a journey undertaken in different ways by his grandfather and his father. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church seeks to disempower the Guadalupes, whose shamanistic lineage connects them to the Aztec goddess Tonantzin.",
