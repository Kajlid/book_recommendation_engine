  "title": "The Centrality of Jesus Christ (Works of T. Austin-Sparks) Volume One",
  "description": "T. Austin-Sparks was one of the great spiritual figures of the twentieth century. Perhaps no one in the last one hundred years gave us ministry that is so Christ-centered.When the measure of a man's ministry is taken as how much he exalted Christ, then T. Austin-Sparks is without peer.Sparks wrote over one hundred books. The golden chord which ran through all those works was the exaltation of his Lord. He has given us more spiritual insight into Christ than perhaps any other man of the last 1700 years. To read Sparks is to discover Christ as few men have ever known or seen him.Sparks' writings speak little of the Christ of Galilee - rather he has given us the resurrected and enthroned Lord. He has gone even farther than this, to show us the insuperable Christ who dwells within us. This presentation of his Lord would be enough to make Sparks' ministry unique, but Sparks went on to join head to body (Christ and the church). As surely as his spoken and written ministry exalted the Lord, so also Sparks called forth the almost forgotten centrality of the church. For T. Austin-Sparks, the two were inseparable. Nor did he speak of the church that most men have known and experienced.",
