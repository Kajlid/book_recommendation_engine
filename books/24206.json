  "description": "NOTE: This Kindle edition has been replaced with ASIN B06XSRTF45 (re-released with a new title and publisher).Once a Colonel with the Fleet, Lyon is now a rebel, a wanted man with a price on his head. Worse, he’s a Leo-class military grade cyborg. Which means the price on his head is dead, or alive. Captured by fleet marines he’s on his way to a medical facility for dissection so the scientists can work out how he and his kind have bypassed all the security protocols the Fleet built into them, and managed to rebel. He expects nothing but pain, and degradation from his captors and, for the most part, that’s what he gets.He doesn’t expect nurse Samara Williams, a woman who was brought up not to judge a book by its cover and to see people for their worth, not what a Fleet PR campaign tells her she ought to see. Disgusted by the treatment Lyon is receiving, she is determined to take care of his injuries and make his stay on the ship as comfortable as possible.But Samara is a nurse, not a trained commando used to dealing with cyborgs. When she neglects to ensure his cuffs are locked tight, all hell breaks loose. A hot, sensual sort of hell she’d trade her soul for...",
