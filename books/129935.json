Jane harbors a frightening secret—she's really Meredith Sommers, on the run from a dangerous ex-husband and desperately in need of the safety Hutch can provide.

And as Christmas approaches, they discover that their love can conquer the past and overcome any obstacle—but what price will they pay?",
