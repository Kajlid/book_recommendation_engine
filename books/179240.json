  "title": "This Is Woman's Work: Calling Forth Your Inner Council of Wise, Brave, Crazy, Rebellious, Loving, Luminous Selves",
  "description": "\"A woman's work is to define herself,\" writes award-winning slam poet Dominique Christina. While this task is important for everybody, Dominique says, \"There is an urgency for women. When you have inherited a construct that names, describes, and practices an ideology that women are somehow less important, less necessary, then the work of defining yourself carries with it a kind of fury.\"Every woman is composed of many selves-archetypal players of the psyche who contribute their voices to her greater \"I.\" This Is Woman's Work introduces us to our council of inner women, delving into the secret wisdom and gifts of the Willing Woman, the Rebel, the Shapeshifter, the Warrior, and more. Combining writing exercises with fresh and dynamic insights, Dominique helps us make an intimate connection with each inner woman-known and unknown, loved and feared-so we may integrate their voices, realize their wisdom, and open ourselves to our full expression and power",
