  "title": "Encore",
  "description": "Warning: This book is meant for mature readers who are 18+. It contains explicit language, and graphic sexual content.  You’ve read Back-up, you’ve read Front & Center, and you want an encore? Jack and Leila have had to deal with some devious nonsense in their lives. But now, life is real good. Find out what they’ve been up to. Travel into the future with Jack, Leila and all their friends. Put to rest your questions of “What happened to…”  If you are looking for heartbreak, angst or drama, look elsewhere. Encore is meant to produce a long and breathy sigh.  I hope you enjoyed the journey of these amazing people half as much as I enjoyed creating it.  Happy Reading!",
