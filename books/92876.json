  "description": "alt cover edition for ASIN B00BU816NQAmerica's love affair with guns invades the heart of Oz with often hilarious results. Follow the Wicked Witch of the West as she goes on a shooting spree after Dorothy drops her house on the Witch's sister. One crazy step after another leads them to the ultimate confrontation between good and evil. Cameo appearances from Jesus Christ: Shooting Star, Elvis the Presley, Harry Poffertje, and Stephen King Author the First add to the hilarity.\"I love The Wizard of Oz, and there is nothing sexier in the history of mankind than Margaret Hamilton wearing green makeup and a jet-black witch's hat and dress. That said, I am a humorist (that some people still don't get my humor is neither here nor there) and I see my job as one that brings a different perspective to those things people consider classics, be they movies, books, or people. I have done that with The Wicked Witch of the West: Munchkin Killer and may it live or die on the strength of what it is.\" - Darrin Mason",
