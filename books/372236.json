  "description": "Serena Cunningham did not trust Dominic Westcroft, since she was almost certain he had brutally slaughtered her sister, his first wife, in a fit of jealous rage, and she was out to prove he was the cold-blooded killer she believed him to be. All she needed was the opportunity. Though both the wizard's council and a jury had found him not guilty, Dominic Westcroft still didn't know if the panther he shifted into at moments of stress or danger had been responsible for his wife's brutal murder. And until he knew for certain whether the beast that claimed a part of his being was innocent of the crime, he had no intention of allowing another woman into his life-no matter how deeply he was attracted to her.",
