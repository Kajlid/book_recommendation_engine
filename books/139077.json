  "description": "The Millicans tell nosy, drunken neighbor Gloria they’re religious marriage counselors. They’re not counseling; training, maybe, but not counseling. Gloria still thinks the truck that delivered those crates in the wee hours of the morning was suspicious. Donna says it was exercise equipment that the moving company lost, but Gloria’s not sure. Could it be that they’re not as they appear?",
