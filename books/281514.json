  "description": "SHE WAS A MISTRESS OF DISASTER--AND HE DEMANDED SHE KEEP HER DISTANCE!With his broad shoulders and flashing dark eyes, Lord Ravenel could have stepped from the pages of lady author Gwenda Vickers's gothic novels!Certainly she hadn't meant to eavesdrop on his marriage proposal--nor overhear the lady's refusal. But certainly he would welcome her advice--as a seasoned writer, of course--on the art of romance.But Ravenel fairly cursed the imperturbable Miss Vickers. Her penchant for disaster and her boot-chewing hound were enough to drive a man to Bedlam! How shocked he was, then, to discover he yearned to star in a love story of his own...with the wide-eyed authoress herself!",
