  "description": "Prison investigator Perri Stone has returned to the Dexter County Correctional Facility after a short leave of absence only to find the prison is going ahead with a ban on smoking. Perri immediately recognized the stockpiling as a sign of something truly dangerous on the horizon. And guess what, the inmates don't like it and they revolt. QUIET RIOT - the inmates take over. Everybody won't make it. Can Perri get Antoinette out of the lion's den before it erupts? How many die? Who lives? Whose side will you be on? You just want to do your time and get out. This time the lines blur and everything may not be what it seems. Bear, Dupree, Thompson, Ortega and Campbell are all back for the Quiet Riot.",
