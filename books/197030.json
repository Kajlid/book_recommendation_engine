  "description": "Although this book is part of a series, it can be read as a stand alone novel.  From New York Times and USA Today Bestselling Author, Cali MacKay...  Marshall should be riding high as the CEO of his own successful company. Instead, he’s in the middle of a nasty divorce as he tries to rid himself of his cheating and lying wife, while trying to track down a mole in his company. What he needs is a distraction, so when Harper Jones walks into his office with improvements she’d like to make to one of their products, Marshall knows that the brilliant and gorgeous engineer is exactly what he needs to take his mind off his problems.  Harper's heard the gossip about her boss, and the last thing she wants is to get sucked into the middle of a nasty divorce—especially when rumor has it that Marshall’s ex may be carrying his baby. When Marshall sets her in his sights, Harper finds him far too difficult to resist, with his charming good looks and sexy smarts, but with her heart and career on the line, and a mole pointing the finger in her direction, will she risk it all to find happiness or simply walk away?  *** This novel contains a Happily Ever After ending. Due to the adult language and explicit sex scenes, this book is for adults only.***",
