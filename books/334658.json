  "description": "Discover the theories and facts surrounding the Whitechapel murders in David Rumbelow's \"The Complete Jack the Ripper\"...It is 1888 in London's Whitechapel district, where one by one a group of prostitutes are brutally murdered. Opium smoking Inspector Fred Abberline is called upon to investigate these horrific murders and through his visions track down and trap Jack the Ripper. David Rumbelow's casebook sets the crimes firmly in their historical setting, examines the evidence comprehensively and scrupulously, disposes of a number of theories and legends and relates the murder to popular literature and to later similar sex crimes. In addition he has had the advantage of access to some of Scotland Yard's most confidential papers.",
