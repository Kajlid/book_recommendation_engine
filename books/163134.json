  "title": "Bananas, Beaches and Bases: Making Feminist Sense of International Politics [Updated Edition]",
  "description": "This radical analysis of globalization reveals the crucial role of women in international politics today. Cynthia Enloe pulls back the curtain on the familiar scenes—governments promoting tourism, companies moving their factories overseas, soldiers serving on foreign soil—and shows that the real landscape is not exclusively male. She describes how many women's seemingly personal strategies—in their marriages, in their housework, in their coping with ideals of beauty—are, in reality, the stuff of global politics. In exposing policymakers' reliance on false notions of \"femininity\" and \"masculinity,\" Enloe dismantles an apparently overwhelming world system, revealing it to be much more fragile and open to change than we think.",
