  "description": "Carna and her sisters carry the last of the royal blood. Every male shifter in the world craves to mate with one of the elusive princesses to secure their place in history. Only royal blood will ensure the continuation of all shifter species. Although she may be the heir to future generations, Carna wants no part in a forced seduction. She's independent and wants to make her own choices, and mate for love, not out of necessity. Carna and her sisters split up and go into hiding, but not for long... When a rogue group of shifters captures Carna and insists she choose one of them as her mate, she puts up the fight of her life, escaping into the forest. Once on the run again, she quickly learns that running and hiding are taking their toll on her. She needs to settle down and why not with one or more of the sexy men begging for her affections? But can she find love amongst all the chaos?",
