  "description": "There are hundreds of conventional writers' guides on the market, but none so scathing, cynical and downright cantankerous as this one. Forget toadying to publishers or obsessing over return postage, in this insider exposé veteran author, Chancery Stone, spares no-one's blushes as she strips the book world bare and reveals the true natures of publishers and authors alike. Interspersed with laugh-out-loud parodies of best-selling thrillers, romances, crime, science fiction, erotica and even the Booker Prize, and naming names and showing no mercy to the perpetrators,  How to Write the Perfect Novel  will submerge you in such brain-numbing brilliance that you may never browse through a book shop in quite the same way again.... \"\"The perfect antidote to the thousands of well-meaning, hefty writers' guides that currently flood the market\"\" Essential Writers \"A bitter look at how to succeed\" Writers' Forum (Reader Review) \"This is the kind of book that you read for the humour the scathing remarks and the blatant flaunting of all the rules. Yet it is so cleverly written that you find yourself learning things that quite frankly none of the other how to books teach you\" W H Smith UK   (Reader Review)\"Chicken soup for the jaded writer's soul\" Good Reads",
