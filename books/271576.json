  "title": "The Obsidian Mirror: Healing from Childhood Sexual Abuse",
  "description": "Affirming and inspiring, The Obsidian Mirror explores the vivid and personal journey of an adult survivor of childhood sexual abuse. Drawing on the power of creativity, Wisechild listens to and learns from her inner voices - the critical judge, the rebel, the scared and needy children of various ages - and uses evocative imagery to describe the emotional settings of her interior landscape. This is both a stirring testimony of one woman's passage from fear and grief to rage and resolve and a moving portrayal of a spiritual reawakening and reclamation of self.",
