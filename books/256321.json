  "description": "Two ICU doctors. No time for love. But what if the girl was new and needed your help? What if she was sweet, worked hard and held her head up high despite the terrible treatment she was getting as a junior doctor? Zaid didn't need love. He didn't need the vision in pink who stumbled into his ICU with a bad cold and arms full of books. But the quiet beauty inevitably captured his heart with her kindness and down-to-earth manners. A sweet love story where hearts are baited, barriers come crashing down and all that remains is a happy ending.",
