  "description": "Sometimes, There's More to the Story…  \nFrom USA TODAY Bestselling Author Sabrina Stark: \nTo every girl with a pulse, he's Lawton Rastor – billionaire bad boy, former underground fighter, and heartbreaker extraordinaire. But in his own private torment, he's the guy who lost his only chance at her – the one exceptional girl he can't quite forget.  He's a notorious bad boy with a terrible reputation. She's a plucky nice girl who wants to play it safe. How can Lawton, who built his empire on raw badness alone, win the heart and mind of the sweetest thing he's ever known? In Unbelonging, we heard the tale from Chloe Malinski, the girl-next-door who captured his heart. Now, at last, Lawton tells his side of the story.  Fans of Unbelonging will love this humorous and heart-wrenching retelling, which includes a few surprises along the way. New readers are in for a special treat, because this is one bad-boy, good-girl story they won't want to miss.  A full-length novel, this new adult contemporary romance features mature content and adult language. It's not advised for under-age readers.",
