  "description": "Socrates Fortlow, an ex-convict forced to define his own morality in a lawless world, confronts wrongs that most people would rather ignore and comes face-to-face with the most dangerous emotion: hope. It has been nine years since his release from prison, and he still makes his home in a two-room shack in a Watts alley. But he has a girlfriend now, a steady job, and he is even caring for a pet, the two-legged dog he calls Killer. These responsibilities make finding the right path even harder - especially when the police make Socrates their first suspect in every crime within six blocks.--BOOK JACKET. \"In each chapter of Walkin' the Dog, Socrates challenges a different conundrum of modern life. In \"Blue Lightning, \" he is offered a better-paying job but has to consider whether the extra pay is worth the freedom he would have to give up. In \"Promise, \" he keeps a vow made long ago to a dying friend, and learns that a promise to one person can mean damage to another. In \"Mookie Kid, \" he gets a telephone and,learns that the price of being able to reach others is that others can contact him - whether he wants to be reached or not.\"--BOOK JACKET. \"Walkin' the Dog builds to a stunning climax as Socrates takes on a rogue cop who has terrorized his neighborhood.\"--BOOK JACKET.",
