  "title": "Heaven's Equal",
  "description": "The rhyming, illustrated adaptation of The Journey to the West continues. After defeating the armies of the Jade Emperor, Sun Wukong the Monkey King settles into his new role as Great Sage Heaven's Equal. But once more Monkey's pride and complete disregard for authority lead to conflict with the bureaucrats who run the Heavenly Kingdom. Despite his outward bravado, Monkey continues to be preoccupied with the possibility that someday the self in which he puts such confidence will be replaced by the nothingness of Death, and he steals both the Peaches of Longevity from the Jade Emperor's private grove as well as Laozi's experimental pills of immortality in the hopes of ensuring that, unlike everything else in the universe, Sun Wukong will never end. These thefts spark a Havoc in Heaven, and the gods are forced to call in the Buddha to set things straight.",
