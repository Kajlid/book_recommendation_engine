  "description": "She had appeared from nowhere quietly watching the storm through the French doors of the Chateau Chantal's salon. Away from the cares of work and family in Japan, Kohei Daigo felt strangely drawn to this woman, also Japanese, whose haunting scent thrilled his senses. In the darkness of that quaint room in a faraway country they shared an experience beyond the physical, a poetic, almost religious frenzy of love...But they also shared their secrets: Daigo's hidden hatred for a fellow scientist responsible for the deaths of several children, and Fumiko's loathing for a killer who has never been caught.Without knowing it, Daigo struck a bargain that night that could separate him from Fumiko forever... and make him a murderer.",
