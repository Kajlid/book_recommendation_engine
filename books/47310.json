But more surprising is Tully’s best friend, a young Indian girl spirit, Penaki, who reveals herself to the children by forming patterns with butterflies, rattling tin cups, drawing on dusty mirrors, and flipping book pages.Tully’s past is shrouded in mystery, and Gus can’t understand why his mother hates Tully so.
