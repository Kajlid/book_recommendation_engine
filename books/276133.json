  "description": "Rules are meant to be broken... Unless breaking them tears an entire family apart.FinnI'm the cool headed one. The rule-follower. The non-hormonal-raging wolf.This pack needs someone like me. We've fought creatures of the night, psychotic families and dealt with magic and the unbelievable. We're all thick as thieves, and the worst thing that could happen is getting kicked out of this pack. Which is why breaking rules is not my thing. So why does Elle make me want to throw it all away?And why is it my stupid, idiotic wolf does exactly that...before I've even had a taste of her lips? Now we’ve got more on our hands than a love story with bad timing. Cause the shite about to go down in Rockland Creek has just hit boiling point - and I’m the catalyst. \nElle\nHe barges in like he owns my destiny, and yeah it's hot as sin. That Irish accent, those gorgeous eyes, it'd be easy to fall for the whole package. Only I don't. I may look as sweet as the baked goods I sell, but there are thorns under this armor Finn has no idea about. Things he cannot know about, or I’ll end up in the looney bin like my mom. And then things get really complicated when Tytus is added to the mix, telling me stories I can't believe. They're fable, myths....but before long I’m spiraling into a web so thick I don’t know which way is up. And when the one person I can trust is hunted by a demon from his past, I’m left to rely on myself to figure it out. But what if I make the wrong choice?​\n*Book III in a paranormal shifter series filled with werewolves of all kinds, feisty females who stand up to them, and enough suspense to make it interesting. Can be read as standalone.*",
