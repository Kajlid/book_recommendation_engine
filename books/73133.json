They chase after pencil-thin supermodels who never have to watch what they eat or exercise to keep their figure.She also has no desire to see the Max's band live when he comes to town, but her groupie sister can't stop going on about how sexy he is. When Therese nonchalantly wins a pair of backstage passes for her sister during a radio contest, she decides to give it a try despite the horde of tattooed and pierced fans that will be there.When the limo arrives to take them to the show, she is sure she makes a fool of herself by not recognizing Max and the rest of the band who are already seated.

She allows her mind to wonder what it would be like to have him to herself for a night.Max is caught off-guard when one of the winners of a radio contest takes a seat in his limo. Her full-figured frame, beautiful curves, and piercing eyes show him that she is interested in him personally, not his fame. He wants to show her there is more to him than being a rock star. Will Therese look past the stage lights and her own insecurities to spend a night with the mysterious rock star, Max Stone?",
