  "description": "The Emperor of Noorhitam, plagued by dreams of disaster, sends out a plea for help from any Dream Walker able to offer interpretation and aid. Little does he realize that his salvation even now languishes in the dungeons beneath his own temple.  A scholar travels from a distant city to fulfill a mission of murder at the command of his new masters. But, through cunning and craft, Sairu has hidden her mistress where no one will think to look for her. Lady Hariawan, lost in the torment of her mind, sinks into darkness beyond Sairu’s protective reach. Shadows of both this world and the other creep ever closer, shadows which Sairu cannot fight with mortal weapons.  As the Dragon’s fire flames brighter in the hearts of men, can anything prevent the impending destruction of the emperor’s city . . . and of the heavens themselves?",
