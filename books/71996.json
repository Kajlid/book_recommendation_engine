  "description": "Stranded! Billionaire Gibb Martin loves risk almost as much he loves a well-made suit. But when his business partner and longtime friend suddenly bails on a major venture to get married...well, that's one risk Gibb isn't willing to take. Now he just needs to charter a plane to Florida so he can stop the wedding-fast! Normally, bombshell pilot Sophia Cruz would have told Slick City Boy exactly where to go. Unfortunately, she really needs cash-even if it does come from an overprivileged guy with a very fine backside. But then disaster strikes midair, and Sophia is forced to crash-land the plane.... Now they're alone on a stunning deserted island-and surrounded by temptation. And this is one collision they won't be able to walk away from!",
