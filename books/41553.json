  "description": "No other Canadian novelist is lauded and read as widely outside his homeland as Robertson Davies. His characters fascinate, and his gentle, graceful style makes no demands on the reader. His civilized prose should read well aloud--indeed, Davidson helps one hear its strengths. He provides an intelligent, expressive, well-paced rendering of the narrative about a Canadian university professor, as well as vivid impersonations of the characters. However, he has trouble with the \"authorial voice.\" In his mouth, the narrative has a sarcastic, even cynical, edge, whereas Davies's words, though not without humor and irony, are far more empathetic",
