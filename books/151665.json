But neither of them are prepared for the day when everything changes, and the lawless life they’ve been carrying out is irrevocably altered.  When he agreed to accompany the shipment of money into Kansas for his latest benefactor, Jarett never thought that anyone would dare to try and steal it from him. He realizes he was greatly mistaken when he comes face to face with two thieves, and the robbery goes horribly wrong. Now on the hunt for the boy that shot him, he is determined to uncover the bandits and have his revenge before moving further west.  Jarett isn’t ready for the stonewall he comes face to face with when dealing with the townspeople though. Nor is he prepared for the enigmatic Alexandra Harris when she appears in the mercantile. Determined to get closer to Alexandra, he’s thrown off by her insistent refusal of him. Fighting against her growing attraction to a man she knows would prefer to see her hung if he uncovered the truth, Alexandra tries to stay far away from Jarett. The more they are forced together though, the more she realizes that the man she considers her enemy is the only one that could save her ravaged heart…  If he doesn’t kill her first.",
