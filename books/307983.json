  "description": "\"No one should die in silence. May I suggest a playlist?\" The new Martian base, Tenacity, was dug by rovers and tested by the Forerunner crew. But when the first long-term crew is on its way, catastrophe strikes.Miranda Oceveda and Caleb Wexler are the sole survivors. In the caverns and tunnels that comprise the new Tenacity base—still scheduled to have over a thousand residents by 2110—they do their work diligently, but they are plagued by their losses.When NASA uploads an AI assistant and entertainment database to the Tenacity system, Caleb and Miranda both welcome it. Sure, it’s a little pushy with its recommender engine (Ero was originally a proprietary personality for Amazon), but it’s handy, comes with tons of media, and supposedly has a good psychiatric therapy function. But when Miranda is starting to get reckless with her safety and Caleb is lying about his tasks... They both have to grapple with what Ero has become to them, and whether silence isn't the safer option .A pair of shell-shocked astronauts struggle to survive on Mars in a suspenseful science fiction adventure that mixes near-future hard science, AI, and planetary exploration.",
