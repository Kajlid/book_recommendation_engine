  "description": "[Siren Erotic Alternative Contemporary Consensual BDSM Romance, M/M, HEA] At thirty-one, Bryce is a damned good attorney, but it feels like that's all he's got going for him right now. He's just about given up on finding a boyfriend, much less a submissive, and his dreams of being a father look increasingly slim. Then mutual friends in the Suncoast Society take over. Dustin is relatively new to the area. The realtor thinks his friends are wasting their time fixing him up, especially since Bryce is fifteen years younger than him. No younger guy has ever wanted him before. Except this feels like forever in a scary-fast way. Bryce is not only okay with Dustin not wanting kids, he's also the Dom of Dustin's dreams. Enter Kira, Bryce's lifelong best friend. She's about to make Bryce's dreams come true with a devastating price. Dustin knows he owns Bryce's heart, but can he accept the guy he loves marrying a woman whose last wish is that Bryce be by her side? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
