Lena was created for one purpose, to rescue a race that is commonly thought of as extinct. Her body has been shaped to carry out her task, but when she has completed her assignment it is up to her creators to determine her fate. Life as a full sized being, or a minute woman in the tiniest city in the Coalition. (Thumbelina could never have imagined this.)",
