  "description": "My name is Ted Spark. I am 12 years and 281 days old. I have seven friends.Three months ago, I solved the mystery of how my cousin Salim disappeared from a pod on the London Eye.This is the story of my second mystery.This summer, I went on holiday to New York, to visit Aunt Gloria and Salim. While I was there, a painting was stolen from the Guggenheim Museum, where Aunt Gloria works.Everyone was very worried and upset. I did not see what the problem was. I do not see the point of paintings, even if they are worth Â£9.8 million. Perhaps that's because of my very unusual brain, which works on a different operating system to everyone else's.But then Aunt Gloria was blamed for the theft - and Aunt Gloria is family. And I realised just how important it was to find the painting, and discover who really had taken it.",
