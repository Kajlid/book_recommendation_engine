  "description": "On an L.A. talk show Arthur C. Clarke was once asked to name his favorite writer. His answer was \"Larry Niven\". Countless others agree. The Baltimore Sun and Kirkus Reviews have both dubbed Niven \"the premier writer of hard SF\", and Gregory Benford has hailed him as \"the paradigm of SF personality of the last several decade\".Now Larry Niven presents us with his undisputed masterwork. N-Space contains, very simply, the best SF of his career, marvelous fiction, a wealth of anecdotes and gossip, plus Niven's own special brand of wit and excitement. This retrospective collection features such classic tales of science fiction as \"Inconstant Moon\" and \"The Hole Man\", previously uncollected works including the novellas \"Brenda\" and \"The Kiteman\", and essays, anecdotes, and observations.Contents: *Introduction: The Maker of Worlds (1990) • essay by Tom Clancy *On Niven (1992) • essay by Frederik Pohl, Steven Barnes, David Brin, John Hertz, Wendy All, Gregory Benford *Dramatis Personae (1990) • essay by Larry Niven *Foreword: Playgrounds for the Mind (1990) • essay by Larry Niven *From World of Ptavvs (excerpt) (1990) / shortfiction by Larry Niven *Bordered in Black (1966) / shortstory by Larry Niven *Convergent Series (1967) / shortstory by Larry Niven (variant of The Long Night) *All the Myriad Ways [Time Travel - Parallel Universe] (1968) / shortstory by Larry Niven *From A Gift From Earth (Excerpt) (1990) / shortfiction by Larry Niven *The Meddler (1968) / novelette by Larry Niven *Passerby [State] (1969) / shortstory by Larry Niven *Down in Flames (1969) • essay by Larry Niven *From Ringworld (Excerpt) (1990) / shortfiction by Larry Niven *The Fourth Profession (1971) / novelette by Larry Niven *\"Shall We Indulge in Rishathra?\" (1978) / shortfiction by Larry Niven; • interior artwork by William Rotsler *Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex (1969) • essay by Larry Niven *Inconstant Moon (1971) / novelette by Larry Niven *What Can You Say About Chocolate Covered Manhole Covers?
