Nine years ago, the island's baby prince was stolen on the streets of London. Now a rescue party, led by a wizard and an ogre, must find him and bring him back. But the kind prince has become a spoilt rich boy, who doesn't believe in magic and doesn't want to go home. Can they rescue him before time runs out - and the doorway disappears for ever?",
