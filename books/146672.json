  "description": "Hold on to your sides for the third and funniest instalment of ‘The Uranus’ space romp trilogy. Journey with the villainous Dr. D’Eath as he threatens to kill the dead people of Lom. Unsuccessful, he moves on to rush the procrastinators of Askme and falls madly in lust with Nyps, so aptly named for her big feet. Meanwhile our hero, Roy, enjoys a few adventures of his own. News of his exploits in the Dead Zone have spread throughout the galaxy and there are those who need his help.Part of his deal with Nev of the Dead Zone was to find Zak from the ‘Kidz Alright’ and to get him to do a gig in exchange for the release of all their prisoners. With both Zak and Nev aboard the Artois there is a final showdown with Dr. D’Eath and Roy uses the Architect’s T.I.T.S. to thwart him, or was it his T.W.A.T? And so the opening three books of our trilogy are done.A book of just over 100,000 words; seasoned with humour and social comment and spiced with a hint of adult language, well quite a bit of that actually.",
