  "description": "Any high schooler on a nerve-wracking first day at a new school is apt to lose his or her head a little, but in Noh-A's case, she literally does! When she wakes up in one piece with a little help from a mysterious doctor, Noh-A quickly realizes that nothing is as it seems at Amityville High, where paranormal creatures battle for supremacy. Caught in the crossfire, Noh-A may have to rely on the unlikely (and possibly unreliable) aid of the most sinister student at Amityville...the deadly Jack Frost!",
