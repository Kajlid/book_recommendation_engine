  "description": "It's all fun and sexy games...until someone gets married...Some women are more dangerous than others. For me, it's like a stoplight. Green means go. Yellow is proceed with caution. And red? Red means you'd best run like hell, because that woman is gonna be serious trouble. The red hair on that hot little Vegas showgirl should be my warning, but I'm a sucker for breaking the rules...Morgan Collins is a dancer with a body meant to bring a grown man to his knees, and keep him there. Yet I can't resist the sexual attractionâ€”intense, fierce as hell, and red-fucking-hot. But I won't let myself get burned after one night of booze and lust. All I have to do is walk away. Except when I wake up the next morning, Morgan is my wife...and all hell is about to break loose.",
