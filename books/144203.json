  "title": "Fragments of Light: A Short Story Set in the World of The Gate",
  "description": "In The Gate’s towering maze of neon and steel, where sunlight rarely reaches the lower levels, Emil creates art from his dreams. A street-level artist in a world of corporate mega-structures, he transforms grimy walls into windows to impossible worlds—vivid landscapes that haunt his sleep and feel more real than the cyberpunk sprawl he calls home.When a mysterious patron offers him access to a hidden chamber in the city's restricted underground, Emil sees his chance to finally capture his visions on a scale matching their intensity. But as his mural takes shape in the naked room, something shifts. The shadows he paints seem to breathe. Colors move when he's not looking. And his dreams bleed into reality, revealing disturbing patterns that connect his mysterious benefactor to an ancient power lurking beneath the city's technological facade.Fragments of Light weaves a haunting tale of artistic obsession in a world where reality itself might be nothing more than humanity's collective dream. In this story of creation and corruption, Emil must decide how much of himself he's willing to pour into his art—before his art consumes him completely.Note from the I wrote this short story during my early exploration of The Gate. As the world has grown and evolved through my current work-in-progress, Threads of the Weaver, I see how it connects to the larger narrative and plan to revisit it in the future. By reading or purchasing this early work, you’re directly supporting the development of The Gate and its ongoing stories—thank you for being part of the journey!",
