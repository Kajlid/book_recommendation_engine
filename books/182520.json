Rowan is summoned home and is immediately mired in family dysfunction better seen in a rear-view mirror. When Jude agrees to help Rowan investigate his stepbrother’s disappearance, Rowan fears his fragile relationship with Jude won’t survive the stress.Being back in his hometown dredges up old fears, a lot of baggage, and murder. Soon Rowan has to decide if he is going to double down on his relationship with Jude, or if it’s wiser to pick up his chips and split for good.",
