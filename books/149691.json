  "description": "Statistically speaking 100% of the population was wiped out, how did Seamus survive? There is a vaccine for the virus ravaging the planet. It's across the country, with his mother. Will Seamus live through the journey? Teen-genius Seamus Robinson is not your typical high school junior. He has sacrificed what is important to most kids his age to pursue his passion for physics. Natural ability and uncommon discipline have allowed him to focus on the development of a dark energy power reactor. Just after his mother leaves on a typical business trip the world is turned upside down when a virus ravages the world. As entire masses of the population are annihilated communication with the remote mother becomes increasingly difficult. When she makes communication from her sanctuary at NASA Ames Research Center in California, she reveals a vaccine just before the Skype video-chat abruptly terminates.",
