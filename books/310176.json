  "description": "For as long as I could remember, I’d had a fear of abandonment.With the exception of my two best friends, Beckett and Ayden, I closed myself off from the world. Loving two boys unconditionally didn’t come without its problems, but my love for them never frayed. At least not until the rope we entwined for ourselves was forced to snap. We were inseparable—until we weren’t.“If love were enough it would save you in every lifetime.” Those are the words my mum lived by. In hindsight, those words were a lesson.
