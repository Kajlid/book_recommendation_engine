  "description": "#1 Bestselling Commission Writer & International Award-Winning Graphic Designer presents: a magical elemental action romance.\nIt’s the night of the Christmas Eve in human world when Arsene’s parents are being ‘collected’ by The Devil himself. Freshly wounded by heart, but weird enough, Arsene asks The Devil of what she can do to redeem them back. Seeing a rather interesting opportunity from the Queen of Noirmelns and the Magistress of Dark Magic, he then make a deal with her. The Devil then hands Arsene a small-scale black skull and asks her.“Are you willing to become a demon?”One pale hand answers that question with an acceptance. Thus begins yet another complicated struggle. Her assignments are to hunt down trespassing and unauthorized demons that comes to the human world and take them back to Hell, where The Devil resides. A thousand demons for both of her parents’ returns is the number of the deal. But can such deal be worth for the comeback of the traitors?Arsene then becomes an immortal demon by night and a mortal wizard by day. What it takes to change back is just going back to the human world and a touch of something that belongs to the Earth. But little by little, becoming a demon just consumes her mortal life until she almost never comes back. Until one day she accidentally drops her skull in the human world, which if she picks up will turn her back to her wizard self. And while her ‘demon minions’ are possibly still around, there is no question that she might be the one being hunted down next.",
