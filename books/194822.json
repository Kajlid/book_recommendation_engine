  "description": "Barely 30 and already washed up, rodeo cowboy Jay Turner has nothing to show for his 12-year career except a few gold buckles and a busted-up knee. The very last thing he needs is career advice from his orthopaedic surgeon, a chilly woman who has obviously never been thrown off a bucking bronco. Instead, Jay decides to lasso the beautiful lady doc with an intimate proposition. Dr. Helen Kinsale's own fast-track career is hanging by a thread as past mistakes and her ex-husband threaten her professional reputation. When Jay offers a no-holds-barred affair, she eagerly accepts the carnal escape from her narrow little world. But the affair quickly turns into something else as they discover a dark sexual compatibility that leads them into new erotic situations and extreme sensations.",
