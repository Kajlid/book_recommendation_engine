  "description": "They won't stay dead!The zombies can't be stopped. From the pitch-black holds of pirate ships and the tunnels beneath the steaming, war-torn jungles of Vietnam, they rise up. And there's no way to slow their shambling march of conquest, no corner of the world or period in history that's safe from the invasion. Secret government labs, the trendy galleries of New York's art scene, and the drawing rooms of nineteenth century England all become the lair of the living dead in this inventive and chilling collection of horror and dark fantasy fiction.",
