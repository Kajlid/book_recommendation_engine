  "description": "Pepper Ryan grew up the troublesome, spoiled child of a rock god. With her less-than-stellar parentage, and the bipolar disorder that has plagued her existence, to say this little firecracker is a handful would be the understatement of the century. Sammy Belle spent more than half his life saving Pepper. He'd been her strength, her sanity, and the protective brotherly figure she never wanted to have. They were never meant to be together. They gave in anyway. And just when Sammy thought he had everything he wanted, Pepper ran. Now twenty-three, Pepper returns to Sugartown, a failed tattoo artist with one too many screws loose who's down on her luck, wielding an ice cream van as beaten up as her heart. Sugartown's most coveted bachelor has always been content with the quiet life he leads until Pepper, the hellion from his past, returns to test his strength, his patience, and perhaps even his sanity. But two can play at that game, and Pepper is about to learn that Sam can give as good as he gets. Can this good country boy survive Pepper's cruel city world, or will the whole thing be put down to a bout of temporary insanity? One thing is for certain: He's crazy about her. She's just crazy. Warning: Intended for an 18+ audience. Contains sexual content, oodles of profanity, a firefighter so hot you may need a very cold shower, and one pink-haired crazy Harajuku girl.",
