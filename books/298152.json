  "description": "With wicked sarcasm and brilliant agility, Catalyst shreds the surface of all his many subjects—gay relationships, backwater adolescence, and spiraling addiction—and ignites a bonfire of personal honesty. Whether he's writing about a chance sexual encounter at a Goth club or revealing the inner thoughts of young hustlers, Catalyst grinds platitudes into toxic dust with a vivid, whip-smart voice.",
