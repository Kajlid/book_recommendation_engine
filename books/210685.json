  "description": "Bridges Spiritual Enlightenment of the East with the Mind and Soul of the West.  Spiritual enlightenment from the Far East has taught the world that true happiness and peace comes from within a wisdom that transcends time and boundaries. As each new generation struggles to find happiness in an ever-changing world overrun by technology and media, few take the inward path to deep, long-lasting peace.  Richard Singer, a psychotherapist, has studied hundreds of Eastern-based writings and given them new life in today s world for people looking to apply this wisdom to the stressful and frustrating aspects of the 21st century. Based on the words of Gandhi, the Dalai Lama, Buddha, Lao-Tzu, and others, Richard Singer has illuminated some of the most profound Eastern quotes with 111 meditations and contemporary applications. Each selection acts as a seed that he expands upon to create a practical meditation for a real-life situation, enabling you to recognize and accept the inner peace of your true being . . . right here, right now.",
