  "description": "The IG Andromeda, a Universal Command Science Ship, had just successfully jumped over 160,000 light years into the Large Magellanic Cloud, giving the ship and its crew the honor of being the first to travel to another galaxy. One of these crewmembers, Donovan Rost, had just been presented with an honorary commission as an Ensign in the Universal Command. The only thing, it seems, that he did to earn such a commission was the fact that he had survived a long time in cryostasis… a very, very long time. Donovan came from a 21st century Earth - an Earth that used to be dominated by humanity. Now, man is a minority and all that he knew of his civilization is buried and almost completely forgotten. He’s about to learn why he and five others were revived and why they were now searching the Large Magellanic Cloud for a technological race that the crew is certain exists somewhere in that galaxy. Scott McElhaney is the award winning author of the Mystic Saga, consisting of the books Indentured, Legacy, Violation, Judgment, and Convergence. Over 125,000 of his books have been downloaded in 2012 alone!",
