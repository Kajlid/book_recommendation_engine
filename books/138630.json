  "title": "Come to Me",
  "description": "This stunning collection of stories takes us into the inner worlds of families, the hidden corners of marriages and affairs and friendships, and introduces us to people whose lives are shaken and changed by love: a grieving mother in need of comfort; a frightened father in need of redemption; wives who become mistresses and regret it, or donâ€™t; a psychiatrist crashing through professional boundaries to provide for her husband and son.Amy Bloom holds her characters close to us as they encounter the everyday mysteries of need and desire, showing us tenderness and humour in the midst of grief and sorrow. She writes the kind of fiction that celebrates the flawed dignity of the human and reminds us all of the fine venture of living in grace and hope in the worlds we are born to and make.",
