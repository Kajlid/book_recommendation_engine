  "description": "A gorgeous, brooding rock god. An unstoppable chemistry we fight to ignore. Desperate passion I want indelibly inked on my soul.Jobless and financially destitute, I have no choice but to see this tour through. Even with my boss hating my guts. A fact he goes out of his way to prove every chance he gets. Lucky for me, the best part of Jasper Diamond is his daughter. But being the nanny on the road with one of the world’s biggest rock bands poses more challenges than I was expecting – including falling for the elusive front man. But with the world chasing after us, how long can we hide what others are determined to exploit? They say there is a thin line between love and hate.That all good things must come to an end.Set on a collision course, nothing could have prepared us for this.Or for what fate has in store for us.",
