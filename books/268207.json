But when her first ever heat cycle hits, she has two choices: get off the planet or find somewhere safe to ride out the heatburns. Determined to never end up mated and trapped in a kitchen, she heads into the Droid district. You can’t mate if the other person isn’t an organic right?Low on funds and preparing for weeks of sexual stupor, Nötchka finds herself in the Nuts in Bolts, a nearly deserted Cozy House with a handful of older models, two of which aren’t even servicing. But the owner, Proto model Avan-8, is willing to trade sex for repairs and Nötchka is desperate. Everything will stay simple with droids… or it would if she didn’t end up liking them all so much. If she can just make it through her heat without too many feelings, avoid the pack of Dendärys males that seem determined to catch her, and figure out why women are going missing, it will all work out. It’s definitely not vekking working out.Good Deeds is a full length, insta-burn, standalone, reverse harem romance novel, starring a fiesty heroine and five fritzing hot android heroes.",
