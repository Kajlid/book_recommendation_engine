  "title": "Freedom through military victory",
  "description": "Can a believer in Jesus Christ serve his country as a soldier, kill the enemy, and at the same time be a good Christian? Can a believer justify being a conscientious objector? Did God contradict Himself in the commandments, “You shall not murder” and “You shall defeat them, then you shall utterly destroy them?” The Bible answers these critical questions. God established a principle by which a nation may guard its sovereignty, maintain its freedom, and protect its citizenry from the horrors of conquest by a foreign power. An alert and stalwart military force averts armed conflict and deters wanton aggression. Yet when an enemy aggressor will not be deterred, then the military must defend and protect those who cannot defend themselves. Men who place a higher value on their wives, families, friends, and nation than on their own lives ensure the survival of our cherished liberty. Just as the Lord Jesus Christ made the greatest sacrifice of all history on the cross—dying so that mankind might have eternal life—so the soldier sacrifices his time, his fortune, and sometimes his life that others might live in freedom. Those of us who are the beneficiaries of these two glorious sacrifices must revere our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and honor the intrepid men who provide freedom through military victory.",
