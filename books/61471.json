  "description": "#2 in the Fairy Compacts series.Before Tammas and Aeron have time to adjust to their new situation, Kamala brings trouble to their door. Firez, her nephew and Tam's old school-friend--and very nearly more--has lost his sister to fairy kidnapping. He can't get her back without fae help.Aeron agrees to help find her, but only if Firez will make a compact: if they manage to save his sister from life as an unwilling fairy thrall, he must give them something they want. So begins a clever, dangerous charade calculated to trick some of the highest, most devious nobles of the Faerie Court. But if Tam doesn't get out of Faerie intact, a compact won't do him, or Aeron, much good at all.Fairy Thrall contains internal illustrations by Ruxandra Lache.",
