  "description": "THE TRANSFORMATION Beth has always been \"The Beast\", that's what everyone at school calls her because of her awkward height, facial scars, and thick glasses. Beth's only friend is geeky, golden-haired Scott. That is, until she's selected to be her choir's soprano soloist, and receives the makeover that will change her life forever. THE LOVE AFFAIR When Beth's choir travels to Switzerland, she meets Derek: pale, brooding, totally dreamy. Derek's untethered passion, for music, and for Beth, leaves her breathless. Because in Derek's eyes? She's not The Beast, she's The Beauty. THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE When Beth comes home, Scott, her best friend in the world, makes a confession that leaves her completely torn. Should she stand by sweet, steady Scott or follow the dangerous, intense new feelings she has for Derek? THE HEARTBREAK The closer Beth gets to Derek, the further away he seems. Then Beth discovers that Derek's been hiding a dark secret from her that could shatter everything.",
