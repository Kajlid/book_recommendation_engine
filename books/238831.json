  "description": "Avery Phoenix  His employees call him The Dragon behind his back. His sister calls him a secret keeper. His personal assistant says he's lucky she didn't quit the first month, like all the others assistants. His brother-in-law tells him to keep his kinky sex games at home.   And Julian Sparks? He's too nervous to say anything at all.  It starts when shy, nervous remote reader Julian Sparks gets called to the home office of Phoenix and Phoenix, a long-standing New York literary agency. Julian recognized a manuscript that was a diamond in the rough, and Avery wants to thank him in person. But to Julian, 'in person' meetings are more terrifying than anything else, and it gets even worse when Avery notices Julian's nails are bitten to the quick.  Julian can't believe this is his life, or that Avery Phoenix, who makes everyone else nervous, actually makes him feel calmer than he's ever felt before.  It ends when - well, does it ever have to end?  Julian thinks he's falling for Avery in a big way, but Avery has some pretty big secrets, maybe big enough to send Julian scurrying for home.",
