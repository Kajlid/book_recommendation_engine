  "description": "Aren has fled the palace, terrified that Av will one day take her life. She tells no one where she is going, no one sees her leave. Too far from the throne for it to be felt by others, Aren find herself in a small village that the rest of the world has forgotten about.Back at the palace, Av is at his wit's end. With court winding down, he has the perfect excuse to explain Aren's absence. When Para brings Anue to court to winter with Aren, Av takes the opportunity to leave the palace before his frustration gets the best of him. Winter is a time of little travel, but how long can Av wait? And why, in the long, dark nights, does he hear queens crying in the darkness, begging for help?",
