  "description": "How happy can a straight man be living life as a gay man? Successful multimillionaire Brian Mallory has just acquired a fabulous new boyfriend, television star John Kaiser. He's also acquired an entire family of colorful characters that has turned his lonely, monotonous life into one surprising misadventure after another. From a flatulating, one-eyed Chihuahua to a pink-tutu'd elf who can't keep his clothes on, the extended Mallory household has more than its share of oddness and eccentricities that keep Brian on his toes.But as Brian and John begin building a future together, can John stop worrying that Brian might leave him for a woman, or for other reasons? Will Brian's arrogance help him or hinder him as he encounters awkward social situations he'd never experienced as a straight man? And the big question: How will Brian's business associates, old friends and family handle his new orientation?Even if both men can overcome their personal obstacles to achieve a long-lasting relationship, will someone (or something) create a tragedy that puts the true meaning of undying love and devotion to the ultimate test?Straight Man Gay Two invites you to once again join Brian and John on their humorous, adventurous and sometimes sad journey of falling in love with the wrong person who turns out to be the right person.",
