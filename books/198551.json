  "description": "As a mother of a 5 year old son who is in kindergarten, I wanted to make books that appealed to him and were easier for him to read on his own while allowing him the opportunity to practice his kindergarten sight words. Dinosaurs Are the Best is that book! It is not only a great and fun book filled with wonderful dinosaurs pictures, but it is also filled with easy to read words and tons of sight words that many young readers are learning in school today. My goal was to make a book that is fun, but is also a good way for beginning readers to practice their reading skills. I hope you and your little ones enjoy it!",
