  "description": "1937 Tensions are brewing in England as World War II threatens. In South London, the Wilsons' anxiety spills over into five-year-old Billy's world. Moreover, his own battle is just beginning. An only child, he longs for a playmate, and when his aunt, uncle and cousin move nearby, he thinks his dream has come true. But cousin Kenneth turns out to be darkly manipulative and envious of Billy's physical sturdiness and material advantages. The envy of greater strength and wider territory that led to Hitler's rise to power is mirrored in the Wilson family.The adoring adults only see Kenneth's porcelain looks, artistic talent and flawless manners. Moreover, Uncle Frank, Kenneth's father, also resents Billy's physical superiority and sets out to bully him. Billy develops a stutter, causing further criticism from the adults and derision from Kenneth.Given his emotionally distant parents, Billy is thrilled by attention from his father's friend, and even more so by secretly seeing his precious Cossack sabre. Under threat of personal and international war, Billy seeks imaginary protection from the sabre. Fantasising that he owns it, this icon sustains him through Uncle's bullying, Kenneth's invasions, an evacuation to the country and the shock of war. But could the icon destroy as well as save him?In a former draft, this book was runner-up in the Yeovil novel prize. It also gained the Editor's Desk on Harper Collins' Authonomy site, winning a full and very positive Harper Collins' critique.",
