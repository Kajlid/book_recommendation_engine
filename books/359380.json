  "description": "Mine is the last face my enemies see… They call me the Reaper. The hitman for my clan, I live in the shadows. I am the executioner of those marked for death. I have one rule - no strings. No attachments. Nobody who can be used against me. Until her. As she tries to save my life, I condemn hers by bringing death to her door. She’s innocent in all this. I'll never touch her, never claim her, but I'll give my life to ensure she remains breathing. No one will take her from me. I swear it.",
