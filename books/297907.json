  "description": "Abby Cortez is a girl with goals, on the verge of turning eighteen and on the brink of stardom. Falling in love isn't just something she doesn't have time for, it's something she doesn't really believe in. Her rule? Date but never, ever fall. Tory Salvatore D'Angelo loves falling in love . . . just not for real. The star basketball player at Allensville Public High gives his heart away one girl at a time then takes it back when he's ready to move on. No serious feelings, no serious pain. They're both good plans until Abby's jaded heart gets all tangled up with Tory's hopeless one. A friendly rivalry grows into friendship, and long talks start to blur the lines. Just one problem--Abby's current boyfriend is Tory's twin brother, Hayden.",
