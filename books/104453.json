  "description": "Librarian's note: Alternate cover edition of ASIN B00CQRHHYC.Some of these poems are bits of moonlight and magic, written just for enjoyment of the written word. Others come from a more serious place, an investigation of ideas clothed in plot and characterization. The styles vary, but the poems are chosen because they somehow matched up as dark fantasies, an expression of mood or a cynical thought or a mysterious magic barely glimpsed that caused the author to reach for a pen and paper. Join the mood. Includes strong language.",
