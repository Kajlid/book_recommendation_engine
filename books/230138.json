  "description": "Trace Bancroft has been in prison for fourteen years, paying for a mistake that cost a man his life. Now released, Trace heads back to Bitter Bark with his mutt, Meatball, and runs into Daniel Kilcannon, who offers to provide some medical care for the dog. Trace knows that would mean seeing Molly Kilcannon, a girl who shared one crazy night with him before his life took a turn for the worst. But when Meatball’s illness intensifies, Trace has no choice. He has to face Molly again and pray she’ll save his dog, no matter what their history. When Trace Bancroft arrives at Waterford Farm with a critically ill dog, Molly Kilcannon’s entire world is rocked to the core. Firmly believing Trace died in a bar fight years ago, Molly never told anyone that the bad boy of Bitter Bark was the father of Prudence Kilcannon, her very good thirteen-year-old daughter. But Molly has promised to tell Pru the truth about her conception, and now that truth is a living, breathing ex-con whose very existence could change everything, including a precious mother-daughter relationship.It doesn’t take long for Molly to realize there’s more to this sexy man than his dark past and tattooed arms. And while the realization that he’s a father is the best thing to ever happen to him, Trace doubts anything could make him worthy of Pru or her spirited veterinarian mother. As they nurse Meatball back to health and grow ever closer, Trace and Molly have to decide when and how to tell Pru the truth. But will the secret that binds their hearts be the very thing that breaks them apart?",
