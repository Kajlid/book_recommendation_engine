  "description": "From the award-winning and #1 bestselling author of  Sufferance and Indians on Vacation When relics of the mysterious Obsidian murders resurface in Chinook, Thumps DreadfulWater is determined to close this case once and for all. Thumps DreadfulWater’s world is turned upside down when Nina Maslow, the producer of a true-crime reality-TV show, turns up dead after working on a cold case that Thumps has spent years trying to forget. What’s more, someone seems set on taunting Thumps, leaving reminders of the Obsidian murder case around town. Is it possible that the elusive serial killer who murdered his girlfriend and her daughter all those years ago has resurfaced in Chinook? Or is this the work of a copycat looking to mess with Thumps by stirring up memories from his past? Dragged back into a case that has haunted him for years, Thumps DreadfulWater is determined to solve the mystery of the Obsidian murders. But as he works the case, he begins to realize just how dangerous the person he is dealing with is—and that he might be the next target. Thumps DreadfulWater, the sly, wry, reluctant investigator of Cold Skies and A Matter of Malice , returns in another irresistible mystery that only Thomas King could create.",
