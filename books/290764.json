  "description": "The darkness holds more than just secrets...\n\n\n\nMarked for death, Sabine escaped from her home more than ten years ago. But the Wild Hunt will never give up.It should have been easy to stay hidden. All Sabine had to do was keep her head down, avoid telling anyone about her past, and above all else -- not let her glamour drop.Even the best-laid plans eventually fall apart.When a charismatic stranger arrives in the city, Sabine finds herself unwittingly drawn to him and the power she can sense hidden within him. Keeping her distance is nearly impossible, especially after a life debt is called due and she’s tasked into helping steal a rare artifact.Sabine is the only one who can break the magical barriers protecting the item, but that means revealing the truth about her identity and exposing her darkest secrets. Unfortunately, the Fae aren’t the only ones hunting her.And the most dangerous monsters aren’t always confined to the dark.",
