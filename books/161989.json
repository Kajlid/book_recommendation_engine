  "description": "A professor in a dental college happens to catch one of his students smoking ganja on the dental college roof top. As per rule he has to be reported and proper punishments have to be given. But the professor decides otherwise. The professor (Dr Mathew) was an addict himself while studying for his undergraduate course. He was saved by a monk like figure. Dr Mathew knows from his experience that punishments are not sufficient to correct the student from a developed bad habit. So he narrates his story that is, how he became an addict and how he had suffered and later how he was saved, to the student, in hope of saving him.",
