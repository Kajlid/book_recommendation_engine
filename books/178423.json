  "description": "Following hot on the heels of Playing For Keeps comes Playing Around, the second book in the racy Scarlet series.  Rugby fanatic Clare has spent her life focusing on herself and her career. When the undeniably charismatic Alex Prince sets his sights on her, she’s sure it’s only to add to the number of ever-growing notches on his bedpost and vows to keep herself away, despite her attraction. Alex has other plans, and when he needs Clare's help in securing a family inheritance, he makes her an offer she can’t refuse. Suddenly, Clare finds herself caught up in more than she can handle.  Clare reassures herself it’s just a business transaction, but sparks fly between them – and wonders, is there more to lose than what’s on just the surface?",
