  "description": "In 1937, as the adults worry about the onset of war, Billy's has just begun. He so wanted a play-mate but it came in the form of a manipulative cousin, the frail and artistic Kenneth. The adults only see the porcelain looks of Kenneth and not his darker soul. Emotionally neglected or misunderstood by parents and aunt, and bullied by uncle and cousin, Billy imagines he owns the precious Cossack sabre of his father's work colleague. This sabre becomes an icon that sustains Billy through Kenneth's psychological invasions, through disruption and evacuation and then the shock of war, but might this icon damage as well as protect?",
