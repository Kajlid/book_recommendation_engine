  "description": "“A Tale of Two Masks: A Transgender Psychopath’s Search for Realization and Restraint\" builds upon existing accounts of psychopathic individuals in a way that is brutally transparent and honest. It is a memoir of an introspective, transgender psychopath that offers hope for a demographic often written off as “broken.” It paints the condition in a way that is relatable by those who are antisocial and that is insightful for the “neurotypical.” In addition, it gives a rare voice - that of a transgender woman - to the subject of mental illness. A Tale of Two Masks challenges what it means to be male or female, and, more importantly, human.",
