She tries to fight off her assailant, but luckily the attempt ends in failure when mysterious business magnate Oliver Black intervenes.  Sophie doesn’t know it, but the stakes are her life and her heart. Desperately needing support, she turns to a few trusted people, and to Oliver most of all. But can he be trusted, who speaks the truth, and the question on everyone’s who is the man in the mask?  Her checkered past returns to entangle her. She will come to realize that it is not dead after all…it is still very much alive.  A Diamond in the Rough is a love story, a thriller, funny in parts and moving in others.
