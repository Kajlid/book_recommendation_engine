  "title": "The Perfect Deceit",
  "description": "Centered in the espionage sphere, the novel offers an interesting insight into the world of spying for political and corporate reasons. In today’s interconnected world, espionage plays a role in the competition for resources and know-how. The drama comes from masterful mind games and encompasses the humanity, fallibility and the passions that drive people in the murky world of espionage, where things do not always turn out the way one expects. It is an engaging spy thriller and makes for compelling reading by portraying the intrigue of agents, double-agents and those who get caught in between. It shows how cynicism can dominate discourse between countries.Set in present-day Washington, D.C., the story revolves around Russian agent Alexey Petrov and his quest to infiltrate U.S. government agencies by using single women or so-called ‘secretary-spies’ in order to obtain and transmit classified information to Moscow.",
