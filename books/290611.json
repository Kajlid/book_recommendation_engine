  "description": "It wasn’t meant to be this way.  Corsair Academy was supposed to be my fresh start in life. I started working out. My skin was perfect. And now I was going out to parties instead of hiding myself under a blanket at home. Not even running into Gino Viscola fazed me at all. What was that psychopath that tortured me for years looking for? To make the matters even worse, Gino was ruling the college I got accepted to. He alongside a gang of boys just like him called The Chevaliers .All of them were filthy rich, handsome to the bone and wicked beyond belief. Despite all of this The Chevaliers didn’t scare me. I knew how my world wanted to be and I wasn’t about to play their game until the night that I had to and that’s how the circus began. My eyes saw what something that wasn’t destined for me and I became an even bigger target. I became Masked. The Chevaliers will do anything in their power to break me, but none of the silver-spoon-fed members know what terrors I’ve faced. They don’t know what I’ve seen with my eyes. I’ve seen and felt pain before. If they are willing to mess with Skylar Borgstein … so be it.  Masked is a reverse harem college bully romance with a pinch of suspense. This book contains dark themes, sexual scenes and foul language. If you don’t have a problem with that, leap in! The preorder date will be pulled in!",
