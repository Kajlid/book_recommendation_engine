Authentic recipes-adapted for modern kitchens-from the period are featured, including Chicken Farced, Smothered Rabbit, and White Leach. Accentuated with striking visuals, this history revives the sights, sounds, and smells of the Tudor kitchen while conveying the daily life of the era?s rich and poor.",
