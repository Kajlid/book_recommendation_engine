  "description": "I was naïve to think my marriage to Luka Catano might work.I was infatuated with him from afar…Until I met him.He loved the challenge of his next conquest, anyone would do...Except me.A wife was never something he wanted.Torturous was not a strong enough word to describe how I felt when I was in a room with Luka. Besides hating nearly every word that came out of his mouth, I also drowned with lust every time I looked at him. At times I thought he might feel the same.But nothing prepared me for what his family would make me become.*There will be four books in the Kingdoms of Sin series. Each book can be read as a standalone though there are interconnecting characters.*Book 1: Downfall is LIVE! (Luka and Eden)Book 2: Exposed January 9, 2020 (Mara and Elias)Book 3: Ruin March 5, 2020 (Ava)Book 4: May 7, 2020 (Jadon)",
