  "description": "We walked off the ferry along the wide, sloping gangplank, and when my feet hit the firm wooden planks of the jetty, I staggered, legs suddenly feeling like jelly. I took Mum's hand, whispering, 'Are we really safe here?' After a perilous and terrifying journey from war-torn Afghanistan, Gulnessa and her family find themselves in Australia, a place they know nothing about. They are exhausted and traumatised, but so full of hope. At last-somewhere safe to call home. But they soon discover that their struggle isn't over yet. They are imprisoned in a detention centre for illegal immigrants, and forced to prove their refugee status. As the days drag into weeks and months, Gulnessa is determined to stay strong. She must keep her family together, and fight for Abdul, her special friend from home, with whom she has secretly fallen in love. She can never give up hope, of a temporary protection visa, and a chance to build a future in a beautiful foreign land.",
