  "description": "Hotel Glencovie, 2013\nResearching her family tree brings Moirag McLellan to the Highlands and a foreboding castle-turned-hotel. She goes to sleep alone surrounded by modern amenities, but awakens in a room lit only by candles�and occupied by a gorgeous kilted man. And he's far too real to be just an erotic dream…\nGlencovie Castle, 1715\nThough Gavin MacIver doesn't know how the lusty wench in barely-there clothing came to be in his bed, he knows he never wants her to leave. But if her story of time-travel is true, how can he stop the only woman he's ever loved from slipping through his fingers once darkness fades into dawn?",
