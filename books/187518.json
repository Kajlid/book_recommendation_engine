  "description": "It was the first day of school and anxieties were running high. For certain there was the excitement of moving up a grade, but there was also the dread of anything and everything that could go wrong. Not only were the possibilities endless, they were totally out of your control. Whether or not you were accepted rested squarely on the shoulders of the popular kids. Suppose you were too short or too tall; too smart or not smart enough; too rich or too poor; or just plain different? These thoughts were fresh on the minds of Otis, Chandler and Marissa. Three pre-teens whose paths had never crossed, although they lived in the same town in Connecticut. Their backgrounds were so diverse they may as well have lived worlds apart. That was all about to change when on their way to school a series of bizarre events lump them together. Literally! Join them on this unreal journey to alternate realities never before reÂ­vealed. Go back in time to a parallel past, the All Agos. Coexist in a present experience that mirrors your own, the Ne'er Now. Finally and with greater understanding, manifest in a future of your creation, the Will Be Once. Then you will have come closer to achieving ...as it should.",
