  "description": "Beautiful girls are not hard to find at Columbia River University. The coeds on campus are great to look at but I was over that scene after graduation three years ago.These days, outside of being part of the largest civil engineering job on campus, all I’m searching for is a decent meal and some peace and quiet. It’s why I’m happy to have found what I consider a hidden gem in the diner I frequent.All I need to do is finish this job and move on to the next by year's end. Should be easy enough. Only when Vanessa walks up with a sexy smile and a mouth full of sass, she does more than take my order. She completely takes my breath away. Next thing I know, I’m here every morning, making every excuse to dine with this intriguing woman. Not only is she smart and sexy, but she’s laser focused on reaching the goals she’s set for herself. The more I get to know her, the more I’m convinced she's the one. I just have to find a way to get her to deviate from her perfectly laid plans and take a chance on me.",
