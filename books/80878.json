  "title": "The Well-Trained Human",
  "description": "Finally, an authoritative manual with step by step instructions for the conscientious canines who want to train their humans properly. Every dog who is considering a human of his own, needs to read this book! Without fail, Tommy's advice will produce a happy healthy and well-trained human. Even the spiritual development of your human is thoughtfully examined and considered. No dog should even think of trying to co-habit with a human before reading this book. Tommy, born blind and deaf, has an almost eerie grasp and understanding of human behavior. While this may be the funniest book you will read this year, it will also make you think seriously about how we treat each other, and our dogs.",
