  "description": "RoxanneRacing and Ross are the only two things I thought I could ever count on. That is, until one of them sends me far away, making me lose the other.Now, stuck with a cousin I’m not sure even wants me here trying to pick up the scattered pieces of my life, all I want to do is find my own way.Who cares if I’m slightly attracted to the asshole who seems to run these parts? Or that I’m starting to find his little tests exciting?Who cares that the abandonment I felt from the people I thought were my family fades as I find a new group to grow close to.It doesn’t mean anything. In the end, I’ll be gone, right?RomanI knew she was going to be trouble the minute I got the call she was coming. I didn’t expect her to light my blood on fire, though.Now, she’s slowly integrating herself into my life, one irritatingly yet sexy glare at a time.It doesn’t matter that I think the fact that she knows her cars is a huge turn on. Or that I crave having her near me.The fact that I’m itching to protect her has nothing to do with the way she makes me feel.There’s no room in the inner circle for new blood. So why does she seem to fit right in?",
