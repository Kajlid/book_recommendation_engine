  "title": "The House of the Vampire Queen",
  "description": "Nearly two years after the fall of Dr. Venjamin and Sangre Valley, Valerie Murray and her family have picked up the pieces of their lives and begun over again on the white beaches and blue seas of the Caribbean. Valerie has her first lead role in the community theater; her children are typical teenagers-John, moody and distance; Amelia has her first boyfriend; and Harry . . . is, well, Harry. Life is anything but a paradise though. The family has become somewhat of a freak show among the vampiric world. Vampires from all around the globe visit the island just to get a glimpse of the living vampires and the woman who destroyed the evil doctor and his legacy. There are whispered rumors that Valerie is the legendary Vampire Queen of ancient times, returned to unite vampires and humans under her reign-a title Valerie wants nothing to do with. But when Dr. Venjamin's technology resurfaces and threatens not only Valerie's new life but the life of all vampires, she just might be the only who can protect them.",
