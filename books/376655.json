  "description": "The Fates do enjoy their little amusements.Storm O’Malley thought she’d always be a beat cop. But when she helped catch a serial murderer, she became a detective and a member of the elite Homicide squad. Now she’s got a murder to solve and a new reason to call on the gorgeous professor she met on the Dean case.The first time Professor Tristan Lisalli met Storm, she was off limits because he couldn’t afford to get mixed up in a high-profile case. No supernatural could. Much less a noble of the Sidhe court. But after that case was solved, he’d fully intended to challenge his cousin Pierce with the seduction of a woman-with the seduction of Storm. But now Storm is involved in another high-profile case. A murder again, but with a difference. Treasure.No fey creature can resist the legendary Medici Chalice of Eros. But if what Tristan suspects is true, then the real treasure is Storm. He thinks she just might be his forever wife-and Pierce’s as well.",
