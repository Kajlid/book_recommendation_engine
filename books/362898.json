  "description": "This book has more than one point of view. If you prefer to avoid multiple perspectives, this book may not be your cup of tea.Three years have passed since the events of the last book. William and Cameron are now sixteen-years-old and have manifested more powers for the first time since they turned seven. The boys have always wondered why Cyrus targeted their community of all places on Zartoto and often wonder if there is more to it other than the fact their family is powerful. The two boys, along with Hayden, and a friend of theirs, Andrew, decide to investigate the family's past to see if they can find any patterns. What they don't expect is to uncover horrifying secrets from their grandparents' past. Can the family recover from the discovery?",
