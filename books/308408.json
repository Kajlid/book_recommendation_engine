  "title": "The Beginner",
  "description": "Poetry. Across several decades, Lyn Hejinian has been constructing an exemplary and profoundly influential body of exploratory work, work of a discrepant lucidity that undermines commonplace assumptions of the permissible and the possible. Her poetry and her prose, as well as her frequent artistic collaborations, probe with incisive wit and formal invention fundamental questions of subjectivity and community, content and communication, gender and expressivity. THE BEGINNER was originally published in a limited edition in 2001 by Spectacular Books, and is now being reprinted by Tuumba Press. \"I'm beginning, and thinking that I think myself launched into something, but the actual beginning has occurred long before and as a result the thought that \"I'm beginning\" is not a beginning but a pause, a phrase, though one incorporated into a beginning (the beginning concealed around it).\"",
