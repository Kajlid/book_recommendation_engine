  "description": "Maybe I would have claimed her more gently if she didn't beg for it... but probably not.After watching over this world for millennia, a girl wandering in the woods should have been of no interest to me. But the moment I saw her bathing in a stream, I knew Emma was mine.I kept myself from throwing her over a fallen tree and ravaging her... but only for a few hours.If she had been obedient, I might have held instinct at bay a little longer. It was the scent of her helpless arousal as I reddened her bare bottom that tore away the last vestiges of my self-control.But it would have made no difference in the end.Sooner or later, she was always going to scream my name as I mounted and rutted her.A beast must claim his mate.Publisher's Note: Guardian includes spankings and rough, intense sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book.",
