  "description": "The Children of Heaven is a collection of poems and stories about children who suffer and die too young and the parents they leave behind. There is a mixture of sadness and life-firming hope in the stories and poetry in this book and it is my hope that those who have lost children will find meaning here and those who haven't will be inspired by the writing.",
