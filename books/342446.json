  "description": "Sara Mosby was a brilliant young history professor at a university near Seattle and loved teaching and her research. Lately, however, her life had turned sour. Several irresponsible students--particularly some athletes--sought to get easy grades by making trouble for her. They complained to her new department chair, who seemed willing to do anything to deny Sara tenure. She was intrigued when a tall handsome man watched one of her classes from the hallway, then asked for direction in a self-study program. Now if she could just keep her mind on History when he smiled at her... Joshua Weathers was a pro basketball player, and the toast of Seattle--constantly in the public eye. Seeking to continue his education, which he had cut short for a basketball career, he chanced upon a dynamic class given by a small, black woman. He was fascinated by her lecture as well as by the woman herself. Could she serve as his mentor? Could she become more?",
