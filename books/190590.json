  "title": "The Brotherhood",
  "description": "\"There I was standing shoulder to shoulder with fourteen other guys just a couple of days after arriving at Kingsland University in Connecticut, a private school for the sons and daughters of society’s elite; not exactly what I was expecting to be doing a week before school started, let me clue you. But I have to admit that’s exactly where I wanted to be standing. I don’t even know why I’m writing this because if the Brotherhood ever found out I chronicled my time as a pledge I would more than likely lose everything. I guess I’m doing it for my own sanity; to make sure that everything I went thru was worth it.\"  Follow Jacob into the world of The Botherhood, secret college organization, and discover along with him not all is what it seems.",
