Still, something compels her to leave the palace to take up a difficult life of study with godmother, Euny. The harsh but wise woman proceeds to teach the girl about herbs, healing, and the magic within nature.It is not until Juniper returns home a year and a day later that she begins to understand the purpose of her training. Meroot, her power-hungry aunt, is using black magic in an attempt to seize the throne. Meroot has not only placed a terrible curse on the countryside but also threatened the life of Juniper's unborn brother--the future king of Cornwall. Armed only with her new, untested powers, Juniper must find a way to stop Meroot--before the kingdom itself is destroyed.The prequel to the spellbinding fantasy Wise Child, Juniper evokes a distant era when spiritual and earthly powers were inextricably entwined.",
