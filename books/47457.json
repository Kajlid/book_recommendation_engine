  "description": "When the mercenary Caledon meets a young man named Hadrian he falls instantly, hopeless in love with him. But Hadrian is a mystery: shy and secretive, hailing from an island supposedly inhabited by sorcerers; he has come to Caledon's city to recruit the mercenaries for a well-paying job offered by Hadrian's father... but it is a lie. Hadrian is far more dangerous than his gentle disposition would suggest, and what he wants with Caledon and the mercenaries of Rhiad will change the land of Juxtan forever and set in motion a prophecy that will bind two men together in love and hatred until death.",
