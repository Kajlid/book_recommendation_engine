  "description": "The virgin Bachelor Sean Lowe reveals the challenges of finding love while championing his Christian convictions in the morally complex world of reality TV.After The Bachelorette broke his heart, Sean Lowe suspected his nice guy image hurt him. The show never emphasized it, but Sean committed to living according to biblical standards of sexuality, even as producers emphasized the risque and promiscuous. A Texas boy from a Baptist home, Sean tells the story of how he went from a Division I college football player to a fan favorite on reality television, taking readers behind the scenes of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette to see the challenges of living out his values and faith and ultimately winning his true love s heart.For the Right Reasons is about the journeys we all have to take in the real world, where being good is the right thing to do but sometimes doesn't seem to be enough; where betrayal is commonplace; and where that thing called perfection is actually just a cruel myth. Sean learned a few things from his two seasons on the hottest romance shows on television, and he wants others to benefit from those lessons: good does eventually win, lies will be discovered, and nice guys do ultimately finish first.\"",
