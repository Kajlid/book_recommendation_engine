  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Abigail just finished her junior year of high school. Her relationship with her parents is distant, but she has a tight group of friends. Everything is pretty normal...except a little secret she's kept from everyone about her cousin, Kelly. But even this secret--which Abby more or less brushes off--will pale in comparison to what she's about to discover. A half-remembered car crash, a new boy at school, and an old friend with secrets of his own: Abigail's entire life is about to be turned upside down when she finds out that not only are angels and demons real, but she's a part of that world as well.Now available @ B&N and Amazon. (June 2012)",
