  "title": "GABRIEL 3: Heroes and Villains",
  "description": "One man lost in a dark world. Will a hero arise to bring back the light? His heart and life shattered when Cole learns of his “betrayal”, Gabe is thrust deeper into Quinton’s twisted world of sex and perversion with no lifeline to cling to. Having cut himself loose from his ‘club’ family, Gabe sinks into a dark abyss, believing it will swallow him up. But the boys of the Phoenix refuse to let go of one of their best without a fight, determined to pull Gabe back from the brink. Without Cole’s love to grab onto, though – Gabe has minimal strength of will to care what happens to him, knowing that it will hurt more to go home to the Phoenix when the man he loves no longer loves him back.",
