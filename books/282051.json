  "description": "** Please note that Beautiful Legend is a STANDALONE and is NOT part of The Darlington Elite Series**He barged into my life my junior year of college. Brooding, mysterious, and barely talks to anyone—Joshua Travin is allegedly as skilled in the bedroom as he is on the rugby field. He’s everywhere I go, always watching. Despite his obvious distaste for me, I find a familiar comfort in his green eyes. I’ve spent every day since I was seven hiding my past, trying to forget the attack that killed my mother and my sister. The attack I barely survived. Now, I never let anyone in. Even the people who would consider me a friend? They don't know the real me. But this time, Joshua won't let me hide.",
