  "description": "In the ancient, pagan rite of Taurobolium, the slaughtering of the sacred bull is at the center of the ritual. In those times, the practice was performed every twenty years and gave a chosen citizen a life of renewal, support, fitness and success from the animals blood. The recipient was placed under the platform of the slain bull so that the blood would slowly drip down through the platforms tiny holes. The blood would nearly cover the persons entire body. Much later in the ritual's development, people believed that the chosen person received great power.The modern bullfight came from this ancient ritual. Many changes had been made by taking it out of the ritual realm and placing it in the sports/entertainment arena. But who could imagine that modern man would practice a certain bloody descendant of Taurobolium in the forest of a midwestern town? This became a cultic, sadistic ritual for the few chosen men who changed it into a corrupt and most evil endeavor.",
