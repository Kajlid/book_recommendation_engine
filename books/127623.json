His dirty if he doesn’t bed a different woman every month he’ll turn feral--and he’s bored to death with mindless sex.  When he hunts down his escaped war dragon, his enemies trap him on earth and strip his powers. His month’s almost up and if he doesn’t bed someone soon, his beast will rise.  Meena’s to be good at something. Anything. Even sticking to a diet. Her she’s a failed witch masquerading as human. She accidentally bonds with Leonidas’s escaped dragon. Sparks fly when he wants it back. Plunged into a world of stuck-up Fae, evil elves, and high-adventure they must solve a twenty-two-year-old mystery. Along the way, they tumble into bed, and lust leads, unexpectedly, to love.  When Leonidas’s curse kicks in again, he’ll have to abandon Meena and bed another. Is their love strong enough to survive their secrets and break the ancient curse?",
