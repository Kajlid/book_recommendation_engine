  "description": "A home renovation show brings them together ~ will they update more than an apartment?Paige I need my independence.My parents’ apartment is a battlefield, and I can’t wait to escape. So, when my brother’s best friend asks me to partner with him on a home renovation reality show competition, I’m all in. The fact that I’m wildly attracted to him and he seems determined to friendzone me is irrelevant. It’s not like I need a new romance. Or so I thought… Jesse I’ve been living someone else’s life. When my sister died, I fulfilled her potential. I never really focused on my own. Until now. With Paige’s help, I have a shot at finally making my dreams come true. I know I have what it takes to be a great carpenter. But do I have what it takes to keep my mind—and hands—off Paige? Seems unlikely… They’re complete opposites with nothing in common but a little forced proximity, and an incredibly inconvenient attraction. Will competition bring them closer to happily ever after—or heartbreak?",
