  "title": "Rees Howells: Intercessor",
  "description": "Rees Howells was a man peculiarly taught of God: one who learned the Bible as the Spirit made him live it. Every chapter of this biography is full of drama and light, showing how he faced the implications of an entire surrender, learned to love the unlovely, found the key to prevailing prayer, became the channel of a mighty revival in Africa, was taught the principles of divine healing, and progressed ever further in faith until world events were affected by his prayers.Here are rich truths of the Spirit for all the Church of Christ today, inherent in a story told with simplicity, humanity, and humor enough to captivate any reader.",
