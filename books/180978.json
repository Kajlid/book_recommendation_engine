Or will they find it is not at all what it seems?  Opprobrium: The Dregs, ancient wraiths jumping from host to host, have invaded the island of Merith with their werewolf servants. Fleeing the invasion and their own country’s Army, four Merithians discover many secrets in the shadows and the truth of Merith’s lies. Aided by elves, mercenaries, satyrs, and piks, these young Merithians learn why it is imperative to the entire world that they escape.",
