  "description": "The author of the #1 New York Times bestseller The FairTax Book offers a new look at the fast-growing populist tax reform movement that’s poised to become a key campaign issue for 2008 In 2005, firebrand radio talk show host Neal Boortz and Georgia congressman John Linder teamed up to create The FairTax Book, the first book devoted to the FairTax movement they had been promoting for years. Riding the growing groundswell of popular support for the tax reform measure, The FairTax Book became an overnight sensation. As the election season heats up, Boortz and Linder return to add fuel to the fire with this radical follow-up. Talking back to the critics who have grossly misrepresented the simple principles behind the tax reform measure―which would abolish the IRS and replace it with a 23 percent retail sales tax on all new goods and services―Boortz and • Debunk myths about the tax and answer critical charges―that it would bankrupt the economy, that it would leave poor people in the lurch, that the math doesn’t work • Offer new insights into aspects of the plan not originally covered • Show the American voter that there’s still hope of replacing our currently outdated, corrupt,and punitive income tax system with a simple plan that will revolutionize the way American pays for itself.",
