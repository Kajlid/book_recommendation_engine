  "description": "In his debut novel 'YEVAL', C.W. Schultz explores the differences between the portrayal and reality of violence. Randy Mulray is on the threshold of madness, envisioning incommunicable murders in a room (called the 'Dark Room') he is mentally forced into by a monster named Yeval. A horror story like never before, 'YEVAL' flirts with the notion that violence in entertainment is too shallow and appealing for audiences to really grip the iniquity and futility.",
