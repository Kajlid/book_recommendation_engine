  "description": "Victoria suffers the normal troubles of every homework deadlines, a protective mother who keeps knives under her pillow, a missing father, and if she's not careful, Victoria falls into her paintings. Ok, so, not so normal problems. The paintings that lead to other realities are Gateways, and all is not well in the worlds outside our own. A shift in power is brewing as a search for an ancient weapon, the same weapon Victoria's father swore to protect, forces her to choose between remaining under the protection of her mentor or going on her own to find her father. If the weapon falls into the wrong hands, every world will suffer (insert evil laugh here).Reader's Den Gold MedalistReader's Favorite FinalistChanticleer Reviews Winner",
