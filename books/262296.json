  "description": "Even though she was acquitted, it seems that everyone-even her own parents-believes that Zoe helped her best friend, Aimee, commit suicide. Now, months later, her family has moved to a new town to escape the stigma of the trial, and Zoe is completely cut off from her group of friends. In her new life Zoe is paralyzed by loneliness, guilt, and anger at everyone's suppression of the truth. As she writes in her journal, Zoe gradually lets readers into her world, a world where parents don't listen, therapists don't help, and best friends betray you. In the end Zoe realizes that she never could have saved Aimee, but she might be able to save herself.",
