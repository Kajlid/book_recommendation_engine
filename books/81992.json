Werewolves mate for life, and normally when a mate dies the other is soon to follow, but Sugar won’t and Jack’s ghost isn’t giving up yet. He wants what every werewolf wants…a forever mate, and if Sugar won’t die naturally he’s willing to force the situation.In this story Sugar makes several willing sacrifices for her freedom and that of her Pack – some of which that will haunt her forever, and one that puts her in debt to a Reaper.",
