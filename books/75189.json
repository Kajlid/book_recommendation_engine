When she met the self destructive Tristan, who has abilities of his own, Ruby joined a tight-knit crew of super powered criminals. Led by the crazed, fire conjuring Madison, the group runs rampant through the moonlit streets of Seattle taking what they want and leaving lifeless bodies in their wake. For six years now, Ruby has been using her powers for self gain and destruction. Her mind that can easily kill a person with a simple command is beginning to fight back with an arsenal of nightmares and hallucinations. As Ruby watches Tristan disappear further behind his drug addiction, she finds herself stealing more time alone with their friend and crew member, Brody. While her crew fights for more money and territory, Ruby struggles with who she has become. When Ruby secretly disobeys one of Madison’s orders, to kill a homeless teenage girl, she finds herself in a whirlwind of wrong decisions, lies, and realizations she isn’t ready to face. Can Ruby walk away from the closest thing she has to family and be the hero she is truly meant to be? A tormenting and emotional tale of self discovery, The Adventures of Miss Mind Shift is the first installment in the series, Emerald City Nights.",
