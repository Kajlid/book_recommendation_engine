  "description": "The tiny, hard to find town of Waresville is a magical place but not the rainbows and glitter kind. Here, the supernatural rule the show, the entire town's economy based on the spooky ambiance. There's not a soul in Waresville that doesn't know the score. Without spooky tours, magic shops, and an unexplainable murder every couple of weeks, this town would be bankrupt. Unfortunately for the citizens, magic is never simple, and it can take as quickly as it gives. All over Waresville, counterfeit bills with a phony, pimple-faced Andrew Jackson are popping up. And then disappearing. In a matter of hours, the fake money dissolves into a cloud of green dust, leaving the shop keepers broke. Businesses are shutting down left and right in Waresville, and not even the revenue from the annual dance competition can keep this little town afloat. Harper Beck, stage name Foxxy, has got her own problems to deal with, and they have nothing to do with missing money. Wyatt, her delicious, detective boyfriend, wants to marry her. With Harper's commitment issues and deep-rooted fear of letting her new family down, she runs in the opposite direction, right toward the counterfeit case. And if disappearing money, broke friends, and a confrontation with her past wasn't enough, Harper has some new, magical neighbors that are just a little too interested in her. This Christmas season, nothing is what it seems in Waresville. Can Harper take a bite out of crime and confront her fears before crime takes a bite out of her? Novella (approx. 40,000 words). Sixth Volume of the Harper \"Foxxy\" Beck Mystery Series. It is a standalone (reading prior or future volumes not required to enjoy the book, no cliffhanger).",
