  "description": "STAND ALONE NO CLIFFHANGERS. My original plan was to break this up into several installments, but I’m looking for long-term fans and I know your time and money is valuable to you. So instead of stringing you along I 'm giving you the entire novel for one low price. Enjoy! Jean Russell  Sam – He has the pedigree....money, power, and looks. However, there are rumors about Ace Erickson – rumors that go well beyond his fascination with brunettes, and how he conducts his business. As a former fighter, turned hairstylist for the dead, I'm not afraid of the Boogie Man or things that go bump in the night but Ace is not like any other man. And when those beautiful brown eyes focus in on me I swear he is looking for something – something only he can see. Will his desire for the truth put me in danger or will my lies destroy the both of us. Ace – After searching all of my life for the Girl in Red I finally have a name, Samantha. When I found her hiding in the shadows of the mortuary I thought to myself – surely this can't be her. But isn’t that how destiny works? A meeting that is so random and implausible that it reminds you that something bigger than you is possibly out there. With Samantha finally in my life I 'm one step closer to finding a cure, and learning the truth about what I really am!",
