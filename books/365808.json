  "description": "Richly illustrated and filled with goodies for anyone who is a lover of plant and fae.Green magick, or stewardship of the earth, begins right in our own backyards. When we cultivate an herb garden--even if it's just a few potted plants on a sunny windowsill--we are tending living, sentient beings who respond to our intention, our energy, and our tender loving care. The \"fae\" (faerie) essence residing at the heart of each nurtured plant manifests in its foliage, flowers, fragrance, and flavor, and its unique healing, nourishing, and restorative properties.      In The Faeries' Guide to Green Magick from the Garden author and free-fae-spirit Jamie Wood offers fresh, faerie-centric profiles of thirty-three familiar medicinal and culinary herbs accompanied by recipes for natural healing remedies, earth-friendly beauty products, and tasty treats. Fantasy artist Lisa Steinke pairs each herb with a vibrant portrait of its personality--its unique faerie signature--in her lyrical poetry and luminous paintings.     With blissful blessings, magickal meditations, and zesty spells sprinkled throughout, The Faeries Guide to Green Magick from the Garden will help you get in touch with your own fae spirit and explore the earthly--and earthy--delights of your own garden.",
