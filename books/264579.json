  "description": "Sometimes, there is no happily ever after...It's All Hallow's Eve, and the Morgan sisters just want to enjoy one night at the Masquerade in peace. But that's wishful thinking. An evil witch has broken the veil between worlds, and once again, the sisters are thrust into danger.Forcing each sister to live out a different story, the witch has altered the happily ever afters of beloved fairy tales, and it's up to Josslyn, Jade, Julie, and Jasmine to restore the damaged tales before happy endings cease to exist-- both in their world and in ours. Failure to save the endings will mean a seismic shift in the balance of good and evil. And worse, if the sisters don't put the tales back together before the veil closes, it means they'll be stuck in the broken fairy tales... forever.Can the sisters harness their powers and defeat the evil witch, or is their story fated to come to an unhappy end?",
