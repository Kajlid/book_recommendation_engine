  "description": "On 9/11, firefighter Nick Fletcher's world changed forever. He's unable to rid himself of survivor's guilt, made worse by the secret he hides from his family and coworkers. Nick's life is centered around helping burn victims, until he is reunited with the man he'd once loved but pushed away. For fashion designer Julian Cornell, appearances mean everything. His love affairs are strictly casual, and the only thing he cares about is making his clothing line a success. A chance encounter with the man he loved long ago has Julian thinking for the first time in years there may be more to life than being seen at the best parties and what designer labels to wear. When Julian's world takes an unexpected turn, it's Nick who helps him regain perspective on what matters most in life. Julian, in turn, helps Nick accept who he is and understand he isn't responsible for tragedies he couldn't prevent. Lost love found can be even sweeter the second time around, and after all the years apart, both men learn to look beyond the surface to find the men they are inside.Contains mature themes.",
