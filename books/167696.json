  "description": "Taken from The Back CoverThe sky overhead turned charcoal-black. Methuselah was engulfed in chaos. The rain beating on the deck went horizontal-a force as heavy as a fire hose. John cried out, as waves battered the sides of their boat, \"BRYON, get inside and secure the cabin.... Tie everything down and turn up the radio. I am going to drop sail....\" The boat rocked from side to side. The rain and wind beat John to a pulp. \"John, get back here! We need to ride this out. It's safer in here!\"\"Bryon, the sail is jammed.... I can't loosen it! We're taking on water. The aft end of the boat is starting to flood.\"John made his way back-they braced themselves. Cupboards in the galley were open. Can goods and supplies flew around like missiles. A can struck Bryon on the brow. Blood poured out of him, \"I need a towel, I can't see.\"...You have a date with destiny. Inside each of us resides a sleeping giant, who at any moment, if woken to the reality of the power and authority we have in Christ, could shake a nation.
