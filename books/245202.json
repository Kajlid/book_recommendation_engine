  "title": "Control",
  "description": "From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author K. Bromberg comes a new story in her Everyday Heroes series…  Control is something Desi Whitman abhors. Why live life in black and white perfection when you can messily color outside the lines?  But when she comes face to face with SWAT officer Reznor Mayne, he’s about to show her just how good control can feel.  **Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**",
