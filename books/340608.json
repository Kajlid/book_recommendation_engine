  "description": "Dr. Zebadiah John Carter, Dr. Dejah Thoris Burroughs (Deety to her friends), Deety's brainiac father, Jake, and her \"Aunt\" Hilda are running off to Reno for a quickie double wedding when a car bomb narrowly misses killing them all. But, what makes this bantering bunch so special isn't money or politics or jealous exes but the one-of-a-kind machine Jake has built in his basement.

And that's when the fun really begins....",
