  "description": "Pack and Go Meals in JarsIf youâ€™re like me, you are continually searching for quick and easy low cost healthy ways to eat. Too many times we fall into the trap of having to buy fast food on the run. The cost of eating out adds up and is probably not as healthy as food we can make at home. And with so many of us on special diets, we need to be able to choose our own ingredients that follow our particular diet plan. Well, the solution I discovered is Mason jar courses. These are easy meals that you can mix up in a Mason jar on the run. Or you can make them the night before and pack them in your bag the next day. The concept is simple. Add ingredients to a Mason jar and bake it in the oven like using bake ware (only in a pan of water). You can also use your Mason jar on your blender to blend soups and smoothies and a whole lot more. Forget the hassle of eating out. Make your Pack and Go meals at home.
