  "description": "Zhuan Falun is the core comprehensive book about Falun Gong--and a best-selling book in China before it was banned. It takes up where Falun Gong leaves off, exploring in detail many of the same subjects. Drawing on an ancient secret oral tradition, Li Hongzhi explores in depth the core concepts of Falun Gong---truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance. Also included here are discussions of - The origins of qigong and the long-forgotten meaning of \"self-cultivation\" - The roots of illness and the fundamental qigong method of healing. - Genuine integrated cultivation of mind and body - The relationship between Falun Gong, Buddhism, Taoism, and other self-cultivation methods.",
