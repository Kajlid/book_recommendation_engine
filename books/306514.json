  "description": "A sizzling second-chance romance from New York Times and USA Today bestselling author L.A. Casey—Frankie pushed her first love away. A decade later, he walks back into her life, but is she prepared to trust again? When rock star Risk Keller shows up in Frankie’s diner with his heart on his sleeve, it turns her world upside down. Letting him go was the hardest thing she ever had to do. For years, his voice has been a reminder of everything she sacrificed, and now it’s time to face the music. For Risk, coming home shows him what he’s always known deep down—every song, every gig, every drink, every girl—it’s always been about Frankie. There’s no denying their intense chemistry. But Risk still has a career that takes him around the world; Frankie still has a sick mother she loves too much to leave. Can they overcome everything in their way to give first love a second chance?",
