  "description": "Held prisoner for years inside the walls of her reclusive uncle’s art gallery, Thea is lost when the man dies suddenly, leaving her to fend for herself. At least until a Scottish giant arrives, scarred and mysterious, claiming it’s his job to professionally pack the paintings. Duncan makes Thea feel safe and free for the first time in her life, encouraging her to enact the fantasies she’s always kept hidden. Locked away. Their scorching bond grows, one delicious encounter at a time. But what if the man who has claimed her heart…isn’t who he claims to be?",
