  "title": "Home Run: The History of the Goldeyes and CanWest Global Park",
  "description": "In Winnipeg, the Goldeyes are the boys of summer. And for more than a decade, they've thrilled, entertained and even frustrated their loyal fans with every pitch and every swing of the bat. Home Run is about those Goldeyes, the young men who come and go each summer, the ones we get to know intimately and the ones who merely stop for a cup of coffee along the way. It's also the story of CanWest Global Park, the home of the Goldeyes and the greatest little ballpark in Canada - a wonderful piece of downtown greenspace that almost wasn't built. Home Run is a story of perseverance, commitment and the love of the game. And it's a story every sports fan will find irresistible.",
