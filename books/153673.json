  "description": "Debt. Guilt. Death.  Finn Walker has spent years carrying the weight of his regret and guilt with him wherever he went. When he found his home with the Nordic Lords Motorcycle Club, he quickly learned their outlaw lifestyle allowed him to banish his guilt with his fists and guns and no one would stop him. It was freeing, and now, he fits right in.  Friends with Ryker Knight for years, Meg McNeery turns to the one place she knows is safe when she needs safety more than her next paycheck. On the run from a man determined to receive payment for a debt he believes Meg owes, she knows the Nordic Lords Clubhouse in Minnesota is the only place where she and her five-year-old son, Brayden, will be safe.  What Meg doesn’t expect is her instant, magnetic attraction to Finn. And when her running ends with the three of them trapped together…it not only tests Meg’s physical self-control, but it also causes Finn to face his demons.  Finn has sworn he’d never get involved with another woman again, much less a woman with a child, but he can’t stop thinking about Meg, the blue-eyed angel who silences his nightmares.  When Finn’s past fears and present threats collide…will he finally be able to save the woman who needs him?  Or will Meg end up like his ex, Piper? Buried six feet under.",
