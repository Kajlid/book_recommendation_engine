  "title": "Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than I.Q",
  "description": "Is IQ destiny? Not nearly as much as we think. Daniel Goleman's fascinating and persuasive book argues that our view of human intelligence is far too narrow, ignoring a crucial range of abilities that matter immensely in terms of how we do in life. Drawing on groundbreaking brain and behavioral research, Goleman shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors, which include self-awareness, self-discipline, and empathy, add up to a different way of being smart - one he terms \"emotional intelligence.\" While childhood is a critical time for its development, emotional intelligence is not fixed at birth. It can be nurtured and strengthened throughout adulthood - with immediate benefits to our health, our relationships, and our work. This eye-opening book offers a new vision of excellence and a vital new curriculum for life that can change the future for us and for our children.",
