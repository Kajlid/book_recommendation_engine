  "description": "In a Dystopian Realm lives an astonishing beauty named Rina. Her only child is a 9-year-old girl called Rani. Now, Rina, 32-year-old, is in her bed, waiting for Death to relieve her of an unenduring pain in her stomach, due to a malignant tumour. Medicine and Science have given up on Rina. But the entire province is profoundly saddened by Rina’s imminent demise.The Resident Sorcerer, Noram Charka, a medicine man, to ward off the wrath of the populace, makes a last ditch effort to save his own hide, and tells the people, “Bring me a bowl of water left behind by a bathing Vulture and I will cure her.” But he added, “The Vulture must be white, bald, and clutched in its talons should be a live King Cobra, even as he bathes, and the Cobra spits out copious venom into the water.”People are aghast at this impossible prescription. They wish to kill the Sorcerer. But little Girl Rani believes him. When best friend Moy comes running and tells he has seen just such an apparition by the opposite bank of their river, Rani takes off with a metal bowl belted around her waist. She swims across the width of the river, and sees the Vulture, bathing, with a King Cobra, wriggling under its talons. The Vulture flies away, with the Cobra. Rani collects a bowlful of the magic potion. She is ready to swim back (one handed with the bowl held high), when a sudden Flash Flood ravages that river. Rani does not let go of her hold on the bowl even as she swallows a lot of murky river water.She looks up to see the angry Vulture shrieking high above in the sky. She sees too that the Vulture drops the Cobra in the river in such a way as to let this venomous serpent swim swiftly to Terminate Her…Will Rani survive?",
