  "description": "Peter Grant journeys into the underworld of Damon Black and his under-devils. By no chance at all, he is given an extraordinary gift by the devil himself. Unknown to Peter, his experience in the Unseen World of devils was actually orchestrated by the God he never believed in. As the Last Days quickly approach, Peter's newly formed relationship with God and His Christ is put to the test as Christians become the most despised group on earth.",
