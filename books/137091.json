  "description": "Mr. Copacabana is the outrageous life story of Monte Proser, creator and operator of the famous Copacabana nightclub in New York City in 1940. Monte's life story is a sweeping epic of the early 20th century through the eyes of one of the most colorful characters in American history. Because he was the involuntary partner of a series of the most powerful gangsters of the era, Monte's story is also a keyhole view of the struggle between crime and conscience in America. It is a history of America at night.",
