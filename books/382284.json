  "description": "Davy is set in the far future of our world, in the fourth century after the collapse of what we describe as the twentieth-century civilisation. In a land turned upside-down and backwards by the results of scientific unwisdom, Davy and his fellow Ramblers are carefree outcasts, whose bawdy, joyous adventures among the dead ashes of Old-Time culture make a novel which has been hailed as \"a frightening, ribald, poignant look at the imaginary future,\" as \"this chilling and fascinating book,\" as \"superb entertainment - unique,\" as \"so unusual as the make it both refreshing and thought provoking.\"",
