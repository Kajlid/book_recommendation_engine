  "description": "The Bird Flu has hit the United States with a vengeance, and Christine Cook, an upper-class mother of three, documents the traumatic days in her diary as she fights to keep her young children quarantined and healthy, while her husband, a pediatrician, insists on going to work to each morning. How does a family cope while so many around them are in despair? How does the world cope with a pandemic without the insanity of the situation becoming contagious in itself?",
