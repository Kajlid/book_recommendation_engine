  "description": "Toni returns to the town of her abusive upbringing for the funeral of her long-missing high school friend. She only has one thought on her mind - pay her respects and leave.  But a strange text has brought all of her high school friends to this one point and they soon realise that all is definitely not what it seems. There is more in the darkness here than just shadows. Coming to terms with her mother’s abuse and the terrors of her upbringing, the ghosts of Toni’s past become more than metaphorical – they become dangerous. Fighting them, a terrifying dark daemon and a serial killer that is closer to home than any of them suspected, Toni learns some steep lessons about friendship, love and just how much she is capable of. But will it be enough to save her friends?",
