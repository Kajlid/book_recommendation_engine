  "description": "To see a change, you must be the change.Mary Parker has just settled down for her usual morning breakfast when a scream of sirens blazes past her manor drawing her attention away from the flowers and birds of early Spring. Her old high school is on fire, and as she watches the students’ responses, she knows she needs to help. Her life, changed by Mildred’s impact, has set her up well to offer assistance to the community in need: she has a gymnasium the other school can use for their prom and graduation, and with a little coordination with the other school’s principal, she hopes to make a night the kids will never forget.When her school, the School of Art, is vandalized, Mary knows her help must extend far beyond a single dance. But what will happen to her school and the museum if she takes in these at-risk kids? Will the new Second Chance Program truly be able to help these kids, or will the students’ presence have a negative impact on the school and museum she loves so much?With Mildred’s nudging preventing her from backing down, Mary, Alfred, Antoinette, and Charlie venture into the unknown and the risks required to make a change in their community near Chicago. Nothing could prepare them for just how much their own lives would change by opening their doors—and their hearts.Mildred’s Legacy: Second Chance Kids is the sequel to Mildred the Bird Lady, however each book can be read as a stand-alone or in order of publication.",
