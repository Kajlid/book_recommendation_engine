  "description": "“There is nothing worse than pretending that you don’t care about something, when that is all you can think about.” Harper Graham wears a mask, and not the pamper kind. She conceals her pain with shoes, shots, and lots of sex. But while her life appears fantastic to most, Harper herself knows that the most important thing in life is not financial stability, but emotional. Having been let down by her absent father for most of her life, Harper chooses to keep the men in her life at arms length. Well, that was until Kyler Morgan. Kyler Morgan has been successful at nearly everything in his life … nearly. Traveling the country with the band Down Glory Road, Kyler has had time to reflect upon his life and in particular his relationship with feisty, drop-dead gorgeous realtor, Harper. Realizing that she is the woman of his dreams, Kyler resolves to win back Harper, and prove to her that she is, and always has been, enough. But the path to true love rarely runs smoothly, and when their journey takes a number of twists and turns, will Harper and Kyler manage to hold tight, or fall by the wayside?",
