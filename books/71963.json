  "description": "After being kidnapped, Sara has undergone torture and sadistic abuse for almost a year and is now a terror-filled shell. Once she re-emerges, several mysteries still remain—she doesn’t know who kidnapped her or where he is, and she doesn’t know why strange things seem to be happening at the hospital. A fast-paced story unfolds following her discovery, as despite having a devoted husband and a large support network, it is ultimately up to Sara to chart a course back to sanity. This novel is a rich tale that gives characters the chance to grow and speaks of a developing faith and deepening love.",
