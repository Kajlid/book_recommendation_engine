  "description": "Manfred enjoyed a life full of sparkle and verve… until he was five, when he started to wonder if his decision to reincarnate as a blissful little boy might have been a mistake. ɝ From the day he was born, Mani enjoyed the unconditional love and acceptance he believed were his divine rights. A rude awakening occurred at the age of five when he danced into the living room in drag to impress his mother with his newest rendition of Chicki-Chicki-Boom-Chick. The horrified reaction of the visitor she was entertaining unveils a mean truth to little Mani: playacting your innate being isn't enough to secure the adoration and approval of the world around you. The child psychiatrist is one in a long line therapists, gurus and spiritual advisors who try to help Mani become something he isn't, so he can find the happiness he once took for granted. At 18 he turns his back on the hick town of his youth and heads for the land of soymilk and sex (Southern California), hoping to find recognition and acceptance. Surrounded by a world of spiritual materialism he enters a bazaar of belief systems and philosophies to find a Wizard who will show him the way back to the Garden of fulfillment. His quest then takes him to a consciousness expanding seminar in Bavaria, Germany, a spiritual retreat in a dark and foreboding castle in the foothills of the Austrian Alps, a healing workshop conducted by a dubious Shaman in the Tuscany and a “meeting of the masters” high in the outer limits of the Tyrol, before he finds the final answer. A high-camp self-help book that takes the reader through a world filled with pseudo gurus, new-age tricksters, and spiritual materialism. It is the forerunner of Eric Brown's first novel, “On Beyond Yoga.”",
