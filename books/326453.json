She quickly becomes a respected friend and member of their blended family, paying special attention to their eight-year old son, Chad, Ann's son from a previous marriage. Their eldest son, David returns home for the summer and an immediate attraction sparks between Diane and David. They began a secretive love affair.Can Diane's proud, traditional family accept a white man as Diane's love interest and will the Shaw's value her as their son's potential partner? As their love affair blossoms, they decide to make their relationship public. This story of an interracial love during the turbulent 70s deftly explores the ugly racism that propelled our nation's conscious to change toward a more diversified culture. Written with sophisticated realism, Hudson's novel stands out as a literary piece of significance during our present-day political climate.",
