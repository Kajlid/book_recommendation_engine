  "title": "Women of the Centre",
  "description": "From Maralinga to the Murray, Alice to Adelaide, then Aboriginal women tell their stories of walking through atomic clouds, being taken from their mothers in the process of 'Assimilation', traditional punishment and tribal life. Two even had time to play Test Cricket and enter the Miss Australia Quest.Extraordinary stories of survival in a land that wasn't harsh until the first white man declared the land uninhabited. These are Australian women to be reckoned with, women who reared children for tomorrow's Australia in defiance of a government whose policy was to 'smooth the pillow of a dying race'.",
