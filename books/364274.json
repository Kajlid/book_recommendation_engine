  "description": "A Mystery of Medieval Ireland - 1510. A great feast is being held. Into a crowd listening to the story of Balor, the one-eyed god, come two strangers. The younger of the two, Iarla, bears a letter that claims that the wealthy Ardal O’Lochlainn is his true father – which Ardal vociferously denies. So when Iarla is found dead, with one eye missing, some think he was killed by the god – but most suspect Ardal. Mara, the Brehon – or lawgiver – of the Burren, is called to investigate.",
