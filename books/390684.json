  "description": "Melding the true and the fictional, Dead End in Norvelt is a novel about two months for a kid named Jack Gantos, whose plans for vacation excitement are shot down when he is \"grounded for life\" by his feuding parents, and whose nose spews blood at every little shock he gets. But plenty of excitement (and shocks) are coming Jack's way once his mom loans him out to help a feisty old neighbor with a most unusual chore—typewriting obituaries filled with stories about the people who founded his Utopian town. As one obituary leads to another, Jack is launched on a strange adventure involving molten wax, Eleanor Roosevelt, twisted promises, a homemade airplane, Girl Scout cookies, a man on a trike, a dancing plague, voices from the past, Hells Angels . . . and possibly murder.",
