  "title": "Cold Rain: Yamabuki and the Warlord Prince",
  "description": "Ancient Japan: a medieval land of stunning beauty and unspeakable brutality...  In a grand bid to preserve the royal bloodline, the warlord, General Moroto has personally trained his daughter and last surviving child, Yamabuki, in the art of war and rulership.  Not-yet seventeen years old, Yamabuki travels in the guise of an ordinary samurai, heading for the capital carrying secret dispatches in her first real-world test. However, rival factions send ninja to make sure she never gets there alive.  In a lawless town Yamabuki encounters the young warlord Yoshinaka. Handsome and charismatic he vows to regain what was taken from him by a treacherous uncle. Drawn to one another as kindred souls, Yoshinaka reveals his plans to regain far more than his birthright. He invites Yamabuki to join him in an ambitious power grab to conquer and rule over the entire empire.",
