  "description": "Sometimes love is fated in the stars. You know you are destined for each other. Your souls entwine and you can’t imagine your life without them.Sometimes it’s found when you’re not looking for it. It peeks around the corner when you least expect it, sweeping you off your feet, carrying you off into the sunset.Sometimes, there are a lucky few who get to experience both. I was one of the lucky ones.",
