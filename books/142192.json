Searching for answers to what she is, Lynnie heads to the only woman she hopes will never lie to her. Finally content with what she has become, her instincts take over and she finds herself trapped in a situation that could not only expose her true nature, but turn deadly for the people she loves. Her becoming was only the beginning of the story. This...this is where the action begins.",
