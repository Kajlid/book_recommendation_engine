  "description": "The year was 1943. On the Black Sea, the Russians were fighting a desperate battle to wrest control of its waterways from the Germans. But the Russians' one real weakness was on the water: whatever they did, the Germans did it better, and the daring hit-and-run tactics of the E-boats plagued them. At last the British agreed to send them a small flotilla of motor torpedo boats (MTBs) under the command of John Devane. Devane had been in the Roval Navy since the outbreak of war. More than a veteran, he was a survivor - and the two rarely went together in the savage war of MTBs. Given command at short notice, Devane soon learned that, even against the vast and raging background of the Eastern Front, war could still be a personal duel between individuals.",
