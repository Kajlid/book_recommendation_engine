  "description": "Cheers to the best group of friends a woman could ask for. Cheers to small apartments and even smaller...paychecks. Cheers to a broken heart and healing it one Gin & Tonic at a time. Cheers to Happy Hour!  Harper Collins is the definition of an independent woman. Working her at up the corporate ladder one rung at a time, she thought she had it all. Well, almost all… there was that one problem – dating. Harper was awkward, silly and uncomfortable when it came to relationships – never seeing a guy more than a few times. Was it her or was she just fishing from all the wrong ponds? Was Mr. Right out there or was she just Miss Wrong?",
