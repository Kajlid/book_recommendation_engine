  "description": "Will George Yeoman defeat his toughest challenge yet?   April 1941.  As Rommel’s Africa Korps thunders towards Tobruk, the last bastion of British defence in North Africa, Flying Officer Yeoman is assigned to help defend the dwindling British lines.  The blazing African sky is studded with Stukas, Fiats and hellish anti-aircraft fire. While on the ground, the desert is littered with mine-fields and German armour.  The RAF in North Africa are as much at their wit’s end as they were over the Channel during the Battle of Britain.  The fighting is just as ferocious.  The Germans appear just as unstoppable…   Target Tobruk is the next instalment in the heart-racing George Yeoman series.  Robert Jackson (b. 1941) is a prolific author of military and aviation history, having become a full time writer in 1969. As an active serviceman in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve he flew a wide range of aircraft, ranging from jets to gliders. Target Tobruk is the third book in the Sergeant George Yeoman series. Hurricane Squadron is the first.   Endeavour Press is the UK's leading independent digital publisher. For more information on our titles please sign up to our newsletter at www.endeavourpress.com.
