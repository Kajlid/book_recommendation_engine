  "description": "Jacob Smith is an honorable young man driven by a responsibility to be the town’s blacksmith. It isn’t his first choice, but when his da can’t dig his way out of grief, Jacob feels obligated to be the man of the house. The role includes taking care of the farm, the shop, and playing father to his thirteen-year-old sister. What it doesn’t include, is the freedom to follow his heart.  Elliot Ryder will do anything to help his family, even if it means breaking the law. Farming sheep was never how he planned to live his days, but if he can help cushion his family’s expenses, that is where he will end up. Couriering letters across the land doesn’t pay, but thieving does. It’s dangerous, and Elliot knows the cost of being caught firsthand.  Fate is determined to bring these men together, but can their growing affections for each other keep them there? Elliot’s past is full of secrets that an honest man like Jacob might never accept. Can Jacob convince Elliot to lead a more honest life before it’s too late? Or will their differences tear them apart?",
