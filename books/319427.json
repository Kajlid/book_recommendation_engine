One dark, fateful night.One accident that shattered my world. One unforgettable move.And now my life is anything but mundane.My name is Astraea Davis, but you can just call me Rae. This is the tale of a girl whose world was ripped apart and pieced back together in the unforgiving cold.Two months ago my parents were murdered. Their death, as much a mystery to me as the path I'm thrown on because of it.A path that has me contending with the tendrils of an unseen enemy, the quips of an asshole teacher, and the pain from a neglectful aunt. But even the darkest paths have a ray or two of light. For the sun always shines brightest after a brutal and unforgiving storm.A new best friend.A new job that I love.A lickable new boss and his equally sexy as sin, brother.These are my rays in the storm raging around me.As the secrets I didn't know I was hiding are unveiled and the threats loom closer, will the new bonds I've developed hold or will everything around me implode ... again?*****\nHer Three Bears \nis a two part Goldilocks and the Three Bears retelling, a part of the Fairly Twisted Chronicles.
