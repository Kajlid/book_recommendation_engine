  "description": "Life on a farm planet at the edge of the universe can be dangerous for a human woman alone.That’s why I need a husband. ANY husband.Unfortunately, all the men I approach keep running off. So I hire a bounty hunter to kidnap me someone capable and strong, someone who will scare off the creeps that are trying to move in on my territory.It’ll be a marriage of convenience only.I should have been a little more specific about who I wanted, though…because the intimidating and fierce praxiian male that the bounty hunter brings to me? The one with feline features, big arms and an even bigger…uh, farm?He’s the problem I was hoping a new husband would scare off. What am I supposed to do now?(Don’t ask him, because all of his suggestions are completely and utterly filthy and have nothing to do with a marriage of convenience.)",
