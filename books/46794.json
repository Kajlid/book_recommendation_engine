  "title": "The Co-ed Killer",
  "description": "The story of Edmund Kemper III first surfaced when at fourteen he killed his grandparents in a cool rage. After five years in a California hospital for sex offenders, this intelligent giant (IQ 136; height 6'9\") emerged to carry out the meticulously rehearsed murders of six hitchhiking girls, culminating in the murder, mutilation — and more — of his mother and her friend. Tried and found guilty, Kemper was labeled sane so that he could be given a life sentence in a prison. Margaret Cheney tells a totally compelling story based on Kemper's enormously detailed confession and extensive interviews with scores of those involved with Kemper's gruesome career. At the same time she perceptively explores Kemper's twisted motivations and the implications of his crimes and trial in a culture that seems to actively promote the acceptance of savagery.",
