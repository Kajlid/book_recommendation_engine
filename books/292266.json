  "description": "First edition. Basing their stories on the unsolved cases to which Dr. Watson refers in the original fifty-six short stories and four novels, Adrian Conan Doyle, son of Sir Arthur, and famed mystery writer and Doyle biographer John Dickson Carr have written one of the best Sherlockian pastiches ever published. Writing on the very desk where the Canon was penned, they endeavored to recreate the atmosphere which has captivated readers since the first Sherlock Holmes story appeared. While no imitation has ever equalled the original, most experts agree that these twelve short stories come as close as any to capturing the Holmes-Watson relationship and Victorian ambiance which enhanced the plots. A must for any collector. Covers show minor spotting, corners and spine ends bumped, bookplate on free endpaper. x, 313 pages. cloth.. small 8vo..",
