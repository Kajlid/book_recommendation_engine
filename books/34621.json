  "description": "Romance is candlelight on cheekbones, blurring gazes and the press of heels on strange sheets. But what happens a year later? You're sharing bath towels and bickering over who forgot to buy a light bulb. There is beauty in a familiar hand on the nape of your neck. There is love in waking up under a shared blanket. In Our House by the Sea is about the romance of domesticity.“Kirsty is one of the best and brightest . . . when I read her stuff I feel like I could taste it, chew it, roll it around on my tongue, the language is so delicious and sturdy and musical. She also has a knack for getting relationships exactly right in her writing, whether between parent and child or lovers or friends.”�  - Amber Sparks, Fiction Editor at Emprise Review “Rarely an author comes along whose work hits you with the impact of a slap. I have had this experience with the work of Jayne Anne Phillips, with Lorrie Moore and Mary Gaitskill; most recently I have felt this on discovering the writing of Kirsty Logan. Her work is elegant, minimal, and innovative, but underlying it all is a great passion. If the world is a place where talent is recognised””in time, I believe, we may come to say her name alongside the aforementioned.”�  - Ewan Morrison, author of Swung “Every time I read something by Kirsty, I think,‘Damn her, I wish I'd written that.' She is the kind of writer that you can't help but read with teeth-crunching envy, broken-hearted admiration, and a realization that your own work is not half as good as you'd hoped it might be. Be forewarned writers and and you will never be the same.”�  - Shanna Germain, finalist for the 2010 John Preston Short Fiction Award and nominee for the 2008 Pushcart Prize",
