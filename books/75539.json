When he unexpectedly returns a year later–with a pregnant French wife, Addison’s heartbroken. Addison stubbornly moves on, caring for her battle-weary brother and pursuing her career – an idea foreign to her father and when her father’s accountant proposes marriage, she reluctantly accepts. When Everett’s bride dies during childbirth with Addison in attendance she’s compelled to stay and help him with the newborn.Just when she’s resigned herself to her future, she finds comfort in Everett’s arms. Addison’s hopeful they can move beyond the heart ache of their past, but he mentions nothing of their future together. She’s left to decide whether to trust her heart or head: risk rejection again or settle for the life as an accountant’s well-cared for wife.",
