  "description": "The room starts to spin a little as I drink in what this man has just said to me. My first reaction was to discount everything he just said, but this is not the countenance of someone who is in jest, he was polite enough, but very down to business in his approach, he had that no nonsense donâ€™t waste my time kind of vibe to him. He fully believes what he is telling me, and it is hard to ignore the fact he is a cop, not just a cop, but a detective, someone who investigates things of this very nature. I was beginning to feel exposed and vulnerable, something I am not using to feeling. I have been so focused on being trapped and held against my will that it had not hit me why I was here at all.",
