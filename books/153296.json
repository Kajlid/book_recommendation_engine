Holding only one secret back, she puts the rest on the line and asks for a second chance. Too bad he’s not going to let her off easy.Camden Jameson loves his twin brother, but his jealousy runs deep. They may be identical in looks, but that’s where the similarities end. When Ashleigh comes back into Ryley’s life, Camden has the perfect opportunity for revenge. Two birds, one stone. A journey to the Dark Side affects them all, but only one will truly get their revenge. Only one will come out on top.",
