  "description": "As a young woman, Isabella Leitner was deported from Hungary to Auschwitz; the Nazis murdered her mother and one sister, but by unimaginable fortitude and will to survive she and her three other sisters dodged death. Her recollections make a sparse and searing book, fragments of remembered feelings and occurrences that evoke perhaps better than most works something unfathomable.",
