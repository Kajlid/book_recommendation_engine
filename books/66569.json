  "description": "We have found the most experienced guides in the business and asked them how they hunt for brown bears and grizzlies. These guides have been on hundreds of hunts and have seen all kinds of hunters, rifles, and calibers for their particular quarry, and they pass on their experience and knowledge to the reader in this extremely interesting book. If you want a brown or grizzly bear, you are well advised to listen to what they say. Combined, these guides have over three hundred years of accumulated guiding experience!",
