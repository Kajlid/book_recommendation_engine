  "title": "Promise, Texas",
  "description": "In the heart of Texas, people know what really matters—family, friends, community. And they know that love gives meaning to every day of their lives…Some of the people in Promise are from old ranching families like the Westons and Pattersons—folks who arrived in the Hill Country more than a century ago. And then there are newcomers like Annie Applegate, who opens a bookstore in town. Some might say Annie does things backward. She marries a widowed veterinarian for the sake of his kids…and discovers that marriage can lead to love. In Promise, everyone’s life is a story! The people here, like people everywhere, experience tragedies as well as triumphs, sorrow as well as joy. This town, like towns everywhere, has its share of secrets. But whether times are good or bad, you’re never alone in a place like Promise. And as Annie Applegate knows, that makes all the difference.",
