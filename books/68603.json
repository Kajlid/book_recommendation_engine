  "description": "In the wake of a family tragedy, Nan, a pensive young woman from rural Vermont, moves to New York City for college. As she makes her way through her new urban life, with all its dangers and excitements, she is haunted by the home she left behind, remembered with equal parts comfort and shadow. Over the course of these ten linked stories, readers come to discover a singular young woman, capable of misjudgment and mistake, but one who is strengthened by her own kind of wisdom and bravery. Nan struggles to find her place in the world, but in doing so discovers herself, her strength, and the voice with which her story must be told.Seven of the stories in Nan were published in the following magazines: Post Road (“Nan”), Narrative (“Liars”), Redivider (“Country House”), Memorious (“Caution”), Guernica (“Forgiveness” and “Compatriots”), and Cousin Corrine’s Reminder (“Plus and Minus”).Please check out the Amazon Reader's Reviews:http://www.amazon.com/Nan-Nathaniel-B...",
