  "title": "Harmonious Hearts 2016 - Stories from the Young Author Challenge",
  "description": "Harmony Ink Press is delighted and honored to showcase the short fiction of some of the best up-and-coming authors working in the LGBT genre. The stories in this third volume of Harmonious Hearts represent the winners of our Young Author Challenge—a group of talented writers between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one. The stories in this anthology are as diverse as their creators and range from the speculative to snapshots of everyday life for people growing up in a society in flux. They confront many issues facing young adults, and they celebrate the joys of this sometimes rocky period of friendship, loyalty, first love, and learning to feel comfortable in one’s own skin. These experiences are universal, and thanks to the courage and talent of authors such as these, young people of all gender identities, expressions, and orientations are starting to see themselves included. Everyone deserves a story that speaks to them, and in these pages, they’ll find that story. Dani Anderson—To LaurenNick Anthony—Scrapyard SunsetsHilda Friday—A Progression of LoveArbour Ames—You Saw BlueChloe Smith—Plenty of FishCaleb Andrews—I Am LoganSarah Caulfield—Make Mad the GuiltyXoe Juliani—Loving You Through the YearsIrene Grant—Jordan and A.J.Latitude Brown—EquinoxJulia Dupuis—Let No Sin Rule Over MeAnika Olivo—MelodimensionalFrisk Gillespie—Ten Words",
