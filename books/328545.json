  "description": "One ancient mask with earth-bending powers searching for a bearer.One magical retrieval expert who is determined to seal it back in its tomb.At the moment, both are failing at their goals, but Arwen is not about to be bested. So what if she doesn’t know what culture it’s from or where to put it back. She’s smarter than a semi-sentient mask. Hopefully.But if the thrice-cursed mask breaks out of her seal one more time, she’s melting it with prejudice, magical backlash be damned.",
