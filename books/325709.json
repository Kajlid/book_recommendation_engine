  "description": "Never Have I Ev... Wait, what was the question again?!What happens when an ill-advised party game makes it obvious I've still got my V-card?Embarrassment. A lot of embarrassment.Especially when the sexy, older guy at the party who witnessed the whole thing turns out to be someone I have to see every week. Not to mention my best friend's cousin.He's not only straight, but way out of my league.It's going to be so awkward for both us.Or awesome...if his protective nature and flirty attempts to teach me how to date lead to the kind of tutoring that lives in my fantasies. But how likely is that to happen? I'm not known as the sweet, naive one among for my friends for nothing.I'm probably imagining those looks he throws my way. Probably projecting my own want onto his expression.But...what if I'm not?Never Have I Evan features an inexperienced, shy tech geek, an assistant football coach who oozes confidence, a town full of quirky, nosy residents, and sexual awakening and discovery themes!",
