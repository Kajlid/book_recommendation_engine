But Brogan Moore, the man she has feelings for has given her an ultimatum: Tell the world they're together, or he walks. As Taryn watches Brogan walk out of her life, she has to ask herself, if her pride is more important than Love. Taryn isn't the only one who has issues with pride and image though. Brogan will have to decide if Taryn is the woman for him, or if his parents are right and he would be better off playing it safe.",
