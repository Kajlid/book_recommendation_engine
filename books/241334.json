  "description": "Watching Her The Beauty and Tragedy of Alzheimer’s Disease Captured in a Daughter’s Poetry is a collection of poems that literally and visually reflect the dark humor and gut-wrenching and raw experiences of the author during the last three years of her mom’s life with Alzheimer’s disease. It is a snapshot of the roller coaster of emotions shared by so many of those who love someone with this disease, as well as those who are afflicted. The book, which began as a documentation of the author’s journey, has turned into an educational and cathartic collection of poems recommended for others.",
