  "description": "A story about coming of age queer. About love between men. About fathers and sons. About longing, fulfillment, heartbreak, and joy. The prequel to Pierre & Bill: A Love Story and to Pierre & Bill NowAfter yet another fight with his father, Pierre leaves home. He doesn't plan on leaving, but on his way to school the next day he doesn't get off the bus. Still in his uniform, he goes to the end of the line, sticks out his thumb, and takes the first ride. He doesn’t see himself as a runaway, more as a wanderer. He’s heading to, not from. To what, he doesn’t know. His ignorance of the world has been imposed. His self-assurance is all his own. The only thing he knows to be true is his attraction to men. This is his story. From boy to man. From the 70s to the 90s. From the backwoods to the whole wide world. From pining after an elusive loner to later, much later, meeting a single dad. For nearly twenty years we watch Pierre grow from a teenager afraid of nothing to a man who's learned one thing: he's better off on his own. Life begs to differ.Here is the latest installment in the Pierre & Bill series and the beginning of the story. In Pierre & Bill: A Love Story we meet them in their prime. In Pierre & Bill Now we follow them into the future. Now, we discover Pierre before he even meets Bill - or Danny or Ruth or Liam. And we find out what makes him who he is: cocksure, determined, and impossible not to love.",
