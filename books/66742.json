  "title": "Nobuyoshi Araki: Bondage",
  "description": "Kinbaku-bi, anyone?Meaning literally “the beauty of tight binding,” Kinbaku-bi, the Japanese art of erotic bondage has long fascinated Nobuyoshi Araki , who has made it one of his most important subjects. He’s been called a genius and a poet, and also a misogynist, a pornographer, a monster, but Araki’s work transcends simplistic moralistic classifications; he has said of his work “There is no conclusion. It's completely open. It doesn't go anywhere.” Whether literally or figuratively, his bound subjects are certainly immobilized, yet in the most tantalizing ways.This Collector's Edition is limited to 1,000 copies. It consists of three volumes , enticingly hand-bound in the Japanese tradition and packaged in a wooden bookcase , featuring Araki’s selection of his favorite bondage photos from over his entire career.Also available in 3 Art Editions each limited to 50 copies and coming with a digital C-print.",
