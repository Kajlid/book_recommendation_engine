  "title": "A Few Short Notes on Tropical Butterflies",
  "description": "These vivid and compelling tales, many set in Africa and Asia, are about immigrants and others facing change and dislocation. The science is never pedantic; indeed the language of biology and natural history is used to great lyrical effect. The stories are accomplished and seasoned, remarkably so given that this is the authorâ€™s first book. Murray is adept at holding together a complex narrative and creating characters who reach out emotionally to the reader upon first meeting.Global in scope, classical in form, evocative of place, and deeply emotional, this collection marks the beginning of what promises to be an illustrious career.",
