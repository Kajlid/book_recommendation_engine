  "description": "After a long day of prepping a house for painting, all Gus Berry wanted was the night off, to spend some time with his girlfriend, and relax before having to return to work the next morning.But that isn’t going to happen.Because Gus’s co-worker Benny has found a one-night job at the local Mollymart East, a job that has to be done by morning. If Gus and his paint crew can complete the work by then, it could mean huge business with a respected, established grocery store chain. But as Gus and his fellow painters soon discover, the much-anticipated zombie apocalypse doesn’t start with a bang. It starts on a Monday. And barricading themselves inside a megastore isn’t the end. It’s just the beginning.",
