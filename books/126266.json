  "description": "Lady Amanda Radburn was the most outspoken, opinionated, impertinent, and irritating woman the Duke of Hadleigh had ever met. She delighted in insulting him, and arguing over the most insignificant matters. Yet when helping her was the only way he could restore a world that included a sister he loved but had driven away with his dominating ways, he realized he had stepped into a dark world of danger and intrigue. Now he is in peril of not only losing his own life, but the life of the woman he realizes he has come to love. Regretting his unguarded words that forced her to close her heart to him, he pursues her into a future that has turned dangerously dark.",
