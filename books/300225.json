  "description": "\"I’m not going to be the good guy in this story. You should know that before you get the wrong idea. You’re probably expecting that I’m some kind of hero, or warrior, or chosen one. Yeah, I’ve heard it all before. But I’m not. I’m just a normal kid. Some would even argue that I’m evil, and I guess… I am. It’s complicated; you’ll see.\"When Kalib Andrews imagined his sixteenth birthday, he never thought his adoptive parents would try to kill him. Or that he’d spend it running away from The Order - a secret society seeking the blood of the last Angel Warrior to raise a lost goddess.Then again, Kalib never suspected that Angels, Demons, Nephilim, and Magicborne even existed. And he never - even in his wildest dreams - thought he was one of them!Packed full of exhilarating action, suspense, mystery, and magic, this is the first book in an exciting series that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The Last Angel Warrior is the perfect read for fans of the Percy Jackson series and those who love young adult fantasy novels.",
