Talking to ghosts? What the hell? But he is brilliant and hot and Cade finds himself falling hard and fast, both in lust and in love. The attraction is mutual, although Michael's past demons haunt him, literally and Jack is finding Michael's past is really his present. Jack has his own secret too and finds Michael's kindness growing on him, making him need the other man in a way he's never needed anyone else. Together, they close in on a killer, another brilliant, wily person whose sights are now set on Michael.Publisher's note: This book is COMPLETELY different from the earlier editions. It contains new characters, a different ending as well as a graphic M/M/M sex scene.",
