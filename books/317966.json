  "description": "My dream of being at the Olympic games has come true. I’ve trained extremely hard for this. Spent countless hours practicing. It’s not easy being a gymnast. Your body is pushed to extremes that many don’t even realize. It’s painful, stressful, and can be lonely. You spend more time with your coach than anyone else. Which isn’t a problem for me. I’ve been attracted to my coach, Dylan, for a long time. I know he feels the same but is fighting his feelings for me as his student. The deep stretching, late nights, and time alone push us to a forbidden place. I’m balancing on a fine line hoping if I fall he’ll still be there to catch me.",
