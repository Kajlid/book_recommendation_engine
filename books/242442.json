  "description": "Sophia… They thought sending me to this supposed tropical paradise would keep me safe. But there’s no place safe for me now. Not when the memories won’t leave me alone. I didn’t know what the universe had in store for me, but I definitely didn’t expect Jameson Burke. People think he has more secrets than I do, but he showed me his true self—his smile, his thoughtfulness, his love. I can’t afford to fall so far, so deep. Not after what happened. I should run, but somehow my heart keeps coming back to him... Jameson… I had my own reasons to run. Little did I know the most important piece of my story started and ended with the quiet girl sitting next to me in seventh period. Sophia Reid’s shy smile brought my soul out of hiding. Through her, I learned what starting over really means. But if I give in to this love, I’ll put us both in danger. For a short time, I was whole again, but what they say is right. The old me is dead, and the new one will never know love again.",
