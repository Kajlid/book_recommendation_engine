  "description": "The most peculiar comic book experience returns in an all-new volume--Beanworld Volume 4: Hoka Hoka Burb'l Burb'l! The Boom'r Band coaxes a new healing power out of Chow, leading to a visit from Dreamishness's relatives--the Windy Songsterinos--who bring their gift of rain. The storm causes great changes to Mr. Spook, Beanish and the Pod'l'pool Cuties. Marder's deceptively simple artwork illustrates a self-contained ecological fantasy realm with its own unique rules and lingo. Beanworld has delighted readers from grade school to grad school for more than a generation, earning a spot on the New York Times Graphic Books Best Sellers List.\"I have yet to find a comic book as challenging and inventive and downright fun as Beanworld.\" -Scott McCloud, author of Understanding Comics and The Sculptor",
