  "description": "When model Mae Banks is caught in the biggest storm of the year, she’s left stranded at her agent Luke’s lavish penthouse. Being around Luke is always awkward: as much as Mae tries to remain professional, she can’t help but get her panties in a twist whenever Luke flashes her his signature grin. But as the pair wait out the storm together, Mae can’t help but notice the sultry glances Luke keeps throwing her way. And, when Luke breaks out the vodka, things are sure to get out of hand. Now Mae has to wonder: can she tame Luke’s Wicked Need . . . or will he awaken her own?  At 3000 words, Wicked Need is sexy, steamy erotica you’ll never want to put down! This story includes domination and submission, a smart, sexy heroine, and a sexy alpha male hero!",
