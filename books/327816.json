  "description": "Wayne Norton is in Paradise. At least, he should be. Married to the dangerously beautiful Kiru and enjoying an endless surfside honeymoon on the resort planet of Cafe World should be enough for any man.But not Wayne. Lying on the beach, watching Kiru wading into the sea, he just can't help wishing that something would happen.Never make a wish, says an ancient Terran proverb, because it might come true.And it does. Something happensâ€”Kiru disappears.Wayne knows she's been abducted, he even knows who's responsible. He just doesn't know where to start looking... and the Universe is a very big place.",
