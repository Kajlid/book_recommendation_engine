Not even the lovely Charlotte, he believes, could bear learning of his unthinkable past.Charlotte travels across the country to look for Lucian and see if his feelings still mirror hers. Reluctantly, she stays in an infamous haunted hotel, in the wintery old mining town of Windfall, Colorado, where Lucian grew up. Will he still be the same man she fell for two years prior? Will his heart still be hers?Told in dual perspectives, Everywhere, Everywhere grapples with the meaning of life and its joys and agonies and the mysteries of death.",
