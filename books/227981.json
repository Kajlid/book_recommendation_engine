  "description": "SELECTED BY PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS HE READ IN 2017 . ***No. 1 New York Times Bestseller*** ***Best Nonfiction Books of 2017 selection by Barnes & Noble*** ***Best Humor and Entertainment Books of 2017 selection by Amazon*** .Michael Jordan is the acknowledged greatest basketball player of all-time, but what season was Michael Jordan the best version of Michael Jordan? Who's in The Disrespectful Dunk Hall of Fame? What's allowed and absolutely not allowed in a game of pickup basketball? BASKETBALL (AND OTHER THINGS)  presents readers with a set of pivotal and ridiculous questions from basketball history, providing arguments and answers, explained with the wit and wisdom that is unique to Shea Serrano. Serrano breaks down debates that NBA fans didn't even know they needed, from the authoritative (Which NBA championship was the most important to the league?) to the fantastical (If you could assign different values to different shots throughout basketball history, what would they be and why?), with tangents and footnotes laser-ing out in all different directions, because that's how talking about basketball works, because that's how basketball works. .With incredible art from Arturo Torres, this book is a must-have for anyone who has ever stayed up late into the night debating basketball's greatest moments, what-ifs, stories, and legends, or for those who are discovering the mythology of basketball for the first time.",
