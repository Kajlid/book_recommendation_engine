  "description": "In the year 2179 Lara Avara discovers that she has the gift of \"sight\" - she can walk through the places where the borders of time overlap and make contact with people from other eras. But when barbaric outsiders invade the land where Lara Avara's people live and seize half the small community as slaves, even her marvelous gift seems powerless to save them.In desperation, aided by Lenarchus the mystic, Lara Avara reaches back in time for help and inspiration. But Jennifer and Robert, time-traveling children from the long-ago twentieth century, don't bring easy answers. Both the captured slaves and those left behind face the loss of their identity as a people, and their firmly held belief in love and trust and sharing is tested beyond all measure.The heroic struggle of a people who refuse to answer violence with violence forms the core of this extraordinary and timely science fantasy by master storyteller Margaret J. Anderson.",
