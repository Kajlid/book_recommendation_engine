  "description": "Aislinn is most definitely not just the 'weird girl' everyone thought she was. Plagued by dreams so vivid she can barely breathe at times, she turns to Sid - her imaginary friend - for comfort. But when a stranger appears in Aislinn's life and her dreams begin to unfold, she soon finds herself stepping through a mystical, haunting waterfall where, on the other side, waits a brand new destiny. As her real identity is finally unveiled, the future will become twice as hard now that Aislinn is Alchera...Vaalbaraâ€™s lost princess. With a handsome guardian named Raighne by her side, Alchera soon realizes that this new fate is not about saving a dying planet or an uncaring race; it is all about saving ten 'Chosen Ones' who hold the future of humanity in the palm of their hands. When Carter, the son of a monstrous immortal appears, the question of whether or not Alchera will lose her true self and succumb to the shadows that are threatening to suffocate her very soul hangs in the balance. Will the true love of her guardian be enough to save her? Or will the darkness that Carter carries with him be the end of Alchera's hope?",
