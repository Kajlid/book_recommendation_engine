  "title": "The Other",
  "description": "A fast paced dialogue driven pulse elevating entertaining but not too weighty mystery novel with a wee touch of the supernatural, the sort of book that drives you to bed early just to read it. The Other evokes just that sort of rapid pace and dramatic imagery. Consider FBI Agent Zack Tolliver, the sun-washed ochre cliffs of Arizona, the body of a little blonde girl found on a remote mesa top apparently killed by a bear, the Navajo guide side-kick, the tracks that change mid-stride from animal to human, the evidence that appears to lead to a local recluse crazed by the tragic death of his wife and child. Then the wild ride from case closed to case wide open again, racing off to the deserts of California, another little blonde girl preyed upon and abandoned, and whoâ€™s doing all this, anyway? What sinister force is toying with our FBI agent?",
