  "description": "The best time of a young man's life is when he hits the college scene. From figuring out the best way to meet guys on campus to testing untried limits, the men of Kegs and Dorms take university life and turn it upside-down. In Kiernan Kelly's \"Secui Domus\", clever Aidan thinks he has a solution for solving campus housing problems, and all he needs is a little help from his friends--including the delicious Bobby Hatcher, who might just carry a torch for Aidan. Stephanie Vaughan's \"Another Believer\" takes a look at the train ride of a lifetime in which two college-bound strangers find they have a chemistry that can't be denied. Tory Temple's \"What It's All About\", a rip-roaring adventure through Rush Week, tells the story of Max, who's out, proud, and confused. Last but not least, Jane Davitt's \"Reading Between the Lines\" tells the story of Seth and Gabe, the odd-couple-from-hell roommates who are either going to kill each other or fall in love, and it's anybody's guess as to which'll come first.",
