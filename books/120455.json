  "description": "It's a happy time for Sloan Trent and Jane Everett. What could be happier than the event of their wedding? Their Krewe friends will all be there, and the event will take place in a medieval castle transported brick by brick to the New England coast. Everyone is festive and thrilled . . . until the priest turns up dead just hours before the nuptials. Jane and Sloan must find the truth behind the man and the murder—the secrets of the living and the dead—before they find themselves bound for eternity—not in wedded bliss but in the darkness of an historical wrong and their own brutal deaths.",
