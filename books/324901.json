  "description": "The journey's been Hell... but it's time to give the devil his due.This is it. This is where it all ends.It’s me, my shadow, and my demons against Lucifer.With the relics stolen, the only way to get them is to go back into the hellfire--back to Hell where Lucifer awaits. Defeating him may mean making the ultimate sacrifice, but even with so much at stake, I don’t know if I can.Things heated up fast with Cain, Elias, and Dorian, and now Maverick, but I’d sell my soul a hundred times to keep them as mine. Forever.What if that’s impossible?There’s so much danger ahead of us, but I’ll bring Hell on earth to save the ones I love. I just wonder that when all’s said and done, who will be the one wearing the unholy crown?",
