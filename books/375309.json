  "title": "Vampire Chase",
  "description": "A horror-tinged 70s set rock 'n' roll roller-coaster mystery. Steve Madison is a troubleshooter of a record label who pulls musicians out of jams and keeps things quiet. It's a refreshing hook/set-up for a detective book. This book is pure 70s rock 'n' roll radio. The Animals, The Who, Jimmi and Janis get name-checked. Madison and his .44 Magnum are turned loose to stop a series of brutal \"vampire\" murders. Now despite the groovy mustachioed vampire on the cover, there's no supernatural element the book. Occult, ritual Vampire slayings and Satan-worship? Sure. It's a really just a crackling (and well done) mystery about who in a set of characters on a rock tour is killing and drinking the blood of groupies along the way. And despite the Dracula cover it's clearly marked \"mystery\" on the spine. \"The Vampire Chase\" puts the pedal down on the first word and keeps it there until the final page.",
