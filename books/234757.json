  "description": "Grace is not your typical werewolf. Being taken at age eight, she endured most torture and pain that any one person should be able to bear. But when one night's chaos allows her to escape, will she really stay free? Not far after getting away she bumps into some more werewolves. Then the biggest and scariest of them claims she is his mate. Trapped by werewolves again? On top of all of her problems she can't even explain herself. She hasn't talked in 9 years and isn't about to open right up to the scary alpha that is making her feel things she has never felt before.----Hi everyone! Just so you know Silent Luna is now available on Amazon! I got it published and for copyright reasons I could not keep the whole book on WattPad unfortunately! Im sorry any confusion! I hope you like the book!!",
