  "description": "She'll juggle your balls.For Stella Allesandro, chaos is good. She's a rising star at a leading sports publicity firm. She's known throughout the industry as the jock whisperer—the one who can tame the baddest of the bad boys in professional sports without losing her signature smile.But Cal Hartshorn is an entirely different kind of chaos.He'll fix your broken heart.This former Army Ranger and now-famous cardiothoracic surgeon fails at nothing…except talking to a woman he's adored from afar. Whether on the battlefield or operating room, he's exacting, precise, and efficient, but all of that crumbles when Stella is in sight.Cal always knows—and gets—what he wants, and now he wants all of her. His forever girl.But Stella isn't convinced she's anyone's forever.This story features a sweet’n’sexy sports publicist who knows how to catch a man when she wants one and a slightly shy, somewhat awkward, very obscene surgeon and he's been in love with that publicist for months. Only trouble? He's never spoken to her. There's a bit with a raccoon (or beaver, tbd), some ass biting, dirty talk for days, and a very happy ever brief mentions of side characters who've experienced postpartum anxiety, alcohol dependence; brief mention of a main character's previous, off-page experience with infidelity; mentions of side character with incidents of fighting and lewd drunken behaviors.",
