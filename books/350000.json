  "description": "At the beginning of sophomore year, Marisa is ready for a fresh start and, hopefully, her first real boyfriend. Derek is clearly the boy Marisa has been waiting for, but there's just one problem. He already has a girlfriend. Then there's Nash, the dorktastic boy next door with zero boyfriend potential. So of course Nash wants to take his friendship with Marisa to the next level.But her boy drama is the least of Marisa's issues. She is dealing with overcoming depression and anxiety, a family that is falling apart, and a best friend who won't stop talking to sketchy guys online. Only the anonymous DJ, who has the school hooked on his underground podcasts, seems to get what Marisa's going through. But she has no idea who he is...or does she?",
