  "description": "He hates the media.She IS the media.April Thomas is a journalist specializing in music at The Topic, an up and coming magazine. They've secured the interview of the decade... Hip Hop/R&B artist, Boston Scott. But the only sparks that fly between the two when they meet are filled with animosity and irritation.Somehow, they still manage to get the interview completed. Even if it took some serious effort to sit in the same room with each other calmly. And this would be great news for them both, if the magazine wasn't branching off into new ventures. The Topic is moving on to video production. Which could mean a huge promotion for April.And guess who their first documentary is going to feature...April and the film crew will be following the Spotlight Tour, giving the masses a look at the superstar in his natural element on stage. He may hate to admit it, but Boston needs this almost as much as April does. And they have to put their hatred towards each other to the side and work together once more. What neither of them saw coming was the connection and attraction that'd be waiting for them once they did.However, the band is full of comical and outrageous friends without filters or tact, and April's family is always right there, pushing all of her buttons. So, if nothing else, this tour will be one for the books. Literally!",
