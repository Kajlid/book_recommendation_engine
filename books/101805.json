  "title": "Ten Kingdoms",
  "description": "A plot to overthrow the Ten Kingdoms has been discovered, but the only ones who know of it are a band of fugitives wanted for murder and treason. They barely escaped Castle Sovereign with their lives and have spent the last year in hiding. But now the time has come to strike back against House Andrassis. The only hope they have is finding a way to warn the kingdoms who are not part of the plot and rally them under the same banner. Which is exactly what Jada Suvari intends to do. Being daughter of the High King ensures that Jada will get an audience with any monarch she chooses to visit, but it will be no easy thing to tell a friend from an enemy and a single slip could cost them all their lives. Against the wishes of her friends, Jada enlists the help of a telepathic mage. A man whose loyalty can be bought. A man who once worked for the enemy. A man who may prove to be their undoing.",
