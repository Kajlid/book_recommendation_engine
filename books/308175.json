  "description": "Claire is a seventh-grade history buff. On one of her frequent visits to a thrift store, she finds a pocket watch. Little does she know that it’s no ordinary object. When showing it to her best friend Sam, the two of them end up going back in time to Colonial Era Boston. Thankfully, before they can get into any trouble, they’re helped by a girl named Prudence. Still, Claire and Sam have no idea how they got there, why they’re there, or how to get home. And now they’ve found themselves in the middle of a problem. They have to figure out how to get home, but first they have to help Prudence catch the person who’s been stealing from their family rye mill, and things are a little more complicated than they bargained for.",
