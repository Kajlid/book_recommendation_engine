  "description": "A Sin. An Abomination. Teenagers Caleb and Matthew had grown up under the shadow of a radical fundamentalist church that dictated every aspect of their families' lives. They were taught that a love like theirs—a love between two boys—was unnatural, forbidden, and destined to damn them forever. The religion didn't just influence their families; it controlled them, pulling the strings like puppets. Every action, every word, and every glance was scrutinized, making it nearly impossible for Caleb and Matthew to keep their secret. But their love demanded a chance—a single, daring opportunity to be together. They would risk everything, taking their shot right under the watchful eyes of those who would condemn them.",
