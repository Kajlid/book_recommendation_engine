  "description": "Against her will, Emma finds herself at the mercy of someone who shouldn't even exist. Passion, rage and fear intermingle as Emma's abductor alternately toys with her and submits to his fascination for this human who by all that is Elvin, should be an object of repulsion. Emma's captor is after all, an Elf-and not just any Elf-he is a prince among elves. And Emma? She is a mere mortal from the 21st century who finds herself in a world far removed from hers.",
