  "title": "SAY SOMETHING: A STORY ABOUT OVERCOMING",
  "description": "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\"This was a tale told in prose that sums up what it's like to never feel like you're loved but to learn that the truest love is the kind that you give yourself. Much in the style of Joy Harjo's \"I Give You Back\", Clarke closes with a piece where he mourns his past self, crying out into the world that he will now try to be the man that he himself can be proud of.\"\"Say something is a short book of poetry providing a biographical window into the author’s life. Jeremy Clarke believes that every person’s journey in life should be heard and told. The inspiration comes from within his soul, as does the desire to encourage others to speak their truth, to heal and live.\"",
