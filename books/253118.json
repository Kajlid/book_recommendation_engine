  "title": "Drujienna's Harp",
  "description": "A translucent sky, a stifling-hot night, a murky blue bottle in a curio shop--and with nothing more to warn her than a strange uneasiness, Tha was suddenly transported to the land of T'Pahl. She found herself an unwilling part of the destiny of the land, a destiny that had to be forestalled if she were ever to return to her own land. She gradually learned the forbidden lore of T'Pahl: its Histories spoke of an ancient curse; its Prophecies, of bloodshed and doom. And under the sway of a fiercely tyrannical ruler, in ignorance both real and pretended, the people of T'Pahl awaited the playing of Drujienna's harp.",
