  "description": "In 2006, Christianity Today voted this title to be one of the top 50 books that have shaped evangelicals! Who is Jesus? \"If Jesus was not God in human flesh, Christianity is exploded,\" writes John Stott. \"We are left with just another religion with some beautiful ideas and noble ethics; its unique distinction has gone.\" If Jesus is not who he said he was, and if he did not do what he said he had come to do, the whole superstructure of Christianity crumbles in ruins to the ground. Is it plausible that Jesus was truly divine? And what might this mean for us? John Stott's clear, classic statement examines the historical facts on which Christianity stands. Here is a sound, sensible guide for all who seek an intellectually satisfying explanation of the Christian faith.",
