  "description": "The third book in the riotously funny Vega Family Love Stories finds self-assured firefighter Leo Vega trying to reignite a flame that’s gone cold and finally bring his secret love affair into the open. Leo Vega’s love life has been on life support since long before the gunshot wound that put him on leave from the fire department. Now, a year after his injury, he’s finally able to return to work, but he’s no closer to fixing things with Sofi, his sister’s best friend and the woman he’s had a secret on-again, off-again relationship with for years. Sofi is still reeling from the revelation that her best friend lied to her years ago, setting her life on a course she’s resented ever since. She’s done with the Vega family, and that includes Leo, who has always prioritized his tight-knit clan over their relationship. She’s moving on with her life, but then circumstances beyond their control push Sofi and Leo into a tense roommate situation. It’s almost impossible to move on with someone new when Leo is there, reminding her what they had, every day. When his great-granddaughter Rosie tips Papo Vega off about what’s been going on between Leo and Sofi, he’s on the case, with reinforcements. Working behind the scenes alongside Sofi’s mom, he’s determined to help these two stubborn lovebirds end up where they belong—together.",
