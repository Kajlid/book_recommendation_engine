  "description": "David Williams's Second Sight is an extraordinary and terrifying tour de force of suspense, about a young woman haunted by the past -- a past in which she cannot have lived and loved, yet which gradually comes to be more real to her than the present.Jennie--a sentimental, beautiful, fragile and sensitive wife--is recovering from the shattering discovery of her husband's infidelity. Romantic, trusting, highly emotional, she has been deeply hurt and damaged but is determined to save their marriage.So she and Michael buy an old house--a dream house in a small country town, within commuting distance of the city--in which they try to share and build a new life, a life which is soon compromised by her curious and growing fascination with the past, with the house, and with its original owner, a gifted American painter who died under mysterious circumstances nearly one hundred years ago.Jennie, still searching for love, finds it possible to go back in time--first by accident, then by design, deliberately--and falls in love with the young painter. At first her visits to him, across the gulf of time, are short, but gradually his presence is more real to her than that of Micahel, and she determines to save him from the death she knows awaits him.Her desperate fight to save the man she loves from a death she knows will happen at an exact time and place and her growing fear that shemay be its cause are at the very center of a novel that holds the reader in suspense from the first page to the last.",
