So she takes a job making snacks for the kinky folk at Bondage Ranch. She's fascinated by what's going on around her, but she doesn't have time for play--she's got a business to run.All work and no play is no way to live, and Aidan knows that. He's in Bondage Ranch for a little R&R between business trips that take him all over the world. So when he sees Constance sneaking peeks at BDSM scenes, he decides to find out what she's like under that chef's uniform and show her the joys of sex and submission.",
