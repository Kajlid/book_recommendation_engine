  "description": "The ler had been genetically created to be a new race of supermen, and the experiment had not been entirely successful. They were superior to normal humans in certain ways, but all too human in others.Grudgingly, suspiciously, the overpopulated billions of Earth allotted the families of the ler a special reservation - a last wilderness where they could live their odd lives, contribute their talents to humanity's desperate needs - and yet be under constant surveillance.For the ler the situation was precarious and their future dubious. And with the disappearance of a ler girl outside the reservation, the explosion point had been reached.",
