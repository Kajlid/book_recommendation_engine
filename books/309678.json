  "description": "I’ve heard the whispers on campus of what a player Teddy McCallister is. Most girls on campus are vying to be the one, but guys like him don’t settle down. When he overhears that my tuition has been pulled and I’m going to basically be a college reject he makes me an offer I can’t refuse. Be his fake girlfriend until graduation so he can get his inheritance. It seems simple enough. I need the money and he needs someone to make him look committed.If one thing is certain, it’s that I won’t be falling for him. But no one warned me about what happens when my fake boyfriend starts to fall for me.",
