  "description": "Everybody knows you don’t mess with a big, bad Wolf. Well, everyone except Samantha Prescott… He’s Easy… Elijah “Easy” Cross works the night shift for the Nightriders MC, collecting pay-offs, protection money, and “policing” their properties. “Live to ride, ride to live” takes on a whole new meaning when members of a rival MC—the Hell Dogs— shoot him and give chase with the intent to kill. Easy ends up on the front porch of a single mom hiding deadly secrets from the same people after him. When she’s brutally murdered by the Hell Dogs, he feels responsible and promises to protect her two kids. Easy and his Nightrider brothers might ride on the far side of the law but hell, yeah their honor is worth dying for, and a promise is a promise. And she’s not… Samantha “Sam” Prescott only wants two things from the Nightriders —her niece and nephew. It’s bad enough her twin got involved with an outlaw motorcycle gang—and was murdered—but now Sam is desperate to extricate herself and the kids. To do that, she has to escape Easy, the sexy biker with boy-next-door dimples and killer instincts. It’s that whole killer thing she must keep in mind when the moonstruck Wolf is determined to make her his mate. Her instincts scream, “RUN!” Her hormones want to get down and dirty with the man who turns her boneless with a kiss. When Sam is kidnapped and tortured by the Hell Dogs, Easy must decide to either keep his promise to ride through the fires of hell to find her or let her go for good, even if it kills him. Warning: Lots of down and dirty sex, extreme violence—including against women—of the blood and guts kind, alpha MC members, and a moonstruck Wolf shifter with dimples. This is the dark side of the Moonstruck world where sex is rough, death is brutal, and laws don’t mean jack.",
