  "title": "Across Australia from East to West",
  "description": "Thomas Palfy’s latest work introduces readers to the many popular tourist attractions of Australia. It follows the tradition set by the author’s earlier photo-travel books. All the states and territories are described in words and illustrated by many photographs. The pictures not only include captivating landscapes and interesting buildings but people, animals and plants as well, since these are also part of the whole experience.Between 2006 and 2009 the author and his wife visited the length and breadth of Australia and recorded these journeys in words and pictures. The travel diaries were condensed into essays about the attractions of each state and territory and the best photos selected for inclusion in the book. Because of the vast expanse of the continent and the large number of well-known and lesser known fascinating sights, it was impossible to visit and describe them all. A handful of pictures depicting places of interest visited before 2006 are also included.",
