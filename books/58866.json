  "description": "Victor and Veronica are soulmates whose paths should have never crossed. Victor is a charming but wicked vampire who could compel a corpse on the gallows to speak. And Veronica, a church-going innocent who longs for a taste of the darker side of life, gets more than she bargained for when, trying to fill an inner emptiness, she is bedded by the devil himself. His obsession with her lures her into a hellish nightmare of no return. And her desire to be with him has run her off the road to Heaven and soon she too will turn her back on righteousness. But she discovers the truth about her dark prince, but is it too late? And will her newfound vampire friend help her to destroy the only man she has ever loved? And why is he so willing to help her destroy him?",
