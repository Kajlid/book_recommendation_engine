  "description": "Something is very wrong with the Fitzwilliam estate... It was supposed to be a regular séance job. But from the minute I met an angry ghost in the hall, I knew there wasn’t going to be anything ordinary about this house or its dead residents. First of all, there were way too many of them. Second, some of them had been helped along from living to dead. Third, my attempt to figure out what was going on got a bit sidetracked when I met the gardener. He was tall, dark green, and handsome. And really, really smart. So I hired him to help me figure out what was going on. And that’s when things got interesting, in more ways than one. I think I’m falling for an orc, and that’s making it really hard to concentrate on doing my job, but if I don’t, I’m going to be in a whole heap of trouble.M/M romance with an HFN ending, the first in a series.",
