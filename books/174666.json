  "title": "Eat Less, Live Longer: Your Practical Guide to Calorie Restriction with Optimal Nutrition",
  "description": "• You found out about the calorie restriction experiments on many animal species and you wonder whether it would work in humans too. • You made up your mind to safely try restricting your daily calories for a possible slowing of aging and a longer lifespan. • You understand the importance of getting an appropriate quantity of nutrients, yet you have no idea how to make good choices in food stores and restaurants. • You may have a chronic disease or you may be in a certain stage of your life like childhood, pregnancy, breastfeeding and you wonder whether it is safe to try calorie restriction at all. • You are more interested in nutritional principles than in counting calories, vitamins, proteins or in following rigid recipes and set menus. • You wonder whether dietary supplements are necessary at all. • You wonder whether a magic pill could mimic the effects of calorie restriction. There is a fine line separating calorie restriction with optimal nutrition from starvation. Don't cross it. Read this book instead.",
