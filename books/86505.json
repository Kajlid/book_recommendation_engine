  "description": "You do not question The Way.Every Toran knows this, even Kiran, a lowly orphan. But at age sixteen, no matter how hard he tries, he’s still tormented by doubt. With only an ancient scroll to guide them, he and six other teens embark on a quest into the Land Unknown, a journey across flatlands rife with wind demons, then raft a river whose spirit rages in a fury of whitewater, only to encounter a clan of nomads entranced by a witch and shaman. Kiran and his friends were warned to beware the savages and their heathen ways. But Kiran’s curiosity leads him astray.When the group meets The Guardian and his family of followers, the others believe him to be the Wise Man described in the scroll. But something isn’t quite right. Too late, Kiran realizes they’ve been seduced by a cult. Into the jungle they flee, into the territory of cannibalistic headhunters, and the quest turns into a fight for survival. Lost and facing starvation, Kiran must use all the skills he’s learned from the natives to survive. If he is to succeed in his quest, he must decide whether to accept The Way of his forefathers or trust his own judgment to find The Path to the Sun.",
