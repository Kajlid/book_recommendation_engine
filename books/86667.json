  "title": "There Will Come More No Tears",
  "description": "Before the days of radio, there were poets. Poets used paper like canvas to tell a story or create a mood. They were well worthy of their praise. They lived interesting lives and saw the world through different spectacles. Many were misunderstood.Today, poetry is not the vehicle is used to be, and it is not read or studied as it was in its golden years. That does not mean that beautiful prose isn't still written or appreciated. This book of sonnets deserves an audience. Each stanza is carefully and cleverly woven together.The reader is carried through emotions by words that are threaded together precisely for that purpose. \"There Will Come No More Tears\" leaves us with a promise of hope and inspiration.",
