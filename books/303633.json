  "description": "\"Did you have relations with my brother . . .\"\nGood question. I’d like to preface this by saying it was never my intention to ever get involved in a workplace romance, let alone get involved with the most surly, agitating, and pompous man I’ve ever met who just so happens to be my new friend’s brother. My intentions were to show students how English and reading books could actually be fun and make a new life for myself in the suburbs of Chicago.But so far, I’ve managed to be called into the principal’s office.Coerced into participating in the teacher's badminton league.And instigated into passionate fights with Arlo Turner over education and decorum while losing my underwear at the same time.Known as Mr. Turns Me On, he’s the reason I might get fired from my first ever teaching job.",
