An unexpected ally is literally blasted into the fray. Sergeant Ray Muirel, war veteran, is in the rear of a van mistaken for the CIC van. His van is attacked and he is blasted out the back of the van and escapes. Soon after he meets Marianne, the very image of his wife who died in the van attack. Predictably he falls in love with her. Together they work to foil the conspiracy. The question is, can they do it before a nuclear missile is unleashed on Washington DC?",
