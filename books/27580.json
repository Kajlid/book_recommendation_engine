  "description": "Blog It Out, Bitch is a collection of humor blogs from author/blogger, Nina Perez. Once called The Oprah of Myspace due to her mass appeal and uncanny ability to get readers hooked on almost anything from green tea to TV shows, she successfully launched her own site in 2009 and started a series of spin-off blogs, Blog It Out, Baby. In Blog It Out, Bitch you'll meet her long-suffering husband Donny, who Nina swears will one day kill her in a fit of \"white boy crazy\" rage, and her inquisitive daughter, Kali. Each blog is a look into the life of a 30-something wife, mother, blogger, and sometimes bitch.",
