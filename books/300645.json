  "description": "Do Gods actually exist?The answer to one of life’s ultimate questions is finally answered.Turns out they do…………………..Just not the kind we were hoping for!When five Gods appear on Earth, they bring with them a reign of destruction that wipes out half the population and most of the Earth’s infrastructure in one single day, and a message for those who remain.Serve your Gods as they demand, or die!From the rubble, a new way of life is born. Strict and harsh in equal measure as the humans are put to work serving their Gods.Money, wealth and greed become things of the past.Five great pyramids are constructed for the Gods, large enough to contain a whole city. One in each of their chosen lands, within the five most populated continents on Earth.Near to each pyramid, another grand building is constructed. Home to the only form of entertainment found on the New Earth, The Colosseums.Centuries since the last gladiators pitted their wits against each other, the blood sport returns in abundance as the Gods train and hone their champions of the arena, then face off against the other Gods in organised wars. Thousands of men and women savagely dying, purely for the entertainment and bragging rights of each God.When a young gladiator named Jacob rises up through the ranks, the humans soon discover he represents their greatest hope of rebelling against the all-powerful Gods. However, when Jacob falls for the charms of the beautiful Goddess Petra, his divided loyalty is called into question in ways he could never have imagined.",
