The wise king would do anything to protect his daughter, but he is no match for a powerful ruler from a faraway empire who suddenly comes to claim Isydoris as his future bride. This frightening man offers no explanation, and he is not afraid to spill blood to get what he wants. When he vows her small kingdom would be spared from his wrath if she does as he says, the young princess has no choice but to strike a bargain with him, even though she knows she is agreeing to a fate worse than death.The mysterious tyrant's name is Reigh Azhrael, and he is famous for only one thing—his cruelty. Ever since he ascended the throne of the vast Aessarion empire, the world has known nothing but war and misery. All seven kingdoms of Ardea fear him and his invincible army. The Aessarion emperor has no mercy for the weak. He is a monster. There is nothing kind about him.For that very reason, his shocking decision to spare an entire kingdom in exchange for the beautiful princess' hand in marriage, leaves people guessing. Can this one woman be enough to tame the beast inside him, or is she to become his next victim? Intended for mature audiences.",
