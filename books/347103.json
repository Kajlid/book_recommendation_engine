  "description": "On a dark road outside the village of Highbury, Mr. and Mrs. Darcy's carriage is hailed by a damsel in distress. Ever the gentleman, Fitzwilliam Darcy stops to aid the young woman, little suspecting that gypsies roam these woods, or that both the Darcys' possessions and the woman are about to vanish into the night.The Darcys seek out the parish magistrate, who is having a difficult evening of his own. Mr Knightley and his new wife, the former Miss Emma Woodhouse, are hosting a party to honor the marriage of their friends Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax. The celebration turns sinister, however, when Edgar Churchill, uncle and adoptive father of the groom, falls ill and dies. The cause of death: poison.The circumstances of another recent death in the Churchill family lead Mr. Knightley to suspect that Mr. Churchill's demise was no accident. When connections between the robbery and murder emerge, the Darcys and Knightleys join forces to investigate the crimes. Together they must work quickly to locate the source of teh poison and the murderer's motive - before the killer strikes again. The Darcys take center stage as the Regency era's answer to The Thin Man's Nick and Nora, searching for truth between teatimes, amidst the social swirl of Jane Austen's England.",
