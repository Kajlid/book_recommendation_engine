  "description": "The small town of Zephyr, Ohio, is home to a very special young woman. Damara is quiet, reclusive -- and she has the ability to make other people's dreams, fears and fantasies all too real. But this isn't an ability that she can control, as many people in town are beginning to learn. For some, dreams are becoming living nightmares. For others, their deepest fears are suddenly alive and worse than they ever imagined.As Damara's powers sweep like a wildfire through the town, her neighbors' long-hidden desires and secret wishes are dragged out into the open -- and given life. But as the old saying goes, be careful what you wish for, because in this case -- it could kill you.",
