  "description": "In this, the third Emmie Reese mystery short story, our heroine is confronted by four separate mysteries, the final one involving a murder in her own home. Emmie is an ambitious young writer who attempts to resurrect a literary magazine in an effort to promote her work. And though the story takes place in 1902, she faces many of the same obstacles young writers of today face--though few of her modern counterparts need worry about vengeful countesses.
