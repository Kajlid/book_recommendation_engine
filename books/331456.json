  "description": "At the Demon Hunter Academy, a witch's worth comes from her magic and her demon fighting prowess. But when I lose everything in one day – my family, my arm, and my magic – I also lose all hope of graduating this term. Three daring men rally behind me: the sensual healer who saves my life, my seductive college classmate, and our tempting professor who helps me reclaim my lost magic. Their powers complement my own, and I find each one irresistible in his own unique way. But when the infernal realm claws its way deeper into our world, no one is safe. We must band together if we hope to defeat the next demonic incursion. Are these three men bold enough to stand with me against hell itself? Demon Hunter Academy is a steamy standalone paranormal academy romance. This book's main characters will later make appearances throughout Bound to the Vampires, a complete trilogy.",
