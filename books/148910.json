  "description": "Dean and Jess knew the house had a tragic past but it did not stop them from making the move with their young daughters. It was supposed to be a new - and bigger - home with which they could continue to build upon their already established happy memories but as the house's past begins to haunt them they realise it is not the dream they first hoped it to be. From Matt Shaw (author of The Cabin, Happy Ever After and Sick B*stards) comes a new novella; a tale of psychological horror and slow-building tension leading to an unforgettable climax.",
