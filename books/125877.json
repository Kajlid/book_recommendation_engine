  "description": "Sigmund Black is no ordinary assassin. A hybrid living in 1912 London, Sigmund is tapped by Barbara Holloway, the CEO of Royal Honey Incorporated, to serve as her bodyguard on the maiden voyage of her newest creation, a pollen-powered passenger liner called the RMS Titanic. The ship and its first journey are sources of pride for Ms. Holloway, but Sigmund soon discovers she may have ulterior motives. Set in an alternate history beepunk world built upon pollen-powered mechanics and jellyglass, \"The Maiden Voyage\" explores Sigmund Black's journey as a newborn apisthrope (or \"werebee\" to humans), whose only choice in his short life is to mate or kill for his Queen. Surrounded by other varieties of hidden hybrids, Sigmund must decide whether to fly straight or break free of the hive.",
