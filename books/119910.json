  "description": "This (Novella) is a two pronged story line. On one hand it features the rise of a mob hit man. The second connected story is about a fence, a low level outsider of the mob. It tells the two stories alternating in the book as they relate, and the Gypsy hag who's control drives the way it goes. Her hold on our characters is subtle, yet devious.",
