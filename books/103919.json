  "description": "Revolving Doors is the story of Gabriella Alexis Sandoval. She is educated, beautiful, and sassy. Gabriella lives a pampered life and fortunately for her, she hasn’t had to endure much turmoil. But there is one defining moment encountered as a young woman that set the stage for how she would proceed with life, and love. IN LIFE, she becomes a woman on a mission. A self-proclaimed “go-getter,” Gabriella goes for the gusto. She graduates at the top of her business class at a top university, becomes a businesswoman with two successful companies before the age of 30, and her power and wealth continue to grow. IN LOVE, she has sworn it off and in its place is a woman with no interest in emotional attachment, and an inability to commit. When her world is aligned exactly as she wants it, Gabriella comes face-to-face with a question she didn’t think she’d ever have to ask herself, “What happens when a love gone wrong, returns for a chance at redemption?”",
