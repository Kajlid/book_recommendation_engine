  "description": "When it comes to operas in which, for once, nobody dies, Gioacchino Rossini's great comedy Il Barbiere di Siviglia (the Barber of Seville) is perhaps the most popular of all time. It's got it all: funny plot, great tunes (including nine of the most immediately recognizable notes in Western music: \"Figaro, Figaro, Figaro!\"), irresistible characters, and an overture that provided Bugs Bunny with one of his greatest moments on screen. Have you ever wondered about the scoring of Lindoro's sweet first act aria, or the requirements for the boom in Basilio's celebration of calumny? Check it all out with this complete orchestral score from Dover Publications. As is standard with Dover, this score is a reprint of a German original, and because it offers the complete orchestration it will be more useful to the music student than to the working singer.",
