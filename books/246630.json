  "description": "Trapped 1300 years in the past, they have one mission: survive.  In the 23rd century, humanity has been hunted to the verge of extinction by an alien race. When an exploratory ship accidentally travels back in time to Viking age Scandinavia, the human race is given a second chance. Pursued by the power-hungry King Harald, the four surviving crew members join a ragtag band of Vikings as they pillage their way across Europe. It will take all their ingenuity, courage and technical know-how just to survive. But survival is only the beginning. To save humanity, they must somehow return to the stars.  Thus begins a decades-long effort to teach the Vikings to build a craft capable of reaching spaceâ€”a ship that will come to be known as the Iron Dragon.",
