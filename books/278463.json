  "description": "Time is an illusion. Although the laws of physics create a powerful impression that time is flowing, in fact there are only timeless ‘nows’. In The End of Time, the British theoretical physicist Julian Barbour describes the coming revolution in our understanding of the a quantum theory of the universe that brings together Einstein’s general theory of relativity – which denies the existence of a unique time – and quantum mechanics – which demands one. Barbour believes that only the most radical of ideas can resolve the conflict between these two that there is, quite literally, no time at all. The End of Time is the first full-length account of the crisis in our understanding that has enveloped quantum cosmology. Unifying thinking that has never been brought together before in a book for the general reader, Barbour reveals the true architecture of the universe and demonstrates how physics is coming up sharp against the extraordinary possibility that the sense of time passing emerges from a universe that is timeless. The heart of the book is the author’s lucid description of how a world of stillness can appear to be teeming with in this timeless world where all possible instants coexist, complex mathematical rules of quantum mechanics bind together a special selection of these instants in a coherent order that consciousness perceives as the flow of time. Finally, in a lucid and eloquent epilogue, the author speculates on the philosophical implications of his Does free will exist? Is time travel possible? How did the universe begin? Where is heaven? Does the denial of time make life meaningless? Written with exceptional clarity and elegance, this profound and original work presents a dazzlingly powerful argument that all will be able to follow, but no-one with an interest in the workings of the universe will be able to ignore.",
