  "description": "I have this strange sense that my silence is preparing me for something I can't name . . . Elizah Rayne is nothing like other fourteen-year-old girls. More interested in bird bones than people, she wraps herself in silence. Trying to escape the shadow of her gambler father, Elizah and her mother move into an old house that borders a cemetery. All her mother wants is for them to have \"normal\" lives. But that becomes impossible for Elizah when she finds a human jawbone by the river and meets Nathaniel, a strangely hypnotic boy who draws Elizah into his dreamlike and mysterious world. Only by forgetting everything she knows can Elizah understand the truth about Nathanielâ€•and discover an unimaginable secret.",
