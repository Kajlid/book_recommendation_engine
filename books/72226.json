  "description": "Widow Glory Sinclair and her daughter are living a quiet life on the mountain homestead her family settled nearly three hundred years ago. Then, on a crisp autumn morning, a fractured shriek echoes across the hollow, and Glory’s temperamental handyman claims her prized statue carved from a tree trunk attacked him. Could a wooden likeness of a witch who died centuries before take life? Glory doesn’t think so. Still, mouthwatering sheriff and bachelor William Moore’s decision to hang around and get to the bottom of the increasingly frequent strange occurrences provides her a degree of comfort. Her growing desires to find comfort in his bed…not so much.",
