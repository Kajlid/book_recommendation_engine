  "description": "The Milliginians. From a distant world they came, a race not unlike our own but technologically superior enough to impose their genocidal interests upon our Mother Earth with a force so catastrophic it reduces the global human population to a small handful of survivors while the surface of the planet is blanketed by a white powder. .a science fiction writer with presidential aspirations, a schizophrenic, an actor convinced he's the robot he'd portrayed on a television series in pre-invasion times, a self-proclaimed Son of God, a girl chosen to bear the children of a new civilization in the last known settlement of humanity. From the mind of Walter Koenig comes Buck Alice and the Actor-Robot, where insanity and survival strive to come to terms with a human condition stripped down to primal instinct, betrayal and social disarray, for a read matched only by the best the world of science fiction has to offer! (From back cover text by Nicholas Grabowsky)",
