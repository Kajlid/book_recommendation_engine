  "description": "A dying Ethiopian Priest, a cryptic prophecy, a centuries-lost map, and the fabled lost Ark of the Covenant – this is no way for a cellist to vacation. A great evil stirs, but Maxwell Sinclair simply wants to do right by his godfather's unusually high expectations. As the world teeters on the precipice of chaos, Max hastens to retrace the footsteps of Menelik, son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, though Max’s actions may have unintended consequences. Pack your bags for the thrill of your life, but hurry – the very fabric of reality is at stake.",
