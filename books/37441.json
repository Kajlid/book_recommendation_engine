But Butch Wheeler and his 11 outlaws murdered her husband, raped Nora, set their house on fire and left her for dead.She survived and returned, hiring retired bounty hunter Peter Clawson to teach her how to track and kill.She had to train, not only in the ways of killing, but to mentally and physically survive in a male world of merciless, sometimes mindless, violence.When the day came that Nora was ready, the deadly 12-member gang was no match against the fury of one womanâ€™s vengeance.",
