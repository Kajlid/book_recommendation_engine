  "title": "The Spades Club: Where Interracial Hotwife and Cuckold Fantasies become Reality",
  "description": "The Spades Club is not your ordinary club. It's a swingers club... of sorts. The Club caters to white couples in which the female desires the company of hot well hung black men. The club has two areas dividing it in half, they are the Hotwife side and the Cuckold Side. Interracial debauchery abounds on both sides, each with their own special flavors.The story focuses on Tom and Sheri who are your average American couple. Like many couples in their mid 30â€™s, their life (particularly their sex life) has become stale and unimaginative. Sheri is a fiery redhead and a reformed party girl whose repressed lust for adventurous sex is about to be re-awakened in the Spades Club.The book is over 35,000 words and is a very hot and steamy read featuring BBC, cuckolding, gangbangs, creampies and countless other illicit acts of sex.After reading this book you will be lusting for your own local Spades Club and may spend hours searching online just to make sure you have not over looked something exotic hidden in your own back yard!",
