  "description": "Ariel Ripa needs a miracle for her daughter on Earth. On Belizair, only a miracle will provide Zeraac d'Amato and Komet d'Vesti with a shared bond-mate. Neither Zeraac, Komet, nor Ariel expect to get what their hearts most desire. But when Zeraac travels to Earth at the request of his brother's human bond-mate, he rescues Ariel and finds the answer to his own and Komet's prayers-just as they're the answer to hers. By Council law Ariel must agree to a binding ceremony of her own free will and can only know the truth about Zeraac and Komet once they're in the transport chamber. To follow the rules would mean the death of Ariel's daughter. While to break the law could mean the setting aside of the mate-bond and the possibility of exile for the two men. For Zeraac and Komet, there is no choice other than to risk their honor and their hearts for Ariel and her young daughter. Through love and hope born from the depths of darkness and despair, the three find something more rare than the precious Ylan stones they wear on their wrists-a miracle that will change their lives.",
