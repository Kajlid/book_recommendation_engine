  "description": "How far would you go for the one you love?Most days, I can happily sit by, watching over and protecting Liam from all of the supernatural beasties that lurk in the darkness. It's my job, after all. But seeing her break his heart again...it's too much. I'd love nothing more than to jab my elemental sword straight through her scrawny little body.I was never meant to love Liam. There are strict rules against a Guardian falling for her human charge. But here we are. Now, with a twist of fate so cruel, he can hear my words...my actual voice, not just the nudgings of an angel. I know I shouldn't have, but I told him how I felt. He needed to know he wasn't alone. But a damn incubus overheard the whole thing and is threatening to bring it to the Guild. So, now I have to hunt him down and silence him. One thing's for sure, this line I'm treading is dangerous and if I'm not careful, I could lose Liam forever. Calling all fans of Shayne Silvers, CN Crawford, Shannon Mayer, & KF Breene! If you like snarky-fun humor, gripping supernatural scenes, and twists that leave you spellbound â€” then you will LOVE Carissa Andrews' supernatural worlds.",
