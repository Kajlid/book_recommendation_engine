  "title": "Enrique El Negro",
  "description": "When the Portuguese explorer, Ferdinand Magellan \"discovered\" the Philippines for the Spanish crown in the 16th century, he was accompanied by a slave named Enrique, who could communicate with the inhabitants of the islands that Magellan visited. Little is known of this slave except that he existed. However, a local historian has come up with a still-controversial theory that the slave Enrique was from what is now known as the Philippines, and therefore, was the man who first circled the globe (and not the Spaniard Sebastian Elcano).This historical fiction, as told by Enrique, is not only a chronicle of the famous voyage but also a peep into the life and times of 16th-century Europe and the Philippines. More importantly, it is a look into the mind of a young man who is given the rare opportunity of seeing civilizations unravel before him under the opposing influences of greed and friendship.",
