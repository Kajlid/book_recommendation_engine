  "description": "Who can a girl with a broken heart rely on if not her gay best friend? Sara Sexton and Martin Blake are besties so it was natural for her to flee to him after breaking up with a Greek lover. But Martin has changed, preoccupied with his new business. In Hong Kong, he's a high-profile, high-dollar interior designer. When Sara meets Andy Harris, a romantic with a bodaciouis bubble-butt, Martin's still on the market and not happy. Seems Martin's only happy when Sara's alone and miserable. Got any 'friends' like that? Now Sara has to juggle a consuming old friendship and a blossoming romance... And how does a girl do that? And what happens when she's forced to choose between the past and the future?",
