  "description": "In the late 1950’s, the United States finally started to pay attention to what was happening in Latin America. The revolution in Cuba was gathering steam and very soon, a committed communist regime would be operating less than one hundred miles from its coastline. It was imperative to keep an eye on this potential menace and as relations with Panama became worse, the US military was anxious to secure a base from which Castro’s island could be kept under observation. It’s 1964. A Latin country south of Panama with a huge international business presence is under the thumb of a corrupt dictator. Maraguay has a deep-water harbor and an island air strip which is leased to the United States. The treaty is up for renewal. The dictator stands to collect a huge chunk of the money the US is offering for a new agreement. Officers of the Armed Forces and Daniel Montego, the senior cadet from the military academy, plot a coup. Key to success is cutting all communications to prevent the U.S. from getting news of the coup and sending troops from Panama to intervene. Friends of the cadet leader who work at the country’s franchised telegraph company are recruited to help. By default, they become deeply involved as the Coup succeeds. Death and injury during the battle to take over the military headquarters, find the senior cadet at the head of the junta. When the dust clears, multinational businesses operating in the country demand that the treaty bid open to all comers. The new Junta agrees to their demands and issues invitations to bid to the world’s leading powers. George MacGregor, a young friend of the new leader is named to negotiate the treaty. He deals with Castro, Roa, Rusk and Johnson and these historical figures are resurrected as they meet in Cuba and at the LBJ ranch in Texas where an unusual compromise is reached. The inner workings of a coup, and how it affects both participants and the general population, are revealed. Meanwhile, millions stolen by the ex-dictator and his friends are tracked to their secret hiding places and strangely enough, are used by the coup leaders to further their aims of returning the government to a civilian power and establish a trusted relationship with the population. The story is interspersed with the hilarious personal tales of one of the key coup participants.",
