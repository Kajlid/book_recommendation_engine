  "description": "When Lieutenant Craig Faulk of the CDDC—Chicago Department of Demon Control—is called to a routine demon attack, he doesn’t expect to find the victim alive. They never live long enough to speak. But handsome Steven Richter defies all odds. How and why has this self-proclaimed loser survived a demon attack when others much stronger have died?Steven knows he’s not good enough for a man like Craig, but that doesn’t stop him from dreaming. It’s easy to fall for a rugged, cowboy demon-hunter in the mean streets of urban Chicago, one who’s risked his life to save Steven. But Craig saves lives while Steven sells his body to make ends meet, and no way could anything come of the attraction both of them experience in each other’s presence.Or could it?When Steven meets life’s greatest challenge, he discovers for the first time that he has true value as an openly gay man. But will it be enough to erase his checkered past and win the heart of a demon-hunting cowboy",
