  "description": "The crew of Earth’s greatest battleship faces an unstoppable foe in this epic science fiction series blending space opera, military sci-fi, alternate history, and more.   The U.S.S. Merrimack was the finest battleship class spaceship in Earth’s fleet—able to stand up against the best the Palatine Empire could throw at them, even able to attack and kill swarms of the seemingly unstoppable Hive.   But nothing could have prepared the captain and crew of the Merrimack to face the Myriad-three colonized worlds in the midst of a globular cluster that the Hive had somehow overlooked.",
