  "description": "Abandoned by the retreating Spanish Army during the Peninsular war, the gun was an eighteen pounder bronze cannon, thirteen feet long, a foot in diameter at the muzzle, and weighing three tons.

But first they must take it a hundred miles across the mountains, with nothing but a handful of donkeys and half-starved oxen to haul it. First they must gather forces...On its epic journey over the mountains, the ornamented bronze cannon begins to gain almost mystical significance for the ever-swelling force that surrounds it. With the gun going on before them they are no longer a mere band of Spanish irregulars, they are an army.
