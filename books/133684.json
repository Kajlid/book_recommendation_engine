  "description": "She lied to me... She betrayed the one rule that I'm most adamant about: Honesty. Complete and utter fucking honesty. I really wish she was someone else—someone who didn't have the ability to make me feel, someone I could easily discard like the hundreds of women before her. She isn't. I'm drawn to her like I've never been drawn to a woman before—completely captivated by the very sight of her. But unfortunately, with my past slowly re-surfacing for all of the world to see, I'll have to find a way to let her go. She can never be mine.",
