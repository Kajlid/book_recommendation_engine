  "description": "Louise is trapped in a house with her neurotic mother and her browbeaten dad. Her parents only notice her to criticise her - she never seems to be quite good enough. So when Danny follows her home one day, she's not scared, she's excited. It's not long before Louise and Danny are head over heels in love - but can you love someone too much?",
