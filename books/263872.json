  "title": "A Demon's Contract",
  "description": "Barkley is determined to save his family from the war with the Quathian Empire, but only magic can combat the magic that ravaged his home. So, he sets off to forge a contract with a demon like those from the legends he’d heard as a child.  When Barkley enters the demon plane and begins his search it is Zaxor Vez'gollock who answers his call.  This odd and powerful demon might just be more than Barkley bargained for but nevertheless, he won’t be stopped in his quest to end the war. Barkley’s family, and all of Rilia, is worth any sacrifice he must make in return.  Though perhaps there is more to this creature, and their contract, than first appears.  ~80,000 words - warnings for explicit m/m content.",
