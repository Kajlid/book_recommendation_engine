On their way to falling in love, the two traverse grief, delve into the Internet fandom they once unknowingly shared, and navigate the realities of transphobia and the stigmas of carrying the \"vampire disease.\" Then, when strange things start happening at the collection, Sol must embrace even more of the unknown to save himself and his job.
