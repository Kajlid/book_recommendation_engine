  "description": "Chestnuts are roasting. Jingle bells are rocking. The halls are about to be decked.In other words, Christmas is about to hit Hemlock Cove. Hard.There’s just one little problem…or maybe two. Okay, there are three big problems plaguing Bay Winchester before she can enjoy the holidays.The first is that the warden who lost his job thanks to a prison break weeks before is determined to stalk Bay until she magically fixes his life. He keeps showing up in the oddest of places and making the sort of demands she can’t fulfill.The second involves Aunt Tillie, who has decided to gift her nemesis Margaret Little a special spell rather than a lump of coal this holiday season. It involves her Christmas decorations taking on a life—and voice—of their own. The spell, however, isn’t nearly as contained as it was supposed to be.When a body shows up at the local private school, that means it’s one problem too many for Bay. And she doesn’t know which problem to solve first.The headmistress of the school was involved in a convoluted affair with father of one of her students. The list of suspects who wanted her dead was long and sundry, however.All Bay wants is to surprise her husband with a dog for Christmas and to eat her weight in cookies. She has to save the day first, though.Murder, mayhem, and mistletoe are on the menu.Death might not be far behind.Buckle up, because the Santa decorations are coming to town.",
