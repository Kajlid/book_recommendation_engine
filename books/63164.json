  "description": "With her stunning white blonde hair, Cassandra Juliet Winthrop was always the belle of the ball in the Colonies, so much so that she began to think that it was a bit of a bore. But a tour of the Continent, now that would be exciting! Her indulgent father acquiesced with surprising ease, and she found herself, one night, at a splendid gala in Paris fairly that wreaked of European elegance. There was one fly in her ointment – one man that refused to fall into line with the rest of her easy conquests, and for a reason she couldn’t possibly realize until, in the wee hours of the morning as the dance is ending, the very same man, Count Victor Andreiv Kaspersky Salkov, kidnapped her. Gone were the parties and balls and galas and dances, and in their place was a daily regimen of punishment, degradation and complete and utter humiliation – all for one purpose, and one purpose only: to get – and preferably keep – her pregnant, constantly forced to produce an ongoing line of white haired babies, barely allowed to recover from one birth before her mate and match was on her to breed another... and another... and another... Warning: This is a breeding story, containing elements of non-consensual sex (for the purpose of animalesque reproduction, aka studding), kidnapping, degradation, humiliation, and non-consensual discipline and punishment. If such elements might disturb or make you uncomfortable, please do not purchase this story.",
