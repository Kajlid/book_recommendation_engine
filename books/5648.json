  "description": "Set in the wilds near Cornwall's sea-tossed coastline, The House on the Strand concerns a young man's experiments with hallucinogenic drugs and his travels back and forth in time to the mysteries of 14th century England. Gradually growing more involved in the lives and emotions of the early Cornish manor lords and their ladies, he finds his own life pale in comparison and the presence of his American wife and stepsons a hindrance to his new-found existence. This ancient/modern Gothic tale will grip the reader until the last surprising twist in Daphne du Maurier's intricately-woven plot of today and yesterday.",
