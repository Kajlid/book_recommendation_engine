  "title": "Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich",
  "description": "Height only five-foot four; a figure of Ghandi-like emaciation barely tipping the scales at one hundred pounds; a head too large for his body; a clubfoot for which he was taunted as both man and boy - all the cards seemed stacked against him. Goebbels blamed the world at large; he hated the human race, and he boasted of his hatred in his secret diaries.Historian David Irving is the first to make use of the entire 80,000 pages of the Goebbels diaries - diaries that lay unrecognized for fifty years in the Red Army's \"Trophy\" archives in Moscow. From this extraordinary trove, to which Irving has added six years' research into the archives of the Western World, he has written the first full-scale biography of Adolf Hitler's confidant and evil genius, Dr. Joseph Goebbels.Here for the first time are Goebbels's secret, unpublished writings on the Reichstag Fire, the Night of the Long Knives, the Dollfuss murder, the Saar plebiscite, the invasion of Prague, Pearl Harbor, and scores of other turning points in modern history. Dr. Goebbels faithfully records Hitler's innermost councils, documenting the hidden methods and strategies of Nazi leadership.",
