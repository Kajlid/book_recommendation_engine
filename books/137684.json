  "description": "The eighteenth collection of Mutts! Earl and Mooch are back in a year';s worth of color Sunday and black-and-white daily cartoons. There's nothing like a buddy: Just ask Earl and Mooch, the adorable pets who inhabit the world of Mutts. The fact that Earl's a dog and Mooch is more of the feline persuasion makes about as much difference as a flea's eyebrow. These guys have a special friendship. Anyone who has a pet will see themselves and their beloved furry housemates in this collection. Yet Mutts has an audience appeal beyond pet lovers. McDonnell's art is unique in that it is reminiscent of the golden age of comic strips.",
