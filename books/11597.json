She enjoyed it, she was good at it, and she wanted nothing more than to do it. But fate had other plans for Leora. On a day like any other, Leora's life was turned upside-down when two strangers visited her and informed her family that she had the power of a Mage-abilities she had always been raised to fear. As they seek to whisk her away and train her in her abilities, Leora must decide whether to remain in the family business, or explore these amazing abilities, and, a potential link to her mother. Deciding to embrace the adventure, Leora learns that there is a lot more in the world outside her home than she thought. With new allies, challenges, experiences, and problems she never knew even existed, Leora must accept the person she was meant to become or lose everything that ever meant anything to her.",
