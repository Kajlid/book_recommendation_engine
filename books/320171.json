  "title": "EDucation: Lessons to Manage Erectile Dysfunction",
  "description": "No man likes to see a doctor at the best of times, but when the diagnosis is erectile dysfunction, it can feel like a life sentence.There was a time not so long ago when talking about erectile dysfunction was taboo and rarely talked about in public. That began to change in the late '90s, when advertisements for Viagra began to air on TV. Today, the erectile dysfunction business is a multi-billion-dollar industry with great promises and limited advice.The authors of EDucation are a real-life couple who had to deal with erectile dysfunction early on in their relationship. They found a few books on erectile dysfunction, but they were very clinical in nature, so they wrote their own book filled with practical advice, like whisky dick is real and having a few before the lights go out is a bad idea.EDucation is a light-hearted, helpful and fun view of erectile dysfunction for men and their partners! it's all in your head!",
