I don’t have any enemies.”“Then you’d best rethink your friends.”Realtor Carla Radling shows an “English gentleman” a lakeside estate—and finds herself facing a gun. Who has hired this assassin to kill her, and why?Forced on the run, Carla must uncover the scathing secrets of her past. Secrets that could destroy some very powerful people. Perhaps even change the face of a nation …Crimson Eve is book three in the Kanner Lake Series.
