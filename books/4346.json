  "description": "The normally peaceful Gloucestershire village of Marsdean finds itself host to a murder scene. Lorraine Chant, wife of a wealthy businessman is found strangled in her home. On first inspection, the police suspect that she disturbed a burglar in her home and the thief panicked. But curiously, it seems that he knew about the two hidden safes at the Chant's house yet nothing was taken. Coincidentally, the Chants' handyman, Terry Holland, a man with a few secrets of his own, finds out that his van has been stolen and abandoned on the same day. Sukey is a police photographer and Scene of Crime Officer, who is helping to investigate the crime scene. Although she doesn't yet realise it, she has already met the murderer of Lorraine Chant. Hugo Bayliss is a man of many identities, dubious background and has a penchant for attractive married women, including Lorraine Chant. When he offers Sukey extra money to do some freelance photography, Sukey unwittingly becomes involved on the other side of crime.",
