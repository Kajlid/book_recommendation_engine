  "description": "“The epic science fiction novel 17 The Captain by A. R. Alexander incorporates dystopian politics, intergalactic adventure, military action, and a medley of other literary elements to create a futuristic saga with extraordinary depth. A revolutionary new technology, the Ajna, offers humanity something it has sought for freedom from ill health and disease. However, one of the ruling factions has found a way to use this technological panacea to subjugate humankind. Captain Elizabeth Lee, a strong, intelligent, and enigmatic woman, takes on a pivotal role in stopping this threat to freedom within the universe. But with seventeen planets, four competing political powers, and innumerable people with a wide array of differing motivations to navigate, even a woman as dangerous and calculating as Lee will have her hands full to take on the Kappa Corporation and their plans for universal domination.”David Korson for Readers’ Favorite",
