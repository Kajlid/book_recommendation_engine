And for the first time, he couldn’t convince himself to walk away, to mind his own business.Even after she was getting the care she needed, he couldn’t seem to make himself stay away. But keeping her close meant he would eventually have to let her in, would have to offer over the horrors of his past, and hope she could accept them.But even if she would embrace his past, could she accept his plan to exact brutal, bloody vengeance against the man who hurt her?",
