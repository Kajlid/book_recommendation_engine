  "description": "Our Sunshine is the tale of a man whose story outgrew his life, Robert Drewe's strikingly imaginative recreation of the inner life of Ned Kelly, the National Hero and Devil Incarnate of the Antipodes. Written with brilliant clarity and impressionistic economy, it carries the reader into a dreamworld of astonishing and violent revelation, an entrancing and frightening landscape of murder, sexuality, persecution, robbery, vanity, politics, and corruption.",
