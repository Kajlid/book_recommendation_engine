It isn't long before a darkness descends on Maigret and the town, as the prediction becomes a brutal reality and the Inspector discovers he is not welcome in the place he once called home.As much a thriller as a meditation on alienation, The Saint-Faicre Affair displays Simenon's unique and searing perspective of the struggles we all are forced to endure.",
