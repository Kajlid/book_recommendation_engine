  "description": "The world of vampires is mysterious and sexual in ways that most humans can never fully understand. Enter where vampires tread among the living - working, loving, laughing. In The Book of Jacob, follow Jacob Baumâ€™s path of discovery as he fully learns of his abilities, becoming the vampire he was sired to be, and unearthing the answers to his questions. Also see what becomes of Tarick von Dred, aka William Smythe as both experience new life and perceptions as The Other, unbound by the limitations of death, morality, and even sanity.",
