  "description": "The whole idea of the book is to make people to be reflective and receptive towards every situations of life. When we are in receptive mode then we hear a song from heart which no one else can hear. When we heed more and more to that inner rhyme then mind becomes sharp, intellectual, transcending, jovial and calm. This makes life progressive. Only when mind progresses towards Truth then only it becomes positive. It is so because everything else falls apart as only truth triumphs in the time flow. That which makes the mind remain free is the positive state and that which makes the mind to cling on things that bounds are negative. All the good things are possible only when mind feels inspired. Inspired mind becomes reflexive and receptive. Thus pray for getting inspired.Highlights31 Chapters Highlights Positive AttitudeMindful Matters Towards The Middle PathSufi Wisdom In Quotes And StoriesVegetarianism And SpiritualityWay To Become VeggieInsight About Real BelieversDifference Between Religious & BelieversDifference Between Debates And DiscussionsMarriages, Love, Divorces In RelationshipsWays To Reduce StressDoes Cries Helps Or Not?Fundamentalism & SecularismMaterialist & SpiritualistSpiritualism V/S MaterialismHighest Charity Among CharitiesRamadan FastingTalk on TerrorismReal Reader.",
