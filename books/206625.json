  "description": "The world as you know it, is gone. There is a war waging on, greater than any war ever predicted by the human race. They all believed that the end would come by human hands, by bombings, radiation, disease, or through the stripping of all Earth’s natural recourses. But that is not how it happened. It was not by the human hand that the world was destroyed, at least not entirely. Now humans are hunted. Both demons and seraphs have established their territories where they live here on earth and both have evolved to use humans as their errand dogs. They catch us, trap us, train us, and eventually we die in some horrific way. This is what is left of us.As for me, well my father was human and my mother one of them, an Angel. I am what they call a halfling, or Nephilim, and I try to survive in this god forsaken place. This is my world now, or what’s left of it.",
