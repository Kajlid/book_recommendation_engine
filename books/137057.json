  "title": "Alethea",
  "description": "This book takes place post-civil war, during the reign of King Charles II, after regaining the throne. The main characters are still part of the Heron family, and though this book is more a romance, there are many actual events portrayed within. The London fire of 1666 is frightfully detailed, giving the readers the sights, sounds, and horrors of that catastrophic event. Another wonderful thread in the book, John Wilmot, second Earl of Rochester , renowned satirical poet and rake of the time, is woven into the story line as Alathea's lover. This is a great book, especially with Alathea making her way in a \"man's world\" as a portrait artist.",
