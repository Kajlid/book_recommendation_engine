  "description": "You can't live to fight another day unless you survive the night. Forty-four years have passed since the Restored United States emerged from the crucible of revolution re-dedicated to the ideals of equality and opportunity, but some things never change. The needy still struggle, the rich still rule, and the oppressed still fall prey to violence. Physical therapist Naomi Kwan overcame poverty and prejudice to put her Subsistence upbringing behind her, but no matter how hard she works or how properly she behaves, the stigma remains. When a chunk of San Francisco's poorest neighborhood goes up in flames in a terrorist attack, her past makes her an easy target for corrupt authorities eager to make an arrest.Devastated by the loss of home and family, Naomi has no money, no resources and nowhere to hide. Loyalty may be her biggest liability. She knows her friend and fellow fugitive Serena Nguyen is no terrorist, but Serena's sanity is questionable, and her temper is deadly. Tracking down the faceless enemies who want them blamed for the tragedy is their only hope for redemption, but the situation gets murkier with every passing hour, and the casualty count rises. They can't hope to succeed on their own. Fortunately they won't be alone for long. The plan is simple: first, get away. Then fight back.",
