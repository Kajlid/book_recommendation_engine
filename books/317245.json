  "description": "My new roommate has the worst taste in men. I mean, Murph’s special. He’s funny and flamboyant and full of life.While I’m straight, even I can tell these guys aren’t good enough for him.I had to yell at one date, toss another one out the door, and throw a beer in another’s face.Kind of embarrassing, really. I don’t know what’s gotten into me.I ask my sister what’s wrong with me and she says I’m jealous.Jealous? Please. Me?Come on.Only thing is, I hate the thought of Murph kissing any guy. Ever.Except, maybe ... me?Undone is a contemporary m/m romance about a dreamy insurance agent that might not be as straight as he thinks, an adorable bartender who adds sparkle wherever he goes, and maybe one or two jokes about swords.",
