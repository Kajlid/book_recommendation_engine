  "description": "Magic, demons, and a brooding wielder—what could possibly go wrong?I thought I had my life figured out—until I bonded Rixon, the Citadel’s most skilled wielder. Our first assignment should have been simple: travel across the dangerous lands of Raeria, face some demons, protect its citizens in need. But no, of course, it's never that easy.Turns out, Rixon’s past is a lot more complicated than I expected, and his icy attitude toward me is impossible to ignore. He’s been avoiding me for two years, and I’m starting to think it’s not just because he’s too busy brooding.I promised myself I wouldn’t let my heart get involved. I know the pain of losing someone you love, and I won’t risk it again. But the closer we get to the heart of our mission—and the more my heart betrays me—the harder it becomes to deny what’s between us. Maybe, just maybe, Rixon is exactly what I’ve been missing all along. But I’m not sure if I can trust that… or him.Wielder’s Prize is the first novel in the Lady Witch series, which is chock-full of sizzling tension, complex characters, and plenty of demon-slaying action. It is a tale of magic, trust, and discovering what it truly means to be bonded.Warning: This series contains explicit sexual content suitable for audiences 18+, adult language, and some demon-slaying violence.",
