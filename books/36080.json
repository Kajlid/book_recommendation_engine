  "title": "Caught in the Slipstream of Time",
  "description": "Someone has opened the Slipstream, causing time to repeat a single day over and over again. As the mysterious events of the day begin to unfold, PARRY PRETTY discovers the heart-stopping reason why only she can close the Slipstream. The only problem is the stubborn girl refuses to believe that the Slipstream even exists. Her logical brain ignores the fact that she continues to relive the same day over and over again, even though she has experienced déjà vu several times. Her scientific mind can’t be convinced that she continues to wake up in different realms, and her practical nature certainly won’t accept the fact that there is more than one realm in the world (eight to be exact). But all that is about to change when Parry finds herself chasing after a mysterious stranger through windows that lead to new and wondrous lands, where she discovers a greater and darker secret that could alter her destiny, and the fate of all the realms, forever.",
