  "description": "She will let nothing stop her...Juliet Bell has a hit man, the FBI, a long-lost sister, and a handful of handsome Highlanders hunting her through time. But she's not going back until she gets what's hers. And her hunters won't go back either--not without Juliet.He's had a change of heart...Quinn's timing stinks. He's about to die a martyr, which would have been fine with him a year before, but 15th century Scotland has revived his survival instincts and he's decided he wants to live after all. His only hope? Making one of his foes believe Quinn can control the future.An enemy they never saw coming...Juliet and Quinn are thrown together, whether by the hands of Fate or a pair of clever witches, and they find love lends a much nobler purpose to their impossible quests. But they'll have to maneuver around a centuries-old curse and a villain with a higher purpose of his own--or everything they want will be out of their hands forever.",
