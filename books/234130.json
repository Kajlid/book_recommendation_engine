  "description": "Jim Brown had only been a teacher for 4 years, and this was the first graduating class he had from start to finish of their high school career. With few exceptions, Jim was a great teacher who had the respect of all the students and his colleagues. He was the kind of teacher you wanted your kids to have, knowledgeable and passionate about teaching. Jim couldn’t wait until she graduated! She was the only student he had ever been attracted to and he couldn’t help but count the days until the temptation was out of his life and he could focus! He looked at the clock on the wall, in 3 hours it would only be 22 days until he would never see her again, free to focus on finding a nice wife and living a normal life. A teacher with an unhealthy obsession for his 18-year-old student, Allison Marshall finds, himself magically swapped into her body. Overwhelmed by the hormones of her new gender, Jim finds out exactly what it was he had wanted to do to this body.",
