  "description": "John Kaiser has problems.As if falling through a stage floor three days before Christmas wasn’t bad enough; his heart stopped on the emergency room table as his boyfriend Brian Mallory looked on, unable to help him.Miraculously, he was revived thanks to the efforts of a heroic doctor, but only after he’d been without oxygen for nearly three minutes.Now, he’s suffering from brain damage, and its after-effects have ended his theatrical career.John may be able to return to the stage after extensive physical therapy, but only if he can tolerate the exercises and his therapist—and right now, he hates both.He also can’t control his temper or his mood swings, so his relationship with Brian and his friends is being put to the test.When John’s producer tells him that he’s been dumped from his television series, the news devastates him—and Brian’s unsympathetic support sends him into a furious rage. One so dramatic that he decides to attend a New Year’s Eve party on his own—with catastrophic consequences for a large wine tray and a catering server with medical issues of her own.Will his dire situation improve? Will he ever recover?Maybe, if he and Brian are willing to make a drastic change, put their trust in a wise, old friend—and in a few new ones, too.",
