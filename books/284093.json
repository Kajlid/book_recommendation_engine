  "description": "You’ll find this an engrossing story. Live your life all over again but knowing what you know now. Molly Maguire is a charmer. Going to bed 4 October 2020, she awakes, Monday 9 October 1962. Letters to President Kennedy telling him about Dallas, his affairs, and classified secret missiles in Cuba follow. Explaining her letters to her parents and the Secret Service who want to know why a Molly Maguire writes letters to the President predicting his demise, begin her problems. Molly also tells the neighbor, Karl McGill about how they marry in the local Catholic Church.What follows is a pleasant, absorbing stroll down 1960’s Nostalgia Road. Follow Molly as she sometimes wildly, and sometimes wistfully romps down Huckleberry Lane, smelling the aromas, casting her eyes upon the flowers, reciting the rhymes and witticisms of 1960’s youth and climbs that apple tree, again, with Karl. Molly remembers our reality since 1962 as a dream. School no longer a problem, she drags Karl, Dominic Pancetti, the misunderstood child misdiagnosed as school bully and his girlfriend with her into adulthood, kicking a screaming.Read Growing up in Levittown, Again as an Alternate History, a Coming of Age, and a fictionalized auto-biographical novel about the author. I grew up on Huckleberry Lane in Levittown Pennsylvania in the early ‘60s, joined the Navy in the early ‘70s, and went to Kent State University in the early ‘80s. I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and studied Counseling at the graduate level.",
