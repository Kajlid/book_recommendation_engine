  "title": "Rescuing Ranu",
  "description": "After a power struggle at her university, math professor Nela Sambashivan returns to her native India to think. She is drawn, instead, into the lives of ten year old Ranu, the cunning motel-keeper who exploits her, and an unscrupulous Uncle who believes that everything is for sale. Nela's transformation from abstract thinker to selfless guardian begins when she and her lover rescue Ranu from a forced marriage. She takes the child back home, without Jackson, who plans to follow them after he finishes his work in the backward village. Nela picks up her old life and builds her spectacular career despite sabotage from a relative, but it is only when Jackson is captured by the same community he tried to help that Nela must confront her miscalculations about sacrifice, survival, and the mysterious alchemy of love.",
