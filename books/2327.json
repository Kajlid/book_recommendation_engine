  "description": "The Omega Exchange: The Lodge #2Anastasia Androff came to The Omega Exchange with an agenda. It wasn't her plan, but she found herself a pawn in the games of powerful men.It's going to take someone like Viktor Nikolov, an alpha Daddy Dom with a penchant for spanking and solving dangerous problems to flip the chessboard.But when the threats coming for Anastasia are more than even Vik can tackle on his own, he knows he needs help: his pack of slightly deranged alphas that aren't afraid of doing what needs to be done.When the last moves play out, will this hasty collision of a pack be enough to keep Anastasia safe?Especially when the haze of rut hits . . .* * *This is the second book in The Omega Exchange series. It can be read as a standalone, but you'll get more enjoyment reading them in order as familiar characters pop up in the newer books. This entire series is low stress/low angst. Each story has no cheating, no choosing, and a full content info is listed in the author's note.",
