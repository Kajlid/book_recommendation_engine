  "description": "Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, published in 1960, is one of the most popular and acclaimed novels to appear in 20th century America. The book's appeal to readers both young and old shows no signs of diminishing in the new millennium. The 1962 film version, an enduring, much-loved classic, ranks 25th of the American Film Institute's Greatest American Movies list. And yet, neither Lee's novel nor the film version has attracted much critical discussion.This book, by a leading literary and film scholar, shines light on the complex and fascinating adaptation process that brought Lee's work to the commercial screen. R. Barton Palmer deftly places Mockingbird within both its fictional setting — a 1930s Southern town marked deeply by racial injustice — and the postwar Civil Rights era that saw the novel and film emerge to such popularity. Palmer demonstrates, with learning and subtlety, how the indirect indictment of the insupportable evil of Jim Crow in both novel and film has proven spectacularly successful in changing hearts and minds for nearly half a century.",
