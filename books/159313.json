  "description": "In Belfast, Northern Ireland, 20-year-old Katheryne dreams. Her dreams are killing her. Each night she sleeps, the beast comes closer to taking over and crossing into her world. On Sanctuary, a world at the heart of the Never, the Liberi warrior, Derren, searches desperately for the face from his dreams. His soul cries out for her. She is the saviour, and only he can find her. At the edge of the universe a dormant evil awakens. His slumber is over as the Veil that hides his source of power slowly collapses, allowing magic to trickle back into his malevolent grasp. This is a battle of light against darkness. If darkness wins, we can only hope we die. The alternative is too terrible to imagine.",
