  "description": "Reading Ypil is meeting oneself in memory, that of the poet’s and one’s own, and in that encounter, affirm everything that one had gone through—pain, fear, lust, love, the interminable secrets that are always converging and fading, and converging in every moment of one’s ordinary day, and even in one’s dreams. And we find our own hiding place.—Merlie Alunan. Finalist, Gintong Aklat Awards 2010, for English Literature. Winner, 2011 Madrigal-Gonzalez, for First Book Award.",
