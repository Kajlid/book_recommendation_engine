But despite 14B's astonishingly low rental price, the recent tragedy within its walls has frightened away all potential tenants... except for Audrey Lucas.No stranger to tragedy at thirty-two—a survivor of a fatherless childhood and a mother's hopeless dementia— Audrey is obsessively determined to make her own way in a city that often strangles the weak.

A door it would be true madness to open...",
