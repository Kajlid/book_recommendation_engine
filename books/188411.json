  "description": "“How big are these Cisterns?” I asked Theodor. “Miles and miles across most of ancient Alexandria. There are an incredible number of tunnels and dwellings, many still to explore. Some Egyptian believe Alexander the Great lays buried down there.” “Ok, that sounds interesting!” Katarina said. “Alexandria once was a city of the World; superior to Rome or Jerusalem. Alexandria’s library, the most complete ever built was the center of worldwide data with thousands of manuscripts from all over the Globe. Huge in size and greater with Knowledge. Sadly set on fire during the Roman invasion, some say by mistake. Nevertheless, most of the precious literature turned to ashes and the remaining scrolls divided throughout the several empires of Earth.Some of them are in the Vatican archive… that you should know Theodor!” A lingering smile played on her eyes. She was beautiful. “You are correct, dear Katarina. I have studied some of it. Primordial Greek philosophical works, several African texts by unknown authors, even Chinese scrolls dating from 2600 BC during the Yellow Emperor ruling period.Many more are still to open. Often I think about all that invaluable information and beautiful tales of the past that no matter with short or long years I may live, I’ll never read.” “You know Theodor!? There are additional things in live besides reading.” “Everyone with its own pleasures, Peter.” We all laughed, it was a good idea keeping up moral high before our swift incursion into Egypt. We discussed a few other details and mentally warmed up for the mission. As we arrived at Alexandria’s Borg El Arab airport.",
