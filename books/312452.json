  "description": "The Swastika Invades the Old WestHerr Kurt Von Dreber, ex-Prussian officer, came to Wyoming with his imperious and beautiful fianc√©e, Countess Hannau, and a lot of Nietzschean notions about founding a race of supermen.As Charlie O'Leary told Mulvane, \"The Dutchman figures he owns the whole world. He sits in that damned stone pile looking down on the poor people like he was some god. He figures there's too many two-bit ranchers in this territory and they're getting in his way. Way I look at it, he figures taking over the whole state of Wyoming before he's through, and running ten million cattle on it.\"But Von Dreber figured without Mulvane.When Von Dreber burned out the ranches of a couple of Mulvane's friends and ran off their cattle, Mulvane got angry. And when angry, Mulvane was a deadly dangerous gun!",
