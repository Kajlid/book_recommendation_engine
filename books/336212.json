  "description": "OSKARAfter a little mishap in an alleyway with CCTV, my public image needs fixing. Oops?It might have been a stunt to get the attention of Lane Pierce, San Jose’s new PR manager, but I didn’t realize what the consequences would be when I did it. I’ve got Lane’s sole focus now in all the wrong ways.He has designated himself as my babysitter, and while it’s fun messing with him, being bound by curfews and rules has never worked for me.The more I push back, the more I realize what’s really on the line. My career, my future, and maybe even my heart.LANEBeing appointed head of San Jose’s PR department was a dream come true … until I met Oskar Voyjik.He may be San Jose royalty, but with the stunts Oskar’s been pulling, the team owner is down to his last thread of patience. Which puts me in the firing line. If I can’t turn Oskar’s entitled party boy image around, we’ll both be shown the door.I have free rein to do whatever it takes, and it turns out whatever it takes is Oskar.Only, the more entangled our lives become, the more I see the Oskar he’s buried deep down. The one who hurts, the one who’s sensitive and kind, the one … the one I think I’m falling for.I can’t have him and my career, and if rumors of the professional lines I’ve crossed get out, it’s not only my dream job I can kiss goodbye; I’ll be disgraced from professional sports completely.",
