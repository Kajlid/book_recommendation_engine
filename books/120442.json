  "description": "Losing your grip on reality is a real bummer.Just ask Leon Blank. Not that he'd know. Seems those losing their marbles are always the last to find out.Until recently, Leon would have argued that a tendency to become easily sidetracked on a regular basis wasn't that odd. And what's so unusual about hearing a voice inside your head? Doesn't everyone? Isn't that just thinking? But his recent visions aren't so freely dismissed; especially the angry- looking clown who's following him around with a baseball bat.Time to act, Leon decides: perhaps keeping a log will shed light on the mystery. Then again, could 'seeing-things' just be sexual frustration? It's been a while! If only he had a girlfriend to take his mind off stuff.Prepare to enter the normally hidden world of delusions,  paranoia, and ... ahem ... 'unusual interests':  Voyeurism; Feederism; Shoes - that kind of thing.'Thanks a lot, Adrian! This seriously messed with my head.' - My sister'Absurd, zany, funny, dark, outrageous, perverse, melon-twisting,  unpredictable. That enough? Nice one. Can I 'ave me fiver now, mate?' - A homeless Manc'It's like Christopher Moore and Robert Rankin had a love child,  raised it on LSD then made it write a novel.' - Anonymous reviewer (No, really; we wouldn't make that up)'What's your name? My name's Wayne. Do you like a book? I like a book. If I wrote a book, I'd call it: Billy Liar meets Donnie Darko.' - Some nutter on the tram",
