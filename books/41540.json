The marriage and the plantation failed, but Baroness Blixen's passion for Africa remained.Out of Africa (1937) and Shadows on the Grass (1960), presented for the first time in one volume, were written when Karen Blixen returned to her native Denmark and are full of her longing to return to the country and people she came to love and admire. Her writing combines intelligence, compassion and an acute understanding of alien culture.",
