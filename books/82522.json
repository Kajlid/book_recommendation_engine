  "description": "Dead Mothers, Missing Husbands, Disgusting Dates, Perverted “Reverends,” Seductive Gurus, Infamous Ingrates and Cheese Thieves. These are a few of the cast of characters that pepper Valerie Gilbert’s true tales in “Raving Violet.” Enter the world of a solitary but intrepid New Yorker. Orphaned since (relative) youth, this divorced, smartass metaphysician has sought solace and insight from philosophers, séances, channels and mediums, a path that has, inevitably, led her back to her formidable fortress within. Join Valerie as she scales the castle walls on her journey for love, sex, sass, a chuckle, and really good chocolate. Love and Loss! Love and Glory! Love and Nausea! “Raving Violet” has it all.“Valerie lives and breathes New York City. She’s Ms. New York, and my virtual sister. Damn, I’m so proud of her! You will treasure this book, re-read it repeatedly, and tell your friends to buy it. Yeah. She’s THAT good!” Bridgett Walther, author, \"Conquer the Cosmos\"",
