  "title": "Before we were immigrants: So long, Yugoslavia",
  "description": "London for immigrant suckers; So long Yugoslavia offers a unique opportunity to hang around with Peter Kovach and witness the last days of Yugoslavia. The package also includes visiting a strip joint on the way to London and exploring all the exciting opportunities that the Capital City offers. Along the way, you'll be challenged by all sorts of situations, regretfully exposed to second-hand smoke, and possibly offended by some of Peter’s views and actions, but hey, it is what it is. There will be just enough time to analyze many aspects of human existence, our choices, and mysterious and unexpected turns of life. By the end of this journey, you might learn something new…or maybe not. Either way, you'll be entertained.",
