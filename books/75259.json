  "description": "\"Our Truth!\" reveals the controversial events that led up to the probation of Yazoo City High School in 1980. The book documents these events from the point of view of the Yazoo City High School girls' basketball team, their coach, and the fans attending the 1980 North Sub-District 6 AA tournament in Pearl, Mississippi. The book initially takes the reader on a short historical journey into the world of Jim Crow. It then ties the events surrounding the basketball games and the high school probation to a historical pattern of racism that has long existed in the sport of basketball as well as in the lives of blacks living in the state of Mississippi. The reader is left with a brazen version of the truth that is both authentic and shocking.",
