  "description": "Ex CIA agent Evan Hernandez knows the odds of seeing a kidnaping victim again and alive, no less, is about zero. When a family friend is kidnapped in Juarez and his brother asks him to be his alibi so he can travel to pay the ransom, Evan proposes to go in his place. After all, he has nothing to lose. Perhaps through his own sacrifice he will finally find redemption. In Mexico, Evan stumbles quite literally into a conflict between an ambitious cartel leader with a desire to reshape Mexico and a government sponsored mercenary outfit run by an ex-CIA agent from Evan’s past. Dark Cloud’s mission is to create a vacuum, destroy the Eastern Cartel and control the remaining crime syndicates. Evan finds himself immersed once again into a life he knows too well, the same life of deceit and danger that cost him his family decades earlier in Columbia. Silver Lead and Dead takes you on a journey into the terrifying world of the narco. Mexico is collapsing. The leader of Dark Cloud uses two ghosts from Evan’s past to recruit him, a mission involving a submarine sale, and the man who killed his family.",
