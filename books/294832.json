  "description": "Rafael is about to betray his oldest friends.  Traveling to the Cove under the guise of friendship, Rafe is there for one reason and one reason only— to steal a siren. Drawn to Skye from the moment their eyes meet, he finds himself torn, but there are no good choices here.  You're supposed to run away from a predator not toward them.  Raised among humans, Skye isn’t a typical siren. He comes to the Cove to see Aden, but he stays because of Rafael. When he feels the wolf’s eyes on him, he knows he’s being hunted. But in Rafe’s gaze, he sees something more.  Stealing Skye is the lesser of two evils.  With his pack at Magnar's mercy, Rafe has no choice but to do the unthinkable. The siren makes it all too easy, leaving Rafe to war with his own feelings, his guilt, and the unearned trust he sees in Skye’s eyes.  “You always have a choice.”  Skye should have known better than to put his curiosity above his own safety, especially when it comes to Rafe. But with their very existence at stake, Rafe is their best chance of survival. The alpha is deeply troubled, and Skye wants — he needs — to help. Even if it means throwing himself headlong into the path of danger and into Rafael’s arms.  Caught is the final book of the Siren Cove series. It's a novel-length read, featuring a traitorous wolf (or is he?), a siren with zero sense of self-preservation, an evil Alpha Prime and his equally evil brother, mpreg, some difficult themes, and scenes not suitable for readers under the age of eighteen.",
