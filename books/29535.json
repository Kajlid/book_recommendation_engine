Sometimes we can tell the soul bird what to feel. Sometimes it decides all by itself. With delightful drawings and poetic text, this book teaches us to listen to our soul bird and find out more about our true selves. When we hear the message of the soul bird, we understand why we behave the way we do. And once we understand our behavior, we can begin to live a happier, more fulfilling life. First published in Israel, The Soul Bird was an instant bestseller. Over the years its magic has spread around the globe, appealing to readers of all ages.",
