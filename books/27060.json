  "description": "Simon Bosford, transplanted English soccer star, has the world by the balls. He just signed a multi-million dollar contract with the L.A. Waves, the worst team in Major League Soccer. Simon's more interested in raising his celebrity profile than scoring goals, but his plans take a detour when he tangles with Jessica Jones, the world's most disorganized personal assistant. Jessica has her own plans, and none of them involve launching a puffed-up male Adonis of an athlete on the L.A. celebrity circuit. Jessica, the rebellious daughter of the wealthy, controlling Bretts, who happen to own a few football teams, yearns to make it on her own. The first step on this journey of independence is her new job with Chase Sports Management (CSM) as a travel agent. Evan Chase, her boss and Simon’s agent, gives her the plum position as Simon’s personal assistant after just four months on the job. The assignment comes with one keep Simon “The Boss” Bosford out of trouble and under wraps until his practices with the Waves start. Easier said than done. As the games between Simon and Jessica kick into high gear, they land off-side, out of bounds, and in love.",
