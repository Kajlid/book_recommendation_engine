  "description": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewStark's Crusade is the concluding volume of a popular military science fiction trilogy written by former U.S. Navy officer John G. Hemry. The first two books, Stark's War and Stark's Command, began chronicling the life of Sergeant Ethan Stark, a living military legend who is sent to the moon to take back control of what America believes is its property. (After the Cold War, America became the last superpower and dominated the world economically. Other nations, and corporations, were forced to begin colonies and manufacturing plants in space.) In the ensuing war, Stark realizes the war has nothing to do with peace or justice, but with greed and television ratings. Stark's Crusade ends this epic adventure. Stark, now the acting commander of the rebel American military forces on the moon, must deal with the United Nations declaring him an outlaw while also taking on the entire American military and his own mutinous forces. (Paul Goat Allen)",
