  "description": "In The Novels of Philip K. Dick , Kim Stanley Robinson says that \" In Milton Lumky Territory . . . is probably the best of Dick's realist novels aside from Confessions of a Crap Artist ,\" and calls it a \"bitter indictment of the effects of capitalism.\" Dick, on the other hand, in his forward, says \"This is actually a very funny book, and a good one, too.\" Milton Lumky territory is both an area of the western USA and a psychic the world and world-view of the traveling salesman. The story takes place in Boise, Idaho, with some extraordinary long-distance driving sequences in which our hero (young Bruce Stevens) drives from Boise to San Francisco, to Reno, to Pocatello, to Seattle, and back to Boise in search of a good deal on some wholesale typewriters. He falls under the spell of an attractive older woman, and of Milton Lumky, a middle-aged paper salesman whose territory is the Northwest. And then Bruce and the others slowly sink into the whirlpool of Bruce's immature personal obsessions and misperceptions. A compassionate and ironic portrayal of three characters enmeshed in a sticky web of everyday events, who have a basic failure to communicate, In Milton Lumky Territory stands out among Dick's early works.",
