  "title": "How to Eat a Book",
  "description": "“Sheila sat down to eat her first book and the strangest thing happened…The book ate HER.”   One by one, Sheila, Gerald, and Geraldine are eaten . . . by their books. This peculiar turn of events flings them far and wide. Sheila escapes the weight of the world entirely, while Gerald braves the wonder of seeing it up close. And Geraldine, well, Geraldine turns as terrifically terrible as she possibly can.   Mrs. & Mr. MacLeod craft a whimsical, modern celebration of books—with hints of Shel Silverstein and a splattering of Edward Gorey. Each page is fantastically illustrated with dipped pen-and-ink cutout art, photographed in a three-dimensional stage diorama, and digitally colored. The result is an irresistible world bursting with charm and character.",
