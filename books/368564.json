  "title": "Al Jaffee's Mad Life: A Biography",
  "description": "Since 1955, when his work began enlivening the pages of \"MAD\" magazine, Al Jaffee has pickled three generations of American kids in the brine of satire--and he continues to bring millions of childhoods to untimely ends with the knowledge that parents are hypocrites, teachers are dummies, politicians are liars, and life isn't fair. Jaffee has a life story that is truly bizarre, that reads like a comic strip of traumatic cliff-hangers with cartoons by Jaffee and captions by Freud--from his traumatic childhood as a reverse immigrant to finding his adult place at the forefront of a movement that would forever change the face of humor and cartooning in America.  A cliff-hanger of a life deserves a page-turner of a biography, and that's precisely what Mary-Lou Weisman and Al Jaffee have delivered.",
