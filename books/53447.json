  "title": "The Roosevelt Myth",
  "description": "The routine judgment of American historians, that Roosevelt was a truly \"great president,\" has nothing objective about it. Like other academics they tend to be overwhelmingly on the left. \"Left-liberal historians worship political power, and idolize those who wield it most lavishly in the service of left-liberal causes.\" (Higgs) Why should it be surprising that they venerate Roosevelt and try to get a credulous public to do the same? For a rather different view, the reader can now turn to The Roosevelt Myth, which was and, after half a century, remains the major debunking of Franklin Roosevelt.",
