  "description": "'You have much sorrow and trouble ahead of you.' Princess Rina V of Occorom has been promised in marriage to Prince Hangree of Airegla. But she doesn't want to marry him; he's vain, selfish, and greedy- not at all princely. She's sure if she marries him, all will end in disaster. Forced to take desperate measures to avoid the marriage, she writes her parents, King Bertram and Queen Hope, to tell them she won't marry Prince Hangree. She runs away, hoping to find refuge in the mountains with the dragons. There, she meets the dragon Roozan, and they immediately connect. When Rina's kidnapped by ogres and Roozan tries and fails to save her, the elves of the forest come to their rescue. One of the elves, who is more than she seems, warns Rina of trouble to come. Rina soon discovers her past is not what she thought it was, and her future is in jeopardy. Rina is caught up in a nightmare, and only speed and friendship will save her from a terrible fate. As time catches up with her, she must decide which path to follow and what part of her she can bear to lose. Find out what Rina decides in Dragon's Heart.",
