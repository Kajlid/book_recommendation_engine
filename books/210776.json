  "description": "It was while she was ill and in bed for several weeks that Marianne found the pencil. It looked quite ordinary, but it wasn't. The things she drew with it - a house, a landscape, the face watching at the window - came alive in her dreams. Sometimes what she drew was good and friendly; sometimes bad and frightening. Once, without quite meaning to, she put herself and the boy in her dreams into a very real danger, from which the only possible escape needed more courage than Marianne thought she could possibly find ... The story has been adapted for the major feature film Paperhouse starring Charlotte Burke as Anna (Marianne), Elliot Spears and Ben Cross.",
