If he gets reelected, he gets a million dollars and we get screwed.\" Michael \"He still hasn't molested as many boys as the Catholic Church.\" \"It's nobody's business to tell another woman what to do with her body. Let's leave that up to Joan and Melissa Rivers.\"Imbued with her razor-sharp voice, sidesplitting candor, and her trademark brand of comedy, the essays in Yeah, I Said It showcase Wanda at her uproarious, uncensored best.",
