So, when Maver moves in with his brother, Kara isn't prepared for the trouble he starts to cause. With a complicated home life, a complaint worthy school atmosphere and Logan's added perviness Kara has her hands full. But the trouble Logan presents is just the beginning and Kara soon realizes that life's not everything she thought it was and maybe with some misguided help she'll find herself. Or maybe she'll just find even more trouble.",
