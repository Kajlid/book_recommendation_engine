I am trapped in a nightmare marriage of fear and abuse and cannot escape my tyrant husband. Charles Swartz was abusive and demanding. He ruled my life with a leather strap and harsh words. The physical and mental abuse I suffered at his hands made me hate and fear him. Death would be the only thing that could release me from our marriage. I've met a man named John Westerling. He is not what I've learned to expect from men. He is caring, thoughtful, encouraging, and dotes on his only daughter. He treats me as his equal and his encouragement builds me up. His displays of patience and love to everyone around draws my heart to him. Can the love we are finding together stand against a woman from his past who threatens to tear us apart and destroy all that we are working to achieve? Will I be able to trust again after being married to a tyrant?",
