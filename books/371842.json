  "description": "The award-winning author of Babes in the Woods and The Rottweiler brings us another gripping Inspector Wexford novel.A lump of concrete dropped deliberately from a little stone bridge over a relatively unfrequented road kills the wrong person. The driver behind is spared. But only for a while...One particular member of the local press is gunning for the Chief Inspector, distinctly unimpressed with what he regards as old-fashioned police methods. But Wexford, with his old friend and partner, Mike Burden, along with two new recruits to the Kingsmarkham team, pursue their inquiries with a diligence and humanity that make Ruth Rendellâ€™s detective stories enthralling, exciting and very touching.From the Hardcover edition.",
