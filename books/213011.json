But her temper isn't the only thing Cassian ignites. And when they are forced to train in battle together, sparks become flame.As the threat of war casts its shadow over them once again, Nesta and Cassian must fight monsters from within and without if they are to stand a chance of halting the enemies of their court. But the ultimate risk will be searching for acceptance – and healing – in each other's arms.",
