  "description": "When Broken meets Beautiful. Melody Spencer has a plan: work hard, stay focused and save enough money to get out of Stone Cliff and the rumors that surround her. Wounded and distrustful, she’s learned the hard way that if a guy is nice to her, it means he’s only after one thing. Until Ryeland Montgomery cruises back into her resort town, beautifully protective as he insists they get to know each other better. Ryeland’s future is in the palm of his hands. Problem is it’s the future his hard-nosed father has chosen for him, not the one he wants. Warned by his folks to steer clear of the local girls who will do whatever it takes to escape the sleepy mountain town, he’s always played the good son and kept his distance. Until he sees Melody, sweet yet tough, standing on the road side, drenched and furious—a girl he knows he has to have. Soon this unlikely pair find themselves lost in each other, and after a whirlwind summer of passion and pleasure, he vows to protect her from everything and everyone. But when secrets unfold, Melody is forced to make the toughest decision of her life and Ryeland must determine whether he's wasted the summer on nothing more than a beautiful lie, or if they can move past the deceit and rebuild the wreckage that has become their lives.",
