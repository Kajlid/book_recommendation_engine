What she did not expect was to be threatened with a spanking before her flight even landed.The moment Norah calls him daddy during a tipsy attempt at flirting, Mazi Tucker knows she is in desperate need of a firm hand applied to her cute backside. Before Mazi can take the beautiful, headstrong reporter in hand properly, however, she will have to be told the truth about him.Though she is quite surprised to discover that Mazi is the only heir of the island's king, the real shock comes when the stern, sexy prince takes off his belt, bares Norah's bottom, and teaches her what happens to naughty little girls who push daddy too far with their pouting and defiance.Over the coming days, Norah's lust for her royal daddy grows into love, but when the time comes for him to marry will Mazi be forced by tradition to claim a wife from his own country?Publisher's Note: Her Royal Daddy includes spankings and sexual scenes.
