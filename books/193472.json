  "description": "Natasha's new abilities lead her to find a strange man bleeding to death in an alley. She is more of a hands on person and she isn't sure how she is going to handle going undercover in the academic world of the stranger she has rescued. She wonders if she will be able to protect her heart as easily as it will be to protect his life. Left to die by an unknown enemy, Warren would have died except for the help of a beautiful woman. He is far away from the academic world he is used to. Without his memories, he will need all the help he can get. To face not only his past, but the enemy hidden there. They are two worlds apart. Will they ever be able to meet in the middle?",
