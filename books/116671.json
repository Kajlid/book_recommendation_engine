  "description": "The Booker Prize-winning author of Possession breathes life into the Ragnorak myth through the novel of a young British girl during World War II.Ragnarok retells the finale of Norse a story of the destruction of life on this planet and the end of the gods themselves. What more relevant myth could any modern writer choose? As the bombs of the Blitz rain down on Britain, one young girl is evacuated to the countryside. She is struggling to make sense of her new wartime life. Then she is given a copy of Asgard and the Gods--a book of ancient Norse myths--and her inner and outer worlds are transformed. War, natural disaster, reckless gods and the recognition of impermanence in the world are just some of the threads that A.S. Byatt weaves into this most timely of books. Linguistically stunning and imaginatively abundant, this is a landmark. A Globe and Mail Best Book \"A gorgeous, brilliant, and significant performance.\" --Booklist, starred review \"Byatt's prose is majestic, the lush descriptive passages--jewelled one minute, gory the next--a pleasure to get lost in.\" --The Telegraph",
