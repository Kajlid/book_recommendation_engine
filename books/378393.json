  "description": "Ever since her brand-new husband flew the coop, Magdalena Yoder, owner of the quaint PennDutch Inn, has had time to kill. And now the local Amish community really has a murder in its midst: an Asian tourist found strangled and run over by a horse and buggy. It isn't a crime police chief Melvin Stolzfus can easily handle; after all, he was once kicked in the head by a bull he was trying to milk. But he's smart enough to deputize Magdalena.",
