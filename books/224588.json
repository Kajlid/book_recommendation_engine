  "title": "My Lonely Room",
  "description": "Life wasn't so great when you didn't have much of a relationship with your parents or the ability to play street games while growing up in the fifties. You would rather be secluded in your lonely room, using your imagination to write stories and draw comic books than to be drowned in negativity by your mother or humiliated by your peers. All of this can change for Jimmy Yadenik when he meets Johnny, his soon to be mentor and member of the Vandals, a street gang, and he applies for membership. But the transition won't be easy.",
