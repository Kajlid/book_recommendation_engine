  "description": "Exceptionally rare first U.S. PB edition, published 1991 by Bedford Arts. If you're reading this, you know this is the most important photo-book to come out of Japan, let alone one of the most important photo-books of the 20th century. All editions of this book are extremely rare and increasingly valuable in both the private photo-book market as well as at art-book auctions.",
