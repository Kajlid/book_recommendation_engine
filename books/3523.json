  "title": "Broetry Poetry for Dudes",
  "description": "As contemporary poets sing the glories of birds, birch trees, and menstruation, regular guys are left scratching their heads. Who can speak for Everyman? Who will articulate his love for Xbox 360, for Mama Celeste's frozen pizza, for the cinematic oeuvre of Bruce Willis? Enter Broetry--a stunning debut from a dazzling new literary voice. \"Broet Laureate\" Brian McGackin goes where no poet has gone before--to Star Wars conventions, to frat parties, to video game tournaments, and beyond. With poems like \"Ode to That Girl I Dated for, Like, a Month Sophomore Year\" and \"My Friends Who Don't Have Student Loans,\" we follow the Bro from his high school graduation and college experience through a \"quarter-life crisis\" and beyond.",
