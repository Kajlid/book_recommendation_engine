  "description": "When Hannah Fairbanks answers an advertisement for a mail-order-bride, she thinks she’s found the man she’ll spend the rest of her life with. Instead she finds a man who has lied to her about everything. Stranded in Dawson, Hannah unexpectedly meets Owl, a local Lakota Indian and is instantly smitten. His dark, exotic looks and kindness draws Hannah to him. Owl has never been attracted to a white woman before, but when he saves Hannah from falling in the mud, that all changes. One look in her beautiful eyes is all it takes to make a connection with her. An unlikely romance begins amid racial bias and societal conflict. Owl makes a decision that will endanger any future the couple might have. Can they rise above bigotry and heartache to catch the dream of love they desperately desire?
