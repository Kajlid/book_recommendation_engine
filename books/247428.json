  "title": "Abyssinian Nomad: An African woman's journey of love, loss, and adventure from Cape to Cairo",
  "description": "What does it take to know oneself? To fully realize one's life dream? For some it may take a lifetime, and for others, the chance may never come. There are those who dream and have the courage to take the first steps past the threshold of familiarity. Their stories, like mine, are etched on the avenues we dare to traverse. The Cape to Cairo road is where I, a black female soul-searcher, faced my greatest trial in confronting my fear of losing my mother to cancer, trying to keep old love alive, and make my childhood dream come true.",
