  "description": "“A style that is verve itself.” — New York Times“A perfectly grand piece of historical record and synthetic journalism.” — Chicago Daily TribuneFrom Frederick Lewis Allen, former editor-in-chief of Harper’s magazine, comes a classic history of 1920s America, from the end of World War I to the stock market crash and the beginning of The Great Depression. Originally published in 1931, Only Yesterday has an exuberance and proximity to its subject—the Roaring Twenties in all its scandal and glory—that uniquely captures the feel of the era.",
