  "title": "Half a Mind",
  "description": "A medical researcher develops a device that can block neural activity in the cortex, simulating lost cognitive function, and in turn, stimulating the brain’s natural capacity for self-healing. But over time, this neural re-wiring becomes exaggerated, distorted, and then all-consuming. Now, a serial killer, exposed to the brain-altering effects of this device, is using it for his own purposes. When the St. Louis-based company Ruger-Phillips assigns one of their new hires, Dr. Sam Price, to a seemingly straightforward evaluation of this technology, no one expects trouble. The reality soon proves much different. Sam and his inexperienced team are plunged into a world where they will have to use everything they have learned to find the truth in a quagmire of inconsistencies, constantly shifting circumstances, and death. But as they come closer to understanding, they start to wonder – is there really any chance they will be able to convince anyone else of a truth they can hardly believe themselves?This edition is out of print.",
