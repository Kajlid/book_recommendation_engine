A fashion designer at heart, she agrees to design and make a wedding dress for a woman who has managed to gain entry into her private life. What a mistake she realizes that is once she agrees to be a bridesmaid for the woman. All hell breaks loose when she is introduced to Walker Albright. A caring man she can't resist but has to in order not to drag him into her dark tormented life. Walker Albright is Patty's soon-to-be brother-in-law.

On the day of his brother's wedding rehearsal, he is introduced to the woman he's been waiting for all his life. Although a pleasant person, Nicole McLin is somewhat cold and adamant about not letting anyone share her space. Will he be able to break through her walls and show her what she's been missing or go on to face another failed attempt at happiness?",
