For hundred of years, the dragon Shelolth has plotted terrible plans in the darkness. Into this wasteland Jasiah and his friends--Emily the archer, Daniel the rogue, Leland the dog, and Talon Wyvern--must go to recover the Dragonsbane Horn. Moaning ghosts, undead pirates, and their own worst fears pursue their every step. All the while, Shelolth prepares her troops for war.The 8-book Knightscares series features many favorites from the epic fantasy genre. Encounter dragons, witches and wizards, goblins, swords and sorcery, centaurs, griffons, and dwarves. Oh, my! Readers will also meet a host of unique magical monsters and fantastic creatures found nowhere else. If Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Goosebumps were mixed in a cauldron and sprinkled with magic, the result would be the face-paced, kid-friendly Knightscares series.ALSO AVAILABLEKnightscares #1: Cauldron Cooker's NightKnightscares #2: Skull in the BirdcageKnightscares #3: Early Winter's OrbKnightscares #4: Voyage to SilvermightKnightscares #5: Trek Through TanglerootKnightscares #6: Hunt for HollowdeepKnightscares #7: The Ninespire ExperimentKnightscares #8: Aware of the Wolf",
