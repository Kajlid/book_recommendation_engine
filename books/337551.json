  "title": "Kingdom Wealth: The Power to Get It - 2nd Edition",
  "description": "The book is a \"how-to\" manual in procuring wealth, strictly on biblical tenets-an expose on Deuteronomy 8:18 and related biblical passages. God's people are instructed to remember (Heb. zakar meaning to \"treat God most worthy\") Him, since He is the One to give them the power (Heb. koch) to get wealth.Â The word koch is the foundation of this revolutionary concept. It is fascinating, carrying eight nuances (according to the Brown, Driver and Briggs Hebrew-English Lexicon), depicting God's multi-facetted channels of release of Kingdom wealth to His people. Explore them in one of the most complete well-balanced and practical discourses on biblical wealth ever published. Also, discover the real secret behind the success of Jabez's prayer, and how to command your morning.",
