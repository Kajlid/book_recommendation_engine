  "description": "Kyle's life has been hell for years. He still wets his bed, wets himself just walking along the road, and everyone just laughs at him about it. When his mother takes him and brother Randy to the carnival, he hopes that nature won't call to him there... but it does. And when Randy rushes him over to the Porta Potty, there's something inside which does more than just scare the piss out of him.",
