Everyone, that is, except knockabout Iowa girl King, who is undaunted, unimpressed and gives as good as she gets.One night a curious story unfolds before their eyes: One business launch, 34 prostitutes and a pallet of missing pink champagne.What on earth does it mean? King and Ayers join forces but they might find a lot more than just a passion for news on the dusty road to Nevada.",
