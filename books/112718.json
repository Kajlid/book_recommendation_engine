It’d be a nightmare - especially if you’re my age.Of all days in my life, I had to find out I was an alien with bizarre powers midway through school’s first term. I wasn't warned; it just happened. And here I was thinking I’d be taken to Neverland to live like Peter Pan.Wrong!My name is Aden and I’m a boy who must die by any means necessary. You’d think I’d escape this fate - having a bunch of gifted people protecting me.Well…they can’t succeed in doing that when a boy that looks identical to me, dressed in black follows me everywhere.You see, my death is marked by my very own Grim Reaper.",
