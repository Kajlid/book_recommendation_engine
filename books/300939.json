  "description": "Was meeting Kaiser fate or a random bit of good luck?  Twenty-five years of silence. Slater's selective mutism and social anxiety have created a life of isolation. His past haunts him. His fears are deeply rooted. But he's lonely and yearns for companionship. Kaiser craves the simple things in life. The serenity of a quiet lake and a beautiful sunrise calls to him. Among crowds, he is jumpy and always on alert. Anxious. A bi-product of a troubled childhood. No one could understand his struggles. Can two broken men come together and mend each other's hearts? Slater's Silence is a 20k novella that can be read independently of the Trials of Fear series or any other Niblet. It is a hurt/comfort short story with mild angst.",
