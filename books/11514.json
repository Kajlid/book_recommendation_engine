Horde blood runs through her veins, and despite the nanotech enhancing her body, she barely scratches out a living in London society.

To save them, Mina and Rhys must race across zombie-infested wastelands and treacherous oceans — and Mina discovers the danger is not only to her countrymen as she finds herself tempted to give up everything to the Iron Duke.Includes Bonus New Material: Mina Wentworth and the Invisible City",
