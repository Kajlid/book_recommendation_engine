  "description": "The son of Terre d'Ange's most infamous traitors and the adopted son of its greatest champions, Imriel de la Courcel returns from his year at university a little older and a little wiser. But perhaps not wise enough. He and Sidonie, the Queen's daughter and heir to the throne, begin a torrid, forbidden affairâ€”until Imriel's obligations as a royal family member compel him to marry an Alban princess. By choosing duty over love, Imriel and Sidonie transgress their religion's central precept: Love as thou wilt. And when dark powers in Alba, who fear an invasion by Terre d'Ange, seek to use the lovers' passion to bind Imriel, the gods themselves take notice.Before the end, Kushiel's justice will be felt in heaven and on earth.",
