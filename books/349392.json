  "description": "When Things Go Really SouthNo one is surprised when feisty Delilah Dickinson opens her own literary travel agency in Atlanta after her divorce. But during her first group's tour of an old plantation modeled after Tara from Gone with the Wind --complete with a full cast of actors--things go south really fast. The actor playing Clark Gable playing Rhett Butler is found dead, apparently the victim of a fatal dose of Southern in-hospitality. Before anyone can even think \"Where shall I go? What shall I do?\" Delilah finds herself taking over the investigation when the #1 suspect turns out to be her son-in-law. But life starts imitating art when the actors begin taking their roles a little too seriously--believing they actually are Ashley Wilkes, Scarlett O'Hara, and Melanie. Next Sunset Boulevard.\"Amusing, breathlessly quick.\" -- Publishers Weekly\"Liva J. Washburn's mysteries are among the best.\" -- Mystery News\"Gone with the Wind fans will cozy up to this tale.\" --Mystery Scene",
