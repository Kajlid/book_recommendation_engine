  "description": "Werewolves and a dark family secret in Northern Labrador! Growing up without his father, Tyler had no way of knowing the horrible secret that has plagued his family for generations. To free himself and find the cure, he will have to look beyond himself and into his dark history. As a twenty-something ne'er do well, Tyler is stuck in a rut. He works a dead-end job, gets high, and plays video games. The only bright spot in his life, his girlfriend Julie, is about to leave Newfoundland (and, by extension, Tyler) for law school. She knows that he's a smart, talented guy, but he's held back by familial trauma he refuses to confront. Then the family curse, and the full moon, transforms Tyler into a werewolf, a fearsome beast with no memory of its humanity, driven by the call of the hunt. It's only by diving into his past and exploring his family's history that Tyler has a hope of finding a cure. It is a journey that will take him north to Labrador and face to face with the terrible legacy of residential schools. To make amends for a crime and appease an offended god, Tyler must choose between making a great sacrifice or living the rest of his life as a monster.",
