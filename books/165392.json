  "description": "In the Summer of 2014 Jimmy Perrin, author of books such as, \"Hard Up 1, 2 and 3\" was asked to write his biography, HE REFUSED !! Instead he wrote a part bi, part stand-up comedian book. NOW HE'S BACK !! More funnier... \"Did you really just call me bi-sexual in the last part? More sexier... \"No I ain't getting my bum out for another cover picture\" More outrageous... \"I will do a full frontal inside, instead\" Much More controversial than the first book, Much more of Jimmy, just being Jimmy.",
