No matter how many horrendous men she slays, her craving for death never wanes, and insanity creeps ever closer. Ocean Breeze has spilled more blood than a full-time butcher, but the lives she steals are swamped with evil. She kills filth to protect the innocent—to shield others from living similar terrors. However, with each life she snuffs, more darkness enters her soul, and the voices, the urges, the over-whelming compulsions, suck her into lunacy. Despite being plagued with mutterings of psychopaths, Ocean still hunts, still searches for her next victim.Callan Bliss lost his heart to a vigilante killer. A woman who left him at the scene of a crime and let him suffer the consequences. Now, he decays in prison, leaving his secret agent days shattered behind him. No longer able to hunt criminals, he must bunk with them. He’s bruised and torn. Unable to stop loving Ocean, but unable to forgive her. However, amongst the darkness there is light. Ocean might not be damned to wallow in whispers of monsters. She has a gift—a blindingly hopeful gift that can right her past and wipe her future clean. As Ocean grows into a woman seeking more than just revenge, she begs Callan to forgive her. She begins the journey to end their heartbreak, but no matter how hard she tries, she can’t stop her dark savior calling.",
