  "description": "This coming-of-age novel by young author James Kirkwood tells the tragic and charming story of Peter Kilburn: a young man facing accusations of murdering the headmaster of his New England prep school—the same man with a sexual fixation on Peter.When his lawyer is caught in another case and asks Peter Kilburn to write down his experiences at Gilford Academy and his interactions with the now-dead headmaster, Mr. Hoyt, Peter begins to pen the letter that makes up the pages of Good Times/Bad Times. From Peter’s elaborate involvement on campus and meeting the closest friend he’s ever had to the unwelcome sexual advances he received from Mr. Hoyt, this letter tells of the ups and downs of Peter’s time at school. As the good times give way to bad and a series of compelling incidents steadily heighten the tension of his time as a student at Gilford Academy, readers fall under the spell of the magnificent storyteller Peter exposes himself to be. Good Times/Bad Times pulses with warmth and laughter of the young and still honest, complete with strong and memorable characters.",
