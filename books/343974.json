  "description": "Ihaka and his friend, Pahiko, always look foreward to the summer wandering, when their hapu goes off to hunt birds in the forests far from their home by the sea. This summer proves to be the most exciting they have ever known, when they discover some giant moa, which the elders thought were extinct, and have their first real hunting experience. But as Ihaka learns some of the skills of manhood and is challenged by his rival, Toihau, he begins to realise that the life of a hunter may not be for him.",
