  "description": "This textbook on Neurophology details the impacts light/photons have on a human brain development their critical role in regulating its functions. The textbook reflects the most exciting and latest research across the entire range of Neurophology. It includes detailed discussions on the mechanisms of gene regulation, while the superfamily of molecules responsible for brain functions in response to light absorption are given emphasis as a unifying theme throughout molecular and cellular Neurophology. The roles of these molecules via light absorption and in signal transmission are fully explained, and illustrated.For the first time in a Neurophology text, these mechanisms are firmly established in scientific findings, providing an in-depth understanding into the role light and sunlight plays towards a human brain development and optimal functioning. Students learn about the progress being made toward a molecular basis for photo-absorption by bio-molecules, and new discoveries for unravelling the neural activity underlying the cognitive and motor functions are described.There is an emphasis on the plasticity of both sensory and the motor circuits in mediating functions that reflect the effects of absorption of sunlight. Central systems are a focus as the targets of the sunlight absorption through the entire body and internal organs. These include the systems vital for brain functioning, such as sleeping, memory, cognition, and motor functioning, as well as the systems for language, emotion and higher cognitive functions. There is special emphasis on recent work on memory, contrasting the mechanisms for short-term working memory and long-term memory and summarizing the present understanding of the mechanisms of long-term potential. The twin themes of the impact of the entire spectrum of the sunlight and the individual light wavelengths help bring together the vast range of studies and provides a conceptual framework that unifies the field of Neurophology. The text draws on the advantages of having a single author. The text represents the most up-to-date views of current research on the nervous system and its relation with the sunlight.",
