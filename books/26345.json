  "description": "(...)in the creative ways they exclude their children from the discussion. \"You're so right,\" they say: \"Sexual abuse is an enormous problem, particularly for young teens. Thank God mine aren't there yet.\"No, sorry, says reality, the most common age at which sexual abuse begins is three.\"Well sure, if you have homosexuals around small children, there's a risk.\"No, sorry, says reality, most sexual abuse is committed by heterosexual males.\"Yeah, but that kind of pervert isn't living in our neighbourhood.\"Sorry, says reality, but that kind of pervert IS living in your neighbourhood. The Department of Justice estimates that on average, there is one child molester per square mile in the United States.\"Well, at least the police know who these people are.\"Not likely, says reality, since the average child molester victimises between 50 and 150 children before he is ever arrested (and many more after he is arrested).When all defenses against reality are taken away, some parents switch to resignation, literally resigning from responsibility: \"Well, there's nothing you can do about it anyway.\" This misplaced fatalism actually becomes fatal for some children.Another common refrain uttered by deniers of the dangers of sexual abuse is: \"Well, kids are resilient. When bad things happen, they bounce back.\"Absolutely not, says reality. Children do not bounce back. They adjust, they conceal, they repress, and sometimes they accept and move on, but they don't bounce back.. (From the foreword written by Gavin de Becker)",
