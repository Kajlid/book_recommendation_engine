If I have to return to my King, he will want the greatest Knight of Camelot, but I am not that creature. I am a man who has learnt to hate what he once loved. How can I help my betrayer kill my fey father, even if it is to save Camelot and her people?”Lancelot, alone and shattered is found by the only person capable of saving what’s left of his mind. When the damaged knight finally manages to scrape his awareness together he reluctantly returns to Camelot, only to find Arthur almost as broken.The two men must face each other, over a vast gulf of betrayal in order to confront their enemies for the last time.As they travel from Camelot, into the Land of the Dead and on to Albion, they remember why and how they became one all those years ago.
