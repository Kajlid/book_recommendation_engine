  "title": "A Love Like Lilly",
  "description": "Bestselling author Kay Lynn Mangum is back with another young adult novel introducing two new, true-to-life stories brilliantly woven together. The action begins in the summer of 1985 after Grandma Lilly's funeral. Jamie (James to her friends) discovers her grandpa's old photo album from the 1930's and his wild days during the Depression. In it she discovers a little-known past about her grandparents, Harold and Lilly, and the unusual circumstances that brought and kept them together. In that sixteenth summer of her life, James discovers a lot of things about herself, too: her shock when Grandpa begins datinï¿½ again, and her jealousy when her childhood best friend, Kyle, shows interest in other girls. Readers will begin to understand that no one ever stops learning and that, although life is hard, there are second chances and new beginnings for everyone.",
