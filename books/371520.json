Captain Mark Bennington has been locked and loaded-ready for action-since meeting Grace. He's on a mission to heat up the Boston nights while on leave. This sexy older woman is lighting his way, fulfilling double-time every sex wish he's ever made. But it's going to be the toughest fight of his life to convince her to take a chance on more than just a fling.",
