  "description": "Jake Brenton runs the most prestigious security firm in the world. When his good friend Rock Star Izzy Blake asks him to take on a client, he doesn't hesitate. His job is his life and he likes it that way.  Liana Hudson is the premier Pop Star in the world. She's also young, sheltered, and being stalked by a ruthless predator. When her friends Izzy and Tina Blake tell her to hire Jake Brenton, she does so without question.  Jake is used to spoiled celebrities. What he doesn't expect is how fiercely protective he feels about the talented young beauty. Or how quickly the lines between client and bodyguard are blurred... can he keep his mind on the job and his hands off Liana? Or will she make him question everything he ever knew about himself?  A note to my readers  I have been listening and I heard you loud and clear! You want more! More stories, more pages, more ROMANCE!  Well my lovelies, I have heard and I have answered with my new book Someone To Watch Over Me. I was having a lot of fun with the Baby Maker series, but now it's on to a more traditional romance. This time it's the Hero who is under contract to the Super Star Heroine! I hope you enjoy this and keep telling me what you are after!  I get tickled each time I see a new review.
