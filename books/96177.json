  "description": "I woke up in the hospital five years ago with no idea of who I am…\nEvery day, I walk aimlessly around the city, searching for anything that helps me remember my past.I don’t find it until I apply for a job at the local hockey arena, home of the NHL team, the Devils.Three sexy hockey players inside look…familiar.They all insist they don’t know me.But they watch me. Every day. Their silence continues until a handsome, tattooed stranger dressed in a suit saunters into the arena and starts sweet talking me.Then they jump off the ice, ready to fight him to the death. And for some reason…he seems ready to return the favor.Now, I’m being swept into a life of glamorous darkness…and into a war between men I evidently used to love.",
