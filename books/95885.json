However, her every step seems to be bringing her to lurch precariously closer to the wrong side.Alex had known her life as a Seer wouldn’t be easy. She knew her gift would be difficult to control and that constantly sensing others’ emotions would be overwhelming. She even knew she’d be hunted for the power it would provided. What she didn’t foresee were the difficulties she’d have with the parts of her life she ought to be able to her decisions, her actions, and her relationships.It isn’t until she’s botched nearly every aspect of her new life that the opportunity arises to make things right. Rocky’s lover has been abducted, and Alex’s gift is the best shot at bringing her home alive. But even that will require tipping the scales in a direction no one but Alex can understand.This sequel to Unforeseen is a darker tale of the battles Alex continues to fight against her enemies, her gift, and even herself. This time victory might cost her sanity, her lover, or her life.",
