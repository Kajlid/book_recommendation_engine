  "title": "The Cave Of Wisdom: Cave of Wisdom: Finest of Esoteric & Semitic Philosophy, part 3",
  "description": "This Book is the Eversion of my paperback book The Cave Of Wisdom. The paperback book has 725 pages, so I have decided to make this Eversion in three parts for easy reading. This book is the Third version. It contains the mystical (84) stories said by various masters like Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Swami Vivekananda, Ramana Maharishi, Zen and Tao Masters. The book also contains many Upanishad mantras translated by the author. Since the principal ideologies are discussed in detail in the previous two books, I tried to use an equation style than elaborating them in this book. The stories are placed in order starting from origin of the world, main concepts, way to truth, qualities of Master, and discipline of the disciple.",
