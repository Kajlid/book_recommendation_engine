  "title": "The Good Little Nurse",
  "description": "Analise Bigelow is nine safety pins away from realizing her lifelong dream of becoming a nurse. A single-minded focus has gotten her to her final year of nursing school in Lansing, Michigan, and June 1940 is two short quarters away. It hasn’t been easy. Doctors don’t take a five-foot-nothing student nurse seriously. And there are so many distractions—the resident who invades her space, the intern who invades her thoughts, and the patient who invades her heart. Immerse yourself in another era, but don’t forget to lock the door! This book contains mild Christian references.",
