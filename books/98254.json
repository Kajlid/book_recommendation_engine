  "description": "My spirit was shattered by the time I was four years old. Beatings and verbal abuse were a normal part of life for me. By the time I understood what death was, there was no doubt in my mind that if Mother could have killed me and gotten away with it she would have done so. But the abuse didn't stop with her, two of my brothers decided that I was their personal sexual plaything. I had no one to turn to, no where to run. This is my story of survival.",
