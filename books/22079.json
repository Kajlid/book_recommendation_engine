  "title": "Ghosts of The Soon Departed",
  "description": "Insanity, imprisonment, and death haunt a dynasty of poor Appalachians, as four generations vainly spend their strength in the pursuit of a mysterious cache of Civil War blood-money. Ghosts of The Soon Departed tells the story of one family’s obsession. William is a Naval officer and strict Calvinist, preoccupied with the concept of destiny. Caleb is a Confederate veteran, traumatized by his internment as a prisoner of war. Marshall is a bricklayer, resourceful and loyal to his family; he is contemptuous of the fabled gold as it threatens to destroy those around him. Julia is a beautiful, coquettish, and spirited belle of the new south. Gene, a depression era moonshiner and schemer, is resentful of the pious affectations he’s confronted with. R.C. works in a cardboard packaging plant, seeks advancement, considers himself classless, and forgives no one. Through their struggles an epoch is illuminated. Along the way, we witness visions tantamount to a litany of the realm known as Dixie.",
