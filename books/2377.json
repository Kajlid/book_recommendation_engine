  "title": "Celtic Modern: Music at the Global Fringe (Volume 1)",
  "description": "The study of 'Celtic' culture has been locked within modern nationalist paradigms, shaped by contemporary media, tourism, and labor migration. Celtic Modern collects critical essays on the global circulation of Celtic music, and the place of music in the construction of Celtic 'Imaginaries'. It provides detailed case studies of the global dimensions of Celtic music in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Brittany, and amongst Diasporas in Canada, the United States and Australia, with specific reference to pipe bands, traditional music education in Edinburgh, the politics of popular/traditional crossover in Ireland, and the Australian bush band phenomenon. Contributors include performer musicians as well as academic writers.Critique necessitates reflexivity, and all of the contributors, active and in many cases professional musicians as well as writers, reflect in their essays on their own contributions to these kind of encounters. Thus, this resource offers an opportunity to reflect critically on some of the insistent 'othering' that has accompanied much cultural production in and on the Celtic World, and that have prohibited serious critical engagement with what are sometimes described as the 'traditional' and 'folk' music of Europe.",
