  "description": "It started out completely harmless. I was moving in and Cliff was my neighbor. His son, Devon was there too, Devon who is my age while Cliff is way older than me. And yet it is Cliff that I want. He’s the man of my dreams, rugged, masculine and he seems to be obsessed with me. Cara is right. I am obsessed with her. She’s so damn young but I can’t take my eyes or hands off of her. The sheer thought of her giving her youthful body to someone else is torturous and I can’t let that happen. And I won’t. I’ve lived long enough to know that when a sweet bombshell looks at you the way she looks at me, you need to lock that girl down. No matter the cost.",
