  "description": "Hustling as a waitress is a far cry from being the most feared witch in the world. But after surviving ten years of war between humans and supernaturals, Lily finds anonymity a relief. Even a request for help from an old coven friend can’t bring Lily out of hiding -- until her friend disappears, along with the entire coven. What’s worse, wolf shifter and Chief Investigator Leif -- the man Lily is secretly in love with -- considers her the only suspect. And to top it all off, the dark witch who was her first love has been resurrected … and wants her back. Lily’s search for the truth could destroy the witch-shifter Alliance and reignite the war with the humans. But if that’s what it takes to help her friends, she’ll do it. Even a retired war witch is very dangerous when provoked.",
