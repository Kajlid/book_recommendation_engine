  "description": "1 Corinthians 12:7-9 7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; Stand In Your Anointment; This Too Shall Pass - Do Not Throw Your Pearls to the Swine is an account of my personal story and journey through life. One, that has been strewn with countless trials and tribulations, and so much pain. But through them all recognizing and realizing that it had to be God to take me through them and give me the grace to stand, and to continue in spite of all that trouble allow Him to gain glory through my life as I continued to go about the work that He has set before me to do. The devastation, sorrow, pain and grief that followed the loss of my precious husband was almost to much to bear. This was the trial that I thought I was going to throw the towel in on, until God gave me the revelation that this must be my anointing and of how I was finally not only able to recognize it, but was able to grasp and take hold of the Gift that God has given to me through the Holy Spirit, the Gifts of Healing! And of how I now stand in that anointing and am using my gifts so that God will continue to be glorified in and through my life. Amen!!!!",
