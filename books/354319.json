Meteors fall from the sky and volcanoes erupt. Fremont is verdant, rich, beautiful, and dangerous.Fremont's single town, Artistos, perches on a cliff below rugged mountains. Below Artistos lie the Grass Plains, which lead down to the sea. And in the middle of the Grass Plains, a single silver spaceship lies quiet and motionless. The seasons do not dull it, nor do the winds scratch it---and the fearful citizens of Aristos won't go near it.Chelo Lee, her brother Joseph, and four other young children have been abandoned on the colony planet.
