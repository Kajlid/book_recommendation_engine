  "title": "A Teenager in the Chad Civil War: A Memoir of Survival, 1982-1986",
  "description": "Chad, which theoretically gained its independence from France in 1960, is one of many African countries that have been fighting a series of particularly brutal wars, internal and external. In 1982, Hissene Habri wrested power from Chad's unrecognized government, igniting a vicious civil war. Thousands of innocent citizens were kidnapped, tortured and killed to quash political unrest. Covering 1982 to 1986, this memoir tells the story of Isaoe Toongar, a native of southern Chad and miraculous survivor of Chad's darkest days. This work contains Toongar's first-hand description of growing up, coming of age and waging the ultimate struggle for survival in the war-torn country. It gives a graphic account of what transpired in Chad during the rule of Habre and the ways in which the author managed to survive, fleeing his home village and seeking safety among the CODOs, a rebel movement of the south. Photographs from the author's collection are included.",
