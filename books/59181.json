  "title": "Painful Questions: An Analysis Of The Sept. 11th Attack",
  "description": "This book has the color photos, diagrams, and the analysis to show that the World Trade Center towers and Building 7 were demolished with explosives that were placed in the buildings in preparation for the 9-11 attack. This book is being used by people around the world to support the accusation that the US Government was the primary conspirator in the 9-11 attack. For two examples, David Ray Griffin references it in his book \"The New Pearl Harbor\", and Andreas von Bulow, a retired German government official, is referencing it in his book published in Germany. If you believe Osama bin Laden attacked us without our government's assistance, why not find the flaws in this book, put these accusations to rest, and help restore America's credibility? If you already believe the attack was conducted by the U.S. government, this book will help you educate your fellow citizens on the unbelievable corruption in our world.",
