  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B083QYZY1ZIt was all perfectly quiet, but Karter knew the shit storm coming was inevitable. It would all be his fault too. It always was. He would probably screw something up and they'd get rid of him, or he would push them too far. It never failed. No matter how much he wanted to believe he had changed, that for once they could handle him, his doubts followed him around. Karter knew that happiness was something that never really lasted.  As those doubts cluttered his mind, he felt the need to run wild and free, to outrun the darkness taking over his mind. A race through the grounds soon turns into a fight for survival.  They must save him. They must claim what is theirs. They will have to destroy any who would dare to take their feisty wolf away.  Blood is pleasure and pain, as vengeance takes over them. The only certain outcome: death.  (Warning: Not for the faint of heart, action pack dark romance) MMMMM Dark Paranormal Romance.",
