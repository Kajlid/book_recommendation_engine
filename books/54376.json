  "title": "Nancy Likes Christmas: Complete Dailies, 1946â€“1948",
  "description": "It 's three more full years of Ernie Bushmiller 's beloved comic strip, featuring over one thousand meticulously restored daily strips from its post-World-War II graphic high point superbly crafted but not yet quite stylized into the almost machine-life sleekness of later decades. And what can you say about the jokes in Nancy other than that, contrary to its reputation for a zen-like, ultra-square oddness, many of them are actually just extremely funny? Nancy Likes Christmas is topped off with a new introduction in comics form by Zippy the Pinhead creator Bill Griffith, a lifelong fan of Nancy and admirer of Bushmiller 's genius, and once again designed with pop-art snap and crackle by Fantagraphics senior designer Jacob Covey.",
