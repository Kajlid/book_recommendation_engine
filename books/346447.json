  "description": "A story of erotic adventure by one of Japan's most celebrated and outspoken novelists.'The Life of an Amorous Man' is Saikaku's first major work in prose, published in 1682, when he was forty-one. In this novel, as in his later works, he depicts the pursuits and follies of the most glamorous period of old Japan: the dawn of the Genroku era, when the wealthy commoners, rising in importance above the traditional warrir caste, indulged in the free and easy life of such celebrated pleasure districts as Edo's Yoshiwara, Osaka's Shinmachi, and Kyoto's Shimabara.",
