  "description": "She was on his sofa, reading a book. She was a complete stranger. And she was naked... Her name was Zoe, and she had survived a horrific ordeal. Fleeing from trouble and the threat of death, Zoe turned to her best friend, Helen. Driving for three days straight, she arrived cold and hungry on Helen s doorstep. But Helen was at work. Leaving Helen s husband, John, and Zoe together...all alone. Having escaped from a life of terror and violence, Zoe was sure she could hide with them for a while. Just long enough to get back on her feet and her life in order again. John s only mistake was to agree she could stay with them... Because Zoe s past was fast catching up with her. And that past would draw them all into a game of life and death. By letting her stay, John had no idea of the horror that would be visited on them all... For someone had a game to finish a game that could turn very deadly indeed. LOVE LIES DYING You always love, The ones you hurt...",
