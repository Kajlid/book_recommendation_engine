  "description": "Amy knew she'd been letting her work take over her life, but it hadn't even entered her head how long it had been since she got laid or had a fling until her best friend Nikki reminded her. Discovering Derek, Nikki's fiancé's cousin, was about to put an ad in \"Kinky Delights\" — the local newspaper's alternative personal column—Amy decided a bit of kink in her non-existent sex life might be just the spark she needed to get her libido running once again.On the way into his favorite adult store in search of some new and exciting kinky toys, Derek bumped into a sweet, but slightly crazy, fortune teller. She insisted on doing his cards for him, and the Ten of Cups was in his future — the \"Happily Ever After\" card.Neither Derek nor Amy had been thinking of \"happily ever after\" when they set out on their affair — which was just as well, since they were far more likely to end up with a Kinkily Ever After.",
