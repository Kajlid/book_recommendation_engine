  "title": "Ramakrishna and His Disciples",
  "description": "This biography of Ramakrishna was written for the West by one of England's most talented authors. The writing is beautiful in itself, but the story of a most unusual man with unheard of spiritual yearning is what this book is really about. \"This is the story of a phenomenon. I will begin by calling him simply that, rather than \"holy man,\"\"mystic,\"or \"saint\"; all emotive words with mixed associations which may attract some readers, repel others.\"A phenomenon is always a fact, an object of experience. That is how I shall try to approach Ramakrishna . . . I only ask you to approach Ramakrishna with the same open-minded curiosity you might feel for any highly unusual human being.\"",
