  "description": "Two strangers. Two stories. One ending. Tasked with carrying out her grandfather’s final wishes, Amelia Quinlivan flies across the Atlantic and sets off driving around the coast of Ireland, spreading his ashes. Once finished, she plans on staying at her inherited cottage in Malin Head, and she plans on staying for a while. Accused of a crime he didn’t commit, Daniel Byrne might not know where he’s going, but he knows where he’s been; and that isn’t a place he wants to return to. When the feisty lass catches him by surprise, every instinct tells him to run from her and save them both the trouble he will undoubtedly cause. But love doesn’t always follow the rules, and when it’s worth fighting for, will Daniel let his pride get in the way of forever?",
