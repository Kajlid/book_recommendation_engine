  "description": "The sizzling conclusion of the Fallen Angels MC series   Their love will be tested once more before they can hope to find happiness.  For Mason Butler, the takedown of Declan McDermott was the easy part. When his brothers took his back, they were able to peaceably remove the dirty club president and he’s gone, for now. But after removing both the first- and second-in-command, Mace has been promoted to the top job in the club, and he’s trying to keep everything he’s worked for from falling apart – including his relationship with Caroline.  Caroline Lewis has agreed to let Mase back in, but it’s not always easy to trust after your heart’s been broken. And now, with him running a club she doesn’t believe in, he’ll have to convince her to not only give him her heart, but also accept his lifestyle.  As they try to make a future for themselves, danger still threatens. McDermott may be gone, but he left behind a promise of vengeance. It will take everything they’ve got for Caroline and Mase to stay safe, everything they've got to stay together against a desperate man with nothing left to lose, and everything they've got to fight for their lives.",
