  "description": "This is a 7500 word short holiday story (about one tenth of a full-length novel). If you enjoy funny romantic mysteries, you can read this one as a stand-alone or as part of the series.  Mistletoe seems a whole lot less romantic once you’ve been poisoned by it. Isobel Avery would know—it’s one of the perks of being an undercover poison taster for the rich and famous. Still, with the weather as cold as it gets in Los Angeles and a hot new date, Izzy has a few ideas on how to keep herself warm this Christmas. They just don’t start under mistletoe.  However, before her cozy plans can come to fruition, she needs to survive meeting her date’s family over Christmas lunch. With a long, awkward road trip that has her wondering whether she’s fallen for the Grinch, a mysterious poisoner intent on killing the holiday spirit, and a Santa’s sackful of secrets she’s not allowed to spill, Izzy will need a Christmas miracle to avoid disaster.  The real question is, will her evening be naughty… or not?    The series so far:  EAT, PRAY, DIE #1 THE HUNGER PAINS #2 TASTE OF CHRISTMAS #2.5 POISON IS THE NEW BLACK #3 (coming January 2017)",
