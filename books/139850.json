  "description": "Wounded Navy SEAL warrior, Captain Ransome Boone is a man with a mission: to stand on his own two feet in time for his brother’s wedding. Moving into his own place, he’s just taken the first step toward independence. He’s expecting old Mrs. Curry as his caregiver, but gets the shock of his life when her daughter shows up instead. Solange Curry was the gangly girl he teased in childhood. Now she’s all grown up–a gorgeous Gullah goddess who captivates him. Living with the sexy, no-nonsense woman is infuriating, exciting, and fraught with erotic possibilities. But Solange won’t bite. Despite her undeniable attraction to the sexy former soldier, she won’t risk her professional integrity for a quick romp. Not for a bad boy like Ransome with a reputation that extends far beyond their little corner of South Carolina. For Ransome, dealing with his physical setbacks is one thing. Coming to grips with the idea he might not be a good enough man for Solange is a brand new obstacle. One he’s hell bent on overcoming. He’s fought for his life, now he must fight for her love and prove he’s an honorable man.",
