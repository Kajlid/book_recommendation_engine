  "description": "\"A most charming, sexy, independent, and candid heroine; clever, literate dialog; and closely woven plotting will win immediate fans for this debut series.\" â€• Library Journal STARRED review Seven Australian soldiers, carousing in Paris in 1918, unknowingly witness a murder, with devastating consequences.

And the effect this is having on her own usually peaceful household is disastrous....",
