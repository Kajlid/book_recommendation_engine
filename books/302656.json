  "description": "He’ll give back my secrets. For a price. Turns out the email I just sent my therapist—wherein I detail my biggest, closest-guarded secrets—did not go to my therapist. It went to Westcott Durham. Yes: the Wes Durham, former child star, former teen heartthrob, and current biggest a**hole on either coast. Gorgeous, enraging Wes. My enemy. The secrets I just spilled? One that could destroy my career, one that could destroy my relationship with my sister…and one that could destroy me. It was supposed to follow me to the grave. They all were. Blackmail’s the name of his game. My sentence: eight weeks of hell. Now he’s making me pretend I like him, all so his has-been music channel (and his bedsheets, I’m sure) will see some traffic from my fans. I can’t say no, even when he makes it clear he’s not pretending, anymore. I think. I hope. I hate Wes Durham with almost everything I am. Whatever’s left…that’s what will get me in trouble. * * * Fake Halo is a standalone, full-length romance novel with steamy scenes, an HEA, and no cliffhanger.
