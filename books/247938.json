  "description": "Would you sacrifice love for a greater cause?After months on the run, Olivia has changed forever, but even more than she, the clone she’s fallen in love with has transformed, and not for the better. Buried deep inside Axel is a different personality, one that only shows when he is handed power. He’s got that now and much more. Axel is convinced Olivia is his reason for living, and he will do anything to hold onto her and the freedom he’s won—no matter the cost. Marcus Axis is searching for his wife. When he finally finds her, letting go is the last thing he plans to do. But is he after total control of Aeropia, territory which Olivia and Axel hold, to add to the land he’s already claimed, or does he speak the truth when he told her he wants a family and he wants it with her? Is she the only way to heal a fractured country as he claims? Torn between the man of her past and the one who could change the future by fusing Aeropia back together, Olivia is determined to make the right choice for her people this time, even if heart desires something else.",
