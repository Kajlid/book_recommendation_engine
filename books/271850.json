  "description": "Praise for Leighton Gage’s Chief Inspector Mario Silva series: “Realistic characters that the readers can care about. . . . The ultimate story of the haves vs. the have nots.”â€”Detroit Free Press “Gage's compelling novels are good examples of how talented crime writers use the police procedural form to lay bare a society.”â€”Indianapolis Star “Gage creates a contemporary tapestry of Brazil . . . [and] builds a compelling foundation for future Silva cases.”â€”Kirkus Reviews “Emotionally charged. . . . Vividly evokes a country of political corruptions, startling economic disparity and relentless crime.”â€”Booklist A playful dog finds a bone at the outset of this mystery set in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Chief Inspector Mario Silva of the federal police based in Brasilia and his team of investigators, Hector Costa and Arnaldo Nunes, are called in. The bone is human and the investigators soon unearth a clandestine cemetery. Someone has secretly disposed of the bodies of unknown human beings, often interred in family groups. And in Sao Paulo, it turns out, many patrons of a local travel agency have never reached their North American destinations. The motive for these mass murders is completely contemporary and completely appalling.",
