He is cautious, ready for anything - except Jet. The first time he sees the black-haired, golden-eyed beauty he recognizes a shape-shifter like himself - but like no Sentinel he has seen before. Jet has been trained by the Sentinels' dark counterparts for one mission: to take down Nick Carter. If she succeeds, her pack will be freed. If she fails. But the moment she meets the man with pale green eyes, she recognizes a kindred spirit, a male to match the wild nature of her soul. Together, they could be amazing.But if they do not betray each other, the people they are supposed to protect will die.",
