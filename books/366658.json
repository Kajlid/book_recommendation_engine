  "description": "FAIRBANKS , ALASKA ADVENTURE, -40°, BEARS, MOOSE . . . HUSBAND-SCHOOL DROPOUT OF AN EX. YIKES! Abigail Vertuccio, reluctant clairvoyant, has three simple goals in life. One. Don’t let people find out about her infuriating habit of seeing the future. Two. Stop seeing the future. Three. Get as far away from her past (and that means Alaska ) as possible. She thought she’d succeeded when she hopped in her ancient motor home and hit and road. Only now she’s back in Alaska – Grandma’s orders – to help run the family rural air service, Alaska Virgin Air. Home only a week, Abbey stumbles onto a plot to destroy the family business. Never one to leave matters to the experts, she and two of her zanier friends orchestrate a counter-attack of stakeouts and spying that have even the Alaska State Troopers rolling in the aisles. Despite all her efforts, she’s batting zero on the spy front. It’s beginning to look like someone’s trying to kill her. As if that isn’t enough, things with her ex are alternately heating up and scaring the hell out of her. She has only one question. Should she get out of town now, before she ends up in someone’s bed, married again or just plain dead? Okay, two questions. What the hell good is being clairvoyant if it never seems to work when she really, really wants it to?",
