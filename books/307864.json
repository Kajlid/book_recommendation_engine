  "description": "Dallas: He’s the one that got away. But, Banks Weston is more than just the man who got away. I let him go. He’d been ready to share with the world his true self, living life openly. He’s loud and proud. It’s all the many things I’m not. It took me a while, but I did it—everyone knows I’m gay. I want him back. My betrayal broke his heart. No—I obliterated it. But somehow, our paths cross again, and we have a reason to come together and pretend we’re something we’re not. Though in my heart, I’ll always hope for the second chance I don’t deserve. Banks: I both hate him and love him all at the same time. His arrogant smirk, the way he rakes his hands through his hair when he’s nervous, and how he lightens any situation with his humor—are just a few things I miss about Dallas Phillips. I won’t let him suck me in again by his charming nature. My guard is up. I’m standing firm. That is until we find a reason to be together. We’ll have to fake it, showing the whole world that we’re a couple. Then again, it won’t be hard because my heart has never stopped loving him.",
