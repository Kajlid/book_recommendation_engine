  "title": "Kitty and Her Sisters",
  "description": "At the age of 19, Kitty McCarthy has decided she is going to live a life less ordinary—although she doesn't know quite how to go about it. What she does know is that she doesn't want to get married and raise children in Liverpool like her elder sisters—Claire, who is a mother-hen, easy-going Norah, and elegant Aileen. But Kitty's resolve is tested by the unexpected direction her life takes. What will she gain by swimming against the tide? The combination of an impetuous youthful decision and a chance meeting 20 years later are to have momentous repercussions that will stay with her forever. As she bounces through the years, wryly accepting that regrets and mistakes are all part of life, it is her sisters who are the constant thread when other relationships have come and gone. They know her best, they say, and in the end they know what is best for her—although Kitty would almost certainly disagree. Maureen Lee paints another unforgettable and intimate picture of one family's chaos, unpredictability, and warmth. Her heroine, Kitty, serves as a reminder that every life story is unique.",
