  "description": "**This is a Stand Alone that pairs with the Hidden Empire Series storyline. Can be read alone but if read after Four Tricks it will give you more background.You know, I thought my life was pretty normal. I was working towards my dream of being a fashion designer, even got my own shop. My best friend Dax and I met in college as roommates and became soul sisters for life. Even her platonic male best friend Weston and I were close, like the big brother I liked to flirt with. All typical, all normal, all what you would expect in your life as a thirty year old… until it wasn’t.Trust me when I tell you I’m not being overdramatic when I say my life changed at gunpoint. Well, if you want me to get real specific, it was being held hostage in my own house at gunpoint by a biker gang! Is that normal to you?Come to find out that my best friend, soul sister, woman who knows everything about me was keeping a hell of a lot of secrets from me. Such as being a major player in the criminal world of LA. Seems she pissed some people off and they came after me to get to her. Now my life is in shambles and everything is ripped away from me in one fell swoop.I haven’t even gotten to the best part yet! My girl Dax decides the best way to keep me safe is to ship me off with three assassins. You heard that right, assassins! Triplets to be exact, carbon copies with bodies that would make Greek gods weep. Oh, and apparently, they’ve decided that I’m going to be their woman, that we were made for each other.They talk me into giving them a chance, not that I have much choice since they won’t tell me where they smuggled me off to. My mind resists while my body has quite the opposite reaction to these men and the promises they make. Can I trust them to protect not only my life but my heart too? If I let them try will I really be able to walk away after?This is an adult romance where the leading lady doesn't have to choose who she loves or how many.
