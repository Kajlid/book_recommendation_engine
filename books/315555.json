  "description": "When a series of coincidences line up to create chaos, and disaster appears imminent, the people of Thaea know those events are not the making of the Great Maze of Life.Greed paves the way for chaos, but human greed transcends time. Therefore a cycle of chaos and order exists.That is when heroes and villains are made. For when the villains create chaos, heroes always rise to restore order: and that is the truth of the great maze we call life.Thaea- a world where the intrigue is as thick as the magic that saturates the soil. Take the Lyvenian Empire, where the Emperor was unable to sire a legitimate heir to secure his throne. And so, on the one hand, the Emperor's brother considers the Imperial throne all but his. On the other hand, however, is the Emperor's natural son. Whom the people revere and consider their true 'Prince'.Then we sail off to Abnayse. Where a mysterious woman continues to revive the ongoing speculations about the 'Lost Princess'.So… what could possibly be the link between the emperor’s natural son and a woman of much renown whose identity is shrouded in mystery?",
