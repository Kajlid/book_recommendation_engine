  "description": "Sheltered in the clan's stronghold, Syssi feels a powerful connection to Kian, all the time unaware that he and his sister are not human, and neither are the supposedly religious fanatics that are after her. As Kian introduces Syssi to a world of pleasure she never dared imagine, his dominant sexuality is a revelation. And even though she is completely out of her element, Syssi feels comfortable and safe letting go with him. That is, until she begins to suspect that all is not as it seems. Piecing the puzzle together, she draws a scary, yet completely wrong conclusionâ€¦Will Kian ultimately betray Syssi's trust? Will he finally confess his true nature? Should he?",
