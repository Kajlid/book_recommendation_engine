  "description": "A southern tale of a teenage girl who opens a Pandora’s box of passion and guilt Bored with her sheltered life on the family farm in Rigby, Georgia, fifteen- year-old Tammi Lynn Elco senses things can change when she acquires a stack of forbidden romance novels. Eluding the watchful eye of her Granny Elco, Tammi forms a secret book club with two girlfriends and her eccentric Aunt Minna, reading about weak- in-the- knees passion and sharing their own stories of love and heartache. When Rigby is seized in an economically damaging drought, local preachers are quick to proclaim sin as the reason for the devastation, forcing Tammi and her fellow book club members to come to terms with the emotions they’re feeling and the strict expectations of the community surrounding them. “Dixie Diva” Julie L. Cannon has written a heartfelt coming- of-age tale with true southern flair.",
