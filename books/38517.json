  "description": "Based on a true story and set in the breathtaking scenery of the Himalayas, Djana follows a last resort call to heal her life and become a nun in a Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in the kingdom of Nepal. She meets a man she recognizes from a past life and a strong karmic connection opens up her psychic ability to see energy, read thoughts and travel through the information field. Together, they open channels and wormholes in time and space as she falls in love with him but he leaves for Tibet. She follows his spirit thereby developing a chain of destined synchronistic events that lead her to The Other Side where the past, present and future co-exist. She becomes a direct channel of the Angels of Love, Truth and Protection, as they guide her through the transforming, all-encompassing power of love that embodies everything there is, and everything there ever will be, as well as the mystery behind our genetic encoding in third dimension. A story of sacred journeys, soulmates and soul choices, recognition and purpose, energy and psychic powers, the heart chakra and the power of love, premonitions and dreams; The Soul Trek is for those who want to open their minds to discovering a world where they are experiencing new things and they are not making themselves figure things out the way they want themselves to figure things out.",
