  "description": "The lives of two addicts converge unexpectedly following an accidental and horrific death. After his fiancé, Vicky, is killed in a hit-and-run car accident, Monty Miller, a self-destructive, codependent alcoholic, embarks on a suicidal mission to drink himself to death. But his family intervenes and has him committed to Sanctuary, a rehabilitation facility high in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. There he meets Dave Bell, a former all-American track star turned washed-up high school volleyball coach, whose narcissism and denial threaten to tear his family apart. Dave is the driver responsible for the accident that killed Vicky, but has no recollection of it due to the massive amounts of crack and alcohol that were in his system. Instead of working on his recovery, Dave spends his time in rehab having an affair with a meth addict named Angie and getting high on drugs he steals from the detox trailer. It isn’t until Monty shares intimate details about the night of the accident that Dave begins to realize his own culpability. Will Dave turn himself in and risk a life sentence in prison or will he find some excuse to skirt responsibility? Will knowing Vicky’s killer bring Monty any kind of resolution or will it propel him further into his self-pity and destruction? Based on the author’s own personal experience with substance abuse and twelve-step programs, Some Are Sicker Than Others transcends the clichés of the typical recovery story by exploring the incomprehensible demoralization of addiction and the devastating effect is has on not just the afflicted, but everyone it touches.",
