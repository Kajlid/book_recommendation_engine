  "description": "The bridge between the spiritual world and ours has been broken.My name is Kevin Glass, and I’m only sixteen years old. I have no idea how it happened, but it’s up to me to stop an army of demonic entities from ravaging our entire planet and killing everything in their wake. Through my harrowing tale of love, combat, and mischief, there are many unforeseen twists and turns that threaten to turn my quest into a debacle.My father and I are called “Spiritual Warriors,” and we have come to lay waste to those that oppose us. He has stood by my side through the thick and thin, and I will stand by his in order to do his bidding. My eyes have seen holes torn in the sky and beings that are not from this world raining down on us all, destroying everything.I have seen death, bloodshed, and corpses that lie on the streets and in the fields. Some of those have been slain by my own blade. There is a story to tell here, and it pleads to be heard. The events herein are not fiction, but rather, they are my own history and my own destiny.Is it my time to die, or is it the time of my enemies? When it is my time, I will make those that threaten me desolate forever, and they will have no resurrection. Journey with me into the world of dreams and of nightmares, and you too will see the monsters that walk among us.I’m coming.",
