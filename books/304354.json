No distractions. Just us.I bake my way through the season.He thinks desserts are a waste of time.I hum Christmas carols.He glares at me like I just suggested surgery without anesthesia.I should not be noticing how good he looks in those tailored scrubs…But then he dares me to prove that Christmas magic is real.Challenge accepted.But as the snow falls and the tension between us intensifies, I realize the real challenge isn’t making him believe in Christmas…It’s making him believe in love.And when he springs an unexpected proposal, I have to wonder…Could this fake marriage turn into something real?",
