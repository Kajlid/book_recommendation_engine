  "title": "The Pig Did It",
  "description": "A poster pig‚ a pig of evil and redemption‚ and shall we go so far as to say a Pig of Peace? Why not? Joseph Caldwell does in this hilarious send−up of the Irish lyric novel. What the Pig did to the lives of the title characters-star-crossed lover-the heart broken and triumphant who act out ancient tales of passion and family feuds against a lush and wild Irish land and seascape could only have happened in the mind of a novelist as seasoned and freewheeling as Caldwell. When you stop laughing long enough‚ you′ll want to go to the nearest pub‚ order a Guinness‚ and share the tale of what the pig did‚ or come to think of it−did he do it‚ and why? Fear not‚ you won′t have to wait long for further laughs and yes‚ suspense‚ because this is only the first in the Pig Trilogy.",
