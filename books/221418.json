Lock needs the best candidates, but those who are sent fall far short of his expectations.Before Lock can change the situation, the candidates, and his own family, come under attack. Confronted by enemies old and new in a fight on two fronts, Lock has to rely on help from Jimmy, the only experienced member of the newly-formed Shadow team. The team must be kept safe while Lock tries to rescue his family, but the battles and foes faced by both Lock and Jimmy are far more deadly than either of them could have imagined.Shadow Team GB is the third book in J M Johnsonâ€™s Starbirth series: fantasy adventures set within a contemporary military basis.",
