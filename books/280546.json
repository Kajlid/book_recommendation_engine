  "description": "I’ve been called a robot. Made of stone. Heartless. But that’s because no one ever saw what was underneath. Not until Mina McLennan saw right through me. We made so many mistakes, left each other with scars so deep and wreckage in our wake but I couldn’t help but find her, fight for her. I mean, I fell in love with the way she loved me. And so deeply, so full of a furiously beating heart that I asked her to marry me. Turns out, that was the easy part.",
