  "description": "At a Friday-night party in New Jersey, sixteen year old Jesse Tynan witnesses a murder of a young girl, and witnesses a skyrunner—a ghost-like insect apparition—emerge for the first time. Then the body of the murdered girl spontaneously burns to ashes, leaving no evidence, but the skyrunner proves to be a much bigger problem. It's a manifestation of negative emotion from a parallel universe; the \"Otherworld\" where our emotions affect our other selves.When Jesse teams up with unlikely companion Ashton Blake, he's not only introduced to the Otherworld, he's trapped there! Jesse's journey crosses paths with many memorable faces as he searches for a way back home to protect his grandmother, and does all he can to escape the prowls of a dangerous witch.The whole thing becomes a giant death trap at the center of an elaborate 'Trick.'Gritty, exhilarating, and utterly gripping, Stacey T. Hunt's ferociously entertaining fantasy takes readers on a wild ride of pure adrenaline.",
