  "description": "Pain and hopelessness are the common ground shared between two vastly different cultures--a middle-class woman in rural America and war-ravaged children in Africa--as author Bethany Haley shares her story of healing and how she built Exile International, a non-profit that nurtures child soldiers rescued from the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army). Meet Denis. Denis was abducted at the age of ten after being forced to watch members of the LRA murder his father and grandparents. His younger siblings were left behind, and his mother was instructed to \"raise them well... for one day we'll return to take them too.\" Denis is one of thousands of innocent boys and girls who have had their innocence stolen and are forced to do the unthinkable on a daily basis. But their horrific experiences are just the beginning. The real story is what happens \"after.\" Once the children escape or are rescued, they have to find a way to live again. This is where Bethany Haley comes in. Faced with her own failures and rocky journey toward healing, Bethany founded Exile International--a foundation that uses art and expression therapy to help with the healing process. Once these children learn to face their pasts, they are given hope for a future and a vision for making a difference in their country as peace-makers. Featuring a foreword by Katie Davis, author of the bestseller \"Kisses from Katie,\" this riveting narrative shows us that no matter what hardships we have endured, there is always a way to healing and a positive future.",
