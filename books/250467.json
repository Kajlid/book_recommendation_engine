  "description": "A small-town, friends to lovers story is coming your way this spring.Getting dumped sucks. Getting dumped by your boyfriend days before your best friend’s wedding? It doesn’t get much worse.Did I mention that the guy who cut me loose was country music’s number one rising star?And my client.I thought I was walking into a proposal. Instead, I crashed right into humiliation—dumped and fired.The silver lining? In a restaurant, there’s plenty of wine to drown my feelings.In strolls Tyler Nichols, the restaurant owner. He’s charming, handsome and does a good job of trying to make me feel better. A really good job. Sharing my heartbreak with a beautiful stranger is the last thing that I expected.Turns out, Tyler Nichols is my ex’s best friend. And according to the local gossips—mainly my cousin—he’s got a mysterious past.No worries, I’m the gal with everything going for her—great job, fabulous apartment and a glamorous life half way across the country in sunny Los Angeles—far away from my hometown and my family’s bourbon empire. I’ll be leaving after the weekend wedding festivities.That is until my best friend, Sage, finds herself in a jam and needs my help before jetting off on her honeymoon.So, I’m staying in Mayfield a little longer than anticipated. In just a few short weeks, I’ll march my happy ass back to the West Coast, far away from Tyler’s smoldering gaze and his panty-melting smile. And the chemistry between us that burns hotter than a hickory stump.But the longer I’m in town, the harder it is to stay away from him. And maybe I don’t want to.",
