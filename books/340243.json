  "description": "Aspen Wicklow, a University of North Texas journalism grad down to her last $75, lucks out and lands a plum job on WBFD-TV's Public Defender in Fort Worth, Tex. Tig Welder, a hotshot gunning for an anchor spot, reminds œInvestigative Reporter Barbie� never to try scooping him, while station manager J. Gordon Pfeiffer warns her never to become part of the story. Following either tip isn't easy after Aspen meets ruggedly handsome Spike Granger, a Johnson County sheriff who's on a rampage about prison overcrowding. Even more alarming is researching a missing person report on Candy Drummond, who pledged at the same sorority as Aspen. Candy later turns up a strangled corpse.",
