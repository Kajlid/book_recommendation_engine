  "description": "The fashionably funny new novel from the bestselling author of Pants on Fire. Cross Bridget Jones with The Devil Wears Prada and you have this engaging romantic comedy about love, sex, friendships, and relationships...with a lot of style. Emily Pointer, stylist for Chic magazine, has a rule about never wear anything older than six months...unless it's so old you can pass it off as vintage. And never, ever fall in love, unless it's for a killer pair of Manolos. With a witty and biting insider's take on the fashion world; the crazy circuit of the New York-London-Milan-Paris designer shows, and the most humbling of all experiences, love, Maggie Alderson delivers a poignant, funny novel of success and revenge, friendship and flirtation, passion and Prada that's as fresh and rejuvenating as an afternoon at Bliss Spa.",
