With rugged good looks, his ever present plaid shirt, and a dog named Babe, John is a modern alpha male lumberjack in more ways than one. Lurking beneath the gruff exterior and beard could be the heart of a romantic. Or is John a wolf in flannel clothing? After his favorite neighbor rents out her cabin for the winter, John finds himself playing fireman and tour guide to Diane Watson, a beautiful brunette with her own messy past and recent battle scars. Will he be ready to fall in love? Or will he go back to his old, flirty ways? Hold onto your heart... and get ready to fall with John Day as he tells his story in this contemporary adult romance/romantic comedy told in male POV.Ready to Fall is the second novel in the Modern Love Stories series. This is a spin-off from Geoducks Are for Lovers. Though the books are interconnected, isn't necessary to read that novel first.",
