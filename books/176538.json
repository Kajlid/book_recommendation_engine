  "description": "When Ilene Stanford’s husband left her after years of marriage for a much younger model, she just knew her romantic life was at an end. Having only known one man since high school, she was sure that at thirty-two her days as a love interest was all but over, and besides, she had a twelve year old daughter to raise. With her mind set on being an old maid, she was in no way prepared for bad boy ex-soldier Dane who came into her life literally through her bedroom window at night, and did things to her body that she didn’t even knew existed. Sure the lovemaking was off the charts good, but could she trust the craziness that he whispered in her ear in the darkness of night?",
