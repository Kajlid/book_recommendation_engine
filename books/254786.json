  "title": "The Yak Guy Project",
  "description": "Imagine waking up in the desert with no idea what happened to you. You have clear memories of situations and places, but a complete loss in personal matters... like your own name. This situation is bad, and you have no idea how to get home.When you're rescued by a talking yak, the situation gets exponentially worse. You've obviously lost your mind. The immediate needs of a ride off the salt pan and searing heat, along with a drink of water, outweigh the concerns about your mental state.This is exactly what happened to the Yak Guy. In fact he's been placed in an alternate world and given a chance to start over in life.Can this selfish, almost parasitic, young man learn to start over in a world where charity is hard to find? Life is brutal and short here, but he's going to have to adapt or perish.The Yak Guy Project is loosely based around The Fool's Journey from the Tarot. Those with experience in Tarot will spot people and situations from the Major Arcana.",
