I haven't been in Ohia a day when Tiki the post office cat, meaner than a wolverine, brings a prize to my doorstep: a piece of the woman who had the job before me.\"This small Hawaii town has more factions than a mafia convention in Vegas, and I've got to find a killer with only a grumpy cat for backup.",
