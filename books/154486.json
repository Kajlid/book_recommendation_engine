  "title": "The Spitz Master: A Parisian Book of Hours",
  "description": "In new art-historical research, Gregory Clark places this manuscript's vivid, even witty, imagery in the turbulent context of Parisian culture around 1420. Clark also examines the book of hours in the context of medieval culture, the book trade in Paris, and the role of Paris as an international center of illumination. The Spitz Master: A Parisian Book of Hours is the first study devoted entirely to the manuscript and reproduces all the book's glowing miniatures in full color. It will serve as a lively introduction to the Spitz Hours for scholars and the general public alike.",
