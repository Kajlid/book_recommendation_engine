  "description": "Book two of The Sensor Series. Melena Sanders has managed to avoid all things inhuman for most of her life, but after coming to Fairbanks, Alaska to rescue her best friend from supernaturals she hasn't been allowed to leave. That is, until her long-time nemesis comes to collect a favor she owes him. Lucas might be half angel, but he's all bad as far as she's concerned. Paying him back might get her out of town for a while, but her new destination will be anything but enjoyable. Mel's got to help the nephilim take care of a demon possession outbreak in Juneau. Although something like this hasn't happened for thousands of years, Lucas is certain Melena's rare abilities are the key to solving the problem. With violence in the capital city growing, she's going to have to figure out how to stop it fast before the trouble spreads to other places. Not only that, but working closely with Lucas is changing the dynamics of their hate-hate relationship-worrying her even more than the demons. Getting back to her captivity in Fairbanks never looked so good.",
