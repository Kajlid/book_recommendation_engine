Frazier Jones takes us to a playground built by imagination, where mermaids ferry the dead to the the afterlife, a husband, long missing, returns as a cat and a vengeful spirit haunts a Pawnee, Oklahoma Walmart, much to the inconvenience of both customers and staff. Overflowing at times with heartbreak, humor and hope, Things We Thought We Saw in the Water will stay with the you long after you have placed the book aside.",
