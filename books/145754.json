  "description": "When the big man in Washington assigned Matt Helm to ride shotgun on an old buddy's top secret mission in Norway, Matt naturally wanted to know what was happening. \"They need an agent with a lethal reputation,\" said Mac. \"That's all you need to know.\" Matt hated these \"Need-to-know\" deals. But he went along with it until somebody murdered his partner--the girl who was supposed to be his \"mistress.\" Now Matt was mad. Mad enough to blow operation \"top secret\" sky high.
