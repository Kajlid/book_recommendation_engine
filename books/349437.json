She never says never, has her first orgasm, yearns for the everlasting. This is woman. You, me, the girl next door. We are all flesh and bone. An eclectic collection of lesbian erotica, the stories in Flesh and Bone are as individual as every woman. From the sweetest petals of romance to the thorny edges of desire, our stories are as individual as we are. Yet one theme remains constant and keeps us intertwined...we are all Flesh and Bone.",
