  "description": "I showed up in backwater little Yazoo City Mississippi expecting to find solitude and a fresh start. I just left my wealthy, neglectful husband--with a couple million dollars belonging to him, I might add. When I got to Yazoo, though, I didn't find any solitude, that's for sure. I ended up in the arms of an oh so sexy young man named Tre McNabb. The problem? Tre is the preacher's son.",
