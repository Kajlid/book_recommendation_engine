  "description": "Previously published as After the Hole.It was only supposed to be a bit of fun to round off the term. Rather than joining the geography field trip, a group of sixth-formers embark on what their charismatic mentor Martyn calls 'an experiment with real life'. They are locked in a forgotten, windowless cellar room below the deserted school. When the three days of the experiment are up, Martyn will return and release them.At first it's all a laugh, a game, a joke. But three days pass and Martyn does not come back. The experiment has only just begun...Now a major film.",
