  "description": "From the author of Hope Rising, comes a collection of more than twenty inspiring, true stories from the Ranch of Rescued Dreams, where horses and children help to heal each other. Hope is like the stars—always there, yet shining brightest in the blackest of nights. It is like the dawn, always rising anew. Hope is for everyone, and that includes you. This collection of more than twenty true stories unveils the heart of true strength and the character of genuine courage. Experience for yourself the kind of love and hope that change a person from the inside out. Because sometimes, just believing in someone is enough for them to start believing in themselves. It’s the galvanizing truth that no matter how deep your pain…God’s love exceeds it still.“During the darkest days I’d ever known, I was introduced to the unconditional love of a little horse and a merciful God, and my life has never been the same,” says author Kim Meeder. Her book proves that hope is not only for us to keep, but also to give because sometimes just believing in someone is enough for them to start believing in themselves.",
