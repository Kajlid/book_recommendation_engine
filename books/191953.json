  "description": "TWO OPPOSING HEARTS FIND DESIRE WHEN THEY LEAST EXPECT IT!As a devious plot swirls to overthrow the monarchy, Gwendolyn Rossiter, whose brother leads the fight to defend the Crown, finds her lively wit and outspoken nature largely ignored by the haut ton. With one exception: August Falcon, a devilishly handsome resistance conspirator. Yet the passion Gwendolyn inspires in him is more rage at her audacity than tenderness. And if she is even mildly fond of him, she conceals it admirably.But as riots in London escalate, and the League of Jewelled Men brings its fiendish machinations to the fore, Gwendolyn will suddenly find unexpected love in the arms of a man who swore he was immune to her charms. . . .",
