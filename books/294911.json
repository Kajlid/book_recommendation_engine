  "description": "Most girls dream of being swept off their feet by a handsome prince. I dream of killing one. For nearly a thousand years my people have suffered beneath the iron-fist of the Alchemists—discarded into the shadows of Ash Mountain. Banished. Forgotten. Until now. The king is dead, and the heir of House Thorn must marry to take the crown. As tradition dictates, twelve girls will be chosen to compete for Prince Decidan’s affection. Only one can be crowned queen. I must make certain that girl is me. No matter the cost. But to succeed I’ll have to guard more than just my heart from the advances of a Prince. You see, I have a secret. A deadly ability of my own that rivals even the most powerful of Alchemists—one that could save my people…or condemn them all. Lose yourself in a fairy-tale that is equal parts swoon-worthy, captivating, and fierce. The Choosing is everything you loved about The Selection, with all the intrigue and magic of A Court of Thornes and Roses. \nScroll up and One-Click today!",
