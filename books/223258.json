Yet the last place he expects to find a bride is in the backstreets of London in a rubbish heap. Isobel Hampton is running from a painful past…and a dangerous man who will stop at nothing until he finds her. A marriage of convenience with a sinfully handsome lord seems like the perfect solution, until Isobel realizes her husband wants much more from her than she is willing to give. Soon, the marriage that was supposed to be “all business” turns into a dangerous dance of seduction that could leave one or both of them with a broken heart. Originally published under the title The Marriage Bargain in 2000 - Seducing The Bride is a newly revised and updated edition.",
