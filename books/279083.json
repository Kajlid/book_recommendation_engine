  "description": "Ingenious, poignant, spicy, Marilyn returns. The body of Martin Montage is the conduit. She slides into his body. She spices up his mind. The day is one heralding event after another, unbalancing Martin, hours filled with activities and celebrity for the benefit of Marilyn's return.Marilyn Monroe needed corrections made in her synergistic life. She sought respect, and Martin Montage was the perfect dupe for posthumous symbiosis of the celebrated and always-present Marilyn Monroe.",
