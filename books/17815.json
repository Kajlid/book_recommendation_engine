Josh has a lot more to offer someone than he's ever been able to show. Ziggy's generosity and genuine affection allow Josh to express feelings and desires he's never shared with anyone before. The friendship begins one early morning in St. Louis when Ziggy rescues Josh from a couple of bad characters. When daylight approaches, Zig offers Josh a place to crash--and more: Ziggy proposes they share his little studio apartment and split the rent.
