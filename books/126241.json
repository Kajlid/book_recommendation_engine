  "description": "Socko Garrett is just an ordinary kid from the projects. Sure he doesn't have much in the way of prospects, but he never expects to be forced into the Watch. And it's all the fault of that red-haired woman. Now he has woken up in jail. Surely it can’t get any worse, can it? For Socko, no matter what happens, this is his first day… This is a spin-off novelette from the Flick Carter series, set in a post-apocalyptic 23rd Century England. There are characters common to both series, but no spoilers.10,800 words.",
