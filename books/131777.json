  "description": "Like his hometown, Malcolm is dying. Cancer. His passing will be slow and painful -- but the rest of the town is going to die with a smile. From deep within the woods come the spores of an infectious mold. Once breathed in, the body begins to shut down, while leaving the infected in a state of euphoria. Now Malcolm only hopes to survive just one more day, so that he may help keep his friends safe from the growing horde of the laughing damned. Opposing his efforts is the town physician Dr. Avery. Out of his depth, the good doctor turns to cruel methods as a way of saving the healthy from the sick. A battle of power and ideals begins between Malcolm and Dr. Avery as the community they both grew up in descends into madness. . .",
