  "description": "A standalone novel about two characters with very minor mentions in the earlier books. Ryder Wilson returned from serving multiple deployments but can't leave the hell of combat behind him. Frustrated and ashamed of his inability to function in the world as well as the veterans he served with, he retreated, choosing to engage only with those he trusted. When retired Master Sergeant Adam Montague sends him on a mission to protect his sister from some unknown danger, Ryder's days of hiding out may be over. Can he fulfill his mission without failing again? Megan Gallagher has two big-brother Marines bent on protecting her from the evils of the world, but she's tougher than they think. When her older brother sends Ryder, one of his recon Marines, to her doorstep in the wee hours one night following a break-in, she realizes he needs rescuing more than she does. A friendship forms quickly, but unexpected passions run hot and complicate her resolve never to have a romantic relationship, much less marriage. So why are her body and her heart betraying her every time he comes near? Can these two wounded people lower their defenses long enough to allow love to grow?The main characters in this book have appeared briefly in earlier Rescue Me Saga books, but this story can be read as a standalone novel and is a new entry point into this ongoing series. Megan and Ryder will appear in later books in the Rescue Me Saga.",
