  "description": "This isn't your everyday Beauty and the Beast story. Our love story was tragic, until it wasn't.... Once upon a time I fell in love with a beast. I fell fast, I fell hard, I loved him intensely and I trusted him completely - until he ripped my heart to shreds. Love isn't a fairy tale. It's messy. It's dirty. It's painful, and it's ugly. Until it's not.... This is Book 2 and the Final Book of the Beast & Beauty Devil's Blaze Duet. Book 1 Beast must be read first.",
