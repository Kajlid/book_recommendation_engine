  "description": "When you cross the world for a stranger, who knows where you might land?Justine has had it with Alex. What was once an exciting relationship of mutual discovery has become routine and argumentative. Alex has to go. Anything must be better than this, even solitude. Especially solitude. Justine loves solitude.However, as Justine settles back into her accustomed solitary lifestyle that has been interrupted for three years by her love for Alex, the 'anything' that turns up is not at all what she is expecting.As a hobbyist songwriter, she joins a social media site for musicians and meets loads of new and surprisingly talented people who share her passion for music and who are not averse to a bit of flirtation on the side, which is very exhilarating and entertaining in its way, but also a little surreal.The shock for Justine is that the person who ends up strumming her chords enough to rock her world is not some young male hunk but another woman, Molly, a classical violinist who lives in New York, far enough away for Justine in Australia to indulge her burgeoning wilder-side fantasies in relative safety.Yet when the beautiful and sensitive Molly offers to fund Justine's plane ticket to see if they can bring their exquisite affair blissfully down to earth in her Manhattan apartment, Justine cannot resist seizing a new world of opportunity, a whole world she has never considered playing in before.And new worlds can prove extremely challenging for na√Øve newcomers, as she is about to find out.",
