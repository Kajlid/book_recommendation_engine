  "description": "As provocative as Michael Crichton’s State of Fear, Juris Jurjevics’s enthralling debut delivers a combustive blend of politics, military might, and environmental catastrophe. In The Trudeau Vector, three scientists die inexplicably, and their colleagues at a lavish research station in the high Arctic are terrified. Epidemiologist Dr. Jessica Hanley is summoned from Los Angeles to investigate the grisly deaths and seal off the facility if the killer is infectious, while in Moscow an admiral is assigned with rescuing a rogue Russian submarine. Seemingly unrelated, the two missions collide in this terrifyingly convincing thriller of international intrigue and desperate passions that threaten a scientific utopia with extinction.",
