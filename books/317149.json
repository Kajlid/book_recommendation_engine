  "description": "Alice always believed her life was ordinary. She's devoted, a good girl who has always done what was right. Until the day she inherited a mysterious family heirloom from a father she never knew. An heirloom that is the key to unleashing the unfathomable magical properties hidden within Alice's blood. Powers she knew nothing about and can scarcely comprehend. With the appearance of two strangers claiming to be warlocks, the unravelling of years-old secrets and misrepresented bloodlines begins. Luke will stop at nothing to gain the right to rule, even if it means manipulating Alice and her newfound powers for his own gain. The only thing stopping him from achieving his throne is the one thing with which his powers cannot seem to help. He must learn to love. Dimitri would do anything for Alice. He owes a debt to her family that can never be repaid, but falling for Alice was not how he planned to repay it. Can Alice come to terms with who she has become? Will she learn who to trust before it is too late? Heirdom is a fantastical tale steeped in magic and action. At its core, it is a story of discovering love, the value of friendship, and the sacrifices people make for those they care about. \"It feels like he's always in my head, whether he's speaking to me or not, just sitting in the shadows of my mind, silently watching me.\" \"There were so many layers to him. I wondered if the ones that stirred madness would someday consume those that sought to be good.\"",
