  "description": "For some, first love is a fleeting spark heralding the greater loves to come. For others, first love is the greatest love. The only love. When a music audition at the world-renowned LaGuardia Arts high school brings together two thirteen-year-olds, unassuming Aurelia Ramirez Preston and confident Chadwick David, the serendipitous encounter becomes an unbreakable friendship. A friendship develops into an unyielding love. A love spanning decades and continents. With New York City as their playground, best friends Chad and Aurelia navigate the turbulence of adolescence. They blossom, and so does their love. An awkward first date turns into a night of intoxicating kisses and together, they lose their innocence. Years later, Chad is \"Maestro,\" the tattooed virtuoso, the James Dean of classical music. And Aurelia is an accomplished cellist. His muse. The enduring love behind his greatness. But when the maestro falters, even for a moment, the most beautiful symphony can spiral into unrelenting chaos. And the greatest of loves can become the most tragic heartbreak. Maestro is a symphony of words, four movements filled with longing, secrets, betrayal, and the grace of forgiveness.",
