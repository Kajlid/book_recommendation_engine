  "description": "For most of his life 17-year-old Declan Storm has been a good guyâ€”he does his homework, takes a stand against bullies, and he is still mourning the sudden death of his father. But lately it seems like he is on a losing streak and everyone wants a piece of him, including the cops. Sure, he's a hothead. A bit of a ladies man. Now the secret supernatural containment agency needs him. It is a dangerous job and no one can ever know his real identity. Good thing it was erased.Despite grueling training, Declan is unprepared for the challenge of his first mission as he uncovers a murderous entity's sinister plot to become powerful and indestructible at any cost. Being an operative is more than he bargained for. Chasing danger and shady suspects is a cakewalk, yet dodging sharp fangs and jumping from windows to stay alive? Not so easy. Near his breaking point, he's ready to walk away from the mission, but that means letting down his teammates. And letting down his teammates means watching as a town and its population is defenseless against total annihilation. The adventure has just begun.",
