  "description": "﻿﻿For all fifteen years of her life, Pauline de Pamiers has witnessed an attack on her family, friends, and faith. It's the early thirteenth century and the Pope and King of France are conducting a Crusade against the Cathars; the only crusade on European soil and against another Christian sect. As a member of this sect in France that sits outside the dominant Roman Church, Pauline is an outsider: young, but independent and bold.Seeking to escape the fate of her countrymen, she chooses the most unlikely path to safety and, ultimately, survival over martyrdom. She forms a bond with one of the crusaders, young knight Simon de Montfort, who sees something special in this outspoken girl who refuses to submit to a society where women are not treated equally to men. Together, they travel to England, where she helps the French knight obtain an English title and stand head and shoulders above other noblemen for his integrity, bravery, and concern for those who have the least.With the Church and men and women of the kingdom under threat, they must overcome the narcissistic king and a challenge against their unique love in order to change the course of their lives, and the history of England.The Girl and the Sword is a sweeping saga that will change minds about the role of women in history, and leave the reader feeling the spiritual power of love.",
