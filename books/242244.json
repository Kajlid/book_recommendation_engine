  "description": "The great fire of 1835 burned most of New York City’s wooden downtown and, like many others, Archie Prescott thinks he’s lost all that’s dear to him. His home is a smoldering ruin and his wife is dead--and next to her body is a child’s corpse he assumes was his daughter. It seems as though it’s the end of everything...But it is only the beginning. In the midst of ancient magic, murderous conspiracies, and a crafty Mesoamerican demon-god who is plotting the end of humanity, Archie finds himself with the power to save the world—or drown it in sacrificial blood.",
