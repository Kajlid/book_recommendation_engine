  "description": "It began with a rose and the girl nobody else could see. Her eyes follow Tom wherever he goes. Watching. Waiting. She surrounds him. She haunts him. She is poison and she will hurt him. So...why can't anybody else see her? Even when she's standing right in front of them? Reality turns against Tom as he clings to shreds of his sanity, knowing she's real. She isn't in his head. He isn't...crazy. With time slipping away from him, the battle between the unseen girl and the voice of reason is a dangerous one Tom can never win. He has too much to lose and the fallout will be catastrophic. As the battle commences, he must overcome the cruel voices clawing at the back of his mind, whispering in agreement with those around him that he is rapidly falling into madness. Who do you trust when your own mind rebels against you?",
