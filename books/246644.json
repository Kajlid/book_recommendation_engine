  "description": "She’s in a white dress that dances around her ankles, and her hair tumbles in a long sheet of curls down her back. A veil covers her beautiful eyes, and she smiles directly at him. Janie is everything Rafe’s ever imagined she would be on her wedding day.  Breathtaking. Gorgeous. Perfect.  The moment he sees her walking down the aisle towards him, he knows that she’s the one.  Then she passes him, making her way to the man she’s to marry.  A man that wasn’t him.  A man that he knows with one hundred percent certainty isn’t good enough for her.  It seems that her father isn’t the only one who’s having a hard time giving her away. Rafe only wishes he knew why.  Everything about Janie sparks protective instincts he doesn’t feel for anyone, not even his own fiancé.  What he feels for the bride, however, isn’t merely a simple attraction. He knows that something is there just beneath the surface…if only he could reach it.  It has to be something huge, too, otherwise he wouldn’t be drinking whiskey straight from the flask in a church pew and wondering how many years he would do in prison if he shot the groom in front of about a hundred witnesses—half of those being cops.  He was good…but not that good.  A near-death experience cost Rafe almost six months of his memory, but right now he can’t help but feel like a huge mistake is being made on both of their parts. One that’s going to cost him everything.  Then she says I do.",
