  "description": "With magic banned, one chanter has a spell that could change everything …  Winnie Durham just wants to make an honest living selling magical items at her beloved store, Charmed, so she can afford to take care of her mother. But when Resolution 84 outlaws magic, Winnie must find a new way to make a living—and fast.  Caught between the law, her mother’s escalating medical bills, and a vow to never deal in the dark magic of the Sable trade, Winnie is given an opportunity that's too good to refuse...and hurled into a world that puts her at odds with everything she thought she stood for.  Can Winnie stay ahead of the law long enough to discover the real reason magic was banned?",
