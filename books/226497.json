  "description": "Will love strike twice? After losing the woman he loves to his brother and experiencing unspeakable trauma, Daniel Lone Wolf leaves Chance City to escape the constant reminders of his tumultuous past. However, the clouds of pain follow him no matter where he goes. Meeting sweet, beautiful Annie Devlin is like being struck by a lightning bolt from out of the blue, and Daniel is instantly drawn to her goodness and kind heart. She’s full of pluck and surprises—like the fact that she’s raising her nephew and nieces on her own. He might not wear shining armor, but Daniel is Annie’s knight in buckskin and moccasins. The tall, blue-eyed Comanche comes along when she most needs a miracle. He’s irresistible and breezes into her world with the force of a summer storm, bringing a tempest of passion with him. When Daniel’s famous reckless nature lands him—and Annie—in hot water, there’s only one thing to do: take her and the kids and go home to Chance City. Having Annie and the children in Daniel’s life is a godsend and things are looking up for all of them until his past finally catches up to him. Can Daniel and Annie cling to their hope for a happy future, or will the raging storm forever separate them?",
