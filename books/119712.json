  "description": "\"A genuine religious sensibility informs these poems, animated not by allegiance to doctrines, rituals, or commands, but rather by a sense of mystery.... If you read only one book of poems this year, make it this one.\" --Philadelphia Inquirer, Frank Wilson\"The Apparitioners is George Witte's first book of poetry, but you would never guess it from his confident, ironic style, which moves easily from colloquial speech-rhythms to rich natural description....Like a Frost of the suburbs, Mr. Witte regards the cozy, domesticated landscape he inhabits with an unsettling lucidity, which gives everything he sees the aspect of a parable or a warning....Anyone who has felt intimations of mortality in our American abundance will recognize the power of Mr. Witte's poems.\" --New York Sun, Adam KirschThe poems of The Apparitioners explore the boundaries between us and the world we have colonized, where we find ourselves unsettled by some mystery that cannot be owned. A father tries to calm his daughter, who is troubled by night visitors after a schoolmate is carried away. Having purchased his ideal home in a planned development, a man confronts past ghosts and his own doubts about belonging. And a woman nearly killed by stroke struggles to recover her place in her family and community, but finds welcome from a surprising host. Longer narratives alternate with lyrics that through close observation seek out the natural world, a presence that on occasion offers us a glimpse of purpose. Moving between poles of assurance and unease, secrecy and revelation, The Apparitioners is a noteworthy debut.",
