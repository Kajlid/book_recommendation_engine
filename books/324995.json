  "description": "My mates are the only people I can trust. Even my grandfather has to earn the loyalty he wants. But heâ€™s right about us needing to get away from it all, some familiar faces from my mates' past give us a place to lay low and regroup. Yet our group has never been more divided. Hopefully a nice holiday in the snowy alps is just what the doctor ordered. Nope. The doctor ordered a heavy dose of antipsychotics, and with the voices getting louder, I need to decide if I want to silence them. This is book 4 in the PHoenix ShiftARS, origionally published as Slay Bells, now a full length 70k novel. While this book is based over the Christmas period, it is part of the series, which must be read in order. This book is for over 18s due to scenes of a graphic nature, and dealing with mental health issues.",
