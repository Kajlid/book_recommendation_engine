  "description": "\"To think it all happened because a demon got drunk.\"From the very first line of The Savvy Demon's Guide to Godly Living, readers will know they're about to experience something very unique. What follows is an epic, satirical novel that will leave readers crying, laughing and considering what it really means to deny yourself, pick up your cross and follow Jesus Christ.Melchior thought that life as a fallen angel would be great, full of deception, trickery and temptation. He had no idea he would be bored out of his mind, but the church he's assigned to makes such little impact for the Kingdom of God that he never has anything to do. While getting plastered at a local New Jersey dive, he gets the idea to pay a drunken visit to the pastor of Compton Baptist Church to tell him exactly what he's doing wrong. Melchior's visit opens the eyes of Rev. Doug Pinkerton to what it truly means to give everything to follow Christâ€”and Compton, New Jersey will never be the same again.Please note: This book is intended for mature audiences. It is absolutely written to glorify God, but it deals with people at all stages of faith. Sometimes their language and behavior are sinful. The Narrator makes every attempt to censor naughty words, but characters in this book who are far from God act and speak in a manner consistent with the darkness in their lives. But don't worry. When the Light comes, the darkness will not be able to stand.",
