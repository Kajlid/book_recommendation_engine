  "description": "Adult Divergent fans will love this smart, near-future speculative, thrill-packed romance!My name is Thessaly, and at 22, I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. Living with my parents, going to college, and hanging out with friends is pretty much the extent of my mediocre life. The biggest drama I have going on with me is fighting a growing attraction toward my best friend Bram. Oh and avoiding needles--specifically ones that draw my blood. See, on January 27, 2044, the DNA Networking Act was set into action. This new law provides those in authority to gather genetic information from citizens in an effort to achieve nationwide resistance to diseases and other weaknesses. Sounds promising, right? Maybe. But to me, it infringes on a person's freedom. The act prohibits citizens from declining to undergo genetic testing when summoned, and the deadline for everyone to voluntarily submit a DNA sample is fast approaching. I'm avoiding the process as long as possible. Until one night the unthinkable I'm ruthlessly abducted. Bleeding is no longer voluntary... it's a requirement. And as it turns out, the four guys who captured me aren't anything like I expected.Full-length, soft Sci-Fi Reverse Harem Romance with a speculative spin on fated mates and a corrupt government hellbent on keeping them separated.",
