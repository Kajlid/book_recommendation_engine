Falc unexpectedly bonds with the quirky community of fisher-people, including a chainsaw-obsessed ice sculptor and Aiyanna, a tobogganing-daredevil from school. But when new friends and family all vanish, Falc and Aiyanna must begin a desperate quest for survival, plunging after the community into a frigid labyrinth of mystifying ice fishing hole portals… the domains of a terrifying presence and lurking secrets.",
