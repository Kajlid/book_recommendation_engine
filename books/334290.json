  "description": "The Art of Love is by Kelley Nyrae. Monique Brenner has had her eye on the beautiful Maori art of Tane Koti. When her art gallery finally gains a little bit of clout on the Seattle art scene, she contacts him with an interest to buy some of his pieces. What she doesn't expect is the overwhelming attraction she feels toward the mysteriously, sexy man behind the art. Her gallery means everything to her which means she has to be professional. That means hanky panky is out of the question! But when Tane asks her to accompany him to a local art show, Monique throws caution to the wind. The allure of Tane Koti is too powerful to ignore and a girl can be only so strong in the fact of such attractive opposition. We'll Always Have Paris is by Mandessa Selby. Two unlikely lovers meet on the eve of the Nazi occupation of France. Daughter of two American ex-patriots, Delilah Simmons is the featured performer at the hot Parisian nightspot, The Indigo Club. The bastard son of a French aristocrat and his Vietnamese mistress, Jean Phillipe Dao, arrives at the club and is promptly enchanted with the beautiful Delilah. But clouds of war hang over them, as the Nazi army marches into Paris. Can the two lovers confront their differences, their passions, and their loyalties?",
