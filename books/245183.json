  "description": "Atherleah grew up in the gang-controlled suburbs of Brisbane at the end of the twenty-first century. From the age of six, she decided that she wanted more, and with the help of her local gang-leader, Leah learned the skills to escape a life of mediocrity. On her sixteenth birthday, she was inadvertently implanted with a Neural Enhancement Chip instead of the free Government provided basic level chip. This mistake removed the limits placed on the AI that was uploaded, broke some of the Government controls and began making changes to Leah's body. Leah’s life rapidly becomes a battle, both in the virtual-multiverse and in real life. On the advice of the local ‘boss’, Leah began playing the virtual fantasy game Dunyanin to earn the money she needed to live and to help with her education. In 'Nascent' Leah, with the help of her rapidly evolving AI, thwarted attempts by the government to limit her and she evaded kidnapping by virtual slavers. Co-opted by several Virtual Security AI, Leah helped shut down a virtual sweat-shop which used mind-controlled players to farm for resources. In 'Odyssey' Leah was coerced to meet the Matriarch of the crime family. Leah steals a spaceship which holds secrets the Matriarch desperately wants returned. While Leah evades her pursuers she finds the time to start a business, apply to college, earn a title in the Elven kingdom, become a landholder, visit both heaven and hell, and fall in love. 'Change' starts with Leah in her manor house which just happens to be the home of a clan of vampires she's befriended. She needs to continue her journey for she has quests to complete.",
