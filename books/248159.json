  "description": "When I put up a \nROOMMATE WANTED\n poster, he was the last person on earth I thought would respond.He was also the last person on earth I'd agree to let live with me...on purpose.But, here we are⁠—roommates. I'm certain we can coexist without it being awkward, and I'm determined to make it work. There will be no sexual tension building with each accidental touch, no flutters when he wears that stupid backward baseball cap, and definitely no flirting when we text back and forth.Caleb Mills can't be the guy for me. He's my best friend's ex-boyfriend.And that would be wrong...right?",
