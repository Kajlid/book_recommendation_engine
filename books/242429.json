  "description": "Sorrow indeed turns to joy as Ekundayo a young student at State University pays a visit to the Dean. He seeks help from Dean Porter to “fix” his failing grades before his Nigerian Mother arrives for visit, and he has to face her disappointment and scolding.Ekundayo has been doing everything a young man might do when he first arrives at college—everything but study. He hangs out with his “boys”, drinks too much and chases “shorties.”Dean Porter knows just what this young man needs. Ekundayo spends an afternoon bent over the Dean’s desk and is grateful for the experience.Excerpt“My sorrow has turned to joy.” Dean Porter sighed as he recited the meaning of my name. I was impressed that he knew what my name meant. He then sat upright and looked right into my eyes. This time his sexy gray eyes had me very excited. I looked out the window to try and focus on something else. Some of my boys passed by the Dean’s office bouncing a basketball as they headed to the gym—shorts sagging around their waists. I wished I was with them.",
