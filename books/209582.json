  "description": "Douglas Adams' holistic detective Dirk Gently has his first two comic book adventures collected here. Containing two stand-alone series, enjoy A Spoon Too Short and   The Interconnectedness of All Kings . But that's not all! Also includes bonus material showing a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the DIRK GENTLY TV show.In A Spoon Too Short,  Dirk finds himself investigating a bizarre case of poaching, dumbstruck tourists, and the inner membranes of a rhinoceros’ nose.In The Interconnectedness of All Kings,  Dirk has been forced to leave his beloved England behind, coming to the too-sunny, too-cheery, and altogether too-bizarre-even-for-Dirk city of San Diego, California, where he gets embroiled in three separate (or are they?) cases involving reincarnated Egyptians, golden cell phones, and copycat killers. All this in a new town seemingly incapable of making even a single proper cup of tea.",
