That's where he met Weatherby Stein, the scion to one of the greatest occult families of Europe. Weatherby and his parents were being held prisoner by the Nazis, forced to use their supernatural knowledge to aid the Third Reich's war effort.Morton Candle got Weatherby to safety, but the kid's parents didn't make it.Now it's the 1950s.Weatherby's a teenager, with his father's knowledge and a chip on his shoulder from the indignities of the modern world. Morton bumps into him again and they decide to go into the only business they can - paranormal private detectives.This time, Weatherby and Mort have cases that will take them from a vampire's decaying mansion to the mob-controlled streets of Havana. They'll take on roadside attractions gone wrong, hordes of the living dead, and ride against the devil in a high speed car race to the death.Between them, Weatherby and Mort have a small arsenal and a deep knowledge of matters arcane and bizarre. They'll need brains and brawn to survive in a world where horror, action and hardboiled noir come together in a cataclysmic mix.",
