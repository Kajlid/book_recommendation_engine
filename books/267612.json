  "description": "Don't ever tell. Three simple words Genevieve lives by. The doctors never believed her, or her sister, they just locked her up in Bethlem mental hospital and said she was making it up. Now, 18 and free, she must find her way in a cold, dark London that is full of other peoples bad memories. Can she embrace her powers and see the good before it sends her back to Bethlem hospital? Will she stop praying to be cured of this, but rather to have the strength to bear it? will she ever say \"gift\" and not \"curse\"? will she be able to save her city for the human and non-human evils that plague it? 06/2019",
