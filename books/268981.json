  "description": "After years of living the life of a high-class fetish escort, Clarice wants to serve as a committed slave to her master. She knows this will alter her life dramatically, but has few ideas how far her new Master will go. Before arriving in New York, Clarice began her transformation under the strict hands of her two best friends, Abby and Sandra. When she finally arrived in New York, she was hardly recognizable, though beautiful. Master was impressed with her friends' work and introduced Clarice to the next stage of her transformation. Clarice had always dreamed of one day finding a way to become one with her latex skin that she was now wearing almost permanently. Enduring rough bondage and discipline sessions only made her erotic allure stronger. Master knew she was ready for the next step. Once the transformation had begun, there was no turning back. Clarice had to learn to live in a constant state of arousal. This would become her strongest weapon.",
