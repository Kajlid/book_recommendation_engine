  "title": "Rebels on the Rio Grande: The Civil War Journals of A.B. Peticolas",
  "description": "The 1862 Confederate invasion of New Mexico is a little known episode of Civil War history. In the Journal of A. B. Peticolas, however, the experiences of the Sibley Brigade come to life, beginning on 21 February 1862, the morning of the battle of Valverde, the first and largest Civil War battle in New Mexico, and ending with the company's marching back to Texas on 15 June 1862. The author has consulted every known journal, diary and memoir by both Confederate and Federal participants, so the journal is extensively annotated.",
