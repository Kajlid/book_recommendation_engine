  "description": "From USA Today Bestselling Author K Webster, comes a dark, paranormal prison reverse harem romance standalone novel!  I’ve been wrongfully accused. Sure, everyone sent to prison says that. It’s true, though. I’m not who they say I am. Dark. Evil. An abomination. The worst of the worst.  They sent me to the deepest, most awful catacombs of Nightmare Penitentiary. It’s where they put all their secrets they don’t want anyone in the world—both human and paranormal—to know about. I’m left to be forgotten and waste away until the day I die.  And I’m not alone.  I’m there with others. Others who are worse than me. Terrifying. Horrible. Monsters. Four demons in particular who seem to wake from their evil slumber the moment I enter their presence.  They want me. All four of them.  I’m not sure what they plan on doing once they get their hands on me. But one thing’s for sure…  It won’t be good.",
