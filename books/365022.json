  "description": "Plain Kate lives in a world of superstitions and curses, where a song can heal a wound and a shadow can work deep magic. As the wood-carver's daughter, Kate held a carving knife before a spoon, and her wooden charms are so fine that some even call her \"witch-blade\" -- a dangerous nickname in a town where witches are hunted and burned in the square.",
