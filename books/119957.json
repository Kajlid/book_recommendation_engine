  "description": "Adjusting hasn't been easy for Kyla in her new life as a werewolf. After a nearly catastrophic loss of control, her and Camille decide to get help from the Pack in Oregon. The girls soon learn that human kidnappings have been on the rise, and Otherworld overseers from the Supernatural Council think that whatever is committing the crimes might be coming for the Pack next. Even with the help of a potential ally in a clan of vampires, the Pack can't determine why they've been targeted. It's a race against time as the abductions get closer and closer to home. And when Camille and Kyla find themselves at the center of the turmoil, they discover just how vast and dangerous their supernatural world really is.",
