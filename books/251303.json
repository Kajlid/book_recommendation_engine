  "description": "If college taught me anything, it wasn't this! The name Melanie Brooks was meant to be credited beneath a riveting story, unveiling secrets that shock the world and delivering them to the public with savage grace! That name should not, however, be associated with, personal assistant. Maybe my new boss, the ever inscrutable and darkly handsome billionaire, Jackson Braun, might have some stories to share, while we cross the Atlantic on his mega yacht! Who knows, I might be able to finally get this stagnating journalism career going, if not something a little more salacious. That is, if his vindictive business coordinator Veronica doesn't throw me overboard first! And she's not the only one who gives me the shivers, as another starts eyeing me with dark thoughts of his own. As for stories, I'm hoping I can make my own with Jackson...one that won't go in the papers!***This is a novella with a Happy For Now endingPart 1 of The Maiden's Voyage Trilogy",
