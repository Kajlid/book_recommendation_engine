  "title": "In Search of Amrit Kaur: A Lost Princess and Her Vanished World",
  "description": "As she builds her own life anew, an Italian journalist embarks on an all-consuming search for the true story of the mysterious princess H. H. Amrit Kaur of Mandi--her disappearance from India, her persecution by the Nazis, and her search for freedom at any cost. On a sweltering day in 2007, having just lost her brother to illness, Livia Manera Sambuy finds herself standing before a 1924 photograph of a stunningly elegant Indian princess at a museum in Mumbai. What's written in the caption will change her life forever. This gorgeous Punjabi princess, it's said, sold her jewels in occupied Paris to save Jewish lives, only to be arrested by the Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp, where she died within a year.Could it be true? And if so, how could such a sensational story have gone unnoticed? Instinctively, almost viscerally, Manera becomes entangled in the mystery, losing herself in the history of the British Raj, in the diamonds and sapphires of the twentieth-century aristocracy, in the Circus Balls and Jubilees, and in the lives of extraordinary figures such as the Maharaja Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala, the Jewish banker Albert Kahn, and the Russian explorer Nicholas Roerich--all in a decades-long pursuit of the elusive Amrit Kaur.When she rendezvouses with the princess's eighty-year-old daughter, Manera's search takes on a new dimension, as she strives to reconnect an orphan with the mother who abandoned her in 1933, leaving behind her two children, her raja husband, and a legacy of activism in India's women's civil rights movement.In Search of Amrit Kaur is an engrossing detective story, a kaleidoscopic history lesson, and a moving portrait of women, across the century, seeking personal freedom.",
