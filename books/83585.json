So when Meredith comes to visit, the two mystery buffs put their heads together to sleuth out the truth about a real-life murder.Claire's star author, the ferociously flirtatious Blanche Dubois, is found dead after eating a poisoned apple and there's no shortage of suspects. Many were jealous of her success, and many put off by her haughty, demanding demeanor. With the help of a detective, Claire and Meredith question Blanche's friends, colleagues, and relatives—and discover that even in the Big Apple, the world of murder is a very small world indeed.",
