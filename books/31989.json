That's because on Tuesdays the Castle adds a new room, a turret, or sometimes even an entire wing. No one ever knows what the Castle will do next, and no one-other than Celie, that is-takes the time to map out the new additions. But when King and Queen Glower are ambushed and their fate is unknown, it's up to Celie, with her secret knowledge of the castle's never-ending twists and turns, to protect their home and save their kingdom.Don't miss these other stories from New York Times bestselling author Jessica Day The Rose Legacy seriesThe Rose LegacyTuesdays at the Castle seriesTuesdays at the CastleWednesdays in the TowerThursdays with the CrownFridays with the WizardsSaturdays at SeaDragon Slippers seriesDragon SlippersDragon FlightDragon SpearThe Twelve Dancing Princesses seriesPrincess of the Midnight BallPrincess of GlassPrincess of the Silver WoodsSun and Moon, Ice and SnowSilver in the Blood",
