  "title": "The Negotiator",
  "description": "Ben Lopez spends his life travelling the world, bartering with people who value money over life. Working for governments, law enforcement agencies, multinational corporations and private clients, Ben is an expert K&R (Kidnap and Ransom) consultant, supplying professional kidnap-negotiation services. He can be called out to anywhere in the world within 24 hours notice to set up and command the negotiator's cell, bargaining with religious fanatics, hardened criminals, and other desperate people in order to save the lives of their captives. Alongside a shadowy team of former spies and special operatives, his arsenal of psychological techniques are just as powerful as brute force. He'll spend as long as is necessary to get the job done. And then he'll disappear. This extraordinary book reads like a thriller - but for those involved in the stories within it, the drama, and the tension, is very real.",
