  "title": "How to Choose a Husband: And Make Peace With Marriage",
  "description": "It's been forty years since the sexual revolution, and the women of America have everything they want. Everything, that is, except a husband. Women may be schooled in the art of sex, but they have failed in the art of love. In How to Choose a Husband , social critic and best-selling author Suzanne Venker says American women need a detox. If they want to be happy, or just plain satisfied, they must do a 180 when it comes to their attitude toward sex, courtship, and married life. If they do, marriageable men will reappear â€“ and women will find the love that eludes them.",
