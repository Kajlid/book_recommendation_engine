  "description": "A college football panty challenge changed my life forever.When I was young, I believed my Pop Pop’s stories about love at first sight. Now I’m older and know better. Until she walked in. She’s everything I didn’t know I wanted. I won her panties, now I want her heart.But she’s not mine to claim.Someone close--since childhood--has already called dibs. And I can’t compete with that. I couldn’t let someone else lose the love of their life.Yet without her, I’ll never be the same.Hard Pass is part of the steamy F*** On The Field series and the first book in the More Family Dynasty series where the men and women know who they want and aren’t afraid to go after it.",
