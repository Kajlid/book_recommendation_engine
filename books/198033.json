  "title": "Stone Age Economics",
  "description": "Ambitiously tackling the nature of economic life and how to study it comparatively, Stone Age Economics includes six studies that reflect the author's ideas on revising traditional views of hunter-gatherer and so-called primitive societies, revealing them to be the original affluent society. When it was originally published in 1974, E. Evans-Pritchard of the Times Literary Supplement noted that this classic study of anthropological economics \"is rich in factual evidence and in ideas, so rich that a brief review cannot do it justice; only another book could do that.\"",
