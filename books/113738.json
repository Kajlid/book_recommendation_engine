  "description": "On a whim, as if by magic, Devane came to Chicago in the dead of winter. What she finds in the windy city alters her life for eternity. Vampire Nikolai Volkov, thought heâ€™d killed his demonic tormentor. To exorcise his memory of her, he commissioned Leonardo da Vinci to paint her portrait. His attempt to destroy her failed, and she hid her essence in a crack in her own portrait. Leonardo da Vinci, the consummate professional, painted over the split in the wooden plank, and ensnared her in the painting. Mona Lisa was trapped. Undetected, no longer corporeal, but pure energy, the evil spirit imprisoned for centuries, obsessed by the vampire she turned, gains strength and plots her ultimate revenge. Now living in the twenty-first century, Nikolai knows she seeks escape. He must at all cost, protect Devane Redding from the ancient demon, who wants to possess him once again, and destroy his only chance at happiness with the sculptor he loves above all. Will he succeed in keeping his hard earned freedom? Can he destroy the demon before she destroys his life, and kills the one woman who matters? Will he even recognize the new corporeal entity that holds her energy?",
