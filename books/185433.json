  "title": "Pushkin House",
  "description": "No other contemporary novel provides such clear insight into the Russian mind and way of life as Andrei Bitov's Pushkin House . First published in the United States in 1987 and highly praised for its inventiveness, Pushkin House is a contemporary literary masterpiece. Though the novel's focus is a love affair between Lyova and Faina, the novel's true subject is an investigation of the corruption of Soviet intellectual life and history. Working within many of the confines imposed upon him during the Soviet regime, Bitov ingeniously draws upon Russian literary models, especially that of Nabokov, in order to parody and satirize the stifling society about him, as well as Russian literary tradition.",
