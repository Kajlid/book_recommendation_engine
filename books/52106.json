  "description": "Barbara Baker?s big, boisterous family of bears is back in a new easy-to-read book about a special evening. The busy Saturday has made the two big bears and the four children tired. Or maybe not. In six chapters?one for each family member?they have quite a time of it as everyone gets ready for bed. Warm, simple text and cozy pictures show how much fun it is to be yourself and be part of a big family.",
