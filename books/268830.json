Losing faith in his talent, tired of being broke and sexually confused, he fears another year may slip by in a haze of surfing, beer, and thwarted ambition. All that changes, however, when Rick Stradman, the charming but neurotic son of a Hollywood movie producer, offers a solution to his financial problems by renting a room in his beach house. Despite initial friction during their summer share, Alex is gradually seduced by Rick's madcap world of movie stars, Bel Air mansions and, despite fighting their growing attraction, by Rick himself.
