  "description": "“Until they broke my legs no one could run faster than me. Thanks to my amazing speed, I won races, eluded street gangs and bullies, and also managed to grab and run, to steal. I was proud of my running but not of stealing. I especially hated being called a thief and the son of a thief, but that was the truth.”Janek Wolf is an injured, angry, petty thief. When he arrives to Janusz Korczak’s orphanage, he gets a once in a lifetime chance to change his destiny. It is a place managed by the children, and their society is based on friendship, solidarity, and justice. Will they accept him? Can he break his street life habits and become one of them? And could he possibly find a new dream?Janusz Korczak, an educator, pediatrician, writer, and champion of children's rights, established a democratic orphanage for Jewish children in Warsaw, Poland, 1912. It was managed by the children. They were judges in its court, writers in its newspaper and helpers in the kitchen and yard. For 30 years it was a loving home for hundreds of children. They called it “A Garden of Eden for kids.”",
