  "description": "London, 1888. A serial killer is butchering women on the streets of Whitechapel. 26-year-old Cate Kingsley is renowned as ‘The Remover’, so-called for her unique ability to erase unwanted memories via hypnotism. When her cousin Lottie becomes Jack the Ripper’s latest victim, Cate finds herself hired by the Metropolitan Police to help catch their man by hypnotizing witnesses in a bid to source clues to the killer’s next moves. Reunited with her younger sister Emmeline, Cate is anxious to keep the detectives at a distance in case they uncover some dark family secrets. But Emmeline seems different – a little too blasé about Lottie’s death and much too keen on ransacking Cate’s home. Cate fears Emmy is working as a prostitute in the Ripper's haunts, but do her sister's secrets run deeper than she’s letting on? As the death toll grows on London’s streets, Emmeline vanishes. Ever protective, Cate ups her game and employs a rival hypnotist, Lupin, as her teacher. She is getting closer to finding her sister and revealing the Ripper, but is Lupin helping her or hypnotizing her? Why can’t she remember the letters she burned? And what was Emmeline hunting for before she disappeared? For anyone who adored the TV series RIPPER STREET, who loved the twists and turns of BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP, and who relished the portraits of Victorian London in THE CRIMSON PETAL AND THE WHITE - THE HYPNOTIST is a roller-coaster ride through psychological riddles that readers will find impossible to put down.",
