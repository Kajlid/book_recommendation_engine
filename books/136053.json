  "description": "1283 A.D. - Edward I is in the midst of his campaign to tame the Welsh, but rising from the chaos is a Welsh knight known as the Serpent. Bhrodi ap Gaerwen de Shera is a warrior of tremendous range and power. Descended from the kings of Anglesey on his mother's side and the earls of Coventry on his father's, Bhrodi is in the unique position of having Welsh royalty and English nobility. Edward knows he must make an alliance with de Shera. With that in mind, Edward calls upon the mightiest warrior of the north, the legendary William de Wolfe, to pledge one of his daughters to de Shera. William is honored by the king's calling; he pledges his youngest daughter, Lady Penelope Adalira de Wolfe, to be the Serpent's bride. But the Lady Penelope is no ordinary woman; raised by knights, she has been trained by the best and, in spite of her mother's protests, she fights like a knight. Exquisitely beautiful with dark hair and hazel eyes, she is an unearthly beauty and a fine legacy for the mighty de Wolfe. But Penelope has no desire to be a bartered bride and she resists the king's directive, but her reluctance is futile. Join Bhrodi and Penelope as they journey through a world where the greed of men breeds great hatred yet great valor. When Bhrodi is injured in a skirmish, Penelope steps in for her husband to lead the Serpent's men against the hated English and realizes she must face her own father on the battlefield. Will Penelope survive The Wolfe? Or will The Serpent's strike become her very own, conquering those she loves?",
