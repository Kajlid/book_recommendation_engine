  "description": "Two strangers in the middle of nowhere, trapped by a blizzard, learn that a week in the snow can be scorching hot.Rebecca is from hot, sunny Miami. When she drives up north in her little convertible to meet a man she met over the Internet, she doesn’t anticipate the Iowa snowstorms. It’s her first time driving in snow and it doesn’t end well – Rebecca winds up on the side of the road with little gas, no cell phone signal and snow drifts piling higher by the minute.The roaring black snowmobile that comes along is carrying Richard, a man who lives a few miles down the road and just happens to see the flashy red paint of Rebecca’s stranded car through the haze of snow. Stuck at Richard’s house for almost a week, Rebecca feels trapped by circumstance. But soon she stops lamenting her position and instead starts to wonder about Richard’s bedroom down the hall, about the reasons he lives alone in the middle of nowhere, and whether she really wants to leave at all.",
