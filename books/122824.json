  "description": "Turns out there are monsters in the world, and I am not talking about the kind that eat pizza with a knife and fork. For over 40 years, I never knew of the demons that lurk among us. One foggy night, everything changed as I witnessed strange creatures emerge from a sewer to attack. Horrible monsters that only I could see. As if almost dying weren’t traumatizing enough, I became a target, not just of the sexy scythe-wielding man who took out the abominations, nor the cute detective who questioned me as a witness to the carnage. For some reason, the demons are after my middle-aged ass!Why would they care about an average woman who works as a clerk, rides the bus, and lives in an apartment alone? I’m told it’s because I’m special. Because there is a latent magic in me I never knew about. I disagree but that hasn’t stopped folks from expecting me to join the resistance. I’d rather go back to my quiet life, however, now that the demons have found me, they won’t rest until they have me in their clawed clutches. Like hell am I going down without a fight. I never asked to be a heroine, but apparently, I’ve been chosen and now I must reap what fate has bestowed before chaos is sown.",
