I stepped into this role with uncertainty but courage, daring myself to conquer my fear. The answers to my mother’s disappearance got derailed when I was sent on a different path.

Quickly, I become ensconced in a life of magic and voodoo and I’m surrounded by unlikely allies. Julian Quibodeaux, an old flame, re-entered my life and our love reignited like dry tinder to a flame. However, he’s been cursed, and is unaware of the terrible secret he holds…One that could destroy our relationship. I’ll be tested in many ways, to save the man I love. Will my friends, and an unusual new-found gift, be enough to help me survive my journey? Secrets become unravelled, but can Julian and I come back from the truth?",
