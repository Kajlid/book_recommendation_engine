  "description": "A houseful of pets has declared their independence--but now they're fighting like cats and dogs! In Peter Hannan's delightfully absurd, illustrated chapter book PETLANDIA, a family of pets has kicked their snoring, sniveling humans to the curb, and declared the house an independent nation. But who will lead the new country of Petlandia? Tricky feline (and dictator-wannabe) Mrs. Wigglesworth is expecting to be waited on like a queen. It's all foot rubs and ice cream sundaes from here on out! But doofy dog Grub and his lovesick sidekick Honeybaked Hamster want equal representation, and they have the masses on their side. It's a dog-eat-dog world, and soon Petlandia has descended into all-out civil war!",
