  "description": "Broadway--New York City. Bright lights and hot nights. Despite a nightly, on-stage seduction by her sultry, debonair costar, Claire Daniels didn't believe vampires were real. Not at first. But her brother was dying and she was willing to believe in anything that might save him. Armed with only her blood and innocence for barter, Claire entered into the dark, silken web of the vampire with the belief that she could seduce one of its most powerful and elusive leaders into helping her save her brother. Such illusions, however, would cost Claire far more than any mere mortal could fathom.",
