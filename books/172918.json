  "description": "The Quanundocii – a love so pure, so strong, so real, that it can even defeat death. To ensure the continuance of the Oonock race, the Orbs of FarCore developed a most powerful weapon called the “Quanundocii”, a love capable of conquering all. The Orbs have called upon the Quanundocii to save the Oonock race only four times in the past hundred million years. The last was King Enok and Queen Medaron. But with the Queen’s death, the Quanundocii is broken, leaving the Oonocks vulnerable. They sense a new Terrian leader hunts the young monarchs, determined to destroy them and all Oonocks, and fulfill JeffRa’s Vow of Revenge. Without the Quanundocii, the end is near for this noble aquatic race. The only hope is for Europa to unite with another Oonock in a new Quanundocii. But this cannot happen as long as she is human. She must be an Oonock to become the new weapon. Using their great powers, the Orbs begin to change Europa, transforming her into a true Oonock, rebuilding her at her DNA level. But their transformation soon puts her life in mortal danger. If Europa cannot control her transformations, she will die. And with her death goes any chance of saving the Oonock race on Earth.",
