  "description": "Aneurin Bevan, socialist, democrat, individualist, was the most fascinating of politicians; In Place of Fear was his only book. It is a series of superbly written chapters on many of the key issues faced by the Labour movement in Parliament, and his perceptions remain directly relevant today. It should be read by anyone who wishes to understand the struggles and achievements of our social democracy.",
