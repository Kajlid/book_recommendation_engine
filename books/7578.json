  "description": "Vardek the Butcher, Lord Commander of the Army vs. Khamadek, High Priest of the Temple of the SunThe future of mankind lay in the balance. Arrayed in battle formation were the forces of evil and the legions of good - men and supernatural powers locked in a war to the death. The High Priest was an old man, his powers waning fast. His weakness and vanity - coupled with the lust of Zesta, the High Priestess - had allowed the Temple to sink to a point where Vardek could openly defy the immense power of the priesthood. Out of his defiance would come total destruction. The entire Atlantean nation was doomed to be engulfed. Nothing would remain to show it had ever existed. But some few would survive the holocaust. These were the seedbearers to the new age.",
