  "title": "Greed",
  "description": "For hundreds of years, Nightmares have ruled the world.  Descended from the Seven Deadly Sins, these supernatural creatures have enslaved and tortured the human race.  I have lived my entire life fighting back against the monsters that have plagued this world. A deadly assassin and a member of the resistance, I only have one motto: kill or be killed.  When The Damning commences - a fight to the death against the world's most brutal serial killers, assassins, and torturers - a twist of fate finds me as one of the competitors. Despite my initial reluctance, I find myself eagerly participating.  But what I didn't count on, however, were the seven princes:  Lupe, a Shifter descended from Wrath.  Devlin, a Genie descended from Greed.  Jax, a Vampire descended from Gluttony.  Killian, an Incubus descended from Lust.  Ryland, a Shadow descended from Pride.  Sebastian, a Mage descended from Sloth.  And,  Dair, a Mermaid descended from Envy.  Our love could never be. I'm an assassin, and they are my targets.  But who ever said I needed to follow the rules? If only I can survive The Damning...   This is a medium-burn reverse harem romance. Expect a kick-ass, snarky MC, seven swoon-worthy heroes, and a lot of bloodshed. This is book 1 in a series.",
