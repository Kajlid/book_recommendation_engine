  "title": "The Murder House",
  "description": "Every community has a house that people walk by hurriedly, nervously peeking at it out of the corners of their eyes. There's a house like that in Santa Cruz that the community has dubbed The Murder House. A bloody double murder occurred there almost twenty years ago and the killer has eluded capture ever since. The house was recently inherited and the new owner wants to sell. The problem is no one wants to buy a house with a violent history and a reputation that it is home to ghosts.The owner thinks Realtor Regan McHenry would make a perfect listing agent; after all, with her penchant for playing amateur sleuth, she’s no stranger to murder.This is the perfect mystery to read if you don’t believe in ghosts and an even better mystery to read if you do.",
