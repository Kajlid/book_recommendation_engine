  "description": "Robert March, acerbic writer and ex-policeman, moves to Larton where he meets Michael Faulkner, the hard-riding, hard-drinking 'squire' of the village. Robert comes to like Larton, but finds there are drawbacks to living there – Michael being one of them.The Larton Chronicles is a gentle, humorous amble through the English countryside meeting Michael's eccentric relatives, Robert's long-suffering agent, the Irish showjumping team, Robert's beloved Aga, and the folk from Larton itself. Damp dogs, hard-ridden horses and snooty cats roam pages filled with the story of Rob and Mike – fighting, laughing, loving and building a life together.",
