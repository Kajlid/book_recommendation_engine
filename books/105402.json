  "description": "Four hundred years ago there raged a debate among the learned men of Europe about whether or not the earth orbits the sun. Until then, it was commonly accepted that the sun, moon, stars and planets were embedded in crystalline spheres centered on the earth. In the debate, the Biblicists held that the sun goes around the earth once a day as well as once a year; whereas, the secularists maintained that the earth daily rotates on an axis and orbits the sun once a year. This latter idea, called heliocentrism, held the sun to be at the center of the universe. The modern view is that there is no center of the universe. In the last half of the twentieth century, geocentrism (the idea that the earth is stationary at the center of the universe) resurfaced in a new, technical form called geocentricity. Among its advocates and supporters one finds several with earned Ph.D.s in astronomy, mathematics or physics.",
