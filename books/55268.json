  "description": "Phoenix is simmering in the heat of a lazy July morning in 2195 when the execution-style murder of a young boy shatters the complacency of a population that hasn’t seen anyone die from natural causes for almost two centuries. Enter Malcolm Godfrey, a darkly brilliant alpha-male with an axe to grind. Malcolm’s insatiable appetite for power, money and women have made him a highly intelligent monster who is plotting the ultimate corporate take-over, a coup d’état. Malcolm believes that he is the chosen one, but there is just one more loose end to tie up before the final stage of his sinister plan can be put into motion. When Malcolm frames the beautiful wife of an ex-black ops specialist for murder, he finds that he has created an inescapable web of corporate deceit, danger and intrigue that culminates finally in a battle for mankind itself.",
