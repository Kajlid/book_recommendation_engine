She’s started a successful pet sitting business—Have-A-Nice-Vacation—and a seasonal lemonade stand—Pack Some Punch Stand. When Mia realizes that she can help her classmates through her business experience, she comes up with a great idea for her third KidBiz Tips with Mia Madison!Mia has made a name for herself at her school as an entrepreneur after launching not one, but two, successful businesses. Now her classmates need her help with their own ventures, and Mia must put her problem-solving skills to the test. Whether she’s helping them get their business off the ground, work with customers, or invent new problem-solving products, Mia is sure to teach them all something new. However, Mia soon finds that juggling her businesses, schoolwork, and friends can be a challenge. With the help of her CEO mom, Mia tackles her friends’ problems (and her own) head-on and teaches them, and readers, the ins-and-outs of running a successful kid business. This is the first book in a brand new series featuring a fun, illustrative format with 40 spot illustrations and doodles throughout!",
