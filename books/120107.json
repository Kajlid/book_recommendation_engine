Normal is but an illusion, and if Nyam Jones can't teach her what she needs to learn, they will both fade out. Nyam is one a small group of half-breed faders still alive on earth. He is also Jeo's mate. Jeo has very strong magic for a half-breed, and it makes Nyam's task far more difficult than it originally seemed. Nyam takes her up to his family's cabin in the mountains to teach her to control her power. Jeo is learning very quickly, until Nyam forgets one of the golden rules about training a half-breed to use their magic. It is a mindless mistake that may take them both into a premature death.
