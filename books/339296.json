  "description": "A young book editor stumbles up from the site of a bombing in the London subway. He accepts a woman's offer of help and a hot cup of tea. He's never heard from again...A group of boys in upstate New York goes sledding. One doesn't come home...A military convoy approaches a lone figure on a dusty road north of Baghdad. The woman is Army Chaplain Jaime Richards--and it seems she's been gone a lifetime.\nÂ \nAfter two years in paradise, Jaime has chosen to return to the \"terris\" world as a dual citizen, an Agent of Eden. But soon she will discover that life among mere mortals has become a living hell--and that a series of kidnappings are fatefully and tragically connected. For the victims are all descendants of Eden, and they have the one thing people outside of paradise want: A way to live forever.",
