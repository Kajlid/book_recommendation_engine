  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B00OKSBCA0“It’s too late to save myself, but I’ll save her, even if it kills me.”  When Akil leaves a nine year old half-blood girl on Muse’s doorstep, it’s not long before the demons come hunting, but this time Muse isn’t the target. The Institute, Muse’s immortal brother, and the Princes of Hell, all want a piece of the little half-blood. What’s so special about Dawn, and why has Akil conveniently disappeared just as Muse needs answers?  To save the half-blood girl, Muse must first save herself, but is it already too late? Muse’s humanity is failing. Her demon hungers. The darkness coiled around her heart lures her toward madness. And all that stands between Muse and her demon’s lust for destruction, is the hope that some half-bloods do get happy endings.  The veil weakens. Titles will fall. A new Prince rises. And if Muse can’t stop them, the demons will have their day.  Due to adult themes and scenarios this book is recommended for +18's.",
