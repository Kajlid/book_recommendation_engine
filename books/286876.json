In what is left of the United States, most live in faceless apartment blocks inside the walled Settlement Zones. There they survive on their basic income and whatever they can steal, scavenge or barter. For the Ultras, the wealthy elites who control the ruthless Gov, life is good in the few surviving small towns.
