  "description": "Brought to the edge of destruction by the death of her father, and her violent mother who blamed her for everything, Luna thought only misery was in store for her in the poor country town of Green Brook.When she finds a book of power inside of a tree, she thought her luck had finally changed, and set off to find the ingredients for a specific potion in the spell book that would make her life complete. But not being the owner of such a powerful book and not knowing what she was doing, Luna casted a spell upon herself that turned her into, some would say, a completely different person.Now she, along with her best friend and a boy she meets on the road, with wishes of his own to be someone different, will travel from place to place, trying to figure out exactly how the spells work and will encounter many fantastical people and places along the way. But nothing will deter them from getting what they each want, no matter what the cost is.This is a story about redemption, friendship, and gaining the courage to go for what you want and the strength to be who you were born to be, despite the disapproval of the entire world.",
