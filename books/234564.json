Life made us colder. Harder. Isolated.Caged.Even though we were different, the broken pieces of me recognized the sadness in her.Now she was back, and I wouldn’t make the mistake of letting her go again.When I first met Jasmine Greene, she came in as raindrops.When we met again, I became her darkest storm.",
