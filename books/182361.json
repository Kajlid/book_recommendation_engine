  "description": "Detective Jeff Arndt keeps an eye on his neighborhood—it’s a professional courtesy and a neighborly gesture. But after shots are fired one humid summer night, the line between professional and personal is obliterated. He won’t rest until his pretty neighbor is safe in his arms…even if that leaves his heart unprotected. Warning: a hot cop’s instincts aren’t the only thing aroused. This erotic romance includes two naughty neighbors who, after months of verbal foreplay and a little help from a muddy, shaggy dog, get down and dirty in the master bath. This summer, let the Naughty Neighbors Series fill your eReader with six short, sexy reads. Each story stands alone and promises to leave you satisfied.",
