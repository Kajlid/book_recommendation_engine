  "title": "The Power of Six",
  "description": "Six science fiction short stories written by the author of Pearseus, the epic fantasy series that has reached #1 on Amazon.  Although they seem to be concerned with various themes, there are certain passions that run through them, almost obsessively. What is the nature of reality; digital and corporeal? Is there more to the world than we can see? How far can we trust our senses? What are the consequences of our actions, and is it possible to change them? And if so, would we simply repeat same mistakes, or make new ones?  The anthology includes “I Come in Peace”, an award-winning short story that deals with a tortuous question: how far would man go to alleviate his loneliness? Readers of Pearseus will certainly recognize here the birth of the Orbs.  Humorous and poignant, these short stories are exciting, intriguing and imaginative.",
