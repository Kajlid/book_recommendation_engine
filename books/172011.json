  "title": "If You Want to Write: A Book about Art, Independence and Spirit",
  "description": "In her 93 remarkable years, Brenda Ueland published six million words. She said she had two rules she followed absolutely: to tell the truth, and not to do anything she didn't want to do. Her integrity shines throughout If You Want to Write, her best-selling classic on the process of writing that has already inspired thousands to find their own creative center. Carl Sandburg called this book \"The best book ever written about how to write.\" Yet Ueland reminds us that \"Whenever I say 'writing' in this book, I also mean anything that you love and want to do or to make.\" Ueland's writing and her teaching are made compelling by her feisty spirit of independence and joy.",
