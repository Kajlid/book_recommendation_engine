  "description": "The Rugged Rebel She'd Never Forgotten...Shane Halloran may have been trouble with a capital T when Merle Pierce fell hard for him in high school, but she never believed the sexy daredevil would abandon her. She devoted herself to her teenage advice column, and tried to forget the man who'd ruined her for any other love. Now, more than twenty years later, fate intervened-and Shane knew a truth she would have done anything to hide from him. Her wild Irish boy was all man now--and furious at her betrayal. How could he forgive her for never telling him the truth, Shane raged--and how could he confess that he'd never stopped loving his sweet Merry, whose proper veneer still hid a spellbinding sensuality that only he could taste? Tempers flared, as did a long-suppressed passion for each other, but what would it take to mend the shattered love that pain had only deepened, that time apart could not destroy?",
