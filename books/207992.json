  "description": "It's not easy, being King. Especially when you've got an allergy to sunrise and sunset, a fire-goddess for a mother-in-law, demonic adversaries, random assassins, and a basement full of insecurities to cope with.  Add to that his daughter, the priestess/princess, a couple of lightly-deranged professional magicians, a whole city full of wizards, and enough squabbling princes to resemble a kindergarten argument.  It's enough to make a man want to just go home.  Luckily for Eric, he has the world's largest pet rock, a smart-mouthed sword, and a horse that not only understands him, but likes him anyway.",
