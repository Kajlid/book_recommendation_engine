  "description": "I'm a boxer--fighting is my life, but nothing could've prepared me for the rounds I'd go through trying to woo my Raven-haired beauty into falling for me.  It didn't help that she thought I was stalking her either, and maybe I was . . . a little. I just couldn't help myself! She was my dream girl, an unattainable and infuriating one, but my dream girl nonetheless.  To her, I would never be more than an unaccented pain in the ass. Sure, I didn't have an accent like she wanted, but there's more to love than the way a person talks. I was determined to show her that. Only, she didn't want my love, my help, or anything else from me, unless you counted my . . . yeah, she definitely wanted ALL of that.  No matter how many times I tried to convince her, she just couldn't admit how good we really were for each other. It was like she purposely put up a fight just to torment me. I almost gave up, until one bad decision led her back to me, and now I'm the only thing keeping her from going to jail.",
