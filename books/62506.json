  "description": "A girl without a name. A boy everyone wants to claim. A system that swallows them whole.Klara and Vuk have grown up in an orphanage where the rules are clear: don’t get too close, don’t expect kindness, never let anyone see you break.She escapes through music. He sees the world through a camera lens. Their love is fragile and urgent, and together, they dream of something more.But dreams don’t last long here.When Vuk is taken in by a wealthy artist, it seems like a way out. What follows will shatter everything Klara thought she knew—about him, about herself, about what it means to survive.Written by an award-winning novelist and playwright, A Lullaby for No One’s Vuk is a dark story about the brutality of institutions, the ache of first love, betrayal, and what it means to survive in a world that would rather forget you.",
