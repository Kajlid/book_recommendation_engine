When the lycans revolt against the iron fist of angelic rule, he steps in to command, becoming both enemy and coveted ally in the conflict between vampires and angels. Vashti is the second most powerful vampire in the world, a lethal beauty with a path of devastation in her wake.

But as war looms, each must decide where their loyalty lies - with their own kind or with the enemy lover they can no longer live without...",
