  "description": "A universal revolution is coming in G. Crittenden's breathtaking new novel, 3535 .After an alien probe lands on Earth, releasing a poisonous gas that spreads for miles, society crumbles and enters what is known only as the \"Lost Century.\"While the dreaded alien invasion never materializes, the scare is enough to prompt the formation of a global government that begins colonizing Mars and Titan, Saturn's moon. But Titan proves a challenging new frontier, one that requires human colonists to be genetically modified over centuries in order to adapt to the moon's harsh conditions.Hundreds of years later, the inhabitants of Titan have wearied of living under Earth's directives without any rights of their own. Led by activist Jodah Belos, a referendum seeking to secede from the union of planets is gaining tractionâ€”much to the chagrin of the politicians back on Earth.As it appears more and more in the realm of possibility that Titan will achieve its independence, those who oppose it will stop at nothing to destroy what had been so carefully created centuries before.A war that threatens not just the world, but the entire galaxy, is coming. Are you ready?",
