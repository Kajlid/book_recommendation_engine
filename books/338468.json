  "description": "′There is no finer guarantee of outstanding romance than the name of Elizabeth Lowell′ - Romantic Times.Cast adrift during the War Between the States, Shannon Conner grew to womanhood in a lonely cabin high in the Colorado Rockies. Though stubborn and courageous, Shannon is ill-prepared to deal with the predatory Culpepper brothers - and the intoxicating ardour of the man who defends her honour, Rafael ′Whip′ Moran.A loner and a wanderer, a man tied to no place or promise, Whip aids the wary young ′widow′ who has a walk like honey and a determined grip on her shotgun. But neither the Culpeppers nor grizzlies are as dangerous to Whip as the passion Shannon offers him - a passion that could cost Whip the freedom that is as much a part of him as his soul.",
