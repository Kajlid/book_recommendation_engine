  "description": "He's only been surviving. Her magic can show him how to live. Red Rock Pass, Book 3 After a decade under a corrupt alpha's thumb, Dylan Gennaro is still reeling from the changes in his life: a new home, a new alpha, a pack at war. Even normal things like an ending relationship. Still, when he's asked to work with an outcast witch, he agrees without hesitation. Maybe by protecting her, he'll rediscover his own inner strength. If, indeed, it exists. Sasha Wallace lost her mentor in a vicious attack that left her scarred in spirit as well as body. While she's grateful for the refuge offered by the Red Rock alpha, it's tough living with the pack's suspicion. Even though-or maybe because-she's willing to use her powers to help them fight their war. Except for Dylan. When she's finally free to find a new home, he'll be the only one she regrets leaving behind. Their attraction is a balm to their wounded hearts, until their journey for knowledge brings them face to face with a terrifying vampire. Neither has the strength for this fight-but if they can let go of their pasts and trust each other, they might just be able to do it. Together. Warning: Contains dangerous magical binding spells, a flannel-wearing vampire lumberjack, paranormal road-trip hijinks and a quietly brilliant werewolf willing to defy his society and his past to protect the witch he loves.",
