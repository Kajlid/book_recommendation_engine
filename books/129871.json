  "description": "A diamond brocade patter is more quilter Martha Rose's style than a baseball diamond - especially when it comes to the new eyesore of a stadium ruining her lovely San Fernando Valley neighbourhood. Martha doesn't know a bunt from a bundt cake, but when she stumbles upon the battered body of baseball coach Dax Martin, she doesn't need a scorecard to know it's foul play. LAPD homicide detective Arlo Beavers is convinced one of her neighbours is responsible. But Martha and her fellow quilters Lucy and Birdie soon discover a whole field of suspects who might have wanted to take the coach out of the game permanently.",
