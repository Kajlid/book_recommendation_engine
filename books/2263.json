  "title": "High Cotton: Selected Stories of Joe R. Lansdale",
  "description": "This collection of Joe R. Lansdale stories represents the best of the “Lansdale” genre—a strange mixture of dark crime, even darker humor, and adventure tales. The stories are varied in setting and theme, but they are all pure Lansdale—eerie, amusing, and occasionally horrific. In “The Pit,” modern gladiators square off against one another using Roman methods. An alternate-history tale called “Trains Not Taken” shows Buffalo Bill as an ambassador and Wild Bill Hickok as a clerk. Lansdale’s love of large lizards and humor are evident in the stories “Godzilla’s Twelve Step Program” and “Bob the Dinosaur Goes to Disneyland.”The pitNot from DetroitBooty and the beastSteppin' out, summer, '68Incident on and off a mountain roadMy dead dog, BobbyTrains not takenTight little stitches in a dead man's backDog, cat, and babyMister weed-eaterBy bizarre handsThe fat man and the elephantThe phone womanLetter from the South, two moons west of NacogdochesBy the hair of the headThe jobGodzilla's twelve step programDrive-in dateBob the dinosaur goes to DisneylandThe steel ValentineNight they missed the horror show",
