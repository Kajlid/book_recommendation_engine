  "description": "She was an angel when she met me. She was broken when she left.    One night in my bed ruined her for good. I left her with aching lips, dark desires… and a secret baby. Eight years later, she’s back, and desperate for more of the same. But there are shadows on her tail – an ex-husband thirsty for blood. Well, he’d better come ready. I’ll die to protect what’s mine.   Halley Talin should have stayed in my past. We had one night together – one hot, filthy night, a night where I showed her how pleasurable the shadows can be.   I knew she’d never forget it. But I had to move on.   I had a club to ride with, and that was all the family I ever wanted. At least, that’s what I used to think.   Then Halley came knocking on my door once more. She was just as stunning, just as sweet. But something dark lingered behind her eyes.   And when she stepped aside, she revealed something that left me damn near speechless – A son I never knew existed.   I don’t know the first thing about being a father. All I know is crime and violence and the craven thrill of making a woman beg and moan.   But for the first time in my life, I have something to lose. Something to fight for. Something to protect.   And I’ll be damned if anyone is going to take it from me.  BROKEN ANGEL is a full-length, standalone, contemporary bad boy romance with hot sex, no cheating, and a HEA ending.",
