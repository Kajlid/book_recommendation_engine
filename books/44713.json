  "description": "The AK-47 instinctively rose toward the Mexican sergeant, and bullets poured out of the suppressor like water from a hose from hell. The only sound Mike heard was the rapid, metallic clack, clack, clack of the bolt cycling, and then he caught a glimpse of twonow threemore uniformed men with rifles. He could sense the three shooters' intentions as their fingers moved to the triggers. For the first time ever, the inactive Marine had a really, really bad thought ... I'm not gonna make it.'",
