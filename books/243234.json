  "description": "Game after game, season after season, everyday dramas mark the road along the way: walk-off home runs and threes at the buzzer, fades to the end zone and goals in stopping time, aces on match point and reaching for the finish. After the championship trophy is hoisted, the story doesn’t end. For some athletes, the journey is just beginning.Champions: 15 Inspiring Comeback Stories from Sports and Life recounts the true stories of top-tier competitors whose greatest victories came against the fiercest of all opponents: life. From Victoria Arlen, a swimmer who came out of a coma to set a world record; to Bob Love, a busboy who fought his way back to the pro basketball ranks; to Kyle Schwarber who started out the Cubs’ 2016 season with a torn ACL and finished with a World Series Championship; these and a dozen other athletes will inspire you to overcome your own obstacles on the field and off as you pursue your dreams.",
