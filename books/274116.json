  "description": "He was alone. He had sent away his only allies, watched as they disappeared into the recesses of space, leaving him to finish what they had begun. To purge the galaxy of a great evil, that disguised itself behind a guise of help and the promise of fertility. The same Project that had made him into the twisted being he had become. There was work to do, a purpose that was his own for the first time in his existence. He had no one to answer to, no one to dictate the course of his actions. Until he met her. He had not intended on taking a companion, especially one that worked for the facility he so despises. But when she looked at him, when she asked for his help… Everyone else would be purged. And she… She would be the conscience he did not seem to possess.",
