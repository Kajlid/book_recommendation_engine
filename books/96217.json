Local residents look upon those who dwell within with respect and fear... trusting their fortune and the future to the mysterious Master of Cardalba.For five years Ronny Dillon has denied the pain and the power that is his birthright--hiding away in the halls of academia from from Welch County, Georgia. But an urgent summons has arrived from his half-brother, and Ronny knows he must return to the ancestral mansion--where his past was erased, his dreams damaged... and his future and life very nearly destroyed in mists of magic and illusion.
