  "description": "After years of various abuse and struggles with different mental illnesses, McKenna Hight began documenting her healing journey in the form of poetry. Illustrated by Allison Gulley, Sublimity names the monsters under our beds for what they are while voicing the simultaneous (and bigger) promises and realities of truth, grace, and love that never give up on us. Growth and hope are the most painful things in the world, but the destinations are as real as the pain of the road, and words can begin to heal our wounds.",
