  "description": "Much remains in a Pennsylvania town turned uninhabitable by slow-burning, subterranean fire. Visiting emptiness, Ink channels atmosphere to empower it in empathy and homage for those who live(d) there. Characters are not people in 61 Central. Rather, the key figures are the structures that make up the town that supports them as well as the nature that reclaims said structures. Decay is mortality in this haunting, ambient narrative.",
