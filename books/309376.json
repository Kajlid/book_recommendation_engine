  "description": "To find temptation, we must lay our own path.For the last ten years, I thought I was nothing special. I was just another priestess in the Temple of Temptation. One of many. Little did I know that my god has plans for me. He intends to make me powerful.But what I will become is up to me.For centuries, things here have always been done the same way - and the gods are now paying for it. Somehow, I'm expected to revive the faith. I'm their last hope, but no one is quite sure how I'm supposed to do that.That means I'm making this up as I go. My god is begging me to become something new. My temple wants me to respect traditions. My instructors want to force me to follow their rules.I just want to save my god.With my three men, I know I'll figure it out. That is not the same as this being easy, though. Even worse, being \"special\" makes those around me jealous, and giving in to temptation is a part of our nature. When my guardian's family gets involved, things get infinitely more complicated.The temple wants to break me.My success or failure depends on the path I choose.I just hope I find the right one.Possible Triggers: Discussions of rape and assault, domestic violence, minor bullying, harassment, consensual pain and battery. Minor violence.The Path of Temptation series features a strong woman and the men who love her. Graphic language and situations that are suitable for a mature audience are included.This is a love story, but sometimes love comes with a price.",
