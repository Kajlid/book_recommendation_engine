  "title": "Problem at Pollensa Bay and Other Stories",
  "description": "The cover states; \"A new collection from the undisputed Queen of Crime.\" The word \"new\" is no longer applicable; it came out in 1991, but it certainly contains eight great short stories, and the author's sobriquet still remains applicable for sure! The stories are: (1) Problem at Pollensa Bay - with Parker Pyne, (2) The Second Gong - with Hercule Poirot, (3) Yellow Iris - with Hercule Poirot, (4) The Harlequin Tea Set - with Harley Quin, (5) The Regatta Mystery - with Parker Pyne, (6) The Love Detectives - with Harley Quin, (7) Next To A Dog - a standalone short story, and (8) Magnolia Blossom - a standalone short story. The last two can be described as romances, but they are much more than that. The variety of the stories stands out. From murder and attempted murder, to theft and the love between a woman and her pet dog, no one can say that Agatha Christie wasn't versatile! The individual stories were first published between the 1920s and 1971. Librarian's note: this entry is for the collection of short stories, \"Problem at Pollensa Bay and Other Stories.\" Entries for the eight individual titles, including the title story, can be found elsewhere on Goodreads. Any short story featuring Poirot can be found by searching Goodreads for \"a Hercule Poirot Short Story,\" Pyne by searching for \"a Parker Pyne Short Story,\" and Quin by searching for \"a Harley Quin Short Story.\"",
