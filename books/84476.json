  "description": "Nightmare in Crimson by Patricia Rosemoor\nHunted for the holidays?\nIt’s been a year since Pippa McNabb’s husband – a philandering executive who was dressed as Santa – was murdered. Now Pippa is co-owner of the Westbrook Department Store and trying to find her footing in management. But at a company charity event, the guest \"Santa\" is suddenly ill and lurches outside… only to be run over by eight (not-so-tiny) reindeer. Another Santa is dead. And once again, Pippa is the prime suspect!But Pippa isn’t the only suspect. Sky Thornton is a naturalist who was responsible for the ruinous reindeer, and he’s also under suspicion. Sky is in Chicago for his own reasons, but finding himself increasingly attracted to Pippa – a potential murderess – was not part of the plan.Pippa now has only three things on this year’s Christmas list: 1) Clear her name; 2) Resist the wicked chemistry with Sky; and 3) Avoid becoming the next Christmas kill!",
