  "description": "Popular homemaker, farm wife, and cook Betsy Lacey has her own online channel, Sweet Home Vermont. What her viewers don’t know is that she isn’t married, only pretends she owns the beautiful farm, and can’t cook. If her brother and sister-in-law find out she’s been putting videos of their home online, it’ll be a quick end for her career as an internet star. Hunky Boone put himself through school helping run the Lacey’s hobby farm, but once he started helping Betsy film her secret show, he never left. Balancing farm work and the channel, Boone keeps his own secret from best friend Betsy: he’s fallen in love with her. When a twist of fate brings her unexpected biggest fan—sexy veteran Dean—to the farm, it threatens to expose everyone’s secrets, and sheds a whole new light on Betsy’s sweetest desires.",
