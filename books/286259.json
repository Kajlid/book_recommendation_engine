  "title": "John + Siena: Extended",
  "description": "Things are changing for John and Siena Marcello again … Between life, work, family and even a pregnancy, the universe has a way of stepping in and testing Johnathan Marcello and his wife at every turn. If there’s anything that he’s learned over the years, it’s that nothing stays the same—even when he wants it to. But these changes might just be for the better, if he can roll with it all. As for Siena, well … no matter what, she is here to love John through it. *For fans of John and Siena, John + Siena: Extended revisits your favorite characters one more time to find out what happened in the space of time between the final chapter, the epilogue, and a little beyond the end. Meet their firstborn and celebrate their HEA all over again. This is a companion novella to the John + Siena duet and should not be read as a standalone.",
