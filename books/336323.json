  "description": "Lux is finishing his Aeronautical Engineering degree at Georgia Tech. His father begins to support him again but he is starting to get noticed a little too widely outside his peers. He has to hire a 7 X 24 security team. The Israeli intelligence operatives, alerted by Professor Helmann are the first to arrive. SpaceX becomes interested when Lux tries to obtain spacesuits suitable for extravehicular activity in vacuum. Lux starts flying frequently and upgrades SpaceX rocket shells with 'Blakely' thrusters. Chinese operatives attempt to obtain the tech by any means and won't stop. The DeepFake video personality, Lummi, has reached 'popstar' status and is pressured to give live international concerts of her music. The DeepFake videos produced by his A.I., Anna, continue to improve and produce income to fund his research. Lux applies to M.I.T. for a Ph.D. in their AeroAstro to investigate the strange field effects from his discovery. The mystery of the 'effect' is beginning to unravel.",
