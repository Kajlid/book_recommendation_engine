  "description": "The strongest crush can turn into the deepest resentment.As a young girl, I had a massive crush on Thor Aurelius, the future ruler of the Northlands. That crush died nine years ago when he ridiculed and humiliated me to my very core. Now I resent his arrogant personality and avoid him at all costs.When Thor disappears to get away from the intense pressure of being the heir to the Northlands, his father asks Linea to use her tracking skills and deliver an ultimatum to his heir.Linea knows Thor will be furious and blame her as the messenger. She’ll have to face him anyway and prove to herself that she’s no longer a young, infatuated girl, but a strong and unapologetic woman who owns the quirkiness he once ridiculed her for. Problem is that the last time she saw the large and angry Nman, Thor threatened to spank her if she came back. He wouldn’t though… or would he?The Heir is the fourteenth installment in Elin Peer’s wildly popular dystopian romance series, Men of the North.Readers rave about each book being new and fresh and this one is no different.Get your copy in pre-sale today!",
