The world didn’t end that day after all, and we’ve lived every day since rebuilding— together. We’re finally ready to tell our story.Photo Description: Two men in early 20th century clothing are standing outdoors together. One has his arm around the other’s shoulder and he’s tweaking his mustache.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love’s Landscapes\" event.
