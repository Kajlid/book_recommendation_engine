Come the full moon, when our goddess watches our victory, we will taste of their blood!\" ---- Wolf-men, savage creatures given humanoid form in an ancient war, mass along the Gihon River.

Their friendship will be tested as their gods resume an unending war, and their very faiths call for the death of the other. Together, friend or foe, they must face Redclaw's horde.
