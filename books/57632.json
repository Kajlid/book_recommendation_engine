Rebecca Gaines, widowed by the conflict that had torn the nation apart, struggles single-handedly to manage the family farm. Life is hard in the beleaguered South, so when a troop of Union soldiers rides in to winter over on her property, Rebecca is grudgingly glad of the extra income. The dashing commanding officer of the Union troops, Colonel Charlie Redmond, is courteous and gentle in his dealings with her, and she is drawn to this intriguing professional soldier. But he is still the enemy, and Rebecca finds it difficult to come to terms with her feelings. For his part, Charlie is alarmed to realize he is romantically involved with the lovely Southerner, for he hides a secret that, if discovered, would mean social disgrace and the end of a distinguished military career. For Charlie is a woman.In this meticulously researched novel, T. Novan and Taylor Rickard have captured the agony and devastation of the Civil War and its impact on soldiers and civilians alike. With its moving love story, powerful scenes of battle, and memorable characters, Words Heard in Silence lays the foundation for the Redmond Family saga.Cover Design by Lúcia A. de Nóbrega",
