  "description": "\"Do not f*** the players. Or you will be fired.\" As the newest \"ice babe\" for the Colorado Blizzard, I'm not too worried about breaking that rule. I know a thing or two about fending off hockey players looking to score. At least, that's what I thought ... until I caught the eye of Blizzard captain and heart-throb Hunter Rockwell. No matter how many times I turn the troubled star down, he's convinced I'm just playing hard to get -- and he doesn't care how much hot water his flirting lands me in. If I were being perfectly honest? Sure, I'd love to spend a few minutes in the sin bin with the chiseled stud ... but I'd never risk my job for a filthy rich athlete with a dirty reputation. But with Hunter stepping up his game on and off the ice to win me over, telling him no is getting harder than ever. It doesn't help that everyone already suspects there's something between us. And maybe they're right. Hunter swears no one will find out ... but I know we're bound to get caught. And then he'll toss my broken heart to the ice, just like all the others. So why am I letting myself get hooked on Hunter? \nHooked is a 50,000 word hockey romance! This stand-alone novel is the first entry in the Colorado Blizzard series. Narrated in alternating first person. No cheating, no cliffhanger, HEA guaranteed.",
