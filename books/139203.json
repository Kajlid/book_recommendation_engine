He sets out on numerous quests to save the universe, however his altruism never seems to turn out quite as expected. Who knew doing the right thing was so hard?In between saving those who don’t want his help—and the chaos that follows—he rescues a damsel in distress.

Too bad he’s got bad genes working against him.",
