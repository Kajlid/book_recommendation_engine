  "title": "Immortal Light: Wide Awake",
  "description": "After a casual touch of the hand from a new teenage stranger in town, unusual things start happening to Lucy Higgins. She can’t explain it, but when she starts having realistic dreams about the new stranger, Benjamin, she begins to question her sanity. Benjamin tells her of a special life-saving power that they share, a power called the Immortal Light that derives from Zharem, an ancient city of gold, now lost. He tells her that she has a purpose in his world and that she must use the power of the Immortal Light to get him home. Thinking she’s going mad, Lucy dismisses the dreams as her imagination gone wild, and it’s easy enough to do until the dream world seems to encroach on reality. Immortal Light Wide Awake is an adventure of discovery and the horrifying dangers of an ancient evil force trying to stop fate. If Lucy can trust herself, she just might discover that the world of the Immortal Light is right under feet.",
