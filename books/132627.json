  "description": "Lana Collins never expected to be on the cover of a magazine, but when Hollywood starlet, Alexa Stanley, checks into rehab her manager needs a replacement and fast! What started as a drunken flight to Los Angeles lands Lana in the hands of Alexa's manager and she makes her a deal she can't refuse. Pretend to be Alexa Stanley for ninety days and make a half a million. Piece of cake, right?It’s hard enough pretending to be someone she’s not, but add in a steamy British co-star with a tongue like a whip and Lana's frustration boils over. Rowan Scott isn't just beautiful, he's downright intoxicating. And his snarky-ass comments are driving her to drink. Too bad he doesn't know who she really is. As each jest brings them closer to the point of no return, Lana struggles with telling the truth...or letting some things go unsaid.",
