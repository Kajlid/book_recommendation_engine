  "description": "Darby O’Rielly may look like a shy, quiet bookstore owner who waits up at night to make sure her fun loving little sister Rowan makes it home. But that would be a bad assumption if you intend to threaten her family and loved ones. If the deadly magic this witch possesses is unleashed, the whole neighborhood better watch out.When two handsome brothers move next door, love blooms. Devon and Blake aren’t just hot, they’re vampires hunted by a man with unlimited wealth and vengeance.With these two atypical couples together, mayhem ensues. Darby is forced to use her new-found magic when hunters snatch Rowan to lure the brothers to their demise. A wreckless decision by the enemy transforms Rowan into a werewolf, throwing her new love Blake into a downward spiral. Werewolf terrors from childhood paralyze his judgment and send him packing, leading Rowan into the arms of a wolf named Dean who helps ease her into the new life she’s forced to embrace.",
