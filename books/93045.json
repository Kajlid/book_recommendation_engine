  "title": "Francis and Eddie: The True Story of America's Underdogs",
  "description": "A century ago, in 1913, the world's finest golfers gathered at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, to compete in golf's national championship, the U.S. Open. Joining them was a little-known amateur, 20-year-old Francis Ouimet, who lived across the street from the course and taught himself to play by sneaking onto the fairways with the only golf club he owned. His caddie? Ten-year-old Eddie Lowery, who stood only four feet tall. Together, against their idols and in front of a crowd that grew from a handful of spectators to a horde of thousands, they attempted to pull off the impossible. Along the way, they forged a lifelong friendship. In FRANCIS AND EDDIE award-winning author Brad Herzog and award-winning illustrator Zachary Pullen celebrate golf's most inspiring underdog story. What Seabiscuit is to the \"sport of kings\" Francis and Eddie are to the \"gentleman's game.\"",
