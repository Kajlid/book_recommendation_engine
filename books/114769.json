Devastated by the death of her longtime lover, Connor Hawthorne, best-selling mystery novelist, former district attorney, and the daughter of a former U.S. Senator and presidential adviser, is determined to bring the murderer to justice. And when the crime is solved--too easily--she vows to put the experience behind her and rebuild her life. But someone is determined to make sure she doesn't. While at a writer's conference in the the Southwest, Connor finds herself running for her life across the high desert, aided by a beautiful and resourceful Navajo guide. As the murderer draws close, Conner and her guide must unravel a web of treachery, some of which lies in Connor's own past, to save their lives and prevent the discovery of a powerful secret that someone is willing to kill for, again and again. In the process, Connor will finally come to understand the very special gifts of wisdom and prescience that have passed to her through generations of Celtic women from the mists of times long past. Caught up in the battle between life and death, she learns that reality isn't necessarily just what you can see.",
