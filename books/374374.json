David saw the problem as her drive to be successful, and not fitting into the mold of an Air Force officer’s wife. Annie blamed their breakup on his unfortunate habit of bringing his dictatorial nature into their relationship as if she were in his squadron.   Can they ever learn to accept the other as they are? Will Annie let stubborn pride cause her to lose the only man she has ever  loved? The real question for Annie does she take this man…again?",
