  "description": "\"This hugely entertaining pack of lies reads like a Woody Allen essay from the New Yorker.\" — David Pitt, BooklistIs Chris Elliott a highly successful and beloved comedian—or a slightly dim-witted notalent from a celebrity family who managed to convince a generation of disillusioned youth that he was funny? From a ghastly childhood on the posh Upper East Side to his first job entertaining mobsters with his Judy Garland impersonation, The Guy Under the Sheets is packed with countless episodes from the life of a mediocre artist who somehow faked his way to the top—of semi-moderate fame and fortune. Woven throughout the fictional fun in Elliott's memoir are wonderful real-life anecdotes that will delight many new readers and loyal fans alike.\"The arc of [Elliott's] career remains unique and inspiring . . . that he blazed a trail for Arrested Development and Community and all the other freaky, convention-flouting TV comedies.\"— Grantland",
