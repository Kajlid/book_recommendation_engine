The prize money will help her family's struggling business, and Juliet figures it's a perfect opportunity to forget Leoâ€¦only to find him already there and gunning for victory. As they compete head-to-head, Leo and Juliet's fervent attraction boils over. But Juliet's not sure whether to trust her adversary, or give up on the sweetest love she's ever tasted...",
