  "description": "Twelve Tales of life gone wrong and brave battles fought. Only the strong come out stronger.When tragedy strikes the lives of twelve different women, they have to fight back for emotional survival . But society is watching, judging, disapproving. Shadows, Darkness and Light gives a voice to the tumultuous emotions of unsung life heroes, ordinary women that must fight running battles with destiny: a woman finding a place in her heart for a child who is a product of rape, a girl living in the world of forced child marriages, a wife jailed for murder rebuilding the relations with her daughter, a mentally ill woman conquering rejection, a widow who realizes there is no comfort for the bereaved, a dying woman haunted by family arranged adultery, exploitation in the guise of religion and more. These are stories of great courage, self-sacrifice and scars. Scars from the past and from the present. Life is not just another story. It is a personal experience. We can only celebrate the victories of those brave enough to accept they cannot change the past or the present. They cannot flee the shadows, or the darkness that comes with the shadows. But as they seek their identity and prove their relevance, they can influence the future and find the light.Then we realize the fight is not theirs alone. It is our fight for humanity. Together we will change the world â€“ one woman at a time. Shadows Darkness and Light is a short story collection of 67,000 words set in Zimbabwe, Africa.",
