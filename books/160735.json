  "description": "First place winner, 2014 Royal Palm Literary Award. \"The author weaves a rich tapestry of vivid images, powerful emotions, and intrigue into an action-packed fantasy that I couldn't put down. She takes you deep into an ethereal world created from the earthiness of tradition and nature, born of blood and lust. Truly spellbinding!\" Rosamond, a former jaguar goddess, wants to live an ordinary life, but the Eternals have other plans. They pressure Rosamond to use a stolen jaguar-skull totem to trap a god in the afterlife, a god to whom Rosamond owes a debt of loyalty. When she is poisoned by a sorcerer's dark magic, Rosamond must confront a mysterious killer and the Eternals who betrayed her before the lethal spell runs its course. \"The Jaguar Key is fantasy fiction at its best. A definite page-turner and a great read!\"",
