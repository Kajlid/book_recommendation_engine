  "description": "It's all my fault.All I want is to do something right, which is why I fix some woman's car for free.She's not supposed to bother me about paying me back.She's not supposed to find the letter meant for someone else.Most of all, she's not supposed to get to my heart.As soon as I realize she's in the same position as me, I know we both have a chance to finally move forward from the past, and from the mistakes.\nExcept for me, one mistake seems to be lingering... in the form of an old fling and a positive pregnancy test.",
