  "title": "Big Chickens Fly the Coop",
  "description": "The four big chickens who were afraid of everything in their wellreceived debut, Big Chickens , are now feeling all cooped up, so they set off to find the farmhouse. But where, the hapless hens wonder, is it? First they find a doghouse (loud barking!); then they run into a tractor ( ewww , dirty!); and then they stomp into the barn (wild horses!). Who knew the farmhouse was right under their beaks the whole time? Sidesplitting silliness abounds in this second riotously funny read-aloud by Leslie Helakoski, once again illustrated with Henry Cole?s boisterous art.",
