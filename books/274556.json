  "description": "“I can’t get him out of my head.”  Zayden’s only at this veterinary conference as a last-minute favor to his boss - and the mixer events really aren’t his style. That is, until he meets a hot omega who is down for a quick fling. There’s just one catch: when the event is over, Zayden can’t help himself from wanting more.  \"I feel so stupid. It’s all blowing up in my face.\"  Elliott returned from the conference with some nice continuing education, some happy memories… and a baby in his stomach. When he can’t hide his pregnancy, he panics, inventing a long distance boyfriend who he’s very happy with. He might get away with the lie, too - until Zayden shows up and blows all of Elliott’s preconceptions out of the water.  Welcome to Sunnydale Vets, where love is the best medicine, and all it takes to fix your problems is the willingness to roll up your sleeves and get to work. This heartwarming mpreg book features a veterinary work exchange, an unplanned pregnancy, and one very fake relationship that’s determined to blossom into something real. This book and every other book in the Sunnydale Vets series can be read in any order",
