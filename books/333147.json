  "title": "Mahomet and His Successors Part 2",
  "description": "Volume 2 of 2. The author makes no claim to novelty of fact, nor profundity of research in this life of Mahomet. It bears the type of a work intended for a family library; in constructing which the whole aim of the author was to digest into an easy, perspicuous and flowing narrative, the admitted facts concerning Mahomet, together with such legends and traditions as have been wrought into the whole system of Oriental literature; and at the same time, to give such a summary of his faith as might be sufficient for the general reader.",
