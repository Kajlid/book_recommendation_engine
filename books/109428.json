  "description": "What happens when young Virgil Creech sets his one-track mind on owning a dog? He can’t find an available one, of course – that would be too easy for a Creech. No, Virgil becomes obsessed with the four-legged companion of eccentric newcomer, Colonel Clarence Birdwhistle. When he enlists his only friend, Henry Lee to help make his dream reality, a hilarious chain of events sweep through Portsong as the miscreant plots and schemes to steal the dog from the kindly old man. Set in the 1920’s, Virgil Creech Takes a Swipe at Redemption probes deep into the mind of a boy, which is a shallow thing indeed. Follow Virgil as he plots and plunders his way through school, church, town, and quite possibly into your heart. His antics are hard for even the stoutest soul to tolerate, but don’t write him off just yet. There is always hope that young Virgil might just find his way. With colorful characters and unforgettable wit, Virgil Creech Takes a Swipe at Redemption will leave you ready to take up residence in Portsong – halfway between Savannah and heaven.",
