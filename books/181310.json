Yet he offers her honey that dramatically improves her illness, and his bees sing words that she can understand.Mal took up beekeeping in order to preserve the last remnants of his humanity. What started as a simple trip to California quickly turns into something far more complicated, as he meets a lovely girl who is deathly ill, infected by Mal's own brother. Feeling guilty and responsible, Mal sets out to heal her with his precious, magic-infused honey, and with each passing day, comes closer to breaking his personal Befriend Many, Serve Some, Trust Few, Love None.Once healed, Libby has the strength to break up with her boyfriend--touching off a war between Mal and his brother. This escalates into a realm of awful magic Libby has never dreamed of, where she is both pawn and prize in the battle against a Necromancer. In the end, Libby must face her growing feelings for Mal, and decide whether to destroy him--or rescue him from his soulless existence.",
