  "description": "HunterPeople weren't supposed to live through what I lived through, and most of the time, I wish I hadn't. I came away from military service fucked up beyond all recognition, slinking back to my family's cattle ranch in Texas to heal, my tail between my legs.Well, leg. Singular.My brothers hire Hadley Parsons to put me back together again, and she's supposed to be the best of the best, tough and beautiful to boot.I’d kick her to the curb right away and get back to guzzling beer and letting my muscles atrophy, but dammit…the woman sure knows how to get a guy’s attention. Maybe it’s her flashing green eyes, or the toss of her auburn hair, or her earnest determination – whatever it is, I’m suddenly a lot more interested in PT than I was a minute ago.HadleyWhen I walk into my newest client’s living room, I can see I have my work cut out for me. Oh, it doesn’t bother me – I’m made of tougher stuff than it seems, and I don’t mind getting down and dirty if I need to. I don’t even mind the insults he lashes out with, or his surly attitude.Besides, something tells me this guy is worth my trouble.Beneath the grime, I see a strong man, a handsome man – a man who’s capable of anything, who can take back his power.I’ll do whatever it takes to get Hunter back on his feet…which is probably a good thing, because I’m about to seriously push some boundaries.***Hunter can be read as a standalone book. For a limited time only, my first RUNAWAY is included as a bonus.",
