  "title": "Mrs Darley's Pagan Healing Wisdom: A Magickal Journey of Healing Through the Senses",
  "description": "The fourth in the 'Mrs Darley' series of books by Carole Carlton explores healing through the five senses of touch, smell, taste, hearing and sight. Peppered with the ever magickal Pagan wisdom from Mrs Darley, Carole's enigmatic next door neighbour whilst living on the wild and remote Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, this book will take you on a Pagan path to healing. When we become ill we search for a cure, but a cure only suppresses the symptoms of disorder; it fails to address the underlying cause. When we search for healing, we are encouraged to look beyond the symptom, in order to explore the emotional, psychological and spiritual imbalances which underpin the illness. Following several periods of less than robust health, Carole Carlton's enigmatic next door neighbour, the ever wise Mrs Darley, invited her to embark on a journey of healing through the five senses. It was a journey that not only made Carole view life and death in a different way, but also altered the way in which she interacted with her body. It ultimately became a magickal journey that changed Carole's career and touched her soul.",
