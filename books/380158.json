  "title": "Night Soul and Other Stories",
  "description": "Best known for his complex and beautiful novels--regularly compared to those of Thomas Pynchon, William Gaddis, and Don DeLillo--Joseph McElroy is equally at home in the short story, having written numerous pieces over the course of his career that now, collected at last, serve as an ideal introduction to one of the most important contemporary American authors. Combining elements of classic McElroy with tantalizing stories pointing the way ahead (the spare and dangerous \"No Man's Land,\" the lush and mischievous \"The Campaign Trail\"), \"Night Soul and Other Stories\" presents a wide range of work from a monumental artist.",
