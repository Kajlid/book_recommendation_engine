  "description": "He likes control and order. She refuses to be controlled. With his family history, Robert Farrell has faced his fair share of problems. Lucky for him, he's never been confronted with a problem he can't solve. And when someone starts manipulating his business deals and threatening the people in his life, Robert realizes it's time to gain control and take over. But when he can't control the sexy and mysterious tour guide who refuses his protection, Robert knows that it's up to him to convince her--one way or another. There is no way in Hell Malia Martin will be controlled by anyone--especially not by a Farrell, of all people. Destroying her childhood was all it took for Malia to despise the entire Farrell family--Robert included. The only thing she wants from the irresistible billionaire is distance--a great deal of distance. The only problem is: someone is threatening Malia after her one not-so-innocent encounter with Robert on the beach. Leave it to a Farrell to have a stalker--a stalker that's after her now. As Robert and Malia vie for the upper hand, their enemy closes in. Will the alpha tame the independent woman or will he die trying?",
