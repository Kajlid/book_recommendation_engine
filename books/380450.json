  "description": "Sunny the meerkat lives with his enormous family in the Kalahari desert. They are all very close... so close, in fact, that one day Sunny decides he`s had enough and packs his bags. He`s off to visit his mongoose cousins. But from the watery world of the Marsh Mongoose to the nocturnal lifestyle of the Malagasy Mongoose, Sunny just doesn`t fit in. And who`s that shadowy figure who seems to be following him around? Another brilliant picture book from the creator of the incredible WOLVES, winner of the 2005 Kate Greenaway Medal.",
