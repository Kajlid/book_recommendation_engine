  "description": "Holy freaking hell. Tanya has just had sex with Brant’s birth enemy. After they connected at such an emotional level, how is she ever going to face him again? She feels like a complete fool who just threw away any chance of real happiness.  When she returns to Brant’s manor house, she finds the kings coming to blows with one another…over her. When Brant catches Zane’s scent on Tanya’s skin all hell breaks loose and she’s caught in the middle. Both kings want her as their mate. They are willing to kill to have her. The future of the vampire species rests firmly on her shoulders so running away is not an option. Zane is bullish, pig-headed and terribly bossy yet has somehow managed to creep under her skin. Brant is tender and thoughtful, everything she always wanted in a man. The thought of seeing either of them hurt at the other’s hand is unbearable. Will she be able to choose once the time comes?  Love & War is Part 3 of a 6 part serial and is approximately 20,000 words/80 pages. The story contains strong sexual themes/language and is not intended for readers under the age of 18. M/F/M",
