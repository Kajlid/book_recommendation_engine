  "description": "The letter changed everything. Celee has always been a loner, shy and awkward, preferring her books and computer games to real life. Everything was dull, routine and boring. Celee was content. And then the letter came. An aunt that Celee never knew existed has left her an inheritance, but with that gift comes the dreams... waking dreams that strike without warning, full of chilling cries for help. Terrified, Celee seeks help, but instead of help, she finds herself trapped in another world, the land of Wunsierth. Suddenly, Celee is no longer the loner- she's an entirely different person, the kind of person she's always hoped to be. Is Wunsierth real or is it just the product of an overactive imagination? Can Celee find her way home? Does she want to?",
