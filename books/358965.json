For the first time, Jared is surrounded by men whose job it is to protect, not hurt him. One of his protectors, Sebastian James, knows a little something about abuse. Once a victim of abuse before he and his brother were taken from an abusive household and put into separate foster homes, Seb learned to harden his heart as a way of survival. Now, the soft spoken and scared Jared threatens the shell Seb spent years fortifying. When Jared's tormentor threatens him from jail, it's up to Seb and the rest of the bodyguards to keep Jared safe until he can testify at his abuser's trial. However, the close contact might be more than Seb's hard shell can withstand.",
