It’s supposed to be an exciting time in her life: fresh out of college, living in a new state, with a new job, and away from her family at last. But when she’s forced to quit her job, everything falls apart quickly. Suddenly, she’s alone in a crowd, with no one to turn to. At her lowest point, a stranger gives her a message that brings her hope. Now is the time to live life her own way. Now is the time to choose to be happy. And maybe it’s time to let a beautiful stranger be part of her life.",
