  "description": "It was just a party. A silly little celebration with champagne and my best friends. As I blew out the candles on my divorce cake, I said goodbye to my failed marriage and embraced my future with open arms.  But I didn’t know the future was going to come in the form of a mysterious stranger sitting at the end of the bar stealing glances all night.  And I didn’t know at the time, but my future even had a name... Dante Amato.  Over the weeks that followed, he pursued me with reckless abandon. He broke down my walls and ignored all the reasons we were completely wrong for each other. He made me feel something I hadn’t felt in years... something so real it terrified me.  But the moment I let him in... just when I began to let myself fall for this dashing stranger... he dropped a bombshell that changed everything.",
