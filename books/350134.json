  "description": "Dark Hills is a small, unknown town hidden by the rest of the world. A place of pure evil and madness. Where killers, monsters, and tribes of vampires stalk in the shadows. A place where a seemingly normal family hides their true nature. Where the law is as corrupt as the criminals they ensnare. These are the stories of several of the inhabitants of the town of Dark Hills. People such as Cherry, the beautiful, charming redhead who loves the taste of meat; Tom Crowning, who accidentally discovers the town and holds a terrible secret; Chris Colquin, tortured son, whose power knows no boundaries; and Mr. Katcher, murderous family man. These and many others await you in the town of Dark Hills…if you’re brave enough to meet them, that is.",
