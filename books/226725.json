He’d been betrayed by his family, exiled, and sentenced to slavery in the desert lands where he doesn't know the language or the customs.

He also does not expect the terrible stipulation attached to the man’s sale, one that would demand a heavy price of them both.Lysander is a mage more used to commanding earth, metal, and wood than people. How is he to be master of a slave and the slave’s desire, when Lysander hasn’t fully mastered his own?",
