  "description": "Grant Jefferson joins the Gay Men's Chorus as a protege of its biggest supporter, and begins causing more dischord than harmony. Determined he's going to Broadway, Grant sees the chorus as the means to his end, and doesn't care much how many of the other members he uses as his stepping stones--or how hard they get stepped on. So, when a car bomb ends Grant's recitative, there is no shortage of possible suspects, and when the chorus's board of directors hires Dick Hardesty to see what he can find out about the murder he ends up in a case as complicated as a madrigal.",
