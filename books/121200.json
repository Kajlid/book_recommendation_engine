  "description": "Jennifer Beaumont had a love that should've lasted forever. It was a love strong enough for her to betray the man she held dear in her heart in order to save him and, once again, succumb to the wishes of her \"master\"--the evil vampire Mikhail. Conor MacNaughten has held thousands of women over hundreds of years, but none ever touched him as deeply as Jennifer and no one hurt him as much as she did when she tossed him aside. Now Valentin asks him to work with the one woman he loathes in order to save another. The game begins with a kidnapping, bringing together two people who can't forgive or forget ... or can they?",
