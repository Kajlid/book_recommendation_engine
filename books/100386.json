  "title": "The Woman Who Fell Through the Sky: The Lodestar",
  "description": "The Woman Falling Through the Sky never stops moving, like the sea, like mesas and endless space. Two women are seen in binoculars standing on a mesa in New Mexico. The woman closest to the edge suddenly steps off the mountain, her body suspended in air for a timeless momentâ€”and the woman who falls, continues to fall through out the book. This thoughtful novel is as fluid as quantum physics says our world is, riding the waves of a powerful change of consciousness. It is a sexually charged pursuit and mystery fused in the lives of three lesbians. The fine threads of their journey weave a tapestry both metaphysical and down home, and this engrossing story doesn't reveal its secrets until the end. The novel is an intelligent and erotic page turner, a story of falling, flight and return.",
