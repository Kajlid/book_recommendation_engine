He’s different…changed. That Realm Prince who’d given his life to save hers has been replaced by a cold and unfeeling one whom she’s been forced to pledge herself to. Maggie vows to marry Michel so that she may rescue her father from the prison he’s so long been captive in.Her heart belongs to Luc. Taken from her by a cruel twist of fate, they’re now left with only fleeting dreams that never leave them enough time together. And it’s to Luc, paid as a father’s tribute, which the Angels have given a sacred task- The Angel Knight, willing to risk all he is to protect that which he loves most.Time is a fickle mistress- We spend the past looking forward to it, the present rushing through it, and the future wishing for more. Curses revealed and secrets uncovered, but it’s a love that only Destiny herself could have predicted that can save them all now.",
