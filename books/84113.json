  "description": "Dark City is the second of a new prequel trilogy, Repairman The Early Years by F. Paul Wilson. It's February 1992. Desert Storm is raging in Iraq but twenty-two-year-old Jack has more pressing matters at home. His favorite bar, The Spot, is about to be sold out from under Julio, Jack's friend. Jack has been something of a tag-along to this point, but now he takes the reins and demonstrates his innate talent for seeing biters get bit. With a body count even higher than in Cold City , this second novel of the Early Years Trilogy hurtles Jack into the final volume in which all scores will be settled, all debts paid.",
