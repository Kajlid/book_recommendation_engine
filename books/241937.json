  "description": "Is this house haunted? There’s a creepy old house in the neighborhood. Even in 1977, everyone still says it’s haunted. Fifteen-year-old Rendo Flex doesn’t believe it—until he sees the face in the window.Already struggling with the stigma of an institutionalized mother, Ren is tormented by his older sister, Calista, who is following their mother’s path toward mental and emotional instability. Why must he suffer for his family’s dysfunction?When Mom wants to leave the psychiatric halfway house for her first family visit in eight years, Ren decides to run away. That’s when he glimpses the ghostly face in the tower window. Ren spends the night in the abandoned house to determine whether it’s haunted by the departed former resident known as “Crazy Betty.” Ren gains perspective on his problems by helping Jack, a fourteen-year-old runaway he finds camping out there. Meanwhile, heartthrob Kayne Barber targets the fragile Calista as his first romantic conquest only to find she’s more than he can handle. After learning that Ren and Calista are related to the Adamsons, the scandalous family who once owned the Victorian house, Kayne uses his knowledge to pry the clinging Calista off his back—by painting her as the last in a long line of lunatics. Torn between his personal happiness and protecting Calista, can Ren come to terms with a sister who’s mentally ill and take a stand to defend her?",
