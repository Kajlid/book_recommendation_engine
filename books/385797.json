  "title": "Verdi: A Biography",
  "description": "Drawing on numerous original documents provided by Verdi's descendants, the Carrara-Verdi family, this long awaited biography presents a reexamination of Verdi's life not only as a composer, but as a philanthropist and son of Italy. Matz places Verdi against a backdrop of a century of fierceItalian nationalism that dictated that not only musical, but political considerations permeate his life and work. Here too is a glimpse into the composer's personal life--his turbulent relationships with his friends and family, his dedication to his music, his passion for his country.Upon his death in 1901 there were scenes of national mourning for the man whose actions had become a model, and music an inspiration to all of Italy. With an eloquent foreword by Andrew Porter, A Biography brilliantly illuminates the life of the composer, patriot, and philanthropist whonot only created the operas that would prosper generations after the artist, but who also emboldened the cultural pride of a country fighting for its freedom.",
