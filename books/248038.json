  "description": "Four dragons, one fate.  One soul shattered, four entwined.  Ariana believed she’d been lucky to find love once. No other man could compare to her mate, and his memory lived strong even after his tragic death.  Whitesong Security became her way of continuing his legacy, fighting for good causes.  Silent battles rage amongst the shifter elite over artifacts from the war that claimed Ariana’s mate. As more elite shifters make demands for Whitesong’s expertise, Ariana is forced to take a partner.  Ariana has three equally skilled applicants to choose from, but each one calls to her dragon and stirs emotions long forgotten.  It’s only a matter of time before they win her heart.  \nDragon Shattered is the first book in a reverse harem trilogy featuring one strong female dragon shifter and the three hot-as-sin male dragon shifters who win a place in her company...and in her bed.",
