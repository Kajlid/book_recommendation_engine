I don't know who to believe or who what is real.Broken and grieving I find refuge in an unlikely foe.A man who claims to be my brother, who vows to protect me, and destroy those that hurt me.But not even he can't protect me from the nightmare that is Drew Marshall.Deranged. Psychotic. Immoral.He broke my heart, and publicly humiliated me. Leaving me shattered and broken when I needed him most.I should hate him, and I do, but a sick twisted part of me craves him as well.The harder I fight to escape him, the deeper he digs his claws into me.They say the truth will set you free, but ours didn't do that.It locked us inside the cage, and tossed away the key.",
