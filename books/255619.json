  "title": "Rantings of a Mad Botanist: A Comprehensive Guide to Gardening and Land Use Practices Emphasizing Central Indiana",
  "description": "This publication emphasizes trees, shrubs and herbaceous perennials (especially native and non-invasive species) and will reduce the likelihood of expensive and time-consuming missteps. The 106 chapters contain candid assessments of common practices as well as a healthy smattering of environmental and social commentary, relevant quotes, historical references and an occasional culinary remark. You will be impressed with the unique and concise formatting and breadth of coverage. Some illustrations and many tables are included, however there are few photographs; it was deemed unnecessary given the plethora of images available on the internet.\"Filled with practical, honest, tested and true help covering almost any topic you will stumble across in your outdoor garden adventure...save yourself years of wasted time, money and frustration as you learn to choose the correct plant and planting technique the FIRST time.\" -Carol EmmertThe author is a botanist (M.S. Eastern Illinois University 1980), and former museum curator and biology teacher, who has called Indianapolis home since 1987. He lives on a three-acre property located in the northeast side of the city where he deals with the usual issues of an urban landscape-traffic, litter, light pollution and weeds, especially invasive exotics.",
