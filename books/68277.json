  "description": "The Five Watchers centers around events occurring in a secluded valley in north-central Pennsylvania called Shady Glen. The people who have lived in the valley over the centuries have unwittingly helped in the formation of a psychic entity, an amalgam of potent psychic residue and a number of remnant human consciousnesses of those who are connected with the area, immersed in evil thoughts, powerful enough to bend the will of the weak-minded, and strong enough to kill. After lying uninhabited for more than 30 years and largely faded from media notoriety, Shady Glen is chosen by a New York City-based TV production company for the latest episode of their new paranormal-focused reality TV series. In each show a group of five volunteer investigators and two psychics are brought together to investigate a haunted location. Over the course of a weekend, the investigators are filmed as they try to verify claims of paranormal activity in the chosen area.What the investigators and psychics don't know is that the production company has secretly sent in a second crew to scare them. And what they are all about to find out is that the evil is real, and is awakening.",
