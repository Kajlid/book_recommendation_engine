  "description": "Ash and Serge, aka Sparky, have always felt a pull to each other, a special connection - a draw that not only tugs at the heart, but at the denims too. Afraid to act upon these feelings and risk ruining their friendship, they fight it until faced with a life-threatening situation. Not once, but twice. Can Ash and Sparkyâ€™s relationship withstand these battles they face while slowly crawling through the depths of hell for each other? Or will pride cause them to miss their one real chance at happiness?",
