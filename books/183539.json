  "title": "A Code of Honor",
  "description": "I took my novella, The Tunnels, and completely rewrote it from scratch, making a lot of changes that were suggested by readers of the original story. This version is therefore different than The Tunnels, though there are similar aspects in both of them. I certainly consider Code of Honor to be the better of the two, and I hope you will, too. U.S. Army tunnel rat, Steve Thompson is running a Vietcong tunnel system when he begins to discover the bodies of its inhabitants. Something massacred them. As he searches through the complex, he discovers a Vietnamese nurse with two children hiding in the infirmary. He offers medical help and safety if they will come with him. Something, however, doesn't want them to get away, and Steve will soon have to go up against the creature with just his survival knife and a flare. It will be a fight to the death, but this is only the tip of the iceberg! A novella.",
