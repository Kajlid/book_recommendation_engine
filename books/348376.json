  "description": "Far, far North, when the nights are longest and the stars shine brightest, Santa begins to prepare for his big night of giving. He gathers his reindeer, feeds them parsnips and berries, and polishes his bells and his sled. Then lovingly, he chooses toys for every child in the world. For Santa loves them all, and he knows what each child at heart wants most. Then, with the thrum of magic that makes reindeers fly, he spreads the Christmas joy and warmth throughout the world--as he always has -- and always will until the end of time.  Lauren Thompson is known for her uncanny ability to reach the hearts and minds of the youngest readers.  Jon J Muth's luminescent watercolor strike all the perfect chords in this warm, reassuring Christmas story.",
