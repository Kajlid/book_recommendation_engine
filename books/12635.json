  "title": "Tip and Run: The Untold Tragedy of the Great War in Africa",
  "description": "In the aftermath of the Great War, many Britons dismissed the East Africa campaign as a remote “sideshow.” But to the other combatant powers, it was a campaign of immense importance, and it continued to rage even after the Armistice was signed. Here, for the first time and in devastating detail, is the true story of what happened, told by one of the finest historians of our time. Edward Paice follows this final phase of the European conquest of Africa, as both Allies and Germans lay waste to an area five times the size of Germany, and cause civilian suffering on an unimaginable scale.",
