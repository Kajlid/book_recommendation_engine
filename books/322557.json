  "description": "One last dance with the devil... Trapped. Silenced. Devastated. Greed has a way of snuffing out even the most noble souls, and in Diablo’s world, you either bend to his will or you’re dead. Ben’s been chained to his enforcer role longer than he ever intended and panic is starting to set in. Will he ever be free again, or is he simply a pawn in another man’s sick and twisted game? More importantly, how will he earn forgiveness from the one woman who can save his soul? With the Wolves disbanded, Hazel’s only hope for revenge lies between two beating hearts—the man who’s loved her since she was a teen and the man who slips into her subconscious at night, heating her from the inside out. She’s torn between family loyalties, enacting revenge, and relinquishing her bruised and beaten heart. Diablo won’t see another day of power if she can help it, but only one person has the kind of access she needs to infiltrate and destroy this crooked kingdom. Screw a dance... this means war.",
