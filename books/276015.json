  "title": "Rebus's Scotland",
  "description": "This evocative and stunningly produced book highlights the places that inspired the settings for the Inspector Rebus novels. It is the modern-day Scotland that the tourist never sees. The book is part biography of Rebus, revealing how he came into being, who he is, and what his Scotland is like. It is also partly an autobiography of Ian Rankin, explaining where he comes from and what his inspirations are. Beautifully illustrated throughout, with pictures that reflect the text, this is the perfect gift for anyone interested in Scotland or in the novels of Ian Rankin.",
