  "description": "A legend from the past is a kingdom's only hope…Cora knows her grandmother's stories of the noble dragon riders by heart, even though most people consider them just a myth.

But her first attempt nearly ends in tragedy when she’s trapped by an angry dragon. They are both stunned when she unlocks the secret of communicating with him.As Cora and the dragon, Alaric, grow closer, they uncover more secrets from the kingdom’s past. There was a dark conclusion to the dragon rider legacy, brought about by a malicious force that sought power at any cost. That force still holds the kingdom in thrall—and has no intention of allowing the dragon riders to rise again.Can Cora and Alaric reignite a legend from the past, before it’s too late?",
