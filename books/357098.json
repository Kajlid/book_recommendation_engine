  "description": "Now Canadians need no longer wait for the CBC to re-run recordings of Max Ferguson’s notorious radio shows (assuming that the tapes have not all been destroyed by court order). A full dose of his lunacy, depravity, and flagrant disregard for CBC management can now be enjoyed at any hour of the day or night simply by reading a copy of And Now… Here’s Max, his scandalous memoir of a life in broadcasting at the CBC.",
