  "description": "Jan Wescott has chosen for her newest work the tempestuous love story between Edward IV, the tall youthful warrior-king, and Elizabeth Woodville, the beautiful widowed mother of two young children, an \"enemy\" Lancastrian in the War of the Roses-a match that was to have tragic repercussions for all England. As with all of Miss Westcott's novels, THE WHITE ROSE is filled with dramatic and vivid scenes and is researched so thoroughly it can stand as a full-fledged biography. She is at her best when writing a love story, and here she has one of the most extraordinary love stories in English history. Like all women in the realm, Elizabeth loved the king but refused to bear him a child out of wedlock. And so their marriage, conducted in secret, was forced to stand the test of not only personal but political pressures. Upon learning of it, the powerful Earl of Warwick, who had already arranged Edward's more advantageous betrothal to a French princess, was incited to take up arms against his own king! THE WHITE ROSE, symbol of the House of York, is a sweeping novel of high drama, passion, and intrigue; spanning thirty years of bloody English history, it is filled with a cast of extraordinary characters-mad King Henry VI; Edward's treacherous brother, the villainous Richard III; the doomed princes in the tower. Unquestionably the most ambitious work by Jan Westcott, whose previous novels have won raves.",
