  "description": "After New York becomes infested with the living dead and the government abandons its citizens, the whole country erupts in panic. Lucas, a shop assistant at one of New York’s most popular, expensive department stores - Dillard’s - unintentionally becomes the ticket to safety for Jason, Zach, Robert and Brian when they escape from their college campus after it is attacked by the undead. Feelings bloom and old grudges resurface in the three days they're trapped together in the store, and it turns out their ticket to safety is not what it seems.",
