  "description": "This is a Short Story about the realities of modern heroism. There is alot of ironic comedy and a deep message about the state of man here. With a name like the Valiant Defender and a huge logo that says V.D. across his chest, you can imagine how Marvin Smithers is recieved when he foils a crime and becomes a national media hero. I would offer it to you for free, but the Amazon DTP system won't let me... Thanks M.R. Mathias",
