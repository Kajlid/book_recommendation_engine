  "description": "LeKrista never thought Roman would kidnap her, but it seems there's no depth to which he won't stoop. She's stuck in a fortress in the middle of only God knows where with no way to contact her family or her new fiance and let them know she's alright. To add insult to injury, Roman has brought her arch nemesis to keep her company. Forced to make friends with Eddy, the man who has made her life miserable for years, she bides her time until a rescue can be arranged. But unrealized feelings for her vampire captor make things complicated. Or perhaps it's Stockholm Syndrome. She can't really be sure. Just to make matters worse, the vampires are ready to go through with their plan to rule the world with an iron fang, and once again, she's caught in the middle of the war for power. The truth of her involvement is becoming clear, but she may lose more than her freedom in her quest to stop the the powerful undead on her own.",
