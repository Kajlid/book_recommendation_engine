  "description": "Jasper lives a good life. Between work and his longtime partner, one would think he wants for nothing, but that’s not entirely true. His love-life is on borrowed time and his work life is anything but exciting.  When he learns of his favorite Auntie Jane’s death, he honors her wishes and makes a trip to the States to see the quaint floral shop she’s left for him. However, when he arrives in Philadelphia, his beloved auntie didn’t leave him a floral shop; she left him a gay nightclub that’s in dire need of financial help.  Desperate to rid himself of the headache, he searches for a way out, but soon discovers that his auntie was more than an eccentric busybody; she was an advocate for those often overlooked by society and her nightclub is their safe harbor. Now, he must save the place or destroy his auntie’s legacy. The only problem is he’s distracted by Charlie, a playboy surgeon, who enjoys toying with his emotions, while simultaneously piquing his curiosity.  As Jasper begins to lose hope, startling news changes everything once again and leaves him contemplating giving love another chance.",
