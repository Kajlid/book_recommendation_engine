  "description": "Living in the small town of Lymon, Oklahoma didn't afford twenty-four year old Joey much of a sex life. Actually, it afforded him no sex life. Joey decided to change his virginal status with a trip to Tulsa, and Club Maverick sounded like just the kind of place he'd been looking for. Stepping into the place, Joey's eyes zero in on the tall bartender. Oh yeah, this was definitely the place to sow some wild oats.",
