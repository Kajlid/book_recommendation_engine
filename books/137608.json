  "title": "To Desire",
  "description": "To Desire by Vatsal Surti is a distinctive and thought provoking piece that delves into the meaning of existence and how two people perceive events around them. Do feelings lead to appropriate actions or do our actions take the place of experiencing emotions? More a collection of thoughts than a story with a beginning and an end, To Desire reflects the thought processes of the characters and the realizations they arrive at together. As with a good poem, re-reading illuminates nuances of thought that may have been minimized previously and provides more of an opportunity to reflect and compare personal feelings and experiences with those of the characters. -Readers' Favorite",
