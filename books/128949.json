  "title": "A Patchwork Fish Tale",
  "description": "This aquatic tale for children takes place in an usual aquarium full of duck fish, hippo fish, tiger fish, and one very large and hungry fish. The story was first published in 1982, and was the creation of artist and author Stewart Moskowitz, who is best known for his fanciful and lighthearted paintings of animals. The book was part of a four book series, each volume's story being inspired by a Moskowitz painting on its cover. None of the four paintings had been intended to relate to a book, but when asked by Simon and Schuster to create stories, the artist wrote his first books. Patchwork Fish is arguably the most compelling of them. In this new edition, the rebuilding of every color and every detail was directed by the author, with the goal of creating an improved version of the original, but without major changes. The restored pictures are vibrant and crisp, with some occasional revisions of coloring, but in general very closely matched to the original. The text is almost unchanged, with just a few very slight alterations, mostly of punctuation. Like all Moskowitz stories, you can expect a happy ending. A 28-page story, published by Stewart Moskowitz Media.",
