  "description": "Just suppose Mark Twain returned from heaven for a brief vacation on Earth. What would the father of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer have to say about our mixed-up, modern world?Just ask Tom Drop, an adventure-craving 12-year-old from Calavaras County, California, who travels with Twain (the wide-eyed visitor) on a whirlwind, seven-day tour of Twain’s favorite American cities. Sound crazy? Great! Then you’re ready to read Tom’s hilarious, day-by-day account of their ridiculous adventures.Whatever your age, \"Mark Twain Returns\" will carry you away on a joyful journey where mischief, courage, humor, and old-fashioned common sense tangle with modern-day insanity in all its forms. Set in the quieter, pre-cell-phone days of the 1980’s, \"Mark Twain Returns\" is a sweeping, non-stop adventure for boys and girls 12 and older, and an outrageous satirical romp for grown-up kids who, like Twain, know good mischief when they find it.",
