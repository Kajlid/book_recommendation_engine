  "description": "Victoria Colletti: Gabriel Maddox was dangerous. I knew it the moment I laid eyes on him. A wealthy playboy with a reputation that preceded him, you could hear it whispered from the tongues of every socialite in New York City. He was known to take pleasure in dominating those around him, and when I crashed into him on the street, he made it very clear he wanted to dominate me. It was the last thing that I needed, and yet it awakened an urge within me I didn’t know how to resist. It was a recipe that could only lead to disaster. Because you see, I lived my life by a very simple set of rules. Don’t get noticed. Don’t get attached. And most importantly, never stay in the same place for too long. You might say that I had more skeletons in my little suitcase than most people had in their entire closet. So what should a girl like me do when I run into a man like Gabriel? Run as fast and as far as I can. Except, I didn’t want to run. Not this time. He made me a proposition. One that was too good to refuse. But the longer I spent with him, the more I saw the vulnerable parts that he had hidden away. He was pulling me closer, tempting my resolve. But it didn’t change anything between us… it couldn’t. The people in my life could only ever be temporary. And whether I liked it or not, Gabriel was no exception to that rule. Previously titled as 'Victoria's Downfall' The Hunted Series",
