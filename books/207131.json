The sight of the man in the high-rise across the street is driving her wild. She longs to feel his touch up close and personal. To win him over, she’ll need to shake off her wallflower sensibilities and become the seductress she never imagined she could be. The only trouble will be finding the perfect way to meet him…   Or are you going to join in?   Sex is easy for millionaire entrepreneur Trey Riordan. Finding something of substance, however, seems impossible.

But when the time comes, neither of them will be truly ready for what follows…From the Trade Paperback edition.",
