  "description": "There is nothing darker than the woods, until you meet your worst fear.  Jackson Bower has a lot on his mind lately. His younger brother hasn’t been the same since his mother’s death. His father’s drinking is out of control. Then there’s Jackson’s girlfriend and the grief that ties them together even as it threatens to drive them apart.  He distances himself, hoping for a little perspective at the family lodge. But when their father gets drunk and dangerous, he and his brother escape into the woods.  Night creeps in, and the rains come fast. Artie slips down a ravine. He’s wounded and the brothers seek shelter in a cave, only to find someone else already taking refuge there.  A desperate man with plans to destroy their town.  Jackson must get him and his wounded brother out of the cave and over the mountain to warn everyone in time. Without getting them both killed first.",
