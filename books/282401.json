Now she must write to stay alive. Mysteriously cast into the ancient Book of Fables, Fate can hardly tell what's real and what's not. She’s trapped inside a magical world of darkly spun fairy tales. While Fate loves adventures, she prefers reading about them while munching on chocolate. Unfortunately, there’s no closing the book on this very real cast of frightening sorceresses, faeries and creatures of legend.And then there's Finn McKeen. The golden-haired Scottish boy who looks like he stepped straight from her journal of secret daydreams. Entranced by this achingly familiar stranger, who’s as inexplicably drawn to Fate as she is to him, they run the gauntlet of this menacing storybook realm, changing each fable’s dreadful ending into a happily-ever-after with the unpredictable power of the Words of Making. But Fate soon learns that while some words make dreams come true, others create nightmares. Can she survive long enough to write her own happy ending, or will she spell her doom?Brimming with fierce magic, breath-taking action and a heart-wrenching romance, FATE’S FABLES, is perfect for readers of Brigid Kemmerer, Sarah J. Maas and Holly Black.Includes the thrilling bonus prequel, Chaos In The Keep, (available in this Special Edition version only).",
