  "title": "The Nature of Cape Cod",
  "description": "A well-known Cape naturalist, geologist, and public educator has written the first comprehensive natural history of the area, describing life and natural processes in its varied environments, from ocean beach to cranberry bog to deep woods. The Nature of Cape Cod provides maps and narrative descriptions of 50 sites that invite exploration; it will take the reader to hidden gems and reveal new aspects of favorite places. Generously illustrated with drawings and maps, the book can be used by anyone wanting to go beyond the paved roads: walkers, paddlers, and nature lovers of all sorts. It should appeal to year-round and seasonal residents alike, and also to the thousands of short-term visitors who wish they had a guide to the nature of Cape Cod.",
