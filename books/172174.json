Sara's humdrum world is turned upside down when she meets a stranger who says he knows her from the past and that she'd disappeared without a trace twenty years ago. She's bewildered and confused; why would someone play such a cruel prank on her? Jack spent nearly two decades searching for her. But when he finally locates her, he is faced with a gut-wrenching discovery: Sara has absolutely no memory of him - or their life together. Like a puzzle, Jack and Sara must piece back together the shreds of a life that was ripped apart. Their heartwarming story is one about loss, loneliness, and renewed love.",
