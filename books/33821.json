  "description": "\"Are You My Baby's Mother?\" Billionaire Alex Dalton has had more than his share of women. But now he needs just one-Julie Bartlett, the fiery redhead who'd once given him the hottest night of his life. Was she the mother who had left a baby on the Dalton doorstep? When a paternity test proves inconclusive, he needs Julie's DNA to determine if it is Alex or his twin brother who's now a father. But when Julie refuses to cooperate, Alex vows to tempt her into giving him everything he wants. Includes a bonus short by Susan Mallery: The Sheikh's Virgin.",
