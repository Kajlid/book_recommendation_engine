  "description": "When Violet Eden loses the key to the gates of Hell she is forced to make a choice that carries apocalyptic consequences When you're hanging off the edge of a volcano, how do you make the most important decision of your life? For Violet Eden the decisions between right and wrong are getting harder and harder. Because apparently being a half-angel Grigori doesn't always make you right.  Where is the good in having to choose between the life of her best friend and saving humanity? How does she balance a soul-crushing need for her Grigori partner, Lincoln, and the desire to keep him safe at all costs? And what if the darkest exiled angel of all, Phoenix, isn't as bad as she thought? Both sides―Angels vs. Exiles―are racing to decipher an ancient scripture that would allow anyone banished to the Underworld to return. And at the very Violet. She only has one chance to make the right choice...
