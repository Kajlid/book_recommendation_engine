  "description": "Andrew Loog Oldham was nineteen when he discovered and became the manager and producer of an unknown band called The Rolling Stones. His radical vision transformed them from a penniless South London blues combo to the greatest rock ’n’ roll band in the world. Ultra-hip, flash, brash and seeped in Sixties style, he was a hustler of genius, addicted to scandal, notoriety and innovation.",
