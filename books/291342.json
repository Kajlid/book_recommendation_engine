Then he rescues a beautiful young woman from the Soul Eaters, his ancient enemies, and she sets off a bloodlust and a desire he hasn't felt for centuries.Photographer Kaira Sorenson's life takes a nightmare turn when she's saved by a…vampire. But she’s seen too much, and now she’s his prisoner. All of which means she should be afraid of Henrik, but he’s regal, tormented, and hot as hell, and she can't deny her intense attraction to him. And then she learns that her blood may be his only salvation… Kaira knows what it’s like to be sick, so she agrees to help Henrik. But when feeding turns into a scorching night of so much more, she must decide if she’s willing to be his forever—but will the king release her so she can freely choose?",
