He uncovered clues to the intergalactic childhood she’s forgotten, where smiles calm, touches kill, and they were soulmates. Now, Cole’s power-hungry father has erased her from his mind as punishment, and her past holds the key to restore his memories. But revealing the truth will change her into someone she fears.  Without Cole’s knowledge of their history, Thea has a chance for him to love her as the girl she is now. Omission, however, can tear them apart and destroy the human race.  Thea’s fear morphs to terror when they encounter his father, and she must choose between Cole’s past and her future. In her heart, she knows the answer. Even if her decision may cost her true love, her life, or the world’s fate.",
