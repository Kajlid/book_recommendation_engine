  "description": "Getting a job with a famous rock band on their first European tour sounds like a dream come true. And for Becca Hall it is - at first. Using her smarts, organization skills and unflappable nature, the plus-size beauty makes herself indispensable quickly.It's everything she wanted. A way to see more of the world, get a foothold back into the business she grew up around, and a chance to get away from things both dreary and painful back at home.But when a playful flirtation with the band's bass player, Dex, turns into something more, everything is at risk. Her job, her carefully guarded secret, and her heart.Note: Hard Rocked is the fourth story in the Rocked series, but it is not necessary to read the other parts first. But you still should. They're fun.",
