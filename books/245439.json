  "description": "With seven super-human children, it has never been easy for Carol and Hammer Winters to keep a low profile. When your always-hungry teenage son will eat literally anything, your firefighter husband can walk (or punch) through walls, and your baby keeps turning invisible in the bath, there’s no avoiding the occasional eyebrow-raising incident.But when local journalism student Charlie Pane develops an interest in Hammer’s firefighting heroics—and Carol’s annual Christmas pageant—the family’s cover takes a sharp turn towards catastrophic failure. Worst of all, their oldest daughter Annabel seems to be as interested in Charlie as he is in her.If they can’t find a way to forestall the inevitable, The Super-Human Advisement and Regulation Department may descend in full force, and the Winters family will be packing their bags by Christmas. And if there's anything the whole family can agree on, it's that no one wants to move.",
