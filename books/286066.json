  "description": "After an AI defense project goes wrong, indefinitely destroying all modern tools of war, knocking weapons technology back to the Iron Age, a desperate president, enacts a draconian executive order consigning millions of student loan debtors, & low income households to slavery or mass incarceration, and selling extraordinary political power to the highest bidder...sparking a revolution! Chessed, a nerdy prepper, and ex-gang member, finds himself leading a rebellion against martial law, fighting the fascists, and corrupt police that threaten to turn his inner-city home into a playground for hate and despotism. Chessed uses a host of skills acquired from his checkered past in the streets, and his love of SCA, and HEMA to wage an epic battle against tyranny and oppression, finding a new meaning to being ride or die for his hood! Imaginative, byzantine, and immersive, The Road of Resistance is a haunting tapestry, woven from grimdark fantasy, dystopian science fiction, and the instrumentalities of race, urban life, and hip-hop culture! Populated by vibrant, diverse characters, humor, and rousing action that will grip you, and take you on a provocative, tactile journey in an all new dystopian world!Get your copy, and walk The Road of Resistance today!",
