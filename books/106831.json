  "description": "A deliciously twisted and seductive historical tale of piano playing, passions, and female powerThe setting of Sedition by Katharine Grant: London, 1794.The problem: Four nouveau riche fathers with five marriageable daughters.The plan: The young women will learn to play the piano, give a concert for young Englishmen who have titles but no fortunes, and will marry very well indeed.The complications: The lascivious (and French) piano teacher; the piano makerâ€™s jealous (and musically gifted) daughter; the one of these marriageable daughters with a mating plan of her own.While it might be a truth universally acknowledged that a man in possession of a title and no money must be in want of a fortune, what does a sexually awakened young woman want? In her wickedly alluring romp through the late-Georgian London, Italian piano making, and tightly-fitted Polonaise gowns, Katharine Grant has written a startling and provocative debut.",
