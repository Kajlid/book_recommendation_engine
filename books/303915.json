  "description": "Darling Arrow,I shouldn’t be writing this. It’s not as if I’m ever going to send you this letter, and there are a million reasons why.First of all, I was sent to this reform school as a punishment for a petty, totally inconsequential crime. Not to ogle the principal’s hot son around the campus.Second of all, you’re a giant jerk. You’re arrogant and moody and so cold. Sometimes I think I shouldn’t even like you.But strangely your coldness sets me on fire.The way your athletic body moves on the soccer field, and the way your powerful thighs sprawl across that motorcycle of yours, make me go inappropriately breathless.But that’s not the worst part.The worst part is that you, Arrow Carlisle, are not only the principal’s hot son. You also happen to be the love of my sister’s life.And I really shouldn’t be thinking about my sister’s boyfriend, or rather fiancé (I overheard a conversation about the ring that I shouldn’t have).Now if I can only stop writing you these meaningless letters that I’ll never send and you’ll never read…Never yours, Salem This is a STANDALONE novel set in the world of St. Mary's.",
