  "description": "In 1915 on a rugged beach in south-western Turkey, young soldiers fighting for their countries forged what we now know at the Anzac spirit. The mateship, loyalty and courage they displayed in the trenches formed the bedrock of the Australian and New Zealand national characters.In 'The Spirit of Gallipoli', bestselling author Patrick Lindsay examines this momentous conflict, bringing to life the heroes and the villians; the tragedy and the glory. In his simple yet powerful retelling, Lindsay shows that our understanding of the Anzac spirit can only be complete once we understand the spirit of Gallipoli.",
