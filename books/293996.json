  "description": "Ben is a Pebble Gifting Season reject. He wandered the cold streets of Anchorage for three weeks straight, hoping an alpha would give him a pebble. But no one did.Axel is banished. He lost his temper four years ago and almost killed the alpha who abandoned his brother. Now he can only spend a handful of days per year in Anchorage, which is when he comes upon a sad penguin shifter in a wrinkled tuxedo.When Cyrano runs into Ben and Axel by chance, he decides to lure them both to bed. Clearly, Ben needs someone to show him how irresistibly attractive he is, and Axel needs to be reminded that he’s a good man, despite what happened in the past.Cyrano’s sure he can do both at the same time. On the same night. After all, he’s good at multitasking. It’s a perfect plan. Until he falls in love. With both of them.A Home for Ben is an MMM romance with an accidental pet tortoise, two omegas who get pregnant at the same time, and cameos from previous characters in the Alaskan Pebble Gifters series. This book is the third in the series, and will only make sense if you’ve read the first two books.Please note that A Home for Ben includes both traditional MPreg and MPreg of the penguin egg variety.",
