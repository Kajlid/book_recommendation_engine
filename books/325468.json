  "description": "I might be chained, but I’m no prisoner.\nThey won't let me leave this pack of demonic beasts with their red glowing eyes and their pawing touch. They keep me locked up during the day and surrounded by their heat at night.They keep me...Confined.Controlled.Consumed.Men who are monsters and monsters who look like men. Trading my fear for their sick, demented games. I hate them. Hate it when they make me run. Hate it when they call it a ‘hunt’. But the capture.The capture is something I can’t stop thinking about.Fangs and claws. Their hunger is insatiable.Until the night I saw him.A man standing in the middle of a labyrinth where we hid.A man dressed in white.He’s here to save me. Here to get me away from these monsters. I just know it. I’ll run to him, the first chance I get. I’ll get away from those demonic creatures…I’ll save myself anyway I can.Or I’ll die trying.",
