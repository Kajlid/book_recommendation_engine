  "title": "Awakening: A Daily Guide to Conscious Living",
  "description": "Bringing one’s personal life into alignment with the natural laws and universal principles is the great challenge for today’s seekers. Information overload, a lack of time, and an inability to connect with essential spiritual teachings conspire to make the journey to consciousness a daunting one. In Awakening: A Daily Guide to Conscious Living, preeminent teacher Shakti Gawain offers gentle daily guidance for that journey. A classic book of days, Awakening is organized around the calendar year and the seasons. Each of the 365 entries is clear and simple, consisting of a heading, a short message, and an affirmation or question. The author shows readers how to recognize and release old patterns and beliefs, and to open to new and nurturing ways in all areas of their lives. Equal parts affirmation and stimulation, these daily doses of wisdom put readers on the path to greater awareness of their own sense of spiritual truth.",
