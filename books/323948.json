The four men that keep me grounded, rooted to the core of my history, my legacy, and I’ll save them no matter the cost.Truths uncovered lead to more secrets, more lies, more pain, and the tangled web of Echoes Cove has me trapped tighter in its bindings.The monsters of this world have no idea how far I’m willing to go. How hard I’m willing to fight.One thing is for sure, they have all underestimated me. Soon they will see my truth, and I’ll be the one with the crown.",
