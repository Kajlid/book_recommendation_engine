My journey started in the bars and rock clubs on Long Island, New york, and eventually took me to arenas and stadiums around the world working for KISS, Alice Cooper, Stone Temple Pilots, and many other groups. This is my story. From club gigs after school as a teenager, to concerts on every continent on the planet. I've been there and back, and survived to tell the story. Hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed living it.",
