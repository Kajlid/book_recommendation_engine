  "description": "It's summer vacation, and Bailey has the house all to himself. What better way than to take advantage of lots of alone time with his best friend, Claud. The two of them plan to have so much fun before their last year of high school in the fall.Now that Bailey and Claud came out to each other, there are many new things to explore in their lives. They can relate to each other's personal struggles, and they're able to confide in each other more than ever. They can also check out other boys together, because why not?But maybe instead of checking out other boys, they can check each other out and take their friendship to a whole new level. Testing the waters with a serious flirt here and there could be a promising start. They've already flirted harmlessly before, after all. It would just be the next step. If only being virgins didn't make them more anxious.Bailey also has a crush on Claud, so it's not only physical on his part. He just doesn't know how to go about it. He's more outgoing than the shyer Claud, yet he doesn't feel like it in a unique situation like this.Who will make the first move? Where will things lead between them? What will happen to their friendship? What they do know is that this summer isn't going to be the same as any other hot one.It's going to be hot in a whole new way.Boys in the Clouds is a 3,700-word short story. (18+ only!)",
