  "description": "From one of the most acclaimed and profound writers in the world of comics comes a thrilling and provocative exploration of humankind’s great modern the superhero The first superhero comic ever published, Action Comics no. 1 in 1938, introduced the world to something both unprecedented and Superman, a caped god for the modern age. In a matter of years, the skies of the imaginary world were filled with strange mutants, aliens, and Batman, Wonder Woman, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, and the X-Men—the list of names as familiar as our own. In less than a century, they’ve gone from not existing at all to being everywhere we on our movie and television screens, in our videogames and dreams.

In this exhilarating work of a lifetime, Morrison draws on art, science, mythology, and his own astonishing journeys through this shadow universe to provide the first true history of the superhero—why they matter, why they will always be with us, and what they tell us about who we are . . . and what we may yet become.",
