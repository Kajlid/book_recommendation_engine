Shipping children to this land of plenty offers them a future far from the temptations of London's overcrowded streets. Widow, Mary Trupper, is wary, but the promise of good food and an education for her children is strong.Are the fields green? Is the food plentiful? For some, yes. For others, the harsh winters reflect the welcome.Based on the true story of the British Home Children who were shipped to Canada in the 1870s.Regular spikes into top Kindle sales ranking when mentioned in British Home Children historical research groups and blogs.",
