This enlightening companion to Julia Cameron's bestselling Prayers Trilogy (Blessings, Heart Steps, and Transitions) is for anyone who has yearned for a more spiritual life, for anyone who has felt that their prayers have gone unheard. In this luminous book God answers our prayers with a prayer of His own: It is His greatest wish that we recognize the divine grace and goodness present within all of us.  In Answered Prayers, the divine creator who watches over us-regardless of religion or creed-reveals that He is with us in every moment, that He in fact never leaves our side. In a language that is at once simple and eloquent, He responds to all of our fears and all of our longings are understood, and are answered. Answered Prayers is truly a gift from God.  Award-winning writer Julia Cameron is the author of twenty books, both fiction and nonfiction, including the bestselling works on the creative process The Artist's Way, Walking in This World, The Vein of Gold, The Right to Write, and The Sound of Paper.
