  "title": "Shattered in the Dark: Mara Irons",
  "description": "There's a darkness within Mara Irons, something that she can't seem to control. After a bizarre accident that left Mara's friends dead, and her with no memory of the events that happened that night, strange things have been occurring. People are turning up dead at her will, a mysterious masked man is stalking her, and Mara can't help but think her biology partner, the dark and edgy Shade Huxley, has a part in all of this. The familiar faces of Mara's dead friends start to haunt her, warning her with threats that she doesn't understand. As Mara's memories start to resurface they turn out to be more horrific and terrifying than she expects, making the haunting faces seem like no big deal- or so she thinks. Until one of the faces turns out to be her own. Will Mara uncover the secrets of her past before they consume her? Or will the \"thing\" inside her take full control?",
