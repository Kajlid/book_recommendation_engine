  "title": "The Old Man and Me",
  "description": "A sly, funny novel about an American girl trying to make it in 1960s London–and discovering that she's in over head. In The Dud Avocado , Elaine Dundy revealed the life of the young expatriate in Paris in all its hilarious and heartbreaking drama. With The Old Man and Me , written when Dundy was living in England in the early 1960s, she tackles the American girl in London, a bit older but certainly no wiser.Honey Flood (if that’s her real name) arrives in London with only her quick wits and a scheme. To get what she wants, she’ll have to seduce the city’s brightest literary star, no matter how many would-be bohemians she has to charm, how many smoky jazz clubs she has to brave, or how many Lady Something-Somethings she has to humor. But with success within her reach, Honey finds that in making the Soho scene, she’s made a big mistake.",
