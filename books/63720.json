  "title": "The Radically Awesome Adventures of the Animal Princess",
  "description": "An awesome series takes root! Animal Princess first appeared in The Totally Awesome Epic Quest of the Brave Boy Knight and was described as \"a girl with strange powers and a subversive sense of humor\" (Kirkus). Now she has her own trio of fulsomely funny adventures (with a cameo by Brave Boy Knight) set in a magical funkadelic kingdom ruled by Queen Mom and King Dad. Though they sometimes force her to wear awful, frilly dresses, Animal Princess prefers magical pajamas, quests, and battling three-headed wizards. Pink? Not her thing! It's radically awesome, big, funny fun!",
