  "title": "An Accomplished Woman",
  "description": "A sparkling tale of wit and romance from a latter-day Jane Austen As a young woman, clever, self-reliant Lydia Templeton scandalized Regency society by rejecting the countyâ€™s most eligible bachelor. Years later, although Lydia would prefer to avoid entanglements of the heart altogether, her godmother begs her to help her young ward make a suitable match. Though the prospect fills Lydia with horror, she can scarcely refuse, but things turn out even worse than she fears when her ward proves surprisingly tricky to manage and the confirmed spinster begins to suspect that her own heart may not be the closed book she thought it was. Brilliantly written and observed, An Accomplished Woman is a delightfully accomplished comedy of manners.",
