  "title": "I Am Radar",
  "description": "In 1975, a black child is mysteriously born to white parents. His name is Radar Radmanovic. Falling in with a secretive group of puppeteers and scientists, he is soon forced to confront the true nature of his identity.Though Radar is raised in suburban New Jersey, his story rapidly becomes entangled with events stretching from Belgrade in a time of siege to arctic Norway, from Cambodia in the years before the murderous Khmer Rouge regime to the modern-day Congo. It explores the furthest reaches of quantum physics, forgotten history, puppetry and human experience. Itâ€™s also about one man, one family and how far you may need to travel to know yourself.I Am Radar is a story greater than all of its remarkable parts, a breath-taking, highly addictive joyride through the worst humanity has to offer only to arrive at a place of wonder.",
