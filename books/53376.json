  "description": "In this deeply heartfelt story about what it takes to build a new life, the death of her abuela brings a young woman home, where she must face the past in order to move forward and build a life that’s truly her own. Ten years after she immigrated to the States, twenty-eight-year-old Vi goes home to Barranquilla, Colombia, at the news of her grandmother’s death. Abuela was the one who insisted Vi leave in the first place, but now Vi learns she’s inherited Caminito, their failing family restaurant. Vi can’t understand Abuela’s intentions, but she resolves to honor those final wishes and stay—long enough, at least, to save Caminito. Her life in New York with a serious boyfriend and bourgeoning career is stable enough to wait for her return. But the longer Vi is home, the more she struggles with what that word means. Abuela’s ghost is never far, reminding her of the choices she’s made and the ones that lie ahead. As she reconnects with her family, community, and her first love, Vi will have to decide if she truly did leave for her own good all those years ago…and whether this time she should stay.",
