  "description": "Jake and I are married now. For real this time. Everything that happened - my dad dying, our fake marriage to keep me out of foster care, the divorce, all of that is finally behind us.  This is our happily ever after.  We both decided weâ€™re ready for a baby. It's just that... I was pregnant once before, and it didn't end well. It crushed both of us. So much that I almost lost Jake forever. Now I'm riddled with all of this fear and doubt.  I did something crazy. Jake doesn't know about it so I'll have to tell him. And he'll have to forgive me. Because we both want this family so much.  Right?",
