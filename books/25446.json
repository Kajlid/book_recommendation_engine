  "description": "Bringing up a child, lying to the boss, placing an order in a fast-food in Etgar Keret's new collection, daily life is complicated, dangerous, and full of yearning. In his most playful and most mature work yet, the living and the dead, silent children and talking animals, dreams and waking life coexist in an uneasy world. Overflowing with absurdity, humor, sadness, and compassion, the tales in Suddenly, a Knock on the Door establish Etgar Keret―declared a \"genius\" by The New York Times ―as one of the most original writers of his generation.",
