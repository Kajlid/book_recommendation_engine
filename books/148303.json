  "description": "Hopper now knows that he is definitely not an ordinary pet shop mouse. With the underground rat civilization of Atlantia all but destroyed and Titus dethroned, Hopper, Zucker, Firren, and a spattering of Rangers are now working to rebuild. But it's difficult. REALLY difficult. Queen Felina, the evil feral royal, has begun amassing a new band of street cats. And without the sinister 'peace accord' in place, it is open season on the rodents.Meanwhile, Hopper's siblings are on quests of their own: Pinkie has led a coup and is ruling the Mus with an iron paw, and Pup is no longer the sweet, innocent brother Hopper once knew.With the support of some new upland allies, including a funky cat named Ace, can Hopper make the tunnels safe again and fulfill a destiny he never imagined?",
