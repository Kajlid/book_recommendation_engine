  "description": "Olivia Price’s world crumbles when her husband is suddenly taken from her in a tragic accident. Detaching herself from the world around her, Olivia becomes nothing but a hollow shell left to dwell on the past. Her relationship with her best friend, Karen, becomes the one stable area of her life. That is, until a man turns up just in time to save Olivia from what seems to be an innocent accident.  Alexander Stone seems to appear out of nowhere, soon becoming Olivia’s handsome savior. He brings with him feelings of guilt, a passion that she can‘t seem to keep under control, as well as a familiarity from her past that continues to haunt her. Little does she know that he holds secrets of his own and he will soon introduce her into a world that she never could have imagined. It’s a world full of good versus evil, supernatural powers, and situations that revolve around life and death.  With reapers and demons at their heels and her dreams becoming reality, Olivia must accept the fact that this new world does actually exist. She must also become experienced in it fast, because it seems to be centered on her. Not only are there evil beings out there, but there are fallen archangels in need of one thing; her soul! If she is to survive, Olivia must begin to trust Alexander and the Guardians, to believe in her dreams, and most importantly, stay hidden from the Fallen.",
