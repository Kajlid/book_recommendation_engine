  "description": "High school was never meant to suck this hard. Then again, never was being eighteen. With adulthood came Brett. Tall, tanned, tantalizing and my biggest nightmare. He wanted his life back and so did I. Our parents, however, ensured that both our lives would be bound by their ties. I knew I couldn’t break them. Brett knew that whatever bond they had could at least be weakened if he tried to break me.  I wasn’t the toughest cookie in the jar.  My skin wasn’t made of rubber or stone. Not pliant, not hard. Easily scarred, just like my heart.  One night is all it took to change everything.  One night with Brett’s hands around my throat.  One night with me not fighting to come up for air.  One night of being broken in all the right ways.  Vengeance will come later.  There’s no doubt about that.",
