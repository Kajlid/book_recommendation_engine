  "description": "Curious about her enduring love for Richard Brautigan’s work, Allison Green embarks on a roadtrip tracing the route of his most famous work, Trout Fishing in America. As she travels, she examines the way we relate to the things that influence us—the ancestors who created us, the past that shaped us, the writers who changed the way we saw the world—and how these things intertwine to make us who we are. The Ghosts Who Travel With Me speaks to a forgotten generation while breaking the confines of traditional memoir.",
