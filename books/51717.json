  "title": "The Shutter of Snow",
  "description": "In a prose form as startling as its content, \"The Shutter of Snow\" portrays the post-partum psychosis of Marthe Gail, who after giving birth to her son, is committed to an insane asylum. Believing herself to be God, she maneuvers through an institutional world that is both sad and terrifying, echoing the worlds of \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"The Snake Pit.\"Based upon the author's own experience after the birth of her son in 1924, \"The Shutter of Snow\" retains all the energy it had when first published in 1930.",
