  "description": "Everyone has a dirty little secret...I just have two.One secret I met at a party.We lied about our names.Trespassed onto a Ferris wheel.And he made me see stars while I stared up into the night's sky.The other secret wooed me with picnics in an orchard.With the taste of honey on his lips.He held me close until I had to say goodbye.Even though I wished I could stay forever.The worst thing about having these dirty little secrets is that where one goes, the other follows.And now they're both at my school...USA Today Bestselling author, Trilina Pucci, gives you a naughty little novella, introducing new characters: Jackson, Holt, and Ava, with guest appearances by some of your favorites from Filthy Little Pretties and Vicious Little Snakes.Dirty little Secrets does not need to be read to understand the series but may enhance your reading experience.",
