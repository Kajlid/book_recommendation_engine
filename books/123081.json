  "description": "Technical writer and volunteer fireman Charles Forrester died at age 37. But his insurance covered freezing in liquid nitrogen against the possibility of someday being thawed, repaired, and returned to life. Which is how he woke up in 2527, with a quarter of a million dollars coming to him from the same insurance policy. Not that he was rich—he was quickly informed that two million was a bare subsistence income. He needed a job, and quick. While looking, he somehow unintentionally insulted a man who took out a license to injure or kill him, attracted the attention of a woman who wanted to begin a relationship, said relationship being very unlike anything Forrester had heard of in his time—and he found a job. However, his employer was an alien, one of a group being held captive on Earth to keep them from getting home and giving the location of Earth to a civilization which might be hostile. And that was when things really became interesting.",
