  "description": "From #1 New York Times Bestselling Author Rachel Van Dyken comes a story about losing everything only to find it again... I was the golden boy. America's Quarterback. I was everything to everyone. Always available. Solid. I can remember how something felt wrong that day. And I haven't been able to get that feeling to go away. Not when I buried my child. Not when my fianc√© looked at me like I'd been the reason for it all. Not when I look in the mirror and scream at the top of my lungs. Football kept me sane. But I've lost everything. And then I got a phone call. She was in an accident. She remembered nothing. A gentleman wouldn't fight for her, wouldn't remind her of the pain. So, I let her go. I let her live her happily ever after and I took all the darkness, all the pain, all the anger. Only, the universe had a sick sense of humor. She bumped into me. She pursued me. The beautiful woman I used to call mine. She said she wanted to make me smile. She didn't know she's the reason I stopped.",
