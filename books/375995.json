  "description": "A chance encounter on a moonlit beach draws sensible, cautious Kay Denehy into a night of anonymous passion and surrender with a ruthlessly dominant stranger. As John Randall introduces her to the exotic thrills of bondage and discipline, she learns who she really is under the prim schoolteacher exterior-a sexual submissive who needs the strict and ardent guidance of a take-no-prisoners Dom.John carries more than his share of emotional baggage, the result of a tragedy for which he feels responsible. Though he cares for Kay, he refuses to pursue a relationship, certain he could only bring her pain. He pushes her away even as his subconscious dream self turns her into a sex slave to be punished and enjoyed m√©nage-style by two other zealous and demanding Doms.For the first time in her life, Kay knows what she needs, and who she needs, to be sexually and emotionally fulfilled. She knows, too, the path John must take to escape his dark places-if only he'll trust her to lead the way.",
