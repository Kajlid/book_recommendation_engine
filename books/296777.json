  "description": "Madison Kate is a new adult/college age dark romance with enemies to lovers/hate to love themes. This is a reverse harem series, meaning the leading lady has several love interests and she doesn't have to choose between them for her happily ever after. If this isn't your cup of tea, then this isn't the series for you. ♥KATE is book 4 of 4 in the MADISON KATE series. The blurb below may contain spoilers for previous books, and I urge you not to read it until you've finished HATE, LIAR and FAKE. ◆◆◆“I never miss.”Riot Night changed my life.Coming back to Shadow Grove turned it on its head. I’ve been hunted, stabbed, stalked, tormented, and used. Hate fueled me, lies tore me apart, and in the end everything I thought I knew turned out to be fake.Except… Riot Night also brought Archer, Kody, and Steele back into my life. No matter how much I’ve fought it, hated it, been lied to or discovered the deceptions—I want them in my life.No one owns me.No one is taking them away.This is my life, dammit, and these guys are mine to keep. If a war is what it takes, then a war is what they'll get.",
