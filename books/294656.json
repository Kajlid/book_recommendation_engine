  "description": "They’ve haunted my dreams, now they’re coming for me.I’ve lived in Gisbourne my whole life, feeling like nothing other than a set of symptoms to my family, my town. Until now Asked to photograph the outright debauchery of Avalon Records latest launch, I look and I look and I look until finally I see it. My parents gave me a camera when I was a kid to help me see the truth: there’s no such thing as the fae. What if they were wrong? Seriously, what else could these beautiful people be? My favourite band, the Changelings: a group of bad boys who shine in my lens, so brightly they threaten to burn me up. Why are they taking an unholy interest in me. Hunting me down, luring me closer, using every damn means they have to box me in, tie me down. And for what? I’m about to step beyond the lens, become something else altogether and I’m not sure any of us are ready for it.Author note: This is a reverse harem, paranormal, enemies to lovers kind of romance with multiple love interests. 18+ only for steamy goodness.",
