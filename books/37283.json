  "description": "Heart-pounding, stomach-kicking, and noir-drenched, The Man Who Crossed Worlds is urban fantasy with a twist of pulp and served in a dirty glass.All freelance Tunneler Miles Franco wants is a bit of freedom and a couple of bucks to rub together. So when the cops haul him downtown for illegally smuggling the natives of another dimension to Earth, he'll take any chance he can get to stay out of the pen. And funnily enough, the cops have just the job for him.A mysterious interdimensional drug-smuggler is staking his claim on Miles' city, and a drug war is about to kick off that will make the city look like the set of a post-apocalyptic horror movie. As a Tunneler, Miles knows all about interdimensional transport, and the cops need his help cutting off the drug lord's supply before it reaches Earth.But it doesn't take long playing police lapdog before Miles realizes this ain't no ordinary drug he's dealing with. Snooping around in gang business is a dangerous job in a city where everyone's on the take and the gangsters play for keeps.And there are a lot of ways a nosy Tunneler can disappear.",
