  "title": "The Persians",
  "description": "The Persians is a Greek tragedy written by Aeschylus in 472 BCE. The play is based on the Persian Wars, specifically the Battle of Salamis in 480 BCE, which was a decisive victory for the Greeks. The play opens with the arrival of a messenger from the Persian court, who brings news of the defeat of the Persian army and the death of King Xerxes' brother. The rest of the play is a series of lamentations and reflections on the tragedy of war, as the Persian court and people come to terms with their loss. The chorus, made up of elderly Persians, serves as a voice of reason and wisdom, urging the characters to accept their fate and learn from their mistakes. The play is notable for its sympathetic portrayal of the Persians, who are typically depicted as barbarians in Greek literature. Aeschylus' portrayal of the Persians as human beings with complex emotions and motivations has been praised for its empathy and insight into the human condition. The Persians is considered one of Aeschylus' greatest works and a masterpiece of Greek tragedy.The mighty Xerxes from Darius sprung, The stream of whose rich blood flows in our veins, Leads against Greece; whether his arrowy shower Shot from the strong-braced bow, or the huge spear High brandish'd, in the deathful field prevails.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations.
