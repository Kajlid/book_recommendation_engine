  "description": "As a boy, I’d developed a likeness for control. As a man, that likeness had corrupted into an obsession. Scarlett Avery was the twenty-one-year-old *brat* committed to setting my obsession on fire and dancing in the flames. Literally. I was an FBI agent, and she was only meant to be a quick assignment. My orders were to chauffeur Little Miss Loud Mouth across the country to deliver to her father—my boss—after her not-so-minor brush with arson.Now, I was trapped in small confines with a woman that made my hands itch to wrap around her pretty neck and squeeze—and what's worse? She wanted me to do it. In fact, she begged me to break her. Scarlett Avery was a woman of secrets and sins packaged in a body twelve years too young for me and completely off-limits. She's my boss's daughter, and I shouldn’t think about her wicked smirk or fantasize about ways I could rearrange the pouty curves of it. I definitely shouldn't give into the dare always written into the green of her eyes, baiting me to hunt her. Destroy her. Punish her. Scarlett wanted a depraved monster.But she had no idea how nightmarish I could be.",
