  "title": "Quantumly Yours!: And Other Journeys from Afar",
  "description": "Quantumly Yours! And Other Journeys from Afar is the third collection of poetry from Jacob William Watters. After an 18-month spiritual journey of knowledge-seeking and internal discovery, the author found himself eager to share his experiences with his readers so they, too, may understand the strange and wonderful worlds of quantum mechanics and cosmology. These poems are written in narratives that are easy and fun to read without being weighed down by the drudgery of mathematics or technical details. Many of the poems can be enjoyed simply as a narrative about a person, relationship, place, or event, but by understanding them in these concepts the reader can find the connections to the quantum and cosmological worlds.Like his previous works (Curbside Assistance and the Benefit of Mistakes and An Eye of Another Color) many of the poems are written with rhyme and meter that readers may find more similar to modern Rap, R&B, and Rock N' Roll music than to the flow of more traditional forms of poetry and prose.",
