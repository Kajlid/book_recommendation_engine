As the Senior Pastor of Faith First Church, perfection was expected of him, but when his son, Frank, informs him that he no longer wants to be part of Christianity, the cracks begin to show.Richard's older brother, Ted, who was also once the Senior Pastor of Faith First before his abrupt resignation a decade ago, has been talking with Frank about living a life of faith outside of organized religion for some time. At first Richard doesn't think this is of any serious consequence. However, when Frank is mysteriously scheduled to preach one Sunday evening, his message challenges Richard's church-growth vision so directly it has the potential to blow his perfect facade sky high.With Henry, the ambitious Associate Pastor, now determined to take matters into his own hands, Richard suddenly has everyone against him: His brother, his son, his wife, his Associate Pastor, and the elders. Despite the pressure, Richard is determined to overcome and maintain his perfect appearanceâ€”but everyone has a breaking point, even the Mighty Pastor Richard.",
