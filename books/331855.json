But their goal is not merely to survive the present. Because as they cling to life on the ice, the remnants of their past swept away, they must also confront the urgent challenge: can they change and evolve rapidly enough to ensure humanity’s future? Can they build a new society in the sub-zero cold?Original and imaginative, as profoundly intimate as it is grand in scope, is a masterful and unforgettable epic.",
