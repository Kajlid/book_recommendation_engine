  "description": "Mike Paloso has lost count of the number of times he's helped childhood friend Jay Charles move. Jay's never had much of a home to call his own, content to follow his boyfriends around, but each break-up means a new pad, until the next guy comes along. This time, it's different. There's been no break-up, and no new pad. Instead, there's one hell of a fixer-upper, and not just the house Jay's inherited from his latest, late, beau. This time, Mike has to find a way to repair Jay's broken dreams and mangled heart. With every reno, there comes some demo, but Mike's not sure he's ready to dismantle his life to rebuild Jay's.",
