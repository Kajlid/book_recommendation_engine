  "description": "Five years ago his mate was taken from him and Hayden, now an alpha of the Clear Ridge Pack, has never stopped searching for the other half of his soul.  Tobias can’t remember his past, but he knows something is coming for him. He’s been having the same dream for the last month and each night he falls asleep only to wake sweat-drenched and heart pounding after a narrow escape from the predator chasing him.  When dreams begin to intrude into reality Tobias finds himself marked, mated and pregnant in a world that can’t possibly be real, but when what began five years ago returns ready to finish what it started, Tobias realizes that the only thing he can do is put his trust in the shifter who’s been hunting him down and who he’s beginning to fall in love with.
