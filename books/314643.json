  "description": "Night falls for the three million Syrians waiting in refugee camps in Turkey. As they lie on rocky ground some of them dream of home, some of the day they’ll be reunited with their families, and some, like Ayamin, are sick of dreaming. Seventeen, independent, and hungry for more, Ayamin packs her tent and sets off on foot across the Mediterranean and Europe in search of a place to call home. But she’s got a problem, and his name is Danny Frey. Danny’s a juvenile delinquent from England, sent to Turkey to help out at the camps. He doesn’t like rules, and he doesn’t like the idea of Ayamin taking on the whole of Europe on her own.This is a love story set during one of the greatest humanitarian disasters of our time. It tells of life and poverty and adventure.",
