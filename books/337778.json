  "title": "A Mind of Her Own: The Evolutionary Psychology of Women",
  "description": "Current theories of evolution portray men as active individuals forging their way forward through a mix of testosterone fuelled competition, rivalry, and aggression. But what role is left for women within such evolutionary thinking? The role women get is that of the passive, weak, individual left to ride on the coat tails of their male suitors. The default, no testosterone sex interested in just selecting the best male to expand the gene pool . Is it any wonder that feminists are dismissive of such evolutionary approaches? That many have sought to ignore the contribution that evolutionary theory can make to our understanding of women. But have women really just been bit part actors in the whole story of evolution? Have they not played their own role in ensuring their reproductive success?  In this highly accessible and thought provoking new book, Anne Campbell challenges this passive role of women in evolutionary theory, and redresses the current bias within evolutionary writing. Guiding us through the basics of evolutionary theory, she proposes that women have forged their own strategic way forward, acting through their own competition, rivalry, indirect aggression, and unfaithfulness, to shape their own destiny. Throwing down a challenge to feminist theories, Campbell argues that evolutionary theory can indeed teach us plenty about the development of the female mind - we just need to get it right. This is an important book that will force others to re-evaluate their own assumptions about the evolution of the female mind.",
