  "description": "Doug Wildey was an acclaimed comic book and comic strip artist, as well as a noted animator. Very much in the school of Milton Caniff and Alex Toth, Wildley was an artist's artist, a storyteller of the highest order, and one with remarkable depth. While not known for any specific character (very much like Toth), Wildey worked in many genres - with western stories being some of his most memorable. In 1987 Wildey began one of his most personal works, Rio - the story of an aging cowboy and gunfighter, as well as special agent for the President of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant. This volume collects the entire Rio saga in one handsome collection, including the final, unfinished and unpublished Rio story.",
