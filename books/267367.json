  "description": "In Catbird: The Ballad of Barbi Prim, the the world meets an insightful, opinionated eight-year-old growing up plump, nerdy and Jewish in a Chicago suburb. Three things make her happy: singing, reading books, and going to Temple. Ridicule makes her afraid to open her mouth, even though she really can sing. But she persists, and with her awkwardness, anxiety, and fear in tow, her love of singing propels her to become the first ordained woman cantor in 3,000 years of Jewish history. Overcoming her own crises and the challenges of finding her way in a male profession, Barbara Ostfeld shows us that we are all brave pioneers at becoming our true selves.",
