  "description": "Fate brought them together—or was it something else entirely?The Fae took everything Scottish warrior Boyd Macleod had. Cursed and alone, he existed for a hundred years but never truly lived. Not until she arrived. The Sassenach is quick-witted, outspoken, and entirely too beautiful for his peace of mind. She stirs in him a hunger he hasn’t felt in…he can’t even remember how long. Now, that hunger won’t be quenched by anything short of possessing her—mind, body, and soul—forever.Maya Harris has no idea what kind of strange magic threw her into the past. All she knows for sure is that she doesn’t belong here. She can’t afford to let herself get too attached to Boyd. The powerful, sensual Highlander is not for her. But the longer she spends with him, the harder it becomes to remember why she shouldn’t give in to his heated seduction…A river of time flows between them. Will love be enough to bridge it? Or will Boyd and Maya remain star-crossed forever?",
