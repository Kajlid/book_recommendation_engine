  "title": "Book: A Novel",
  "description": "The English department at the University of Washagon is in a uproar. Professor Adam Snell - humanist, scholar, gadfly and faculty pariah - has disappeared without a trace. Stranger still, all copies of his obscure but brilliant novel, Sovrana Sostrata, also seem to be missing. Has Snell been murdered? Has his book been murdered? And, more important, if Snell is not dead, does his department have the power to fire him at his upcoming post-tenure review? So begins Book, a hilarious academic caper that lampoons clever critical theorists, spoofs the New York book-publishing scene, parodies at least seventeen separate literary forms and unleashes Frank Underwood, a deranged theorist with a high-powered target pistol - and a pathological hatred for Adam Snell. And that's just for starters. Book also contains a touching love story, an unforgettable mongrel dog, a genetically engineered garden weed, a power-crazed, sexually dazed chairwoman, a novel accused of rape and a revolt of footnotes that halts the text. Book is the wildest, woolliest campus satire since Lucky Jim - brilliantly on-target send-up of contemporary fads and follies.",
