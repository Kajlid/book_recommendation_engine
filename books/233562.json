  "title": "Agent of Darkness",
  "description": "It’s been about three weeks now since Darvlicht Hans-Kimmler, an SS officer and interrogator for the Third Reich, took an American spy named Isabel Riley as a war prize. Every night, he rides her tender flesh. Every night, he forces her to feel pleasure…despite her unwillingness, despite her resistance, despite her whispered words of “don’t” and “no.”  And every night, she pleases him more and more.  No, it’s not completely consensual, but hell, she’s his war prize, his prisoner. Besides, who said life was fair?  Keywords: sci-fi, alternate history, romance, dubious consent, dystopian fiction, anti-hero, captive.",
