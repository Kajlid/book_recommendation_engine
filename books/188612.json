  "description": "This Cinderella-type story begins on the Greek isle of Lipsi, where orphaned Ipatia lives with her grandfather. Intent on a college degree, she leaves for Piraeus. The day before her trip she falls into the arms of Tony, a rich shipowner s son. As their love blossoms, obstacles get in the way; Tony s father wants him to marry an heiress, and an accident separates the couple. Will their love endure the test of time? This sweet romance, which follows a young Greek woman s journey from a Greek island to mainland Greece to America, was a delight to read, with plenty of action and suspense. The Greek culture and its intricate variations are cleverly woven into the novel s tapestry of human relations. -Marilyn Rouvelas, author of the bestseller A Guide to Greek Traditions and Customs in America I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and recommend it to everyone who likes a romance that takes you away to other countries. 4 Â½ stars - Melissa Alvarez, RomanceFiction.com Wow! This is the only word I can think to describe this novel. The story of Ipatia Kouris and Tony Plakis is the most innocent, fascinating story I have ever read.
