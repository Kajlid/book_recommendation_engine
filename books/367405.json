Henry Stebbing, A. M. (1799-1883). All Bible references are complete text. Please The Olney Hymns (1779) were originally published without music. This edition is uniform with the first edition and contains no music. In those days hymns were sung using many different tunes that had the same meter. Music wasn’t commonly published in hymnbooks until well into the 1800’s.",
