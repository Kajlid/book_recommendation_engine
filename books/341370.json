Even better, he's found Raphael \"Rafe\" Dirisio, a strong, giant of a man who owns the town pool hall, and Seth has never felt so comfortable, safe, or close to anyone. When Seth is asked to give a series of lectures in Washington, DC, it seems only natural that Rafe come along. But in a few surreal days, Seth's true nature is exposed and he brings both their lives crashing down around them. Because Seth is not only a werewolf, he's also something much, much worse...
