  "description": "Dear Santa,I do not want Keller James for Christmas. I will not fall for him, no matter how charming or irresistible or famous he is. I will not be swayed by his skills in the kitchen or by his British accent. I’m going to win the Great Gingerbread Bake Off and no one is going to stand in my way. Not even Keller. All kisses are off. I mean all bets. All bets are off. And his clothes, those are off too. Grr, never mind. I’ll figure this out myself. XOXO, Ginger Winter",
