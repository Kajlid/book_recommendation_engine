And they're both out for revenge on the same man....\n  When pampered former cheerleader Feenie Malone takes a job writing fluff pieces for her South Texas paper, she has no idea she's about to stumble into a juicy news story that could launch her career -- if it doesn't get her killed first. Almost as soon as she breaks out her press pass, she crosses paths with Marco Juarez, the macho PI obsessed with solving his sister's murder.

He quickly discovers he's underestimated his new partner, as well as the danger they both face. Now he must protect her -- to the very last breath....",
