  "title": "Take Charge: Woman's Guide to a Healthier Heart",
  "description": "Women work, clean, cook, take care of children, spouses, parents, pets - but sometimes forget to take care of themselves. Their knowledge about health often comes from a two minute news report or short article. But every week there is some new research report telling us what we need to do. What we have done is compile a concise, easy reference book for women who are too busy to spend hours searching for this valuable information. We want to help you learn about your risks as early as possible and to develop a heart healthy lifestyle that will allow you to live a longer, healthier life. Make your health a priority! Carolyn Strimike and Margie Latrella are cardiac nurse practitioners specializing in the prevention of heart disease and stroke. They have over 40 years of nursing experience in Cardiology between them. The main goal of their work is to counsel, motivate and empower women to adopt healthy lifestyle choices!",
