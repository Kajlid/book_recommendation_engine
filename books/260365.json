  "description": "From over a thousand miles away, I watched on the screen of my phone as two men murdered my wife. And I was helpless to save her. Consumed by hate and rage, I spent four years running from my memories. Until a shattered woman gave me a reason to stop. Cora lived in a nightmare, but through sheer force of will, she’d turned it into something beautiful. She had a smile that could pierce the darkest soul. And with one glance, she shredded mine. I was only there for a fresh start. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. There was nothing I could do to save her, either. But that’s the thing about lies—you never know who to believe.",
