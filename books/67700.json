  "description": "Now in the iTunes Bookstore! http://bit.ly/Px3rXO During his imprisonment at Linz Castle in Austria during the 30-Year-War, Prince Rupert the Devil receives a poodle puppy as a gift. There the pup named Boye grows into a fine dog, one which Rupert intends to take home with him to become a battle dog. Upon Rupert’s release, he and Boye head to England to join King Charles I’s Cavaliers during the English Civil War against the Parliamentarian Roundheads. Boye, Rupert’s ‘luck,’ is believed by the Roundheads to be a witch dog, with the ability to turn invisible at will, to catch bullets with his teeth, and to be the secret of Rupert’s success. An English page, Hugh, serving Rupert is jealous of how his master adores this cur and steals Boye away in the night giving him to the Roundheads so that Hugh may become the Prince’s favorite. Now Boye is on his own, experiencing life in dungeons, cages and wandering on the road of the English country side in the cold. He searches for his master during the Civil War in a historical world where the Witch Dog isn’t always in luck and Rupert is missing one of the few beings he has come to love.www.beebliome.com",
