  "description": "Fourteen year old Sadie, her family, and friends attempt to evade a deadly pandemic by retreating into the mountain wilderness. They soon discover their mountain sanctuary has dangers of its own. The camp is guarded by Tyran, a man with a merciless vision of what’s required to survive in a new world. Wielding fear and torture, he and his followers, impose power and control over all newcomers. When Sadie’s four year old brother is killed, her father disappears, and her mother is threatened, she knows it’s time to go. Being blind doesn’t help. Having Kole as a best friend and discovering she has extra-keen sensory ability does. While hiding in a mysterious mountain cave, Sadie and Kole uncover secrets of an advanced, ancient civilization that suggest earth’s history is not what was taught in school. It’s a discovery that may help to save the world. If they could only figure out how it works. Tyran is hunting them and the plague is spreading. Time is running out.",
