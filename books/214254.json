  "description": "Love can be a beautiful thing. It can fill up your life with the warmth of its embrace and spread to every corner of your mind. It can quiet your soul. But when that love turns wrong, it warps into something bitter and unrecognizable. The pain of it promises unyielding noise in place of that half-remembered silence. Lexie has lived with this pain for four years, pouring it into music that transformed Unquiet Mind into the most famous rock band in the world. But fame can also turn ugly, twist into that bitter version of love and endanger everything Lexie holds dear. The moment Lexie’s life is threatened, he comes back to ensure she stays breathing. Killian. He’s not just back to save her life, he’s back to save her soul and to claim what’s his. Problem is, someone else already considers Lexie his, and he’ll kill to make sure she stays that way.Note: This is the book two of two. It is highly recommended to read Echoes of Silence first.",
