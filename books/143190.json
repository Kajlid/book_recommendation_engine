  "description": "An African safari camp in North Idaho? Won’t happen, not if offbeat eco-activist Roadkill can convince his brother to drop the mustard jar bearing his ex-wife’s ashes and fight the fanatical developer of the canned hunt. Together they face the wannabe big game hunter, his wacky minions and his fake preacher-in-a-pocket, a con artist on the lam. Roadkill is an environmental activist, convinced the safari camp threatens the environment and eco-systems in the mountains outside Hancock, Idaho. When Roadkill disappears, his brother Ed Mustard, a struggling screenwriter, turns amateur detective and searches for him. Mustard, four determined pregnant women, one fired security clerk on the hunt for the tweaker who assaulted her, and assorted captive African wildlife, create havoc in the small mountain town of Hancock, Idaho. This humorous book, the first novel in the Havoc in Hancock humorous suspense series, blends mad-cap humor, odd-ball characters, light romance and suspense to make readers laugh as it nudges them to consider what we’re doing to our environment.",
