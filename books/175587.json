  "description": "Harley Jameson is not your typical woman. She’s a rough and tumble, beer drinking, hockey loving, smart mouthed, kind of woman. In fact, she owns her own contracting company. Most men just treat her as one of the guys; that is, until she meets her newest client…  Nolan Hammerstein is most definitely not a guy’s guy. He’s rich, spoiled, well dressed, and oh yeah - rich. His father owns the NHL’s Boston Bruisers, and he’s worked for his father since graduating from Harvard. Needless to say, he lives the life of luxury. When he purchases a new home, Nolan calls Jameson Contractors to schedule a consult with a man that he thinks is the owner…  Harley and Nolan’s first meeting does not go well, so you can imagine her surprise when he actually hires her to renovate his house. While snarky comments and arguments are simmering on the surface, sexual attraction and tension are brewing underneath. But will Nolan’s uptight father and a handsy hockey player get in between their already volatile relationship? Or will they learn to accept each other’s differences and bond tighter because of them?  Note: This book is a standalone with a HEA. For mature audiences only, as there are hot, steamy, and explicit sex scenes throughout the book.",
