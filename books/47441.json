  "description": "The crackpot staff of the Bathroom Readers’ Institute is out of control. After 25 years of laboriously researching facts and verifying them and then verifying them again, Uncle John’s mischievous minions decided to blow off a little steam. The Fake Facts . It’s stuff that isn’t even remotely true—we just made it sound real. Why? Because it’s really funny. Fake Facts is 228 pages of origins, facts, weird products, strange diseases, kooky fads, slang terms, historical oddities, and other fascinating bits of information that are too good to be true . . . because they aren’t true. So put aside your BS detector and settle in to read The ill-fated “Vice President For a Day” for kids programHow the overfishing of dolphins led to the canned tuna industry“Crumble,” “plaidsy,” “benji,” and other British slangAbandoned rules of early baseball, and obscure rules of grammarHow early vegetarians gave Boston its “Beantown” nicknameThe secret superpowers of twinsJames Joyce’s unpublished sci-fi trilogyUnicorns, wizards, and pirates galoreAnd lots more falsified fun!",
