  "title": "The House of Strife",
  "description": "The House of Strife is the third in a trilogy about the wars following Britain's colonisation of New Zealand. Writing in London in the 1830s, Ferdinand Wildblood plagiarises a manuscript submitted to his publishing house, and begins a career writing cheap and successful novels about New Zealand, and country to which he has never been. When the original writer of the manuscript threatens him, the timid Wildblood flees, with apt literary convenience, to New Zealand. The land he enters is of course more alarming and complicated than anything he has ever written about, and so begins his true adventure.",
