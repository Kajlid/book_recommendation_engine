  "description": "Reno and Trina are back, but this time the hounds of hell are on their trail. Their marriage isn’t a day old before Reno’s enemies conspire against him and end up targeting his own wife. Reno, a man of honor who never starts a fight but will always finish one, refuse to let anyone get away with disrespecting him. He fights back, but he doesn’t even know who the enemy is anymore. And he soon discovers that protecting his wife isn’t going to be as simple as keeping her under his thumb. Trina, too, is concerned by the tumultuousness of their lifestyle as Reno’s overly protective, Alpha-male behavior becomes almost unbearable for her. She, too, fights back, but she discovers that taming Reno isn’t going to be as simple as doing it her way. Both are determined to make their brand new marriage work, but the odds begin to stack against them. But when Reno finds out he has a son from a previous relationship, and his son is being used as a pawn by his enemies, the game changes again. And Reno and Trina begins to discover that not only is their way of life under attack, but their very love for each other as well.",
