  "description": "Andrew is able to go one year before he finds himself in bed with April again. He never did fall out of love with her, and for a moment, he thinks she might still feel the same way. But she'd rather stay bandmates than get back together. That is, if they can even remain bandmates, considering that his band is falling apart. Andrew has to figure out a way to keep the band together and get his ex-girlfriend back for good, or he'll have to live with the fact that he may just be better off alone.",
