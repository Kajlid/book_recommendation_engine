More fun than you can imagine!\"One of the best and rarest gems of the indie book market.\"~ Matthew LeDrewStopping at the grocery store for carrots shouldn't be dangerous, but for Shelby Nichols, it changes her life forever. During a bank robbery, she is caught in the cross-fire and grazed by a bullet to the head, leaving her with the ability to read minds. Not only is she hearing what everyone thinks about her, but the gunman who shot her is out to silence her forever. In her fight to stay alive she is saved from certain death by a handsome hit-man with ties to organized crime. This pulls Shelby even deeper into danger, where knowing someone's thoughts can not only hurt her feelings, but get her killed.",
