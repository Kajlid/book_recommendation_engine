  "description": "The year is 1969...Gary Fairchild is proud to be a hippie college student, and he protests the Vietnam War because he believes in love and peace. To him, it isn't just a counterculture movement--it's a way of life. When tickets to the Aquarium Exposition--3 Days of Peace & Music, or Woodstock, as it was better known, go on sale, there's no way he isn't going.Richard Ronsman is a sheltered farm boy who lives in the shadow of his overbearing father. He's hidden his darkest secret to earn his father's love, but nothing is ever good enough--not even volunteering for the Vietnam War. And with just a few days left before he's deployed, he's invited by a striking hippie to join him at a music festival.Three days of music, drugs, rain, mud, and love forged a bond between these two very different men that would shape the rest of their lives. They share dreams and fears, and when Richard is shipped off to war, they share letters and love. For Richard's first Christmas home, he is gifted a special angel ornament that just might make a soldier's wish come true. * * * This story is one of seven stories which can all be read and enjoyed in any order.* * * In 1750, a master woodcarver poured all his unrequited love, passion, and longing into his masterpiece--a gorgeous Christmas angel for his beloved's tree. When the man he loved tossed the angel away without a second thought, a miracle happened. The angel was found by another who brought the woodcarver True Love.Since then, the angel has been passed down, sold, lost and found, but its magic remains.",
