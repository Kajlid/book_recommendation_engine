  "description": "The power that brought them together could be the force that destroys them. Minders, Book 3 Although Josh and Kir have each narrowly escaped the grip of the agency, they haven’t escaped its long, devastating reach. Josh has gone to ground, desperate to keep a lid on an implanted compulsion to kill his lover. When he learns Kir is in danger, though, he has no choice but to come out of hiding and use every deadly skill at his disposal. Then try to pull away before he unwillingly takes aim at Kir. Kir is having none of it. Now that he has Josh back in his life, he’s confident his powers as a Minder—and their love—will keep them both safe. But Josh is not the same man who disappeared almost a year ago. The agency has seen to that, and they have a fallback plan to bring Kir back under their control…or see them both dead.
