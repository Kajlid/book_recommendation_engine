  "description": "Margo Gentry's life is perfect. She loves her job as a DJ for Manhattan's only country music station, and she has a great boyfriend who accepts her need to avoid marriage and tolerates her Elvis obsession--even the velvet Elvis painting in their bedroom.But then it all falls apart. The radio station changes formats and fires all the DJs. Margo's boyfriend decides he wants kids and a house in the suburbs and kicks her to the curb. And to top it all off, her Mom is getting married--for the 11th time --and expects Margo to be there as maid of honor.With no job and no place to live, Margo has to bunk on the couch of her best friend, Chris, whose revolving bedroom door has played host to half the women in New York--at least, the ones who pass his \"kiss test.\" Worse, he's insisting she attend her mother's wedding, and he's personally driving her cross-country to ensure she shows up.Forget about surviving the road trip--can their friendship survive The Kiss Test?",
