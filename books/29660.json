Fully loaded with Eisner Award-winning writer Greg Rucka (Batwoman, Queen and Country, WOLVERINE) and neo-superstar artist Marco Checchetto (AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, DAREDEVIL), the biggest gun of all is back with blood on his hands and vengeance in his eyes to serve his own brand of justice with everything's he's got - but can he survive the darkness stored in his own arsenal? Plus: a violent look at how the Punisher deals with a world where every criminal is now a super hero. (Here's a hint: He doesn't deal with it pleasantly.)
