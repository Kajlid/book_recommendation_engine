The New Age phenomenon called Cosmic Ordering is not as new as some might believe. Media coverage relating to how UK TV presenter, Noel Edmunds highlighted his renewed success has prompted the author to be brave enough to admit to how Cosmic Ordering (United Field Theory) has also worked for him. The author, on first learning about this, was very sceptical, trying other beliefs first and then eventually this worked for him and now he is a devotee of the cosmos. Learn how to fast track your wishes and create a direct link to the cosmos. The author provides irrefutable documentary proof of his rags to riches success story, claiming to have won GBPs in a few months and reveals how Cosmic Ordering turned his life around from having no money at all to becoming a property developer, author, TV consultant, radio broadcaster and as a result is wealthy beyond his wildest dreams. Now, after years of studying, he has fine honed his cosmic connection technique and says, why wait for the winning lottery number, following my guidance you will find you can achieve almost anything.",
