  "description": "After a Major League Baseball player dies from a ball intentionally throw at his head by a rookie pitcher, it is up to veteran prosecutor Jaime Brooks to investigate the matter and handle the prosecution. What began as a feud between two teams ends in a national spectacle and a sensational trial when the pitcher is investigated for murder.Brooks must confront a possible criminal conspiracy among team members, an uncompromising widow bent on avenging her husband's death, corruption in the grand jury, and a national debate over the inherent risks of baseball and the accountability of its players. Should the pitch have been handled by the baseball commissioner, or was it a crime to be prosecuted in the courts?A Pitch for Justice examines the unwritten rules of baseball on the twenty-year-old rookie who threw the pitch, the game itself, and our legal system. Did he compromise his moral compass for the team's honor? What was in his heart when he threw the fatal pitch?Author Harold Kasselman prosecuted criminal cases in New Jersey for three decades, and has practiced with a criminal defense firm there for the past several years. He spends his time in New Jersey and Florida with his wife, Robin.",
