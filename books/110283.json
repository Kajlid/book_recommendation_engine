  "description": "Eating close to home has reawakened British-Columbians to the abundance of food produced in our province. Knowing that the food we eat comes from family farms puts us in touch with its seasonality and strengthens our trust in the foods produced here. With this cookbook, you can present your family with food featuring tasty home grown products such as vine-ripened tomatoes, fresh corn and juicy peaches in recipes inspired by our own Canadian multicultural heritage. This book features some of the best recipes from The British Columbian Seasonal Cookbook and previous Companyâ€™s Coming cookbooks.",
