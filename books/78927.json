  "description": "Be Careful What You Wish For…Hiding from bullies in the town cemetery seemed like a good idea. Right up until we fell through a creepy secret doorway into a magic land called Chimera.That certainly changed things. My friends think change is cool. But me? Not so much. What’s wrong with how things are? I mean, it’s already pretty weird around here!In our town, people still talk about that time twelve years ago — the year we were born — as THE STRANGEST YEAR EVER. Yeah, like that. ALL CAPS.Turns out, only someone born that year can get through the secret doorway.Too bad school doesn’t teach what’s really important. Like what to do about fog that smells so bad you can barely breathe. Or an enchanted forest where you can get lost forever, and shrieking monsters that want to eat you for lunch.Or what to do when everything you say can trigger a magic spell. Actually, some spells are pretty cool, but others — Ugh!My friends and I promised to keep Chimera a secret, but that’s hard when you go there every month. Especially when the town bullies keep trying to make you tell them all about it.Who knew being born in THE STRANGEST YEAR EVER could change…everything!",
