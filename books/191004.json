  "title": "Life in a Whirlwind of Numbers: 26 Years of OCD",
  "description": "26 years of rituals, sleepless nights, battle after battle are described in this personal account of a generation of life lived under the impairment of OCD. Fit within the context of childhood through parenthood, this deeply descriptive autobiography delves into the possible causes and definite effects of a painful illness that can only be lived, not imagined. Yet the reader is led to live this account through Mr. Dahlberg's vivid descriptions of a life still fully-lived in spite of the battles against this intimidating enemy. In the end, David Dahlberg shows it is possible to defeat this enemy, and yet to also express the vigilance required to keep it at bay. Neither \"just\" about OCD or a purely personal description, the symptoms, treatment and introspections of one man's OCD are here for all to follow.",
