  "description": "Could prey and predator ever be anything more?Fighter…The club was my family, my blood, my entire world. They were the only thing I cared about…until her. Until Penny.I was a soldier for the Devil’s Highwaymen, and Penny was a job gone wrong. An order from my president: take the girl and keep her hidden until it was time to give her back. Only as the days went on, I wasn’t sure I wanted to give the fiery little brunette back.With a mane of long dark hair, golden wolf eyes, and a sassy mouth that spat poison at me every time she opened it, she needed to learn my rules, and quick.And if she didn’t submit?I’d be the one to punish her.And I’d make her love it.Penny was a wild woman, and all I could think about doing was taming her.Penny…He was brutish and stubborn, moody and single-minded, and he’d protect his club at all costs. He’d do anything they ordered him to do, a machine in a man’s body clad in dark leather and chains, and now he had a single focus…Me.I hated him and everything he stood for and wanted nothing but to be away from him. But as the hours turned into days and the days turned into weeks, I began to feel something I’d never felt before…A craving for his brutal touch.His rough kisses.And his depraved punishments.Fighter was the monster in the dark, and I was his willing victim.",
