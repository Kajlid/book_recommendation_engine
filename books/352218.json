  "description": "The summer of 2008 changed Edwina Emily Blair's life completely. A small town librarian, she loved her predictable lifestyle. But her European-born stepsister Cecelia had other plans. As the two of them were about to board a plane for Scotland, Cecelia was suddenly called away to Italy. Edwina found herself alone in Edinburgh, tired, hungry, and very late. When the hotel clerk told her that she no longer had a room, she fainted - right into the arms of a tall Scot standing behind her. Anxious to meet his fianc√©, Alex Dunnegin whisked Edwina off to his castle and that's when the trouble began. The handsome Laird became the hero for the novel Edwina was writing. And Cecelia, her beautiful, entrepreneurial sister, the heroine. Could it be any other way? Edwina would find out that the stubborn Scot did not always play the part she wrote for him. My grandmother, a Southern farmer's wife, became the spark of light in my simple, quiet existence when she told me stories. As a child I listened in the dark of night as she, in the other twin bed in my small room, told me about her life. What it was like to live on a farm in the early 1900s. About the two children she lost to death and how it affected her. I felt like I knew the people who had died before I had been born. They had lived and it mattered. With her penchant for Irish story-telling, she began what was to become my own desire. To tell stories. For the last eleven years I have written a dozen fiction novels and as many true stories of my own life experiences, hoping that perhaps my stories will touch another's life like my grandmother did mine.",
