All except for the ambassador, who disappears without a trace.When Oracle is called on to help in the race against time to find the one man who can ensure the survival of two desperate nations and prevent a volatile region from erupting in war, the woman behind it must once again step up, while she is still reeling from the too recent threat to her own life.And when a turn of events brings the path of an investigation led by USFID agent Donovan Pierce to cross that of Oracleâ€™s mission, Lara Holsworth must also once again work with him, even as she is still trying to accept his presence in her life.",
