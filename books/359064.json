  "description": "The now-classic memoir that shocked, outraged, and ultimately changed the way the United States looked at the civil rights movement and the black experience.By turns shocking and lyrical, unblinking and raw, the searingly honest memoirs of Eldridge Cleaver are a testament to his unique place in American history. Cleaver writes in Soul on Ice, \"I'm perfectly aware that I'm in prison, that I'm a Negro, that I've been a rapist, and that I have a Higher Uneducation.\" What Cleaver shows us, on the pages of this now classic autobiography, is how much he was a man.",
