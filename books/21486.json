  "description": "Thirteen-year-old Glory Mason has always been known as a troublemaker in Dogwood, the tiny Appalachian town where she's lived her entire life. Intelligent and impudent, Glory is frustrated with Dogwood's isolation from the world \"outside,\" and her pranks and tomfoolery have become an almost constant worry to her father, the town leader and pillar of the community. But when Glory's hijinks cause a horrible accident, her father-and the townspeople-can no longer look the other way. Glory is cast out of the town; left alone to fend for herself in a world she has never known.",
