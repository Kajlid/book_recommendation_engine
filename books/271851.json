  "description": "One impassioned argument.One dominating kiss.One unexpected moment that turns everything upside down.And that’s only the opening act.Rockstar Braxton Hunte is the type of chaos that makes your soul burn…Brax has been on tour for a decade, and some may say he swallows obstacles for fun. Well, maybe he does—he’s never encountered a riff he couldn’t handle, a treasure he couldn’t score, or a woman he couldn’t conquer. No one, especially not a buttoned-down rule-follower like the band’s new tour accountant, is going to change him.Accountant Sara Anderson is an unabashed stickler for the rules…Sara’s worked nine long years to make partner, and only one thing stands between her and her goal—Hunte. Now she’s going on their tour to whip the band into financial shape. So long as she gets them out of the red, the promotion will be hers. Those bad boys of rock will be tamed, no matter how yummy their lead singer is.When rebellion confronts discipline, fireworks explode.Passions collide, and lives are permanently altered, in this enemies-to-lovers, slow burn standalone romance set in the mid-1990s—when grunge ruled the airwaves and women partners were as uncommon as those new mobile phones.",
