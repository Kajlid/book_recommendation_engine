  "description": "Wolf Shifter/Vampire Novel  Dax Portrain has it all - he's the next Alpha of the only pack in town, he owns a successful night club and he has men falling all over him every night of the week. So when he catches sight of a new vampire in town, he tries to shrug off the instant attraction he feels. After all, everyone knows that wolf shifters and vampires do not get along.  Zane Macintosh has lived a long and full life, and while he might have issues trying to pass himself off as human at the Portrain police department, he knows it's only temporary and shrugs off the problems. A night out with friends turns his whole life upside down when he catches sight of Dax with his pack. The gorgeous hunk is his mate, but that doesn't mean that anything has to come of it. In fact, he's determined nothing will.  One explosive meeting sends both men's lives into a spiral. Zane knows the only way things can end well for his mate is to allow himself to die. But Dax has a stubborn streak a mile wide and isn't going to let Zane go that easily.  Warning: This is an M/M book and contains graphic scenes of sexual practices between two men. Some violence and coarse language, no cliffhangers, a definite HEA, and love of course, because I couldn't write any of my books without it.",
