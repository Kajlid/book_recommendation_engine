  "description": "Wimleigh Kingdom is at war, Ailith MacCree is missing, Queen Greer has lost control, and Princess Caitriona is feeling progressively unheard. Despite that Lachlan, lost prince of Invarlwen, has joined Wimleigh’s efforts, there is little positive progress. With troops moving steadily westward toward the kingdom, the future remains unclear, but some aspects seem certain: the kingdom’s forces are vastly outnumbered and weaker than their foes, and there seems to be little hope for success. Desperation seems to be the only option; but will it yield success?",
