  "description": "He’s the one man who could ruin everything.And he may be the only one who can keep her safe.When Emma Forester left Earth behind, all she wanted was to do her job and be left alone. After months on the run, a corporate colony world on the outskirts of explored space seemed like the perfect place to hide from her terrifying past. But before she can settle into her new life on Daragh, she attracts the attention and the suspicions of brusque, handsome corporate soldier Devan Rybeck.Devan is convinced Emma is hiding something, but finds himself increasingly driven to protect the fragile-looking newcomer from the harsh realities of a colony world. Her distracting presence complicates his mission and his feelings, until a vicious attack reveals that neither Emma nor Daragh are all they pretend to be.Emma’s subsequent flight into the dangerous and unpredictable wilds of Daragh proves just how much steel she’s hiding beneath her quiet exterior, and just how far she’s willing to go to protect her secrets. But Daragh has secrets of its own, and Devan must race against time to bring Emma home before her staggering discoveries trigger a Conclave war.If he fails, there will be no escape from the coming darkness—either for himself or the woman he would die to protect.",
