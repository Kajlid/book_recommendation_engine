When former rock star Jonny Shellmer is found shot in the head in Lewis's father's field and Lewis himself goes missing after contacting a man on the internet, Detective Sergeant Wesley Peterson suddenly faces one of his most intriguing cases yet. Is Jonny's death linked to Lewis's disappearance? And does Jonny's best-known song, \"Angel,\" contain a clue? It soon becomes clear to Neil that the painting—a portrayal of hell and judgment more than half a millennium old—holds the key to the mystery. As events reach a terrifying climax, Wesley has to act swiftly in order to save a young life.",
