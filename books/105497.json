Now grown, Liana is plagued by questions about her parents and her own inability to form a romantic relationship with a man she's starting to care about. Adopted by her mother's sister, she has always felt like an outsider in the family, and her disjointed memories--and nightmares--of the past make it impossible for her to bridge the wide gulf. But when Liana travels to India in search of answers, she makes a shocking discovery at her parents' gravesite. Confused and uncertain about where her heart is leading her, Liana begins yet another search to uncover the secrets from her past.",
