  "description": "Most people merely pass through the quiet town of Agua Dulce on their way to someplace more interesting. Marisa Rutherford has actually returned to care for her mother, who's suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and to run her mother's cafe. But when the town is sold in an eBay auction, it could mean the end of Agua Dulce as Marisa and the other nine residents know it.Terry Ledger is a high-rolling real estate developer who knows a good deal when he sees it. Though purchasing a remote town in West Texas on eBay sounds crazy, this serene hamlet actually holds much promise as a hub for travelers. Unfortunately, the citizens don't share in his vision. To win them over to his side, Terry must curry favor with the town's unofficial leader, feisty Marisa, who fiercely guards her hometown and her recently broken heart. With different plans for the future of Agua Dulce, they find themselves agreeing on one thing--an undeniable attraction that could change their lives forever.",
