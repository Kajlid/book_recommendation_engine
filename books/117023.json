  "title": "Cary Grant; The Wizard of Beverly Grove",
  "description": "Here is the most candid portrait of the legendary film actor Cay Grant that his fans will ever read, packed with new information about his career and life, and told with the honesty only a true intimate could provide. When Bill Royce met Cary Grant, he was a 25 year old fan magazine editor and the film star was near 70. As these two men from different generations forged a friendship that lasted until Cary's death, they found both had impoverished, often-brutal childhoods. With uncommon frankness, they stripped away the walls each had built in order to survive. To learn the truth about Bill's abusive past, Cary spared no detail about his own painful childhood. By opening up his home, and his heart, Cary revealed the facts behind the myths that had haunted his life. Glimpses into Cary's life include details of his alcoholic father and mentally disturbed mother; his early years in New York where Cole Porter, Noel Coward, and others helped groom an awkward young Englishman into a worldly matinee idol; his secret fears for his daughter, Jennifer; the lowdown on his leading ladies; a day when Cary was attacked by Minnie Mouse; a visit with Elvis Presley where he tells Cary about aliens; and Cary's crush on Black movie actress, Pam Grier. This is an honest, compassionate book for fans, for all who have kept secrets, and for survivors of abusive childhoods. Poignant and compelling, this book shows how a difficult childhood can be changed into a rewarding future.",
