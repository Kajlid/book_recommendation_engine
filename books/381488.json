  "description": "Almost any family looks odd from the outside. But the Stantons are odder than most...So when Poppy Hazleton finally succumbs to her boss Davey Stanton's plea that she join him and his family for Christmas, she has no idea what she's letting herself in for. But the invitation to spend Christmas in the country gets Poppy inextricably entangled in the family politics and convoluted machinations of a group of Cornish eccentrics who come complete with their own witch. And even once Poppy has started adjusting to roof races, thistle shooting and the Stantons' increasingly tangled intrigues over who gets to inherit the crumbling family pile, there's still her adolescent monkey to be dealt with. Not to mention the rather more tempting problem of Davey's gorgeous younger brother.",
