  "description": "Bobby \"Norton\" Thompson left New Jersey in 1969 with $30 and a one way plane ticket to LA .To make a living, he hired out as a \"roadie\" for several hit bands in the 1970's before landing a plum gig with the Eagles as Glenn Frey's guitar tech. More than a guitar tech for Glenn both on tour and off, he was a good friend, a close confidant, and at Glenn's side on all his projects on records, TV, film, and solo artist tours, as well as the legendary Eagles band tours. And... he was a survivor of the Third Encore parties after the Eagles shows.The cast of Nortons life story includes wild and interesting characters like \"Chainsaw Joe, \"Balloon,\" Frankie The Blade,\" and the \"teen King.\" HIs stories offer more than glimpses into the roadie and rock n roll lifestyle. They actually take the reader there day to day.Eventually Norton made his way through rock n roll to become a rock entrepreneur, owning two of the biggest rehearsal complexes in the world, one in LA, the other in Nashville, with his business partner Glenn Frey that set he and his family up for the rest of their lives.Norton's is a success story that began with $30 and a plane ticket, came to fruition on 10 acres in Tennessee, and ended up full circle at the Hollywood eulogy and last encore for his friend, boss, and mentor, Glenn Frey.",
