  "title": "BJ and Da Dogs",
  "description": "Half artist's book, half graphic novel, this volume combines photographs, drawings, prints, and junk by the art collective Paper Rad: Jessica Ciocci, her brother Jacob, and their friend Ben Jones, with two graphic novellas (Spaceballz and Alfe) by Jones. The work of the group, which has a rabid underground following, synthesizes popular material from television, comics, video games, and advertising, and explodes with color, feeling, and good humor. This book, the first to be created and designed by Paper Rad, is sure to be a collector's item, as it explores the world of one of the most vibrant and original collectives making artwork today.",
