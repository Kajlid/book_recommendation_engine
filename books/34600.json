  "title": "Bob Powell's Terror",
  "description": "Cult favorite Bob Powell was a master 1950s horror cartoonist delineating some of the most imaginative and incredibly drawn comics in the genre. His terrifying ghouls were as gruesome as his tantalizing girls were gorgeous The introduction is by Eisner winner Craig Yoe and details Powell's comics career with extensive and revealing quotes from a recently discovered manuscript about his work penned by Powell himself. The front matter is profusely illustrated with rare ephemera and flawless reproductions of Powell's original art. Bob Powell's Terror prints a generous amount of horror comics stories carefully scanned and reproduced from vintage horror-era comics, many of them quite rare and expensive - if you could find them This beautifully designed, 148-page, library-quality, full-color hardback book is Volume 2 in The Chilling Archives of Horror Comics series. The first volume, still available, was Dick Briefer's Frankenstein, published last Halloween to great acclaim. As with the entire line of Yoe Books, the reproduction techniques employed strive to preserve the look and feel of expensive vintage comics. Painstakingly remastered, enjoy the closest possible recreation of reading these comics when first released.",
