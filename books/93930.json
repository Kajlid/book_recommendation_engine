  "description": "Malcolm Tully, the sensitive young owner of a pastry shop in suburban Chicago, only wanted an open-mike night, not a spiritual movement. But when his shop hosts a Saturday night discussion group, he finds an audience hungry to learn life's meaning and ready to pay for it. Seduced by his scheming pastry chef, Carlos, Malcolm becomes reluctant leader of a cult-like business enterprise that Carlos thinks will make them rich. Malcolm's diary chronicles their transformation as the outlandish venture grows beyond their wildest dreams. His initial panic turns to pride as he gains confidence, but he falters when self-doubt creeps in. Carlos's sexual blandishments turn desperate as he becomes dependent on Malcolm to keep the money flowing in.Quirky, comic, erotic, and poignant, DIARY OF A HERETIC is a wild ride through the dark reaches of faith and desire.",
