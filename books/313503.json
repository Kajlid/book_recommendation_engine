  "title": "THE GARDEN OF EDEN IN GALILEE",
  "description": "A book about three topics. Messiah son of Judah or Joseph. Jerusalem or Shiloh, which was chosen. An alternative view of the Land of Israel. The story of Eden focuses on three aspects, The LAND of Eden, The GARDEN of Eden and the TREE OF LIFE planted in the Garden. This is paralleled in the story of Israel. We have the LAND OF ISRAEL, the HOLY MOUNTAIN where the temple was built and the PRESENCE OF GOD planted within the Temple representing the Tree of Life. When Adam sinned, the tree of Life was hidden, and Adam was kicked out of the Garden. When Israel sinned, the presence of God was hidden, and Israel was kicked out of the land. Is it really so out of context to suggest Eden is the land of Israel and the tree of life is the presence of God? So really the story of Israel is about nothing more and nothing less than the re-establishment of the Tree of Life in Eden.",
