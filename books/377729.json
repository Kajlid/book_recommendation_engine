  "description": "Successful Chicago corporate lawyer Steeleman Krueger returns to his small-town roots in central Illinois with one objective – to crash his half-brother Conn’s wedding and spoil his snooty mother’s grand plans. But when Steele meets his brother’s intended bride, he finds the opposite of what he expects. Instead of a shallow gold-digger, Rebecca Sedder is a shy and quiet young lady, totally unsuited for his slob of a brother. Now Steele’s new goal is to find out why sweet and hard-working Becca would agree on such short notice to marry his brother. The more she refuses to tell him, the more curious he gets, and the more attracted to her he becomes. He knows his conniving mother is behind everything, and he’s as eager to find out why as he is to find out the truth of his past his mother has deliberately withheld from him his whole life.Rebecca Sedder is between a rock and a hard place. Forced to wed a man she despises to save the reputation of one she cares deeply for, she can’t breathe a word of the truth to anyone, or the deal is off. Conner Morse’s older half-brother Steeleman Krueger shows up in town in the nick of time and promises to help Becca out of her predicament. She wants to jump at his offer and tell him the truth about everything, but she can’t, or someone dear to her will suffer the consequences. She doesn’t want to get involved in the family feud involving Steele and his mother, but she’s already smack-dab in the middle and can’t escape. No matter what Steele says, she knows she has to go through with marrying his brother. But Steele has another idea. The wedding can go on as planned, with one little change – he’ll replace his brother as the groom!",
