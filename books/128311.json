  "description": "The Supernatural Thriller of the DecadeEvery few years, a book bursts onto the scene that captures the imagination so powerfully and singularly that it takes on its own life in the minds of millions of readers: The Prince of Tides by Pat Conroy; The Secret History by Donna Tartt; The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty.Dark Debts is such a book. Author Karen Hall masterfully combines horror, southern gothic, romantic comedy, and theological mystery in the form of a supernatural thriller. Terrifying, irreverent, and deeply spiritual, Dark Debts grabs the reader from the very beginning and doesn't let go until the last remarkable page.A superstar among television writers, the only woman ever to work on the staffs of M*A*S*H and Hill Street Blues, Karen Hall spent five years creating this vividly original story of faith confronting evil in Atlanta and Los Angeles. Her characters include:*Michael, a sexy Jesuit priest who is having an affair with a beautiful New Yorker editor.*Cam, a reclusive southern writer who survived a murderous family only to leap to his death under mysterious circumstances.*Randa, an obsessive newspaper reporter on the trail of Cam's family secret.*Jack, a lost soul who meets the love of his life just as he realizes he's losing his mind.Dark Debts will give readers nightmares and fantasies, provoke fear and laughter, inspire doubt and faith.",
