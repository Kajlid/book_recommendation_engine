  "description": "That’s the flummoxed state of Edward Stanton, a forty-two-year-old with Asperger’s syndrome. His job, his therapist, and his best friends are all gone. Even his nightly ritual of watching Dragnet reruns has short-circuited. But a call from his friend Donna in Idaho, telling him that her son Kyle is in trouble, launches Edward from his rigidly scheduled existence in Billings, Montana, to the open road. He and Kyle, a sweet little boy turned sullen adolescent, debate football, music, and bodily functions (“Why do you pee so much?” Kyle asks). All the while, inspired by dreams of the past, Edward tries to make peace with his life ― and when he meets an eccentric motel owner, perhaps open it to love.",
