  "description": "She looked at him as a friend until she realised she loved him.” Kas was a busy social worker from London, with no time for love or relationships. Thanks to Owen, her casual lover, she believed that weekend hookups would be enough, and love is just an overrated myth. But meeting her online friend, Aiden, for the first time changed everything. He understood her, believed in her, and supported her the way nobody ever did. He helped her overcome her struggles with emotions. But will they break the “just friends” façade and let love win? And which broken promises will Kas forgive? “I will never fall in love with you.” “I will always be here with you, no matter what. I won’t leave.” “I will be strong, I promise.” Trigger warnings: anxiety, panic attack, reference to child abuse, descriptive sex scenes, harsh language",
