Amused by the rumors, they buy and move into The Grange. With Mark working the graveyard shift, Alice is alone at night. Alone with the sounds from an old house, with the words of the neighbors whispering around her, the stories of the shadows arising from the graves next door and making their way into the house.Will her imagination succumb to the rumors? Is that a door creaking open? Who is that standing at the foot of her bed? Is it just a dream? A nightmare of real or imagined proportions follows Alice around as she tries to remember that ghosts don’t exist. Or do they?",
