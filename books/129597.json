Sheriff Lincoln \"Linc\" Redding is tracking an escaped prisoner through the wilderness of Wyoming. The young man, Edward \"Ned\" Dove, is accused of theft, his victim a military officer staying at Bernadette's Boarding House. Dove was being transported to Fort Laramie to stand trial when he somehow managed to flee. As Lincoln follows the trail and finally catches up with Dove, he learns things aren't quite so black and white. Lincoln is forced to accept that a tin star on his chest doesn't mean he has all the answers, or that just because a man wears a striped prison uniform doesn't mean he's guilty. It seems illicit conspiracies exist in the seedy underbelly of his town. Lincoln's loyalties are divided between doing his duty and falling for a man he shouldn't. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
