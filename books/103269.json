  "description": "Slumming his way from a fortune teller down on Coast Highway in Doheny Beach to the decaying trailers and rotting fish along the Salton Sea and back to the restless summer nights of Laurel Lagoon, Michael Devlin, the jaded protagonist and private detective of South On Pacific Coast Highway doggedly searches among the often tony, sometimes seedy but always alluring venues of the Southern California coastline, attempting to solve four murders, free a wrongly imprisoned friend and wrest spiritual enlightenment from a handful of better forgotten dreams. Michael has one clue to guide him, the final cryptic words of a dying man. “My wife Audrey, she knows the...\" That leads Michael to Audrey, her mane of long red hair a talisman to Michael’s better forgotten dreams. And Audrey leads Michael to Dirk Vanderhof, a billionaire online gambling mogul who is the one link tying all the disparate pieces of this mystery together and whose name pops up in every rotten place Michael looks.The first in a series of throwback crime novels, inspired by the Phillip Marlowe and Sam Spades of the author’s youth, Michael is himself a throwback private detective, preferring persistence to gadgetry and brains over guns and brawn. Operating a one man shop out of Laurel Lagoon, modeled after Laguna Beach, CA, South On Pacific Coast Highway is at once an affectionate ode to everything LA, from the cookie cutter communities to the seedy shops dotting the beach towns along that stretch of coastline, a portrait of the moral and cultural arc of Southern California from the sixties to the growing disillusionment of contemporary times, and lastly, on a personal level, it is simply the tale of a man haunted by a woman’s uncanny resemblance to the redhead he once loved.",
