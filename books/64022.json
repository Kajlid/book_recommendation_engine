Unfortunately, her powers are unpredictable at best and downright dangerous at worst. When she realizes she's become a danger to her friends and family, she flees and begins a new life where she distances herself to limit the chances of her secret getting out. Enter her new neighbor, Nate. A chance meeting outside her apartment and something stirs inside of Davie. She knows that she should fight the sudden feelings and is smart enough to realize that if he finds out about her powers, she could yet again find herself on the run. But there's something about the man that draws her to him, and soon enough he knows about it all. But does he really? Is that even possible when Davie herself learns more about her powers and her past than she could ever have dreamed? One thing is for sure. Davie's life as she knows it is about to go up in flames.",
