  "description": "Clare needs to loosen up and have some fun—not to mention some hot sex with someone other than herself. Her best friend, Kira, knows exactly what she needs—a vacation full of hunky single men who'll knock her panties off. When she booked the cruise for Clare's birthday, the travel agent left out one tiny detail. It's a supernatural cruise, and they aren't getting off until they're married.   The powers that be are tired of waiting for the supernatural to find their own mates and reproduce. In a desperate act to get the dwindling population back up, they've decided to take matters into their own hands. Dominik, a lycan, and Braden, a vampire, are just the two perfect candidates to start this experiment. They're sexy, in the prime of their reproductive immortal lives and ready to mate—just as soon as they can seduce their unsuspecting brides, or at the very least, keep them from swimming back to shore.",
