  "title": "The Star Bear Odyssey",
  "description": "This book, The Star Bear Odyssey, is a science fiction fable with a touch of Poe and a twist of Dahl. A teeny star bear sits at play on her tiny meteor. Skorp, a space traveller, crash-lands on her rocky home. And so unfolds a haiku horror picture story. Each haiku is a bite-sized morsel of malice expressed and hunger unfulfilled. And the end is fabulous. Ah, the bittersweet pyrrhic victory...it burns!The lavishly illustrated book celebrates the challenge of haiku as a way to get the creative juices flowing. It is an engaging tool for educators and a cautionary tale for peculiar children. The pictures tell their own dark story, an enigma for those visual readers inclined to question \"Life, the Universe and Everything\" (as per Douglas Adams's book).",
