  "description": "Arianette, the orphaned daughter of the Wood Witch of the Greenwood, could not help but be drawn to the strange music in the forest on the night of the Rite - when the Veil between the worlds is at its thinnest.After being lured by a shadowy woman into the war-ravaged Ethereal Realms and bound by a bargain with a wayward Fae lord, Arianette is torn between two worlds - and two strikingly different men. With both the impetuous Skylord and his stoic half-brother seeking to win her heart, the deepest betrayal of all may come from within as they band together to solve the mystery of Arianette's origins... before the Fae Courts burn.But the truth about who - and what- Arianette is might be far more dangerous than they could have imagined, and the hand that destiny has dealt may not be the one Arianette intends to play.",
