  "description": "On a mission to save his people from being destroyed, Vaulcron must team up with a human reporter known as the Great White Shark. She's beautiful, cunning, and definitely hiding something. Vaulcron will do anything for his family, even if it means breeding with the one woman who can destroy them all. Mallory Cahill hadn't become the lead reporter of channel eight news by being weak. Feared by some and hated by many, she'd do anything to get the story, no matter whose toes she had to step on to achieve it. When Vaulcron, a Bracadyte Prince, virtually falls into her lap, Mallory jumps at the chance to interview him. She hadn't counted on falling for the gorgeous alien anymore than she expected to be running for her life from the very government who had promised to protect her.  Recommend reading the books in order. This is not a serial, and it does have a happy ever after, but the story moves forward with a new hero and heroine in the next book.",
