  "title": "We Wove a Web in Childhood: The Brontes at Home",
  "description": "We Wove A Web In Childhood is a fictional work concerning the Bronte family. Much of the existing literature tends to focus exclusively on the sisters, but in undertaking a dramatic reconstruction of their lives Ruth Thomas has succeeded in bringing each family member to life, including their brilliant and volatile brother Branwell, and their scholarly and compassionate father, the Reverend Patrick Bronte. The individual lives of the Brontes are as full of interest and drama as any of the novels they produced, and the family continues to exert a fascination right across the spectrum from dedicated Bronte fans to more casual readers. The novel has been written with an attention to detail and historical veracity, cleverly juxtaposing biographical material and real incidents with vividly imagined episodes, and should appeal to anyone with a love of literature and an interest in the peculiar and tortuous mental processes by which it is shaped.",
