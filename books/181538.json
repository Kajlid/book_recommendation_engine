  "description": "There are things in this world that no one understands and the people that do don’t dare speak about them, but these things are used to make people atone for their sins. Vincent was made to atone for his sins of Narcissism leading to the death of a woman and her child, and Persephone was made to atone for the sins of her father, both curses leading to wandering the earth looking for and running from love. Vincent is a man infatuated with seeing the world and living life purely for his own needs. When his estranged grandfather is stricken with a mortal illness Vincent is called to his side and pulled into the circumstances that will alter his existence forever. Persephone is an Oklahoma plains woman driven into a life of love and excess in order to escape the confines of a life cursed by situations out of her control. When Persephone falls in love with a handsome stranger she is taken from her life of solitude into a journey of love, loss, and misfortune. Vincent and Persephone will struggle through many lives filled with sex, drugs and Rock and Roll… Excess is the great mediator that will bridge a gap between eternal life and precious mortality.",
