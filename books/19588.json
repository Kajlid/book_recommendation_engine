  "description": "Warfare...hell...demons... I'm just trying to drive my kids to school and stay on top of the laundry. What does any of that have to do with me? You've heard plenty of talk about evil. You've heard about binding Satan and breaking strongholds and calling demons by name. You've heard you should claim your victory in Christ...but you're not really sure how to do that. This isn't a book about evil. With passion and strength, Mary DeMuth brings balance and insight to the often murky realm of spiritual warfare. As you embrace the abundant life to which God calls his daughters, she'll tell you why your voice matters for eternity. And on the darkest days, you'll know that spiritual warfare is about bowing before the Creator, not cowering before the devil. It's about finding freedom and beauty in the midst of devastation. It's about the power of God to heal our hearts, to move mountains, to intercede when we're weary. It's about crucifixion and a defiant, glorious resurrection. It's about truth. It's about power. Join Mary in the beautiful battle, and be renewed on the journey.",
