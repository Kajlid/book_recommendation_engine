Bo has come to terms with his sexuality, their business is thriving, and Sam has begun to accept his role as a step-parent of sorts to Bo-s sons, Sean and Adrian. The only real dark spot is Bo-s ex-wife, Janine.When eleven-year-old Adrian begins exhibiting signs of psychokinesis-the same ability which allows Sam to manipulate interdimensional portals-the friction between Sam, Bo and Janine escalates. Sam and Bo have reason to believe Adrian-s raw, uncontrolled talent poses a danger to him and those around him. Janine, however, believes Sam and Bo are encouraging dangerous delusions on Adrian-s part. Common ground is nonexistent, anger and hard words ever-present.Caught in the middle of the conflict and burdened with an ability he can-t yet control, Adrian is soon pushed beyond his limits. With Adrian-s mind-and the lives of everyone around him-hanging in the balance, Sam and Bo race against time to save both boys and keep an otherworldly horror from breaking free.Warning: This book contains graphic language, explicit male/male sex, family drama and scary monsters.",
