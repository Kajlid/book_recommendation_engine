Some traditions are meant to last forever, sort of like the relationship the twins have formed with Shay. It's their first Christmas together as a triad, and it's a morning to remember.Word count: 10,000River, Reese, and Shay appear throughout the Game Series. Breathless (Game Series, #3)The Air That I Breathe (Game Series, #3.5)Senseless (Game Series, #9)A Tenley TraditionAt Their Mercy (Game Series, #17. TBA)â€‹NOTE: River, Reese, and Shay also appear in the Renegades, a whole other series in which they have their own book. But since it takes place a few years into the future, it's not necessary to have read it in order to get the full enjoyment of the Tenley triad in the Game Series.",
