He's also the guy you want next to you when things go bad. While carrying dispatches, Link meets Prudence Wainwright, a pious Eastern woman whose husband has been murdered and whose daughter has been kidnapped by a gang of renegade Jayhawkers. Teaming up reluctantly, Link and Prudence must cross hundreds of miles of hostile territory and recapture Hope before her kidnappers sell her to the Comancheros and she is lost to them forever.",
