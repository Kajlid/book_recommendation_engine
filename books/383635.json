  "description": "You have to wonder what kind of pets cartoonist Darby Conley had as a child. If they were anything like Bucky Katt and Satchel Pooch. . . well, life in the Conley house must have been interesting to say the least. The wacky triumvirate of Bucky, Satchel, and Rob are back in the fourth Get Fuzzy collection, Blueprint for Disaster, and ?interesting? doesn?t begin to describe their antics. Rob Wilco is the mild-mannered ad executive caretaker of Bucky and Satchel. Satchel is a sweet and naive shar-pei-yellow-Lab cross, while Bucky is a Siamese with ?cat-titude? to spare. Bucky and Satchel get along like, well, like cats and dogs. Like a beleaguered parent, Rob constantly must thwart Bucky?s schemes and protect the unsuspecting Satchel. His pets? mischief continually disrupts his attempts to meet women. You try explaining to your date why your cat thinks he?s a gangsta rapper and your dog is filming his ?crib? for MTV. Would anyone live with humans who behaved like this?Bitingly funny with a wry sense of the absurdity of life with pets, Get Fuzzy appeals to everyone who has ever lived in a mixed-species household. Blueprint for Disaster is sure to be yet another Get Fuzzy best-seller.",
