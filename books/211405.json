  "title": "Always Unstable: Bipolar and Hospitalisation: A Memoir",
  "description": "Always Unstable is the story of my life living with mental illness. I have Bipolar I Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder. I have been mentally ill since I was a child but it all really started when I was 15 years old and attempted suicide. That resulted in my first hospital stay. My next four hospital stays were for a bipolar mixed episode, a manic episode/ eating disorder, electroconvulsive therapy, and a psychotic manic episode. Focusing on my five hospitalisations, this book takes you through all of those hospital stays while also telling you what happened before, during, and afterwards. Four of the hospitalisations were all within one year. Three of my stays were in America, the other two in Australia.This book is a heart wrenching, devastating, and brutally honest book. It is an addicting story which you won’t be able to put down. Telling the truth about what it’s like to live with a mental illness. It’s not censored, there are graphic descriptions of things like suicide and self harm. I’m telling it exactly how it is, how it was for me, how it happened. If you’re mentally ill then you might be able to relate, if you’re not mentally ill, then I hope that it will help you to understand what we go through, what we’ve been through, and what we struggle with on a daily basis.
