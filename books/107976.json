  "description": "Consistently hailed as \"wonderful\" (The New York Times Book Review), the Fielding mysteries are a magical combination of period ambiance, vivid characterization, and intriguing plotlines. In An Experiment in Treason, a packet of incendiary letters is stolen from the London residence of a prominent official, and turns up in the colony of Massachusetts. Why are the contents so controversial? Why has a suspect in the theft turned up dead? And what should Sir John do about his feeling that Benjamin Franklin himself is somehow complicit? While the political tensions rise, Sir John searches for answers and finds that justice isn't always served by the letter of the law.",
