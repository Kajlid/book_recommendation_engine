  "title": "The Irrational Atheist: Dissecting the Unholy Trinity of Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens",
  "description": "The Irrational Atheist is not a book about God, but about those who seek to replace Him. In this devastating critique of the anti-theistic arguments of Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, and Michel Onfray, Day skillfully demonstrates to even the most skeptical reader that the New Atheists are no champions of Reason, but rather abandon Reason in their arguments against religion. Drawing upon history and philosophers from Socrates to Tupac Shakur, Vox Day combines intellectual precision with wit in presenting a powerful defense of religionâ€™s rightful place in modern society.",
