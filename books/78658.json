  "title": "The Timeline Pervert",
  "description": "This is the first collection of poetry/prose/text from experimental writer and artist, Alvin Tung. Like the surrealists to which he is indebted, his writing aims to evoke and is concerned with themes of irrational and altered states of consciousness such as paranoia, panic, and pareidolia. To this end, he often uses experimental techniques in the creation of his works such as automatic writing and generative methods.",
