  "description": "Toward the end of the Dark Ages, the Original Master commanded a scourge of the Kindred. Those chosen to remain were further commanded to use shifter wolves for daylight protection while they were at rest. Lazily, perhaps crazily, the king chosen to reign over the undeads decided to use his mystical blood to infuse with wild wolves, hoping to create a creature he could master via blood-bind. His error was monumental, as wolves are not docile creatures and are only commanded by their recognized (wolf) alphas… and they were the least of his worries. Six hundred years have passed and Kenny Trammell is prepared to ascend. Beliefs, hopes, dreams, and more are attached to his growth. Capping it all is a mate that Kenny would have never chosen for himself. His life is a living hell, and with all of his might, Kenny is powerless to change anything affecting him. When he decides to give up on everyone and run away from his reality, what he is, a supernatural link grows between him and his missing siblings. At that point, unable to escape from others, even himself, Kenny decides stake a territorial claim away from his birth Pack. In the process, he has also decided to destroy those responsible for the loss of his youngest siblings… the Sacred Puppies.",
