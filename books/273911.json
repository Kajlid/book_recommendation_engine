  "description": "Chained to a demon queen for hundreds of years, fallen angel Ramiel has given up on his brothers and sisters—and humanity. He has seven days away from hell to replenish his power and that’s all he cares about—right up until his meeting with the much too innocent Kyria. He fell for that act before and it landed him in hell, he won’t be making that mistake again. To save her sick father, Kyria knows she must find Ramiel. He’s dark, brooding and everything Kyria should be scared of, but the haunted look in his eyes makes her think there’s more to him. The tattoos and chains don’t frighten her either, but the connection she has with him does. When strange creatures attack her, Ramiel steps in to protect her. Ramiel believes he’s reluctantly helping Kyria, but what neither of them knows is that she may be the one to save them all...",
