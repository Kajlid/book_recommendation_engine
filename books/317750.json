  "description": "From bestselling author, R.L. Mathewson comes Christmas from Hell…For readers who enjoy a funny, sweet love story with a touch of naughtiness.For the past year, Duncan Bradford had been going out of his way to avoid the little jinx next door, not sure how much more he could take. When fate steps in and he makes the biggest mistake of his life, he can’t help but wonder if there was something more to the little jinx next door. He’d never expected to find himself drawn to her, unable to stop thinking about her, and praying that he didn’t lose her when she turns out to be more than he could handle.Necie Dixon was used to a lot of things by now, tripping over her own two feet, setting a record for insurance claims for all those unfortunate incidents that she was really hoping would stop happening at some point, but she could never get used to the way that Duncan made her feel…or the way that he glared at her. She also wished that she could stop thinking about him and wishing that things could be different until one moment changes everything and she realizes that she deserves so much more than to be thought of as the little jinx next door.",
