  "description": "\"Magic is just like love, Allai. It won't wait for permission before it destroys you.\"Like sand in an hourglass, Allai's future is dwindling away. She's spent her entire life fighting the Mages who threaten humanity, and dreams of someday eradicating magic. But all it takes is an anonymous phone call for the truth to spill out: Allai is the one thing she despises most. She's a Mage. Though ancient law mandates Allai's death, she still has one last chance of survival. His name is Drake Rhaize, and he swears he can lead Allai to a sanctuary for Mages. Allai hasn't seen Drake in years, but she remembers him as the demon boy who used to hold her close and softly whisper that he'd keep her safe. But Drake has changed since then: He's now suspected of murder, and has been out-casted for betraying his own kind. While Allai doesn't trust Drake, she has no choice but to put her life in his hands and hope he can get her to safety. Because Allai's father has hired a pack of Demons to bring her back to him, dead or alive, and demons never stop the hunt.",
