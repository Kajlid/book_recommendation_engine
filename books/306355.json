  "description": "What happens when a Rock God falls for his enemy?Angela MoralesI came to Mesa Palms for a fresh start after my divorce. Needing the serenity and calm of the desert, I spend my afternoons as a DJ rocking the city. It might not be the most glamorous job, but I love the no-frills life and answering only to my cat.That is, until one day, England’s biggest God of Nu Rock walks in like he owns the place, and my boss forces me to interview the arrogant jerk on-air. The entire interview turns into a horrible disaster, but it gets even worse when Viktor sets his sights on me. He thinks he can seduce me with his bedroom eyes, but I’ve dealt with men like him before. I’ll chew him up and spit him out so hard he’ll land back in England, where he belongs.Viktor FarrowWhen I walked into the dumpy little radio station, I’ll admit I didn’t think much of it--until I saw the little angel sitting in front of the microphone with a snarky smile. Yeah, I've made some terrible mistakes in my past, but it’s been years and I’ve cleaned up my act.No drugs. No alcohol. No messing around.Does Angela, the little demon sent to torture me, believe it? That’s a big, fat bloody no. But I have a plan—Operation Angel Seducer. Once it’s sprung, she’ll be putty in my quite capable hands. After all, no woman has ever resisted the lead singer of Angry Gods.",
