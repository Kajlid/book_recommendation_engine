  "description": "Claire was a daughter - that was all she'd ever wanted to be in life, really, and had managed to pretty much screw up trying to be an adult. So when she was twenty-seven and should have been a mother herself, according to society, Dan and Margaret had gradually started taking over all of those pesky adult things she hated, leaving her more time to draw or paint or write or nap, it had been perfectly fine with her. She was quite free- as far as Dan and Margaret were concerned, to be pretty much any age, and often drifted within one day from a babyish toddler to a trying-to-be-more-growed-up six or seven year old. \" \"Attentions Throbbing\" is an \"age-play\" story. All characters are over sexually mature adults who choose to participate in \"age play\" scenarios. It is explicit and severe and not for all readers, containing severe spanking, anal punishment, and diaper play. In addition, it contains F/F elements not found in most of our offerings. But if you have been waiting for a new age play from Carolyn (and no one does it better) your wait is over.",
