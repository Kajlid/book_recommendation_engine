  "description": "Suffering from writer’s block for her new comic book series, Eliza struggles to balance the demands of her mother and her editor, both of whom phone frequently, trying to figure out what’s wrong with Eliza. The sad thing is, Eliza knows what’s wrong: she’s lonely. Ever since her girlfriend walked out, Eliza’s been whiling away her evenings in the company of Netflix and cheap red wine.  But when a little orange cat comes into her life, things start looking up for Eliza. She’s no longer so lonely, and she has conversations with the cat, who actually seems to understand her. And when she learns that the little orange cat is more than she seems, Eliza’s wildest dreams are about to come true…if they can beat the terrible organization that threatens their happiness.",
