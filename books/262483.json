  "description": "Somehow, sarcastic Penny's gotten roped into helping make an amateur slasher film. With a team of flakes and weirdos, she's probably the only one who can save this stupid movie... but maybe it can save her, too. Now can somebody please stop that dog from licking the fake blood?\"I never wanted to be a teacher or lawyer. I never wanted to be anything, really.\" Stuck working mind-numbing temp jobs, Penny Nichols yearns to break free from the rut she's found herself in. When, by chance, she falls in with a group of misfits making a no-budget horror movie called \"Blood Wedding,\" everything goes sideways. Soon her days are overrun with gory props, failed Shakespearean actors, a horny cameraman, and a disappearing director. Somehow Penny must hold it all together and keep the production from coming apart at the seams.This hilarious original graphic novel is a loving tribute to the chaos and camaraderie of DIY filmmaking, and the ways we find our future -- and our family -- in the unlikeliest of places.",
