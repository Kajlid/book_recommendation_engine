  "description": "Look carefully beneath the trees and you'll catch sight of the Toadstool Fairies with their pots of brightly coloured paint. Or, if you're really lucky, you'll see a Fairy Ring where the fairies meet to dance and sing. Then again, you might discover where the Larch Tree Fairy mended her torn wing and read a letter to a noisy goblin.Margaret Tarrant's illustrations capture the enchantment and magic of the secret world of the Forest Fairies.",
