  "description": "My Perfect Little SecretOn the first day of sophomore year, Lillian Grace Parker organizes handouts with sticky tabs, assigns different colored highlighters to each class, and loads the whole thing into a bubblegum-pink binder. Lilly’s pencil-straight brown hair and a sea of freckles feel even more annoying to her with the few extra pounds she’s gained over summer break. But Lilly never met a problem she can’t fix. As the number on the scale goes down, Lilly keeps changing her goal to a lower weight. Everything’s going even better than planned. She’s got a BFF who’s awesome, all A’s (not to mention every extra credit available), and on the soccer field, she’s scoring goal after goal. Best of all, she’s head over heels in love with Sean, the quirky, sensitive guy who sweeps her off her feet the first week of school. Then why doesn’t she feel good? Lilly thinks if she can just lose a few more pounds all her troubles will melt away. With coffee for breakfast, her favorite foods on the NO EAT list, and her dog getting fat from the scraps she’s feeding her under the table, Lilly is losing not only pounds, but herself. When Lilly collapses on the soccer field, she’s forced to make one of the biggest decisions of her life. Will she continue to lie to everyone she loves to hide her little secret and maintain her distorted version of a perfect body or will she have the courage to fight for her life and see herself for more than the reflection in the mirror?",
