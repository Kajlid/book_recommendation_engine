It's ridiculous to think a reality-TV husband might be the one... but it will mean a break from my regularly scheduled life.And what if he is?FinnTo rehab my image — one I've cultivated for years, thank you very much — my agent has given me the hardest role I'll ever have to play. A 24-hour loving husband, on reality TV.It's just 3 months. I can handle that. That's all it will take for my latest sexcapade to be forgiven and forgotten, and instead of finding myself on the D-List, I might salvage my career.I just have to stay strong and not fall for the perfect woman they've chosen for me.That's the problem with reality TV. It's so hard to know when it's TV and when it's real.Married Blind is a standalone marriage-of-convenience Hollywood romance set in the Kings of Screen world.",
