  "description": "A wild ride for young adults through the small-town agonies of adolescence, packed with sex, drugs, love and hip hop. Bones Carter spends much of his time trying to avoid germs and the school bully Chase Barnes. Then he meets Naya Kajang, a new exchange student. Naya is brilliant, black and beautiful—and wants to free the world of prejudice. She thinks Bones is a well of untapped potential. Bones thinks she’s a bit lame. But she makes him feel something he didn’t think he could. A hilarious and touching debut full of oddball humour and incredible heart.",
