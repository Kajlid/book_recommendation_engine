  "description": "I swear I didn’t mean to flirt with Brayden Clarke—especially not right in the middle of an interview for a job. It was a gut reaction to his smoldering eyes and deep voice. To my total disbelief, he gives me the assignment. I can handle the job, but the sexy man who's intent on getting under my skin might be too hot to resist. But our lives are too different. He’s under constant scrutiny. I thrive on freedom and spontaneity. When we’re together, all our differences fade, and I can’t get enough of this man. And he won’t quit until he makes me his.",
