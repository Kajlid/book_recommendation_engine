  "description": "Hailed as one of the best short story writers of his generation, T.C. Boyle presents sixteen stories--nine of which appeared in The New Yorker--that highlight the evolving excellence of his inventive, modern, and wickedly witty style. In After the Plague, Boyle exhibits his maturing themes through an amazing array of subjects in a range of emotional keys. He taps today's headlines, from air rage (\"Friendly Skies\") to abortion doctors (\"Killing Babies\"), and delves into more naturalistic themes of quiet power and passion, from a tale of first love (\"The Love of My Life\") to a story about confronting old age (\"Rust\"). Combining joy and humor with the dark, intense scenarios that Boyle's audience has come to love, After the Plague reveals a writer at the top of his form.",
