  "title": "Palace Of Tears",
  "description": "On a golden autumn afternoon in Paris, Casimir de Chateauneuf, a successful vintner, wanders through the hollow arcades of the Palais Royal. He stops to browse in an Oriental shop, and past the hookahs, turbans and daggers his eyes are drawn to a miniature portrait of an enchanting woman, skin like ivory, with one eye blue and one yellow. That night, the painting by his bedside, Casimir dreams he is lost in a city of domes and slim minarets. Alone in a shadowy courtyard a woman sits sobbing, her tears filling an empty fountain.A man possessed, Casimir abandons his wife, family, country, everything, to journey across the sea and desert in search of his vision, a journey that finally leads him to Constantinople. As East meets West, two people whose worlds are impossibly far apart are destined to meet and discover a love beyond even their wildest dreams.",
