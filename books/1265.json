  "description": "Half-vampire Cat Crawfield and her vampire husband Bones have fought for their lives, as well as for their relationship. But just when theyve triumphed over the latest battle, Cats new and unexpected abilities threaten to upset a long-standing balance. With the mysterious disappearance of vampires, rumors abound that a species war is brewing. A zealot is inciting tensions between the vampires and ghouls, and if these two powerful groups clash, innocent mortals could become collateral damage. Now Cat and Bones are forced to seek help from a dangerous â€œallyâ€â€”the ghoul queen of New Orleans herself. But the price of her assistance may prove more treacherous than even the threat of a supernatural warâ€”to say nothing of the repercussions Cat never imagined.",
