  "title": "Break of Day",
  "description": "Colette began writing Break of Day in her early fifties, at Saint-Tropez on the CÃ´te d'Azur, where she had bought a small house after the breakup of her second marriage. The novel's theme--the renunciation of love and the return to an independent existence supported and enriched by the beauty and peace of nature--grows out of Colette's own period of self-assessment in the middle of her life. A collection of subtle reflections about love and life, it is among her most thoughtful and stylistically bold works.",
