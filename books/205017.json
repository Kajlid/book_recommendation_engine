  "title": "Who Are You?: The ID16 Personality Test",
  "description": "Which of the sixteen personality types is yours? Are you an energetic and decisive ‘administrator’? A sensitive and creative ‘artist’? Or a dazzling and analytical ‘logician’, perhaps? ‘Who Are You?’ offers you the ID16 Personality Test, along with an outline of the sixteen personality types, including essential information on their natural inclinations, potential strengths and weaknesses, related types, and an overview of how often each type occurs in the world population. Armed with what you discover, you’ll understand yourself and others far better! ID16 is a personality typology which draws on the theory developed by Carl Gustav Jung. Typologies formulated on the basis of Jung’s theory are widely used in teaching, training, coaching and human resource management, as well as in career and relationship counselling. They also form a basis for numerous programmes supporting personal development and improving interpersonal relationships. The majority of global businesses employ Jungian personality tests as a standard tool in their recruitment procedures and vocational development processes. This book is part of the ID16 Personality Types series.",
