  "description": "One undeniable bond. One shared devastation. Before all hell broke loose, Colin, Sydney, and Anthony had just hit their stride in their special \"V\" relationship. They've endured their pasts, their fears, an abduction, and betrayal. But now, their relationship has been shattered and the damage has been done. The devastating events have caused Colin to accept how much he needs Sydney...and Anthony, but he's lost without his best friend at his side. Without Anthony, it's up to Colin to pick up the pieces and be the strength, the shoulder, and the shelter that Sydney needs to recover from her ordeal. But sometimes, even the strongest ones will buckle and bend. Much of the damage lies hidden, and Sydney struggles to understand the hushed secrets of what transpired while she was gone. Everything must be exposed for them to heal, but will Sydney be forced to move on without Colin and Anthony?",
