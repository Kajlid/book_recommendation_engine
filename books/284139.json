  "description": "On the Street of Gods, in the center of the city of Haven, the Beings of Power come and go. They are real and unreal, both and neither. They inspire worship and fear. The Street is theirs and theirs alone. And now, someone or something is killing them, one by one... Hawk and Fisher are on special assignment, on a street where none of the laws of nature apply... and very few of Haven's. They're two tough cops in a city of magic and mayhem. Hawk rules the streets by battle-axe. Fisher wields her dagger with unflinching skill. Together, they are the perfect crimebusters ...with a magic touch.",
