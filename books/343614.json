  "title": "Muse and Reverie",
  "description": "\"Muse and Reverie \"is an all-new collection of short fiction in Charles de Lint's \"Newford\" universe--the fifth such collection since 1993, and the first since 2002. Previous collections are \"Dreams Underfoot,\" \"The Ivory and the Horn,\" the World Fantasy Award-winning \"Memory and Dream,\" and \"Tapping the Dream Tree.\"  The city of Newford could be any city in North America, bursting with music, commerce, art, love, hate, and of course, magic. Magic in the sidewalk cracks, myth at the foundations of its great buildings, enchantment in the spaces between its people. In novels like Moonheart, Forests of the Heart, The Onion Girl, and The Mystery of Grace, and in a series of story collections as well, urban fantasy master Charles de Lint has explored that magic and those spaces, bringing to life a tapestry of people from all walks of life, each looking for a spark of the miraculous to shape their lives and transform their fates.Here, in the fifth of the story collections, we reencounter old friends, such as Jilly, Sophie, and the Crow Girls. We breathe in intimations of the world beyond death, and of magic beyond time. Longtime readers and newcomers alike will find themselves under Charles de Lintâ€™s unique spell.",
