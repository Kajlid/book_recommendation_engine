  "title": "Beyond the Spotlight: On the Road With Phyllis Diller",
  "description": "As Robin Skone-Palmer approached the mansion on Rockingham Avenue one hot September afternoon, she didn’t know what to expect. “Ask for Phyllis Diller,” the employment agent had said.Curious as much as nervous, Robin studied the beautiful house. Three-and-a-half hours later, she walked away wondering if she’d just stepped into Alice’s Wonderland.Plane travel, foreign countries, celebrities, and television studios became part of everyday life—from This Is Tom Jones in London to the Glass Festival in Elwood, Indiana.They shared raucous laughter, mind-numbing boredom, and occasionally absolute terror. The work relationship became a friendship that lasted to the day of Phyllis’s death at that same Rockingham mansion in Brentwood.Phyllis endorsed it herself (before she died), saying: Robin Skone-Palmer has written a book — it is FABULOUS! — Phyllis DillerAnd here's what her son says: I laughed a lot. What a wonderful, insightful, bright observation of a another time and place. You are kind and fair. Thank you for your service to my mother. — Perry Diller",
