  "description": "As vampire Evande Austin tries to adjust to her newfound abilities, she can't fight her new reality. She never intended to fall in love with two men. But she also never intended to take Fae blood to keep her alive either. Trouble lurks in the shadows and Evande fears she will not be able to control the raging blood fever that burns through her because of Quinn. Thanks to Logan, the man who gives her anchor, Evande is able to maintain a thread of sanity in the blinding chaos.When the Elders strike out and her future tumbles around her feet, Evande realizes the two men give her a bond she is unable to survive without. They need her just as much as she needs them. Giving into them both could just be the one thing that saves everyone.But one thing remains clear--nothing comes without a cost.  Contains elements some readers may find Violence, blood, foul-language from a smartass Fae king, a newbie vampire unashamed of his kinks and a scintillating m/f/m bath scene that's hot enough to steam mirrors",
