  "description": "Humans must have govenment. If they do not have it, they will create it. But what kind? In Volume I of the Imperial Stars series best-selling author Jerry Pournelle set out to find the answer. His reluctant conclusion: that throughout history, no matter in what form they began, all governments become empires -- or are conquered by them. From Babylon, to Persia, to Rome, to the U.S.S.R.: no matter how hight the founding ideals, the end is ever tyranny.Or is there possibly one form of govenment that can withstand the curse of power and yet be strong enough to try conclusions with Imperial legions...?Content: Republic and empire / Jerry Pournelle Outward bound / Norman Spinrad In the realm of the heart, in the world of the knife / Wayne Wightman Litany for dictatorships / Stephen Vincent Benet Doing well while doing good / Hayford Peirce The last department / Rudyard Kipling --Consititution for utopia / John W.
