  "description": "Winnie the Witch and Wilbur, her cat, are both tired of winter. The garden is covered in snow, the pond is covered in ice, icicles hang from the rooftop. Wilbur's feet are wet and his whiskers are frozen. So, Winnie casts a spell from her big book of spells and turns everything into summer.But that's her big mistake.... All over the garden little animals wake up and flowers begin to grow. Crowds of people arrive to enjoy the sunshine, and soon there is no room for Winnie and Wilbur in the garden. So out on the porch, with an imperious stomp, Winnie shuts her eyes, waves her wand fivetimes, and shouts ABRACADABRA! As the sun disappears and the snow begins to fall, Winnie and Wilbur go back inside, having decided that \"Winter is lovely too.\"The award-winning team of Korky Paul and Valerie Thomas has delivered a delightful and witty tale that is sure to be a child's favorite.",
