  "description": "John and Mattie have been best friends for years, and share everything...including women. The two disagree on what kind of woman they might find to keep forever and have both given up until a woman on a mission steps into their path. They'll have to get through more obstacles than a normal couple might, especially since bullets are flying around them.  Maria is on a mission to leave her old life behind, but falling in love with two men is not what she imagined her future to hold. Is this a life she can accept or will all of the hurdles they make it through be for nothing?",
