  "title": "Since Tomorrow",
  "description": "An old man rides a workhorse through the night,\n across mudslides, past stores abandoned for decades, past the rotted corpses of automobiles invisible under mounds of blackberry. Rain courses from his rabbit skin poncho. He carries a sword and a spear. He knows where to find the murderer. He will face him alone.The old man, Frost, remembers the Good Times, before the global collapse, before the pandemic. Those who live on his farm among fallen warehouses do what they can to maintain human values. But when others in this makeshift world are driven only by greed and the need for power, all values must be replaced by the simple instinct for survival",
