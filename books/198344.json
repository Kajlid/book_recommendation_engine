Her kids may be happy to see their dad, but Hayley’s determined not to be taken in by his charms, and suspects he’s in financial trouble—again.   Still, the haunted holiday is about to get a whole lot scarier after Danny’s moonshine-making uncle is found lying dead next to a tombstone in a cemetery—and Danny quickly becomes the prime suspect. To prove her ex is innocent, Hayley will have to dig deep into her own bag of tricks to unmask the real culprit…before anyone else—including her—ends up in the graveyard . . .  Includes seven delectable recipes from Hayley’s kitchen!  Praise for Death of aCupcake Queen   “The real treat is the author’s skill at writing witty, light-hearted humor, which makes this series truly shine.” —RT Book Reviews",
