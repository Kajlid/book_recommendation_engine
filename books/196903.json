  "description": "From the new author, Katherine Davis, read the first book of the brand new Child of Fate series, Serendipity's Daughter. Life for Kismet Jones has never been easy. Not only is she an unwanted orphan reduced to working as a servant in the orphanage of Wicker Hill, she's suspected of being a Changeling - a fae child smuggled illegally from Fairy through the veil to Earth believed to bring bad luck and curses upon all those around them. The mercy of the orphanage Cook saved her life. A landslide left a set of strange, blue eyed twins orphaned and the young Kismet proved herself useful by taking over their care, mollifying the superstitious villagers a little while longer. But time had run out. The Academy was coming to Wicker Hill for a Finding for the first time in generations and the magically gifted twins were practically guaranteed acceptance. With them gone, Wicker Hill would have no reason to tolerate a Changeling's presence among them and Kis knew she'd be exiled...or worse. A Changeling at worst, and unregistered blue eyes at best, she had little hope of following her charges into the exciting, adventure filled life promised by enlistment into the world domineering Academy. Except in this world and all the rest, Fate truly is in charge of one's destiny, and She has weaved a very special strand in her Web for Kismet.",
