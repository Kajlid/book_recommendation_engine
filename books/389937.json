And he stumbles across the means.Together, he and Angela will plunge into a global chase, pursued by a shadowy cult, dead bodies and destruction in their wake. To succeed, they must defy the gates of heaven and hell to learn a secret hidden from the world since the dawn of time . . . The Knowledge of Good & Evil.",
