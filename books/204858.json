  "description": "Paul Randall needs to start over, and Crescent Cove looks like the ideal place for the widowed pharmacist to begin again. What could be more perfect than running an old-fashioned pharmacy in an idyllic small town on the coast of northern California? But soon after purchasing the charming drugstore, Paul discovers it will be anything but business as usual in his new locale. Although Crescent Cove seems prosperous, there is also something about it that feels dangerous -- a fact that becomes disturbingly obvious when Paul finds Bria Georgopolis cowering on the side of the freeway. She unveils an eerie truth about a nearby hospital that places corporate profits above the price of human life. As the pieces of the conspiracy come together, Paul and Bria realize that it's up to them to expose the monstrous evil -- before their new beginnings lead to a very dead end.",
