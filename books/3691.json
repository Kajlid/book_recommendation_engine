Teresa left her painful past behind and built a new life for her and her son. She cares deeply for Angel, but is afraid to let down her guard. Just when she thinks she might be able to handle the flirtatious Divine Creek Ranch foreman, a holiday visitor arrives and throws her for a loop. Fresh from a one-night stand, self-confessed 'rodeo slut' bull-rider Joaquin Martinez shows up at his brother's house Christmas Eve, and finds out for himself what love at first sight feels like. She could barely handle one. Now she's got two Martinez brothers after her. Can she forget the past and fall for both her heavenly Angel and his handsome, devilish brother? ** A Siren Erotic Romance[Siren Menage Everlasting: Erotic Cowboy Menage a Trois Romance, M/F/M, sex toys]",
