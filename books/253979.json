  "title": "Tell 'Em We're Surfing: The Surf Poetry Collection by Scott Rosin",
  "description": "The word \"surfing\" has come to mean different things over the years, but to poet Scott Rosin, the most important meaning is the original: surfing waves. This varied poetic collection touches on everything from alienation, conservation, environmentalism and the joyful psyche and practice of wave-riding. Rosin presents a sensual wordscape that is accessible, thoughtful and reflective of his half-century among the breakers. Referencing classic updates of Faustus and The Ancient Mariner and employing the beat and rhythm of the ocean, Rosin gives us poems that entertain both as a smooth summer beach read and as a reflective winter fireside companion for surfers and non-surfers alike. Humorous and satirical with a tinge of the philosophical, Rosin's poems are about stepping away from our fast-paced civilization and paddling out into the watery wilds.",
