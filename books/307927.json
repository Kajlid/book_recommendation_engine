A new strain of the virus has the medical community baffled, and at the first sign of symptoms, Eveleen is shipped to the Hollow, a treatment facility, to be quarantined. But there is more to the virus than anyone knows, and Eveleen soon learns the horrifying truth of her condition—she’s turning into a vampire. Eveleen struggles to accept the fate the doctors tell her is inevitable, and with other patients in the Hollow, forms a plan to fight back against the so-called treatment they are being subjected to. But time is running out—if they don’t escape soon, Eveleen and her friends—along with anyone else who contracts the disease—will be lost forever. Does contain dark themes and mild language.",
