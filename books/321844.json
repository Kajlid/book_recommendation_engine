  "description": "Darker than romance Atticus and Grace were each others salvation—up until they became the cause of each others pain. “I gave you a choice, Grace. A chance to redeem yourself and what do you do? You curse me. You threaten me, you hit me. You bite me like a rabid dog. Knowing damn well I wouldn’t hit you back. But I will make your life miserable if you don’t do what I want. You owe me seven years and a chance to watch my child grow inside you. I want everything you robbed me of by running away and keeping my son from me.”He was crazy.“Have you completely lost your mind?” I screeched.“Yes. Because of you,” he chuckled.I twisted my body, but it was a futile effort. \"Let me go or I’m going to scream.\"The cold smile he gave me was unnerving.\"Do it.\" He let my throat go. I opened my mouth to do just that, but only a gasp came out because with his now free hand, he lifted my skirt and snatched my panties clean off in one tug.Using his thick thigh, he forced my legs apart. He let go of my wrist, bent and gripped my right leg and hooked it over his arm. Spreading me open. I was forced to stop fighting against him and grab a hold of his shoulder to keep myself from falling.“What are—”\"Shut up and scream, Grace. Come on, I'll do it with you.” he yelled in my face. “My wife is probably right outside the door. You seem to give a fuck about her feelings, but I don’t.\"His voice was so loud I knew if she was outside she’d hear everything he was saying.“I'd get off on her coming in and finding my dick buried inside you. You don’t know how fucking much I hate that woman.” He confessed.",
