  "title": "Confessions of a Swinging Single Sea Turtle: The Fourteenth Sherman's Lagoon Collection",
  "description": "What happens in Sherman's Lagoon doesn't always stay in Sherman's Lagoon. In this, the fourteenth collection of Sherman's Lagoon comic strips, we examine the once-taboo subject of sea turtle courting rituals and conclude that, although sea turtles may be remarkable navigators, it's a cruel exercise in Darwinism when they show up at the right place without the right pickup line.With 280 strips featuring the adventures and misadventures of Sherman the great white shark and undersea entourage, Confessions of a Swinging Sea Turtle gives fans of the strip a much-needed dip in Sherman's Lagoon .",
