  "description": "Unlike some sci-fi authors who create settings that are so far-fetched they aren't believable, Halstead writes about a future world that is very real and plausible. The author does an excellent job of exploring how far people will go to ensure their own survival. I thoroughly enjoyed \"Ice Princess\" and hope the author continues with a 3rd installment! -Kim DaweThe truly amazing thing is how much of a story Jason Halstead fits into a novella of this length - it was very impressive! He keeps the action tight and the plot moving quickly along - nothing is described, mentioned or talked about that doesn't relate to the overall story. \"Ice Princess\" is the sort of novella that allows you to really sink your teeth into it. -Katy SozaevaTanya Kurkova is still wanted. The technology used to rebuild her can't be allowed to fall into the wrong hands. This time her father has sent a new hunter after her. A new hunter with the same technology plus years of experience and unlimited resources.What he doesn't have is a clear memory of the last year of his life. The answers to his questions lie in the desolate wilderness of southeastern Utah. One way or another, she has to be brought in.For Tanya once escape becomes impossible only one option remains: revenge.",
