  "title": "Wild, Weird, and Wonderful: The American Circus 1901-1927 as seen by F. W. Glasier, Photographer",
  "description": "Here, in both glory and grit, is the American circus during the most vibrant period in its history. These photographs, not seen for almost a century, capture both the intensity of the routines and the spirit of camaraderie of the performers. They show it all, from the parades and the Big Top to the train leaving town, from performers hanging by their teeth to hanging out the laundry.",
