  "description": "Electra Brown can be very shallow. Her dad is having a mid-life crisis, her mom's given in to her daytime TV addiction, her little brother (aka The Little Runt) has been caught shoplifting Tampax and even Google the guinea pig's gone mental. But despite life going pear-shaped around her, all Electra can think of is whether green eyeliner complements or clashes with blue eyes!",
