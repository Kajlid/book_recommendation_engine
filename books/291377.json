  "title": "The Case for Keto: Rethinking Weight Control and the Science and Practice of Low-Carb/High-Fat Eating",
  "description": "A revelatory expose of the bad science behind conventional weight loss advice, arguing for low-carb high-fat diets, from the bestselling author of The Case Against Sugar.While government and nutritional agencies still spout the failed mantra of calorie reduction, doctors treating diabetes and obesity are experiencing extraordinary results among patients cutting out carbs; a diet that has the essential benefit of allowing you to lose weight without ever feeling hungry.With forensic journalistic rigour and in compelling prose, world authority Gary Taubes analyses the bad science behind our nutritional dogma. He shows that weight gain is driven by genetic, hormonal factors - and not overeating or 'gluttony' as is commonly the underlying suggestion - citing compelling evidence that people with the propensity to fatten easily can be helped best by a low carbohydrate high-fat diet.This groundbreaking read offers hope to anyone wishing to prevent or reverse diabetes or obesity - as well as anyone wanting to eat more healthily - and will fundamentally change our habits around food forever.",
