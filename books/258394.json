  "description": "My name's Mallory F'Cent, and I'm always horny.  No, get your mind out of the gutter. Not THAT kind of horny.  I'm talking about the horns on my head. It doesn't matter how I try to disguise them with updo’s and headscarves; they're two permanent, pointy reminders of my parentage - a feisty Fairy Godmother for a mom, and a towering ogre with poor impulse control for a dad.  I can’t help stand out even as I try desperately to blend in.  Then I go and turned into a Big Bad.  Secrets leave my heart in tatters, and I turn the man I love from sexy stud into a sad sack.  And the worst part?  Despite everything I've done to him, Stefan's still willing to fight to find our Happy Ever After and he’s determined to prove there’s a halo held up by my horns!   Author’s Note: Not So Wicked is a full-length novel full of crazy fun. Ever wonder what would happen if Maleficent and Ursula were best friends? Find out with this romantic comedy stand-alone.  *Each book in the Fairytale Fantasy series can be read by itself.",
