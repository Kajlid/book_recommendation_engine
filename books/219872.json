But a lot of hurdles had to be taken before the first guests could be accommodated.In this book Stef reports about his adventures in buying and reconstructing the house, obtaining a tax number and a bank account, registering at the commune and at the national health service, importing their car and a range of other things that led to a myriad of bureaucratic troubles. These problems were always resolved in a truly Italian fashion, leading to raised Dutch eyebrows and hilarious scenes.About mafiose real estate agents, Mussolini-type builders, lousy plumbers, Italian neighbours and much more!As a reader you will encounter a range of characteristic Italians, from sympathetic to villainous, from moving to shameless. Real Italians of flesh and blood, sometimes cliché, sometimes surprisingly original. But always worth encountering.Readers' Favorite:\"a comical, often downright hilarious account\"\"Stef writes in a style all his own that keeps you riveted and thoroughly entertained.\"\"the true essence of the Italian people without falling into the usual stereotypes\"",
