  "description": "Falling for my kidnapper is a terrible idea.He’s a bad man and I don’t mean trash like your ex. I mean seriously bad. I mean dangerous. You can tell just by looking at him; black eyes, a menacing scowl, and a nose that’s been badly broken in the past.He is my arch nemesis. My mortal enemy. My singular obsession.I was afraid of him when we met. He took me against will and kept me chained to a bed. Me, Damon Alexander Beckett of BeckIT fame and fortune. Well, the joke’s on him because I’m going to make it my life’s mission to destroy him. But first, I have to survive being his captive. He’s here all the time. Watching me. His heavy male presence never more than five feet away, dark, glinting eyes tracking down my body.When he propositions me indecently, I am shocked and outraged. As I should be. Seriously, the audacity of him is unreal.It’s obvious I should say no. It goes without saying. Any sane person would laugh in his face.So why am I sinking to my knees?",
