  "description": "Seven years ago, I found myself, bruised and broken, standing at my grandmother's door, preparing the one and only lie I'd ever tell her. I couldn't tell her how I had truly come by those bruises. I couldn't tell her HE did it. I couldn't be that cliche. She took me in. Fixed me. Advised me. Now, I live in her house and run her coffee shop in the best place in the world, Balboa Island. This island, the locals... everything was predictable... right down to the weather, just the way I liked it - no surprises. When she passed, she left it all to me. It was my safe haven, my happy place. Until... Max came back. ****Warning**** REcovered contains sexually explicit scenes and adult language. This material is intended for adults only!",
