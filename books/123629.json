  "description": "\"If Spike Lee directed Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" In a post-apocalyptic world of sci-fi action-adventure, are a deadly FBI Agent and America's Most Wanted criminal enough to time travel back to Nazi-occupied Paris to rescue African American jazz musicians from certain death? How do you mend a broken heart? How do you fill the emptiness inside your soul? You answer your inner calling and combat sadistic androids, racial prejudice, and Nazi oppression against an action-packed backdrop of 1940s wartime romance, cinematic crime noir, and swing music. Speculative fiction and Afrofuturism collide with actual historical events in hyper-realistic gameplay and martial arts. It's heists, Hitler, ass-kicking lesbians, and the French Resistance— so strap in tight.",
