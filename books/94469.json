  "description": "When Elizabeth Gunnar accepts a teaching position at the preparatory school she attended as a girl, she is returning to more than a place--to memories, mysteries, and an old love. Once there she meets unexpected challenges--and challenging new people. She revisits ghosts of the past and old self-doubts. And she is reminded of the faith that first captured her there in what she called her “moments of being.”",
