  "title": "Shy Gal: An Introvert's Journey Through High School",
  "description": "Bella is an introverted teenage girl who is about to enter her first year of high school. As nervous as she is, she feels confident, since she has the support of her extroverted friend, Mercedes, who has helped and guided her through grade school. But Bella's confidence is quickly shattered. Without any warning, Mercedes is moved to another class, and Bella is left on her own to deal with with all her insecurities and challenges. The biggest is being in the same class as a bully she has known since grade school, Brianna Mason, without her best friend and protector, Mercedes, by her side. Bella manages to navigate her experiences of being put on the spot by standing her ground in many unique, tense, yet humorous situations while befriending Izzy, the outcast girl she barely talked to in middle school. Bella must learn tolerance and patience with her new friend while often being hilariously whipped out of her comfort zone.",
