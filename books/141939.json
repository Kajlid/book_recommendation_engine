  "description": "From H. Beam Piper , the creator of the Terrohuman Future History and the bestselling Fuzzy novels, come the parallel worlds of Paratime —collected for the first time in one volume. Infinite worlds allowed for infinite evil—unless the doorway to those worlds was most carefully guarded. The Paratime Police are an elite force of men and women charged with defending a million unsuspecting Earths from their more developed—and more ruthless—neighbors in parallel continua. From the original Paratime , which introduced the unceasing struggles of the time-traveling heroes, to Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen , the last Paratime story of a state trooper’s conquest of an alternate Earth... The Complete Paratime is a grand science fiction experience.",
