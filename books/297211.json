  "description": "He has something that belongs to her, something he can’t give back…Nakita Faulkner may be straight-laced, but she's never one to back down from a bet with her twin brother. That's how she finds herself reluctantly getting her first tattoo. Her attraction to her sexy tattooist makes the whole situation even more awkward. Still, there’s no way she’d ever have anything to do with someone like him—she has a plan for her life and she’s sticking with it. Lennox Conrad—Nox—a tattooist with a troubled past is trying to get his life back on track. When Nakita walks into his parlour, Nox is more than a little intrigued by the uptight redhead, determined to get a tattoo she clearly doesn’t want. As drawn as he is to her, bookish innocents really aren’t his type. Besides, there are circumstances beyond his control and time is running out. One night Nakita’s world is turned upside down. A strange twist of fate throws her back into the path of Nox. She discovers something about him that compels her to make an unusual proposition—a proposition he cannot refuse.  Will the very thing that draws them together, tear them apart? Black Ink Heart is a captivating and powerful love story about choosing when to hold on and when to let go. If you like raw emotion, sensual romance and compelling characters, then you’ll adore this much-loved standalone romance.",
