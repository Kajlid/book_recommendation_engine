  "title": "A Suite Life",
  "description": "Frustrated landscape painter Delaney Forbes finally quits her day job and is free to escape her stifling home town of Buttermilk Falls, Ontario. Nothing can stand in the way of her dream of a year spent painting in Paris -- nothing except an inopportune fire that temporarily compromises her finances, followed by a lucrative short-term job offer from handsome hotelier and absolutely confirmed bachelor Trey Sullivan. While living in adjacent penthouse suites, Delaney dreams of painting in Paris and Trey determines to avoid the career-killing ties of love and marriage, goals immediately jeopardized by their mutual attraction. But their agreement to a no-strings romance soon falters as the pair begins to realize the depth of their feelings for one another. They promise not to stand in the way of each other's goals, but their creativity and ambition come at a price that might prove to be too steep. A Suite Life is the second book in the Suite Love Series by Sue Gibson.",
