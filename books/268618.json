  "description": "Our dork of destiny rides again! Edger is falling for Mary, his bodyguard, kick-ass spy, and cover wife. But she's so hopelessly out of his league, it's clear someone's going to get hurt. Less clear? That someone may be the Prime Minister of Australia. When Mary confesses her desire to kill the world leader whose assassination Edger's supposed to prevent, Edger's superpowers pick the worst time to stop working. Without a fully functional psychic superhero, their team of spies can no longer order him to probe Mary's mind for ill intent. The stage is set for a confrontation that threatens to strip a defenseless Edger of his loyal protector just when he needs her most. Return to the Collective Unconscious, this time with Listerine-chugging stoners, Hollyweirdos, commie-alien-kung fu robots, one space gorilla-unicorn, and an exceedingly lovesick Vladimir Putin. Mind your fingers and toes on page 222. Those skydiving mind-control monkeys have been known to bite!",
