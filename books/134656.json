  "description": "Readers may be familiar with such things as natural weather forecasting, basic tracking and natural navigation, but THE WALKER'S GUIDE will reveal intriguing new lessons, including telling the time and date using the stars and detecting which animals are around by listening to birdsong. Anyone with an interest in the outdoors may already know how to gauge the distance of a storm by counting after lightning or how to estimate the age of dead trees by counting rings. But people have never been given the chance to learn many more similar skills from one book until now... Written by the author of THE NATURAL NAVIGATOR and THE NATURAL EXPLORER, THE WALKER'S GUIDE is for everyone to enrich their own walks and see their surroundings in a completely new light.",
