  "description": "The sermons of Charles Haddon Spurgeon were the pinnacle of preaching in mid-nineteenth-century England. They are still powerful and widely influential today. This five-volume set is a compilation of Spurgeon's best sermons, covering topics from Israel in Egypt and confession of sin to justification by grace and Paul's first prayer. Originally published in ten volumes in 1883, this collection was printed in five volumes by Baker in 1996 and is now back in print.",
