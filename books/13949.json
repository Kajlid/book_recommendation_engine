  "description": "Trinity is a massage therapist who has issues with men. Her last ex was a no good cheater. But she misses dating, and especially kissing. When she meets Chet she decides she must have him. They start dating and things heat up quickly. They are caught between wanting to prove themselves since their former relationships left them insecure, and doing the right thing, which is to wait for marriage. It proves to be more difficult than either of them anticipated.Chet's first response to Trinity when he receives an unexpected massage embarrasses him, but he wants to see her again. Since he doesn't get any romance in real life, he's writing love stories on the side hoping to become a published author someday. So far he hasn't written a novel good enough to sell, but when he meets Trinity his muse not only returns, but his writing is stellar. Too bad it's only fiction.",
