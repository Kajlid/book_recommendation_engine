  "description": "To Millicent Brewer, Barnum may as well be Poseidon when he walks out of a rip current's swell in the Pacific Ocean to save her five-year-old son from drowning. Jonah is her whole world. However, Millie's divorce taught her to avoid tall, gorgeous men--badasses her sister Denny calls them. And the glow in Barnum's eyes stirs her. No. Not merely gratitude. More like an emotional alarm prompting her to remain on her guard.Trouble emerges in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico with two murders at their hotel. To prevent retribution from the Jalisco Drug Cartel, Barnum fetches Millie, Denny, and Jonah in the middle of the night to board his yacht.One evening while walking on the beach, Barnum gathers Millie in his arms in a passionate kiss that turns black clouds into white linen, and Millie senses the two of them floating far above the ground. While the man provides for all their needs with charm and kindness, through unfathomable occurrences, Millie considers Barnum might not be human.",
