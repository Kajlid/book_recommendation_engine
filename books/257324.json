  "description": "When we were younger, Temperance Price was the quiet girl with dreamy eyes who hung on my every word. She was always beautiful, but I had plans to get out of Red Oak and make a life of my own. Ten years later, a crushing tragedy has brought me home again—right back to her. The innocent girl I left is gone, and in her place is a sassy single mom I can’t get out of my head. She’s hired me to fix her house, but I have other things in mind. She thinks I’m just a handyman. She thinks we’re only friends. She thinks I’ve never noticed her. I think what really needs to be fixed is her whole perspective.",
