  "description": "Wolfe Creek is a place with a zero percent divorce rate because wolves mate for life. Most meet their mates by the time they are twenty-five. The Alpha is already thirty-two and still unmated. Unrest is starting to rise in both him and his pack. Something’s got to give.  Hunter is on the prowl, searching for his mysterious nightly lover. She has to be his mate, but he can’t find her anywhere. He’s well past his breaking point and needs to find her before he loses his mind.  Catherine Kinney is struggling to get by from day to day with no job or money. She was doing well in school and work until she started dreaming of him. Damn him and his beautiful blue eyes, she thought.  Both of them thought they were going crazy. They developed a love/hate relationship for sleep. Would they ever find peace? Just when they feel like there’s no hope, fate steps in and brings them together.  But what happens when you get what you ask for and then some?  Can they handle the passion that engulfs them both? Especially when they can feel each other’s emotions.",
