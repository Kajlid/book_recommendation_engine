  "title": "The Fury Queenâ€™s Harem",
  "description": "One hybrid Fury queen. Three pure-blood Dragon Princes. A reverse harem with a dark fairy tale twist and an epic flair!  My name is Daisy. I've been cursed to serve a bad-tempered elemental in my beastly form for centuries. There's only one way to lift the curse: a kiss from three true loves. To garner even one is nearly impossible. How am I going to get three? Then three gorgeous-as-sin, yet clueless dragon princes stumble into my lair. Only they do not come to kiss me. They come to slay me without knowing who I really am. Unless they cut the three heads of the Furies--my heads--or make the Fury Queen fall in love with them, they'll never shift back to dragons. Not surprisingly, the princes all choose what they think is the easiest--to behead the beasts.",
