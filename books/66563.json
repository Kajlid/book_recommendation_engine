  "description": "For many years, The Black Stallion books by Walter Farley have been among the most popular books with young readers on the Navajo Nation. With this in mind, Salina Bookshelf, working in conjunction with the Black Stallion Literacy Project, offers a new edition of the 1961 children's classic Little Black, A Pony. Translated into Navajo and completely re-illustrated by Baje Whitethorne, Sr. in vivid watercolors, this book on friendship and unwavering loyalty promises to steal readers' hearts. A little boy is in love with horses. He takes Little Black, his very own pony, on rides all around his family's property. However, one day the boy decides to ride Big Red, a horse that can do practically everything run fast, jump over obstacles, and even swim across rushing rivers! The boy begins spending more and more time with Big Red and less and less time with Little Black. However, when a ride on Big Red ends in a frightening accident, the boy must rely on Little Black to save him. Is there one thing Little Black can do that Big Red can't?",
