At least she has help, albeit from an unlikely source: Gil Pratt, a member of her handsome tenant Tripp Blackston's veterans group and co-owner of a motorcycle repair shop with his brother. Abby and Gil may seem like an odd couple, but they work great together.The event seems to be running smoothly--until city council member James DiSalvo is found murdered in a ravine along the race route.

Now the two race organizers must again team up to prove Gary's innocence--before the real killer makes a run for it. But one wrong step and Abby may be the next one to come in dead last...",
