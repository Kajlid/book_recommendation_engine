  "description": "In this landmark book endorsed by Chuck Colson, Dr. Vishal Mangalwadi surveys the Gospel's power to reform society. Lessons gleaned from the Bible come alive when viewed through the lens of his own experience. Rather than simply suggesting that politicians invest more money in aiding the oppressed, Mangalwadi delves into the ideological roots of social oppression. he suggests that reform is never without controversy, and that reforming a culture's values is a necessary precursor to stable, lasting liberation for the oppressed. His book culminates with the Christian vision of hope in God's making all things new.",
