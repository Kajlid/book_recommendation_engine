  "description": "HE NEEDED A SCRIBE Only two things could cheer Lord Jason Renwick, near-blinded by an accident in India. One was his pet tiger, Sahib, who earned Jason's Sussex house the nickname Tiger's Lair; the other, his journals of that exotic land which he could no longer read. But when he secured the well-schooled services of Miss Eustacia Coleson and her lovely lilting voice, and embarked on a memoir, a dilemma faced him. Eustacia had become the light of his life--and Sahib's! She was an angel who made him dream of the most intimate bliss. Yet no man of honor, maimed as he was, could aspire to such a lady's hand... SHE WANTED A POSITION Eustacia found herself in quite a pickle. Her reverend father's death had reduced her to a life of genteel poverty with a stepmother who ran up debts for fripperies, and proposed to marry Eustacia to a fat, elderly, malodorous suitor. Tiger's Lair was her only escape. Intrigued by his lordship's tawny beast--and even more by its handsome, growling master and his tales of the East--Eustacia endeavored to free Jason from his cage of bitterness--only to find herself imprisoned by a hopeless love. For parsons' daughters never became baronesses! Not, that is, without help from a feline lord of the jungle",
