  "description": "THE GRAND CHAM, originally published in Adventure magazine in 1922 but never before in book form, is a grand story of revenge that begins in the camp of the Turkish lord, Bayezid, but quickly moves on to Venice, the deck of a galley, an overland caravan, and the tent of Tamerlane the Great, amongst many other places. When hero Micheal Bearn is crippled by Bayezid, he vows vengeance and escapes captivity, surviving when his companions fall, which serves only to strengthen his resolve. Barefoot, injured, and broke in the land of his enemies shortly after the story opens, he lives to see his fortunes turn, and, most importantly, his vow fulfilled. This is the first book publication of THE GRAND CHAM, which also features a new introduction by Lamb scholar Howard Jones.",
