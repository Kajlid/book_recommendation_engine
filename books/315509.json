  "description": "Ren’s homecoming wishlist includes:•Arman not bashing everyone’s heads together (at least not without him)•Getting the fortress built before the Mongs attack (not at the rate they’re going with all the thefts happening)•Going home without incident (also, again, not likely)What it did not include was:•Social reform•A child•A raiding party•Arman actually using his wordsLife once again proved reality is better than fantasy, and Ren couldn’t be happier.Except for the Mongs. He could do without the Mongs.Tags:Homecoming, Arman actually uses his words, it’s a miracle, children, homophobic idiots, supportive brother, surprise visits from royalty, Ren would like to point out this was not his idea, words are hard, if you have to build a fortress do it right the first time, Arman promises to not beat the whole country to a pulp for scorning his marriage, maybe, no promises, parenting is hard, someone should have warned Arman, raiding parties are their jam, O’ Broín is a good bro, matchmaking, social change, Arman sucks at giving hints, absolutely no one is surprised by this, fantasy becomes reality",
