When he s not putting crooks behind bars, he s watching out for his team of young constables, only too aware that for them as much as for him the knock about humor of the station is in stark contrast to the dangers they face on the beat. Sheep steeling and shoplifting are everyday crimes in Heckley, but there are local villains with bigger fish to fry. When Charlie suspects a now-respected businessman, with a background of extortion and GBH, of involvement in an international art fraud, he's taking on an enemy with friends in high places.
