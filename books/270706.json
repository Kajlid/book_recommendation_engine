A scheme that will see her empress not just of Bessemia, but the entire continent of Vesteria. But the princesses have their own plans.Beatriz and Daphne are still separated by a continent, and there are enemies everywhere, but now they have allies, and they stretch across the borders of Vesteria. Sophronia’s husband, the deposed King Leopold; Violie, a former spy for Empress Margaraux; and Beatriz’s missing husband, Pasquale and his lover, Ambrose. Now, with their help and the magic of the stars above, the princesses are ready to make their final stand.But whispers of an ancient prophecy follow them--there are secrets from the their past that have yet to be revealed—and every move they make, the empress seems to always be one step ahead them. If there’s any hope for the princesses, the girls will need to use every skill their mother taught them, trust in the magic in their veins, and defy fate, itself—or all is lost for the people of Vesteria.",
