  "description": "Long before the world bowed down to the band Whispered Words, they bowed down to me. I was a simple girl in a small town, working two jobs and juggling college full-timeâ€”all in the name of a better future. Until them...Kieran. Cal. Ash. Rad. They marched into my world like a hurricane, infiltrating every aspect of my life and taking control until they owned every inch of me. I became their obsession. Their toy to use. And I ate up every second of it. Looking back, I should have run in the opposite direction the moment they mentioned my family name. West. I should have known they were only chasing me for my father, Corbin West's multi-million-dollar music legacy. But I didn't. I stayed. I loved. And then I was wrecked. Every fortified wall I erected, they beat down until I was left in shambles, and then they shattered me to pieces. Music. Lies. Love. Betrayal. S*x. Money. Rock and roll. It all amounted to a whirlwind romance full of deceptive destruction and betrayal.
