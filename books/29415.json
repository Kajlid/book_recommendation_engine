  "title": "Canyon of Dreams: The Magic and the Music of Laurel Canyon",
  "description": "A lavishly illustrated insider’s look at 80 years of music and culture in Laurel Canyon--a ZIP code with its own playlist. Sonny & Cher, the Doors, the Monkees, the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; the Eagles, Carole King, and others cultivated their immortal sounds in this L.A.-based musical fraternity. Written by a long-time Canyon resident who knows them all, Canyon of Dreams traces the history of the community and its enduring legacy. Taking a deeply personal approach, it uses a multiple-voice narration based on exclusive interviews with the area’s musical elite. Because of their close connection with Kubernik, some of these stars are speaking openly for the first time.  New in paper .",
