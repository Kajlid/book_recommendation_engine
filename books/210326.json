  "description": "When desire burns hotter than fire...  I knew the rules, I've played by them for years. Don't get too close, Don't fall in love. Focus on work, Focus on me.  But I broke all the rules, I fell hard for him, And he for me. After all, how could I not fall for him? A major league baseball player, With a killer smile and an incredible body? He's strong, hot, and amazing, In bed.  He's everything, That I'm not allowed to have. Someone doesn't want us together. Someone will destroy us both if we get too close.  But we're already there, Bound by love, Held together by our hearts. Burning for each other, Just as the fire starts.  And now, we're forced to decide. Let our desire burn, Or extinguish what we both want. Can the fire burn without destroying us both?  *This is a stand-alone, full-length romance with a HEA and no cliffhanger.",
