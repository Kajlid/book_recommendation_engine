  "description": "He wants to steal their money. They want to steal his memories.  The thief who calls himself Now You Don't serves the Trickster, exalting the humble and humbling the exalted. In the course of this noble enterprise, he discovers a conspiracy to recreate a magical interrogation drug, forbidden since the War of Gods for its memory-stealing side effects.  And the first people the conspirators plan to use it on will lead them straight to his family.  Tracking the source of the drug, he and his companions must battle pirates, Justicemen, and a guardian automaton in a desperate race against time. They've carried out many successful heists, but can they destroy the conspiracy before it steals from them what they value more than anything?",
