  "description": "Obsidian crows frequently get run over because quite frankly, they’re too damn lazy to get out of the way and anyway, they usually just get up and walk off again afterwards. They are flightless birds, mainly because they were extremely hard-bodied and far too heavy to fly – unless they fall off a cliff or get launched from a catapult. (Anything will fly if launched from a catapult – just ask the Navy.)Deanna is just another third rate colony in the Terran Empire – and it’s pretty much as boring a lump of rock as could be expected. That is, until Gary Beck, a.k.a. Beck the Badfeller runs over an obsidian crow with his Jeepo and doesn’t have a spare tire. (Things pretty much go down hill from there.)The day started off rather nicely for Albrecht, who just more-or-less recovered from a nervous breakdown. (All you had to do was ask him for a cup of Hot Stuff Blend and then you’d see why some things are meant to be drunk while standing up.) There’s an assassin in town now and she has a score to settle. She’s pretty, but as most poets will tell you, beauty can be deceiving. The same poets, who would write about Helen of Troy as the face that launched a thousand ships, would write about Villainessa Tittle as the bitch that sank them. As an assassin, she’s the worst kind; this means she takes pride in her work, enjoys what she does for a living – and above all, that she’s bloody good at it. And this time unfortunately, it’s absolutely 100 percent personal.",
