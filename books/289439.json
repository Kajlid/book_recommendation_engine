Sometimes you meet someone, maybe meet isn't the right word. You don't even have say hello for this to happen. You simply pass by them and everything in your world changes forever.

The moment when something inside of you ignites to life, recognizing their other half that's been gone for far too long. It burns hot, destroying any hope that it's only a coincidence, and that life will go back to what it was.These moments are never forgotten.That's only with a single glance.I can tell you what a single touch will do. It will destroy you and everything you thought you knew. I felt all of this with Jase Cross, every flick of the flames that roared inside of me. I knew he'd be my downfall, and I was determined to be his just the same.Irresistible Attraction is the complete collection of the USA Today bestselling, Irresistible Attraction series.",
