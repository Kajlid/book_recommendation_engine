  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B07PG2VCRBLera isn’t a hero. The world doesn’t know that.  Lera needs to keep her head down—not an easy feat when a giant gray wolf with a fondness for her dorm room starts roaming the Academy. Worse still, Lera’s caught the attention of the powerful and popular Princess Katita, who doesn’t like her territory trespassed upon—especially when that territory is a particular red-haired athlete…  Tye learned the hard way years ago that competition training and love don’t mix, but every moment he spends with Lera is testing that resolve. The hauntingly beautiful new cadet makes Tye feel like he’s playing with fire—a fire he’d do well to avoid. But when Lera’s bravery thrusts her into grave danger, Tye may have no choice but to get burned.  SCENT OF A WOLF is the third episode in the GREAT FALLS ACADEMY novella series, featuring the same reverse-harem cast as Alex Lidell’s internationally bestselling POWER OF FIVE series. (Reading the POWER OF FIVE novels is not necessary to enjoy GREAT FALLS ACADEMY.)",
