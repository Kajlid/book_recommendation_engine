  "title": "A Life Without Touch: A Modern Romance During Covid-19",
  "description": "\"The world got quiet. It seems like everyone was in unison. Do not touch. Social Distancing. Isolation. Quarantine. A virus gave a new status quo. Be alone to be alive. But be active to let others know you've survived\" \"The simplest things in life sounds, so dramatic and far fetched as I desire them. I would not explain it to myself years ago, the anxiety I am experiencing now. The fear of taking a book, walking across the street to the park, and reading. So simple? So it seems. I didn't know, taking such a risk that day, would lead to meeting him.\"",
