That suits them fine -- but only if they can first brave a rough and windy sea to fetch the new priest in time for Christmas. \"That mysterious thing, the spirit of Christmas, is brought heartily to life. Rie Muqoz brings to her brilliantly stylized pictures a knowledge stored up during a year spent as a teacher on the island in the Bering Sea.\" --The New York Times\"A beautifully designed book to enjoy at any time of the year.\" --The Horn Book",
