  "description": "You've heard music can affect your mood, but what if could do more? What if a song not only got stuck in your head but in the rest of your body as well? What if music became addictive?Someone in the town of Lyman has discovered a melody more addictive than any drug and is selling it on the streets. Teenagers are hooked with one listen--they stop paying attention in school, playing with their friends, and even eating. And to buy more they resort to selling all they have, then selling all they can find or steal. And in the distance, an ominous howl can be heard--a harbinger of death.Only the intervention of the Wandering Koala--a mysterious traveler mute since childhood--has any chance of freeing the town from this invisible trap.The Hook (a Wandering Koala tale) is a fully illustrated short story by Jeff Thomason and the latest exciting chapter in the Wandering Koala saga!",
