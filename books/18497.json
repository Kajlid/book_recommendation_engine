  "description": "As the prophet Nephi concluded his writings and history of his people, he stated that he was not \"mighty in writing,\" but that \"I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great worth, and especially unto my people.\" Then he concluded, \"Ye shall know that I have been commanded of Christ to write these things, notwithstanding my weakness.\" (2 Nephi 33.) Feelings of weakness and inadequacy are common to almost all mortals, as they strive for eventual perfection. In Notwithstanding My Weakness, author Neal A. Maxwell presents a positive course for those who need encouragement and reassurance and who are striving to put off the natural man and become saintlike. \"In these times of hopelessness we must cultivate in ourselves a particularized and 'perfect brightness of hope,' he writes. \"We will surely need, too, genuine patience, not only with others but also with ourselves, for impatience so often opens the door for despair and contempt. . . . Though we feel weak, our help is much needed by those . . . converts coming into the Church who will be undertaking the very same 'mighty change' in their hearts and lives. \"As together we become less spotted by the world and more pure-achieving this condition in a time of gross immorality and corruption-then we can become worthy of being called 'true believers in Christ.'\" Notwithstanding My Weakness presents a reassuring message of hope for those who are discouraged, who are weighed down with stress and anxiety, who feel weak and inadequate. To those who do overcome their weaknesses and imperfections, the promise is truly \"The kingdom is yours.\" (D&C 38:15.)",
