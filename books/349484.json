  "description": "Mica Moon is a fourteen year old girl, and already the weight of the world sits on her shoulders. She can see human energy fields (auras) and is a great healer in her town of Sedona, Arizona. She has been living in the domes ever since global warming and the ID virus robbed the people of Earth from their freedom, forty years ago in 2012.When the World Leader falls ill, he summons Mica to heal him and gives her a great task. She scours the country with her band of followers, including Dylan, a prophetic dreaming gypsy boy. Together they make believers out of the most doubtful individuals. While running from Damian Black, the man persistent to see her fail, she finds safety in other worlds. But can she get back to, and save the world she is destined to? (The first book in a planned 5-part series.)",
