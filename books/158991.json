  "description": "A prequel to the paranormal thriller Polar Night.  Locomotive wheels screech to a halt. Potters Creek, Alaska is nothing more than a small camp set up alongside the tracks. A weathered sign dominates the scene.  The Turnagain Arm Saloon  Est.1917   Only one passenger remains and exits.  The early afternoon full moon peaks through a shimmering snow fall as a shadow casts over each split rail. The wind howls, sweeping the cloak of a hooded figure. He follows the tracks toward the distant saloon. A hulking man crunches through the snow, attracting his attention.  Calling out to him in a foreign accent, the townsman stops in mid step. The stranger catches up and engages him.  Until…  The man disappears under the stranger’s cloak.  Blood drips from his lips, and he wipes the remaining trickles from his mouth. After disposing of the body, the mysterious figure continues on his journey. He glides through the snow as if on a sleigh, leaving no footprints behind.   * * * * *   Within a short period, he convinces Vasyl, the owner of the saloon, to hire him. Aleksei charms everyone he meets. But soon mistrust enters every tense line on Vasyl’s face as others disappear and his wife falls under Aleksei’s spell.  The classic game of cat and mouse continues, but who will win?  Is a mere mortal any match for Aleksei?  A spark ignites within Alexei after yet another of Vasyl’s attempts to disgrace him.  This man knows of me. He must be a witch. Aleksei laughs. You are no match for me or my plan.",
