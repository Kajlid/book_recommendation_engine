  "description": "Happy Holidays! Well, maybe not so happy as far as Mama Bear is concerned. She misses Christmas past, when her family gathered together around a little tree, with feelings of love and goodwill. But this year it seems as if everybody in Bear Country has gone Christmas-crazy -- fighting for the last toy on the shelf, jamming the roadways with honking cars, and covering Bear homes with enough Christmas lights to blot out the stars. Mama Bear isn't the only one who thinks this Christmas lacks the true holiday spirit. Someone is watching the Bears on his scanner-machine -- someone who knows more about Christmas than anyone and doesn't like what he sees one bit. It is Santa Bear, of course, and he's ready to take drastic action! Only the Berenstain Bears can change his mind, but will they be in time to save Christmas? Like the Bear family, Stan, Jan, and Mike Berenstain have the true Christmas spirit in their hearts, and they prove it with this merry holiday story.",
