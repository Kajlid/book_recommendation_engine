  "description": "The cheerleading squad at Shadyside has always been strong, but now there are rumors that lack of funds may mean the end of cheerleading at Shadyside. That would be a shame for Heather Wyatt, who has just transferred from her old school, where she was a star, and is eager to join the squad. There s only one other girl who stands in her way rich, spoiled Devra Dalby, who is also trying out for the one open slot. The competition to join the squad is anything but friendly and it ends in murder. Will Heather make the squad if there's even a squad anymore or will she end up dead?",
