  "title": "One Incarnate Truth: Christianity's Answer to Spiritual Chaos",
  "description": "The book consists of 28 articles by recognized Christian authors, clergy, and laity, who seek ways in which Christians can relate to the postmodern world. Contributors are committed Christians from several denominations, known for their public profession of the faith.The book is loosely structured along key dates of the church year, especially Advent and Christmas. The articles show how Christianity relates to society, broadly dealing with philosophy, society and culture, and the Christian faith. It points to Christ as the antidote to the present-day, postmodern chaos.",
