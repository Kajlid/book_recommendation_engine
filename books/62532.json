  "description": "Science and technology are failing. Power outages are spreading across the country. Cars, computers, cell phones, and every convenience science has given us begin to grow useless. Scientists theorize the cause, but their explanations fall short. Frank Bell prefers to leave worries about the worlds problems to his parents. When he stumbles upon the source of the problem with science, though, he is thrust into a world where he must learn to deal with dragons and ogres as well as the dark side of modern society. With the help of his sister Emily, Amy, and his new-found friend Lucas, he fights his way back to the old wizard who is the key to saving the world of science . . . or destroying it.",
