Somewhere between childhood and adulthood, they trade in their fairy-tale dreams of being cherished for a tarnished identity fashioned by their own insecurities and the mixed-up messages of the media. Now, these tenderly adoring letters written from God's persepective demonstrate that every woman is beautiful just the way she is. Walking in confidence toward her God-given purpose, every woman can bless others - even future generations.It's hard to look at our lives and think of ourselves as royalty . But the truth is, God is our King and wer are chosen by Him. As your soul soaks in these love letters fromÂ your King, be affirmed of who you are, why you are here, and how much you are loved.For we are God's masterpiece.He has created us anew.Ephesians 2:10, NLT",
