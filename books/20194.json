  "description": "To help develop the history of Aperture Science, and the span of time between Portal and Portal 2, Valve expanded upon the unseen character of the \"Rat Man\" in both Portal 2 and through a digital comic, \"Portal 2: Lab Rat\", whose storyline takes place between the two games. This comic, made available online about two weeks before Portal 2's release, includes Wicklund's art contrasted against Oeming's own style and layout along with an overall story written by Ted Kosmatka. The artists worked with the game's writers, Laidlaw, Faliszek, Wolpaw, Pinkerton and team leader Josh Weir, to tie the comic's story to the plot of Portal 2.",
