  "description": "Richard Clayson has everything in life. As Police Commissioner of a small town, he has status, prestige, and authority. His success has given him a comfortable lifestyle and a beautiful wife and family; all the things that any man would want. But there’s something else. Lurking beneath the surface is a fiery desire that Richard thought had long since been extinguished. When Gary Letterman, an acquaintance of Richard, is found stabbed to death on his farm, suspicion falls on the Blackwell family, notorious delinquents who are always at the center of trouble. In particular, the youngest member of the family, Beau, comes to the forefront of the investigation, having discovered Letterman’s body decomposing in a field.This youngster, who does everything he shouldn’t, spells trouble in a way that he could never have guessed. In a moment of unguarded madness, Richard suddenly finds that everything he has worked so hard to achieve is on the line. But as he toils to solve a heinous murder, it slowly dawns on Richard that he isn’t the solid and dependable Police Commissioner that the locals have looked up to for years. He’s living a double life and there’s no way he can have both.",
