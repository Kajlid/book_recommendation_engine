Interactive Listening is a multimedia expedition through the history, science, and diverse languages of music. Every page uses audio, video, 3d instruments, tablet drawing exercises, or instant listening tests to actively engage learners. With over 120 built in music examples, listen to Tibetan monks, a Dixieland parade, or a Dubstep DJ while you cross 35,000 years of music history. Why has music been written in caves, ships, and cathedrals in every corner of the human odyssey? Interactive Listening was designed by two music professors to test your ears, eyes, and mind in an experimental search for the truth about what music really is.",
