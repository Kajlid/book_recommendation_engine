It sees family man David Strutter lured back to his old childhood home on a seemingly mundane errand. Once there, the memories of his traumatic upbringing and abusive father come flooding back.  But along with these dark memories come memories of his talent. For David was a special boy. A boy blessed with an ability to 'travel' to an alternate reality and hide away from his father when he was at his worst. With the help of his equally talented mother, he learnt to harness these abilities and to some extent control the world he travelled to.  The world of Shael.  Now, some thirty years later with his 'body' seriously injured in the real world, he unexpectedly finds himself trapped in Shael. Like a fish out of water he must follow a series of cryptic clues to traverse the hostile alien landscapes, reach his mother and finally come face to face with the evil entity that has possessed his father for years.  Homecoming is the stunning first volume of the 'Shael Chronicles'.
