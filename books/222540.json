  "description": "THE VENGEANCE OF GOD...During a raging storm one night on the Welsh mountains, thunder roars, lightning sears across the sky, the ground heaves and a deep black cave yawns open. Still alive, the mysterious and nameless narrator of this chilling tale and his beloved Morwyn are engulfed by the rock and plunged into the gaping cavern. The subterranean void is part of a hell inhabited by the spirits of cruel fanatics who enjoyed a life of inflicting pain on others - such infamous characters as the Marquis de Sade, Gilles de Rais, the Emperor Nero and Torquemada. The narrator and Morwyn meet all these spirits during their strange adventure and witness a trial at which the evil-doers are charged with their crimes. Do these wicked souls deserve to suffer the vengeance of God?MORWYN has an original introduction by Dennis Wheatley.",
