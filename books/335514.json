  "title": "Terlingua Teacher: The Remarkable Lessons Taught and Learned in a One-room Texas Schoolhouse",
  "description": "A search for a simpler, more rewarding lifestyle brings Trent Jones and his wife Olga to the ghost town of Terlingua, Texas so that Trent can accept the unusual job of teacher/principal/janitor of a one-room schoolhouse. So what if the princely sum of half his current salary would make it impossible for them to afford a telephone, or that they would have to haul drinking water from five miles away. It was a challenge whose rewards far outweighed any inconvenience. The colorful residents, the school children, the beauty of the vast and awsome Trans-Pecos all play their part in making this an unforgettable experience and inspirational triumph. Terlingua Teacher gives us a unique definition of what make a person a \"success\" and offers an insider's look at our hard-working educators and the sacrifices they often make. In its third printing since original publication in 1978. A afterword has been added to bring the reader up to date on the Jonses and the Terlingua School.",
