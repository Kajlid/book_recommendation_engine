  "description": "The Ghost Moth; a tragic tale of the Spirit versus the Flesh. (Given 5 stars by Readers' Favorite, it is also a recent Book Excellence Awards Finalist) As Joe reads an old folk tale and is drawn into a world of religious fanatics, witches, angels and she-devils, he begins to wonder if it is possible that a five hundred year old tragic love story of a young monk and his lover could be impacting on his family in the present day? A story about the desires of the sexes and the doctrines of religion, with hints at the supernatural and beautiful and atmospheric imagery, this controversial, adult, speculative, spiritual and philosophical tale will intrigue, entertain and keep you guessing in equal measure up until the last page.(Warning to sensitive readers; the story is an adult one and so deals with adult themes. It contains what some might find to be controversial views on both religion and sex, as well as mild sex scenes.)",
