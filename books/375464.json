  "description": "A Fashion Tour-de-Farce!  Welcome to The Museum of Kitschy Stitches, the astonishingly awful collection of the finest knitting and crocheting horrors the twentieth century has to offer. From hideous hats and gender-bending sweater sets to a set of bonus patterns that will bring the kitsch home, this gallery of notorious knits delivers it all.  Remember, one person’s inspiration can become another’s desperation quicker than you can drop a stitch!",
