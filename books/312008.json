  "description": "They say librarians are old-fashioned. I’m anything but.As a 23-year-old woman I have my whole life ahead of me, and I’m in no rush to settle down.But my favorite patron of the Golden Creek Library has a different opinion … and at 72, Charles McArthur is hard to argue with.He wants to set me up with his grandson and I don’t have the heart to say no.When my date comes to my door, I am oh-so-glad I said yes.Chuck McArthur is a tall, dark, and handsome man who happens to love books as much as I do. He calls me Cookie, just like his gramps, and I’m more than eager for him to have a taste. Luckily for me, he likes a woman with some curves, and lucky for him, his dirty talk is quickly becoming my favorite sound.Best part? Chuck and I want the exact same thing: a no strings attached relationshipBut when tragedy strikes, everything changes.I may like it when he talks wordy to me … but maybe I need more than talk. Maybe I need forever.",
