  "description": "On my eighteenth birthday my father, the senator, gives me the gift he thinks every little girl dreams of.  The man of my dreams, and the wedding to match.  Stefan Zoric is heir to an elite worldwide modeling agency. Practically a prince.  My arrangement is simple, as far as sham marriages go.  I give him my virginity, behave as the perfect wife and he'll pay for the college degree my father found irrelevant.  But I don't want to be the perfect wife.  I want him to want me the way I want him.  I want him to confide in me.  But Stefan has secrets that he holds close, dangerous secrets.  And soon I'm wondering what kind of devil have I made a deal with?",
