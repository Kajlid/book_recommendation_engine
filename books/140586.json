He must leave behind an even more dangerous conflict brewing between his wife and his powerful mother, Princess Marla....And in far off Medalon, someone has stolen the music.Their quest for the tiny stolen lyre containing the essence of the God of Music will eventually touch all their lives, threaten everything they hold dear and prove to be far more personal than any of them can imagine.",
