  "description": "A sexy, mistaken-identity, forbidden sports romance!After my last romance turned into a dumpster fire, I did the only reasonable thing–I swore off men for all of eternity. So my bestie said she did the only reasonable thing–she signed me up for a freaking dating app. I thought it was a joke. But after too many martinis, I committed a cardinal sin. I slid into the DMs of the first eye-roll inducing profile I found – @BigDeckEnergy . With a name like that, how could I resist giving him a piece of my mind? I never expected him to write back. I also never expected to like him. Everything was falling into place until it all came crashing down and I remembered why I’d written off dating in the first place. Because Ethan Byrne wasn’t just @BigDeckEnergy . He was a pro hockey player. #41, the center for the Seattle Cyclones, to be exact. He also happened to be my brand new client, and completely off-limits. Too bad I already knew exactly how big his deck really was. The Dating Playbook is a steamy stand-alone novel in Kim Loraine's Anything For Love series featuring a strong heroine, a hero with a hot AF British accent, and lots of flirty banter.",
