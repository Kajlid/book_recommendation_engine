  "description": "Michael Van Ott is running for Mayor of New York, and his campaign has hit a big enough snag to send his whole career off the rails. But this is one catastrophe that Van Ott won't be able to buy or (quite literally) talk his way out of. \"Liar's Tongue\" is a chilling gross-out of a tale that will make all politicians watch their mouths. \"This is an instant classic Allison Dickson story. Visceral, powerful, and leaves a sickening final impression. It reminds me of 'Tales from the Darkside.'\" Ian Thomas Healy, Author of \"Dental Plan\" and \"Footprints in the Butter\"",
