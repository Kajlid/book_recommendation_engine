  "description": "Aidan, the Wolf of Awe, has abandoned the Brotherhood and forsaken his vows. Feared by all and trusted by none, he hunts alone, seeking vengeance against the evil that destroyed his son. He has not saved an Innocent in sixty-six years--until he hears Brianna Rose's scream of terror across centuries, and leaps to modern-day Manhattan to rescue her…Brie is a gifted empath who spends her time fighting evil from the safety of her laptop--and fantasizing about the medieval Highlander she met just once. Still, her life is pretty ordinary--until she awakens one night consumed with Aidan's pain and rage. When Aidan suddenly appears and takes her hostage, Brie cannot believe how dark and dangerous he has become. She knows she should be afraid, but instead, she will fight across time for his redemption…and his love.",
