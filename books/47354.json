  "title": "Cut and Run",
  "description": "Based on true events, this is the story of three men entwined in a multi-million-Dollar international drug smuggling conspiracy. Two are narcotics entrepreneurs with lavish lifestyles and one is a cop with a passion for growing orchids who is out for his last criminal lock-down. But life is never that simple. One becomes a traitor, one a turncoat and the other turns to deception. But which is which? The canvas on which they roam, plot and play stretches from Da Nang in Vietnam to Londonâ€™s Savile Row, Seattle to New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong. It involves deceptions within deception, gun battles at sea, identities that should never be assumed and loyalty that switches and counts for nothing. And all the while the Dollars keep getting banked.",
