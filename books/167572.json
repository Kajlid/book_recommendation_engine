  "description": "Something creeps under the floorboards of the Rutherford Estate, the fortress where Eileen Morgan spends her sixteenth summer, in Fife, Scotland, a usually quiet community but where locals have been experiencing freak accidents -- stampeding by bull and falling to their deaths into the North Sea. The inheritance of the estate is now in question. Will the heir be Ewan Stalker, the estranged grandson who tends the sheep? Will Eileen help him? Will she be gored by Caedmon the bull or chased into a mineshaft by the resident ghost? Whichever her choice, a dynasty may disappear forever should Eileen not come in aid at the Rutherfords' direst hour.",
