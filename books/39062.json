  "description": "An alternate cover edition can be found here and here.Lucy Hathcoat's best friend the supermodel is getting married to a billionaire—what better place than their week-long wedding in a luxury eco-resort to find a new man? Lucy isn’t picky; she just wants a decent guy who’s eager to start a family. Someone as logical, responsible, and practical as she is.  Definitely not the six-foot-five, fun-loving Miles Girard. Being totally hot and charming is not important. She doesn’t need a college dropout who makes her laugh. A man who makes her jump in his lap and kiss him. A man who is pathologically wary of marriage and thinks she needs him more than she needs a husband.  Then again, Lucy’s starting to feel like maybe, just maybe, she can’t live without him…\nThe sequel to this book is Diving In.",
