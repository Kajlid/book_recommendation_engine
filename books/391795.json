  "description": "A tour de force of imaginative storytelling from the critically acclaimed author of City of Thieves and  The 25th Hour and co-creator of the HBO series Game of ThronesIn When the Nines Roll Over , David Benioff ( The 25th Hour, City of Thieves ) uses humor and rich characterizations to explore the sometimes thrilling, sometimes pathetic emotional lives of a diverse set of characters.  Over the course of eight stories, we are introduced to a host of young people on the cusp of discovery and loss.  As he evokes the various states of agony and pleasure—humiliation, rebellion, camaraderie, and desire—Benioff displays a profound understanding of the transformative power of a single moment and how sadness can be illuminated by a humorous flip side. When the Nines Roll Over confirms the promise of a gifted writer emerging as a storytelling force.",
