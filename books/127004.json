  "description": "If you’d asked me what I thought I’d be doing at twenty-two, it certainly wouldn’t be taking my clothes off for complete strangers. The world sees me as a whore and a worthless piece of trash. No one would ever believe that I am still a virgin, waiting to find love. I think I can easily say that I don’t think love is ever going to be finding me at Club Climax. I give the crowd what they want. For the next two and half minutes, I dance, undress, shake my ass, and slide up and down the metal pole. I am in complete control while I am up here on this stage. The dancers make the rules at this place. That is except for the room in the far back, known as Ultimate Climax. It is the one place where all power is surrendered; the one place in this club that I said I’d never go, no matter how desperate I got. The price is just too high for me, and I refuse to sell myself to the highest bidder. I cannot afford to lose the only thing I have left… My control. Sometimes, the day comes when we have to do the things that we said we would never do. For me, that day is here. I take a deep breath, grab the door handle, and know that once I walk through that door, my whole life will forever change. Little did I know just how much it actually would.",
