  "description": "Lessness and More is a fresh poetic experiment that will be certainly most rewarding to the reader. Its themes are varied, from weather reports to approaching death.Excerpts:THAT SUMMER AFTERNOONThat summer was not easy on usBut one afternoon the clouds cameAnd the shadows gave way to quiet lightAs we walked to the park half regrettingHaving cursed the heatWe were tired of summer, and afraid of winterLying by me, you read a book, occasionallyTurning your head to see what I was doingBut I was reading tooAnd I would bend over to your sideAnd kiss you lightly on the headIt was a quiet summer afternoon, andWe had all life can offerThe rest being vanity and excessI flipped a page and turned to youTo kiss you on the headIt was the last of that hot summerBut winter would be warmA DOG IS A MAN'S BEST FRIENDShould you peekAt the fugitivePicture of death?How will you faceYour deathIf it is not sudden?And will your dogEver barkAt your corpseDeceased?Or will it be at easeAs if you threw it a boneThat was once your own?",
