While on the trail of the fiendish Elf Knight, Nate crosses paths with Molly Tucker, who is seeking revenge against the Elf Knight for her sister’s murder. As Nate and Molly close in on the demon, it becomes a race against time for Nate to send the Elf Knight back to Hell before the creature takes Molly as his next victim.The Helwyn are demon hunters born of Hell, outcasts in the realm of demons. Rejecting evil, they have walked through Hellfire, a fearsome trial of purification to purge Hell from their souls. Cleansed of the curse of evil, they hunt Hell’s dark forces on earth, using age-old ballads as a road map to find these creatures and send them back to the Underworld.Helwyn is the first book in the series and is based on the ballad Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight, about the world’s first serial killer. Ballads are, after all, man’s first urban legends...",
