  "title": "Stations: Short Stories Inspired by the Overground Line",
  "description": "Twenty-four new short stories in homage to the East and South London section of the London Overground a story for every station from New Cross, Crystal Palace and West Croydon at the Southern extremes of the line, all the way to Highbury & Islington. From tigers in a South London suburb to retired Victorian police inspectors investigating train based thefts, from collectors of poets at Shadwell to life-changing decisions in Canonbury, by way of an art installation that defies the boundaries of a gallery, Stations takes a sideways look through the windows of the Overground train, at life as it is, or might be, lived beside the quirky, humorous and sometimes horrifying.",
