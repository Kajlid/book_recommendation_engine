  "description": "She thought she was stepping into fame.\nMeeting Drezden Halifax should have been a dream. But dreams are supposed to be sweet, fragile things that whisk you away. Not monsters crafted from hard fingers, gritty vocal cords and a voice so powerful it could tear my guts right out. Maybe my heart, too. Becoming the guitarist for Four and a Half Headstones was everything I needed. Too bad the band's lead singer is doing his best to ruin everything I am. \nHe thought she would solve his troubles.\nLola Cooper, god damn Lola Cooper. She was the perfect guitarist, fingers that could summon a sweet song or punch a chord. She's supposed to save my band, make us come out of this tour in one piece... But I just want to tear HER to pieces. No one should make me feel this way. One look at her, one smell, and I knew I'd have to have her. She does things to me that scare the shit out of me. Make me want to slam her on a wall and listen to her cries: eager or fearful, it doesn't matter. I'm a monster... And I don't even care. New Adult Rockstar Romance. This is the first installment of the Body Rock Series. 25,000 words.",
