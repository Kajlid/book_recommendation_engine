  "description": "The third book in the series! A funny and feel good romcom with a twist from International selling Author, Sasha Lane.In a relationship = check.Married = Nope.Children = Zero.It seems like everyone surrounding me has wedding and baby fever. My best friend, Sophie, is pregnant. Simon and James have adopted twin boys, yet there is no suggestion of either marriage or babies on the horizon for me.Okay, maybe that’s because I don’t want either of those things right now. Do I?Yes. No. Maybe.Why is life so complicated? And more importantly, can I legally murder anyone who utters those intolerable words ‘Your biological clock is ticking’?The perfect, feel good, contemporary romance following on from 'Girl, Conflicted' and 'Girl, Unhinged'.Hilarious, heart-warming and romantic! An addictive read that is perfect for fans of Bridget Jones and for lovers of romantic comedy novels by Sophie Kinsella, Paige Toon, and Lindsey Kelk.What readers are saying about the book:'Witty, plausible but with a twist.
