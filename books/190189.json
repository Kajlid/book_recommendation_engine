  "description": "The manga: The water, and whatever nightmares lie beneath its cloudy surface, control reality in this frightful collection of short stories. The first of four torments follows a mother and daughter who move into a haunted apartment complex - the source of its downpours of horror is the spirit of a young, angry girl. Their story gives way to a night cruise that includes a frightening discovery, and later, to a diver who's tortured by his father's disappearance. Within these pages are four equally frightful tales of underwater horrors the murky depths that house them, and the curious people who become their unwilling prey.",
