  "description": "A true underdog story of an unlikely hero and two best friends coming of age in depression era, rural Alabama. Tom is white, Ben is black. This creates problems in this particular historical period. Ben Evans was born forty years too early. A black kid growing up in the height of the Great Depression in the South, being raised by an alcoholic, abusive and incestuous father. This is not the place, nor the circumstances, you would expect one of the brightest young minds of the time to emerge. But Ben has an insatiable curiosity from a very young age to learn everything there is to know about the world. With the help of Rachel Winston, the benevolent daughter of the man who owns the farm the Evan’s family lives on as sharecroppers, Ben finds a way to educate himself. He gains access to Rachel’s text books, as well as her fathers extensive private library. When a series of adventures cause Ben and his best friend Tom Martin to move to Atlanta to find work, Ben gets the opportunity to really expand his education. But the more educated Ben becomes, the more trouble he encounters in a time where black folks were not supposed to forget their place. Despite racism and other seemingly impossible barriers, Ben doesn't give in to self pity or hatred. Instead, he becomes more determined than ever. Genius and tenacity vs. racism, envy and lynch mobs in this southern historical thriller. Which will prevail? A novel for adults as well as young adult readers.",
