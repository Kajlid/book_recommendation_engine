  "description": "'The Lord puts the salmon in the river like he puts the berries on the trees. They're there for all of us, not just for the laird.' The Bruach islanders don't consider poaching a crime, more like a natural right. Fishermen Erchy and Hector are experts, but they are not the only ones tempted. Even a visiting vicar succumbs. In this collection of tales about her eccentric island friends, Lillian Beckwith sees the funny side of many a strange situation.",
