  "description": "With King Richard making war on the French and Prince Llywelyn consolidating power in Wales, peace prevails across England and the Welsh Marches. But bloody strife rages in the north of Ireland, drawing Declan O’Duinne back to his homeland. He’s been ten years gone, but some things never change. The Anglo-Normans relentlessly expand their Irish domains while the Irish kings fight amongst themselves. Can Declan and his fellow knight, Roland Inness, help save what’s left of free Ireland? The first four books in the saga—Longbow, Warbow, The Broken Realm and The Ransomed Crown tell the coming-of-age story of the young archer. A Prince of Wales, the fifth in the series, follows Roland Inness as he leads the legendary Invalid Company into Wales to help Llywelyn the Great win a throne. The sixth book in the series, Declan O'Duinne, takes Roland and Declan to Ireland, where they are plunged into a new Norman conquest. The seventh and final book in the Saga, A Question of Honour was published in October, 2019.If you would like to know more about the author or get updates on new books, visit his webpage at www.waynegrantbooks.com or the Longbow Facebook page, www.facebook.com/Longbowbooks/ .",
