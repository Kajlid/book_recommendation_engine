  "description": "A glorious Christmas story, full of festive sparkle from the illustrator of The Primrose Railway Children . William lives in Words of Wonder, a perfect bookshop full of stories and delights. He has always lived there with his family, ever since he was a baby, and now he is thirty-seven books tall. But times are hard, and the bookshop is struggling, so William takes it upon himself to create the most beautiful Christmas window to draw people in – with a leaping reindeer, pulling a sleigh full of stories. And then one night, as Christmas draws near, the reindeer comes to life and all William’s wishes for his family and all the shops around come true . . . making a Christmas to remember through the power of words and hope. A beautiful new picture book, full of the magic of Christmas!",
