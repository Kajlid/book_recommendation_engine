  "description": "I thought I’d finally made it.Me and my band, Broken Vows.Then everything fell apart. I got sent to rehab while my brother and his girlfriend are living the dream. My dream. Touring the world.And now? I’m back in my old room, and I’ve never felt more alone.As for the music? It calls to me. And so does she.But if I go after her, am I exchanging one addiction for another?And if I do, will I spiral like before? Or will she be the one who can finally save me?Then again, it doesn’t matter, because if my dealer––and half brother––finds out about her, he’ll sink his claws so deep, she’ll never get out of his grasp.And if that happens? I’ll never forgive myself.",
