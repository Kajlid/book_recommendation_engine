  "title": "The Book of Celeste",
  "description": "God designates a 19-year old social media blogger as a prophet to warn the world about an approaching calamity caused by the worship of false idols. God sends the messenger angel Gabriel to visit Celeste in a dream. Through the angel, God calls the teenager to assume the gift of prophecy in the area of social media. Gabriel informs Celeste about God's Final Judgment on a disobedient world unless it changes course immediately. God instructs Celeste to build an army of social media spiritual warriors that can alert people to the imminent catastrophe. The book details her efforts to fulfill God's plan despite many trials. It describes both the successes and failures of her prophecy mission. The final chapter presents hope for averting disaster but only if humankind chooses God over idol worship.",
