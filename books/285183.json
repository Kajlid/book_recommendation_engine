  "title": "Seductive",
  "description": "From USA Today bestselling author Willow Winters  He’s forbidden, dangerous, and everything that’s bad for me. More than that, the life he leads is exactly why I’d been on the run. The seductive and powerful air around him is what drew me in, the reminder of what could have and should have been years ago. His dark gaze riddled with desire could always see through me. Deep down to the core of what I craved most. To be his. And so I agreed. I came back. I chose him even when I knew I shouldn’t. If only it were so easy to forget the past. If only our mistakes didn’t hold on to us, harder and more violently than we could hold on to each other.   Seductive is an extension of Addison and Daniel’s story, Possessive. Although it can be read on its own, it’s recommended you start with Possessive.",
