  "description": "In Elfhame, bargains are currency, lies are weapons, and your heart is your greatest weakness. Reeling from Bastian’s revelations, Kat wakes from her dire illness wanting nothing more than to sever all ties with the man who betrayed her. But fate has a different plan—she’s trapped in Elfhame, the fae realm where nothing is as it seems. And worse, she’s trapped with him, reliant on his touch to stave off a poison that threatens her very life. Thrust into the centre of Dusk and Dawn Courts, they must balance the two in order to maintain a delicate peace. But in a world where alliances are forged and shattered in a heartbeat, danger looms. A mysterious group infiltrates the city and spies whisper of an ancient artefact powerful enough to destroy an entire court. As enemies close in from all sides and attacks on the city escalate, Kat and Bastian must unearth deadly secrets and their own complicated feelings to survive—or risk a war to destroy faekind itself.",
