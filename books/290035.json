  "description": "Ziggy is the adopted teenaged son of two sexually abusive fathers, from whose obsessive attentions he flees into the weird world of his uncle, an amoral man who makes violent pornography. As scenes of fierce sex and sadistic oppression take place around him, Ziggy falls improbably in love -- with his best friend, a junkie. Dennis Cooper, author of the gay horror classic Frisk, returns in this novel to his characteristic themes of alienated youth, voyeurism and twisted Todenlust, except this time the horrors are as grounded in emotions as they are in the body.",
