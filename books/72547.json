  "description": "Kate Bingham's life has never been ordinary, so she has no reason to think it will settle down anytime soon. With Paulie safely across the pond and living the life he should, Kate struggles to build a new world where she can finally get what she needs. But just what, or whom, she needs isn’t clear, especially after a brutal attack that leaves Kate hurting on many levels. Rob Evans wants to be the answer to all of Kate’s problems, but he can’t wait around forever while Kate teeters on her high wire, never certain which direction to fall. Can Kate find her way back to Rob without severing her tenuous ties to Paulie? Things look promising until a shocking revelation in a London courthouse threatens to shatter the fragile bond between Paulie, Kate and Rob, leaving them to wonder if anything will ever be normal again.",
