  "description": "When a distress call is received from a space station floating in the æther of outer space, Professor Sedgewick and his companion, Cadwallander, are quick to investigate. What they find aboard the transætheric space-lock is an alien perversion, intent on spreading its horrific dominion over Victorian Earth…  The first novelette chapbook in the Sedgewick Papers collection, The Angels of the Abyss is a uniquely satisfying blend of rip-roaring steampunk adventure and Lovecraftian cosmic horror.",
