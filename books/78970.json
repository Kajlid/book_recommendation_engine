Under the bed, deep in the closet, behind the radiator . . . the bedtime monsters are stirring, and poor Arnold is too scared to fall asleep. He’s powerless to get rid of them—and they don't seem to be more scared of him than he is of them, no matter what his mother says. But even the most terrible, horrible monster has to be afraid of something, as Arnold eventually finds out in this empowering tale of harnessing the imagination and conquering nighttime fears.",
