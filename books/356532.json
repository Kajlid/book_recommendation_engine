  "description": "\"Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing,\" by Soren Kierkegaard, is considered a devotional classic. Through irony, dialogue, and parable, Kierkegaard slices through the masks and fascades we construct that delude us into thinking that all is well with our soul. With the skill and precision of a surgeon's hand, Kierkegaard opens up the true condition of our motivations in life and faith. Kierkegaard is not afraid to stare in the face the dark side of our humanity. In \"Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing\" we see that only through this brutal honesty can we become our true selves and find healing. Kierkegaard boldly asserts that only by joining with providence and the Great Physician's hand can we \"will one thing\"--the good. The good is all that is true, eternal, and authentic. The good is all that comes from God. As with all of Kierkegaard's works, \"Purity of Heart\" makes for worthy reading which will provoke and challenge you.",
