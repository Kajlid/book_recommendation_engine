  "description": "Hungry? Thirsty?Stop Here.The Grand View Restaurant. When her family buys a little roadside restaurant with a gas station out front and an apartment in the back, Hannah thinks she knows what to expect: She'll still go to the same school, her best friend will still be Aggie Branagan, and she'll still have to put up with that pesky boy, Otto Zimmer. But life at The Grand View Restaurant turns out to be full of surprises! Hannah never imagined that a piano could play by itself, that she would discover a new secret place by the river, or that square hamburgers could be so perfectly delicious. In fact, life is full of wonders-- her father's amazing inventions, her mother's magnificent garden-- and in the middle of it all, Hannah makes her own discovery about the remarkable magic of home.",
