Now I’m about to offer up my blood.When my brother gets into some serious trouble with the Vampire Clan of Baltimore, there’s only one thing I can do to save his ass.I decide to offer myself up as a blood tribute, infiltrate their underground palace, and find a way to get him out.But playing the part of a simpering blood bag is harder than I expected, especially when my first impulse is to put a stake through the heart of every vamp I meet. To make matters worse, I’ve somehow caught the eye of three dangerous vampire men:Bastian, an ancient prince with features as cold as ice and eyes that burn like fire.Rome, a darkly sexy rebel who just returned from a hundred-year banishment.And Connor, a newly turned vampire whose lopsided grin is so devastatingly human that I almost forget he’s the enemy.Even though I want to hate them all, they keep getting under my skin in ways I can’t explain. But if I let myself lose focus for even a second, it won’t just be me who pays for it. My brother will suffer too.I’ve danced with the devil plenty of times…But this time, the dance might kill me.The Kingdom of Blood series is a paranormal vampire romance. The heroine is tough but flawed and the three (anti)heroes are sexy and dangerous.Books in this set:Blood DebtDark LegacyVampire Wars",
