  "description": "“I want to savor India, not save it,” declares Amit, as he sets off to discover what it means to be Indian. How? By hopping onto Kaya, his trusted motorcycle, and heading out on a year-long journey around the country. Stepping outside his quasi-liberal, urban middle-class bubble he is forced to see the country through the eyes of the people he encounters—the tourist-hating tribal, the homosexual forced into marriage, the farmer without a farm. What begins as a journey fueled by nationalism, and not just a little narcissism, devolves into an agonizing insight into the country’s failures, and his own complicity in them. An epic tale of India and Indians, and a young man’s quest to understand the two, \"Who Stole my India?\" takes you on a tragicomic journey across the social and political landscape of the country.",
