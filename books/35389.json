  "description": "Three skinny socialites should be a pushover after the rough and tumble world of Wall Street. Right? Kate Ryan may be au fait with making high-powered legal decisions but she's about to submit to the rules of reality TV, where nothing is what it seems. Who'd have thought a few days with the cameras rolling for a low-rent cable show would be so challenging, or that the claws of a former homecoming queen, a washed-up soap star and a whiny cat-lover would be so sharp.",
