  "description": "\"4 of 5 stars overall, 5 for originality....make the world and the opportunities for animating beautiful sequences a selling point....keep it up!\" --Jonny Perl for Rob Minkoff, director \"The Lion King\". Corporate-backed black ops, they fed the world to the worms. Armed to their greedy teeth with genetic weaponry, and temporal spy-tech... Diplomats like Oxridge College’s Skall, Dor, and Dimmack... These geniuses alone can oppose them. Skall has his time machine calibrated to nudge history’s path a bit. But he didn’t foresee a trio of time-tripping deities with their own agendas. –Of how they want to use humanity, and lesser magic beings, too. So, seeming invulnerable enemies are squeezing both sides of history, and the human race itself. The thinnest thread of hope is intuitive mastery of mythic time. Which music-scholars – aka bards – alone possess. Pray, that one of the fatcats miscalculates, somehow, somewhere, sometime.The blue-cover Ver. 2 adds 18k words to the 20k novelized screenplay (orange-cover), adding characterizations FAR beyond even the highly detailed, 2-hour film. A 5 minute, animated, trailer can be seen at amazondotcom/author/swwilcox That's an excerpt from the 100min. Previs film I made, where all scenes, dialogue, and music were tested for fluidity. it is not, however, a version for commercial release. Rather, it's aimed at a future director's use, as a reference.",
