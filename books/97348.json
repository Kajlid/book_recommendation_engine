  "description": "A deliciously funny rom com from Random Romance. What happens when you fall in love with the man you hate?Nicola Doyle's dating record is a disaster, and it doesn't improve when she returns to Redgum Valley, after an absence of twelve years, to look after her increasingly eccentric parents. There, she's thrown into regular contact with Blair Morrissey – the very reason she couldn't wait to leave town in the first place. The decade-old scars are still raw from that humiliating day in high school – when Blair went from the boy she loved to the boy she hated.Except Blair doesn't seem to be a ‘bad boy' any more – in fact, he's charming, infuriatingly helpful and extremely attractive. If only Nicola could forgive and forget . . .",
