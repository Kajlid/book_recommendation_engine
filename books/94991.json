  "description": "WILD THINGS. They've been with us forever—prowling the smoky roadhouse dives that are their watering holes and hunting grounds. Predators, lurking amidst the human herd.Changing shape at will. Lusting for blood and meat. They are gods in the wild. Gods in disguise. And they feed on the spark inside each of us.Syd was just another lonely working-class guy singing the steel-town blues. Then he met Nora. She's sensual. Erotic. Amoral. A creature of the night. And she's luring Syd across the line that few can cross—and fewer survive: the line that separates man from beast.",
