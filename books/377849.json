  "description": "In April 1945 Hitler's bunker in Berlin was the last place Edith Mecklenburg wanted to be. Faced with the constant bombing and the inexorable Russian advance, Hitler's grip on reality weakened by the hour. But Edith had no choice: as secretary to Eva Braun, Hitler's mistress and - for a few final, desperate hours - his wife, Edith had to see it through to the bitter end. An end that was likely to be summoned by cyanide or bullet.Edith was one of the lucky few. She not only got out alive but made a new life for herself in England, marrying the young British Army captain who first interrogated her. Sixty years on, now a widow and grandmother, the Bunker is almost forgotten - another country, another life.But the past has not forgotten her. Hans, a soldier she knew from those dark days, has written asking if he may visit. Obsessed with the past, he has spent the intervening decades tracking down all who were there, and who survived. Edith is the last on his list, the one he is most wary of. In her reluctant raking-over of old coals, Edith finds embers that still burn, and in an act of remembrance a very current threat. . .Brilliantly re-creating the intensity and madness of Hitler's final days and his effect on those around him, Alan Judd's highly original new novel also reveals a terrifying coda. Superbly controlled and quietly devastating, Dancing With Eva is a dramatic dialogue with the past by a novelist at the height of his powers.",
