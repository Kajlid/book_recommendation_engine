  "description": "Having magic is a blessing from the gods, and they gave me an especially powerful gift when they made me a Spell Traveler. Now if only I could use it properly without randomly teleporting, falling, and inevitably crashing into important people!  As the youngest member of the renowned Harlow family, I, Brianne Marie Harlow, have some big shoes to fill. With amazing parents on the magic council and a sister who works for Witchling Star Agency, I’m determined to prove that I can meet the expectations of our family name. I hope. Getting accepted into Witchling Academy isn't the problem, given my gift. But surviving in a school filled with witches and warlocks? That is a whole other dilemma. My game plan? Focus on learning, do my homework, and speak to no one — except for my best friend, Elijah, who I secretly have a crush on.  What could go wrong? Turns out, everything.  On the first day of classes, I managed to piss off the leader of the Notorious Four, a group of hot boys with their eyes all on me. As if that weren’t bad enough, now I’m getting death threats and random men are chasing me after school, trying to steal my power. Now I only have two goals. One, survive long enough to graduate and make my family proud. With craziness and danger coming at me left and right, it's up to me and Elijah — with the help of N4 — to find a way to make it out alive.  Goal number two? Manage not to fall in love with all five boys in the process.",
