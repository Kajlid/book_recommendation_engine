  "title": "Bondage At Sea",
  "description": "Working together on opposite sides of a project has caused nothing but tension between Arielle and David. When that tension turns sexual, Arielle consents to taking a pleasure cruise with the man who rattles her chains. Looking to break free from the ties that bind her carefully guarded control, Arielle opens herself to a journey of self-discovery and sensual delight as she learns to let go. She soon finds that submission is not about giving in, but about receiving the pleasure that’s all around her. Reader Advisory: Arielle’s journey is very intense and includes some female/female sexual exploration. David is a very lucky man!",
