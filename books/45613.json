  "title": "The Sin Eater",
  "description": "As family members gather at the bedside of their ailing patriarch, very little is as it seems and there is an ominous tension in the air -- without a doubt, this is the territory of Alice Thomas Ellis. Hailed as a brilliant chronicler of the boredom, bad climate, and general creepines of the rural English countryside, she has invented her own fictional the \"supernatural comedy of manners.\" In this, her first novel, she turns ordinary occasions such as a family dinner or a village cricket match into events fraught with fear and indefinable menace. Daughter-in-law Rose, in whose home the family patriarch is dying, manipulates the scene and her guests -- Angela, her conservative sister-in-law, and Ermyn, the visiting single daughter. Rose relishes her post, displaying her gift for disarming family members by moving furniture about, making shocking remarks to Angela, and serving up mischievously seductive meals. Ermyn, meanwhile, is fixating on various Bible passages, in particular the gruesome tale of the concubine in the country of the Benjamites. Now, her home, a small Welsh tourist town, grows inhospitable. Even Phullis, the dying man's cook and caregiver, is drawn into the eerie tension that surrounds the deathbed and the entire household. In a brilliant clash of expectations and reality, the author presents a close look at the conniving that underlie a family gathered in anticipation of death.",
