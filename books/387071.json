  "description": "The ancient Greeks and Romans created two of the most incredible and enduring cultures known to humanity. They also created a pantheon of gods and a rich body of mythology that has survived for centuries. Among these powerful myths is the story of Athena, the goddess of battle, who sprang from Zeus's head, and the story of Dionysus, the god of wine and fertility, whose worshippers achieved a state of mad ecstasy.These fantastic stories are captured in Iitans and Olympians: Greek and Roman Myth, an exciting new volume in a series called Myth and Mankind. The series provides a fascinating, culture-by-culture examination of world myth and its historical roots. Whether exploring the legends of Germany, Egypt, Tibet or Greece, each book brings an ancient culture to live through myth.These are the greatest stories ever told, stories so powerful and unforgettable that they have been recounted for centuries. Who could forget the story of Hades, the Greek god of the underworld, whose marriage to the unwilling Persephone creates the seasons?",
