Guided by sorcery, Guyime journeys to Carthula in the centre of the First Sea to claim the mythical blade known as the Kraken's Tooth. Aided by three companions — the beast charmer Seeker, a powerful sorceress and a scholarly slave — Guyime ventures into Carthula's perilous underbelly to secure a prize guarded by ancient magics, cursed spirits, and lethal traps. But can he survive an ultimate ordeal crafted from his worst nightmares? Continuing the epic story begun in A Pilgrimage of Swords, The Kraken's Tooth is a fast-paced tale of low intrigue and grand adventure from the New York Times bestselling author of the Raven's Shadow and Draconis Memoria trilogies.",
