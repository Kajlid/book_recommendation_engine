This story started as a class assignment on pourquoi tales. At first I thought of writing about a natural phenomenon such as thunder or lightning, but finally was inspired to write a tale about a peacock because of two beautiful peacock feathers that someone had once given me. I love writing and reading a lot. I like to write poetry, stories and plays. In my free time, I also like to draw and sew. In the future, I see myself as an artist, a writer, or a scientist â€“ the possibilities are endless.",
