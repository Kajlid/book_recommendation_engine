  "description": "6 weeks of white castle /n rust is a collection of poems which takes the gravity of the post-industrial American Mid-West as its subject. The poems are the brutal, often humorous conjurings of a world populated by waitresses, dead-end wages and ghosts. Built from the scrap, wreckage and junk typical of places defined by their decay and abandon, DiSabatino's world of rust and rebirth carves a unique voice in new American poetry.(from the interior flap)one-size fits all:factories, gravel - beer cans, hubcaps.a limited, discount rate:lost bars, back roads, minimum-wage sex.available w/ night shifts,waitresses. down paymentsat 4-/n-a-quarter percent:motels, last calls, ghost storiesof the living.pill bottles, parole,fast food chicken.loss, lust. ruin, rain.drive it away today:6 weeks of white castle /n rust.",
