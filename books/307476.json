She chooses Beast, hopeful that his keen, human eyes mean that he can be manipulated like any other man.

Can Beauty find a way to keep her newfound happiness and freedom, or will time run out and destroy everything she loves?Beauty and Beast is a cheeky standalone retelling of the classic fairytale.",
