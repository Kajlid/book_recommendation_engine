  "description": "He's the ruthless lawyer with a not-so-little black book, and one simple rule as unyielding as his heart: Nothing more than a month.She's the doctoral student helping to raise his niece. His brother's best friend. And the valium for his soul he had no business wanting.To be fair, she did ask him for advice--on what she could do to stop being 'the nice girl' for a little bit. All he did was answer truthfully:\"Try something new that excites you.\"...Preferably him.NOTE TO READERS: This is Book #1 in a three-part 600-pg SERIAL (also available as a bundled box set). Each book in the trilogy has a separate story arc in the greater love triangle, and need to be read in order. Book #4 (the other brother's happily ever after) is a standalone novel that can be read on its own.",
