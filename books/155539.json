  "title": "Tales from an Israeli Storyteller",
  "description": "Tales from an Israeli Storyteller is an illustrated cycle of 20 short stories and novellas born from exploring the most iconic locations in Israel. This is the story of the Israel you don’t hear about on the news – the Israel where an evil rabbi creates a smartass golem that comes back to haunt him during an unholy ceremony on Mount Meron, where talking animals search for justice among the demons and spirits of Ein Gedi, where a Bedouin hero confronts a reportedly evil book in the caves of Qumran, and where one clueless efreet keeps losing his wife in the Negev desert until a conscientious policeman comes to his rescue.While some of the characters are hard to meet, all the locations are real and very accessible, making this book a guide to some very cool places as well as a modern fantasy setting inspired by the folklore and mythology of one of the oldest (and youngest) countries in the world.",
