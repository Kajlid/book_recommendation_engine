  "description": "Meg has spent the last twelve years of her life living in the Wasteland with a protector who has kept her in the dark about her origins, and trained her to be a fighter and weapons expert.What Meg doesn’t know is that she is an Antaean: a super soldier engineered to protect the country of Sirain from its enemies, then hidden away from the very cities that sacrificed many of their own people to design her. It isn’t until an attack by a group of unidentified soldiers leaves her permanently scarred, and her protector dead that she begins to learn the truth about herself. Trying to survive in a world of strangers, Meg discovers there are more like her: other Antaeans who’ve been hidden from their enemies. Forced from the Wasteland by the loss of her protector, Meg realizes she must try to locate the other Antaeans before Sirain’s enemies do - or worse, the cities’ leaders – can discover and destroy them all.",
