  "title": "Aghora II: Kundalini",
  "description": "This, the second volume in the Aghora series, focuses on Kundalini, the transformative power of the enlightened self. Kundalini, the root from which all spiritual experiences sprout, has remained secret for so long because it cannot be explained, only experienced. This book recounts how Vimalananda introduced me to Kundalini, and took me step by step through the practices used to awaken Her. It examines mantras, yantras, tantric practices, and shows how normally mundane things like music, food, and even the noise of trains rumbling down tracks can be turned to one's spiritual benefit. For Vimalananda Kundalini was not some sort of impersonal serpent energy, but rather took the form of his beloved deity Smashan Tara, the \"Saviouress of the Cemetery.\" He trusted Kundalini implicitly, and She never let him down.",
