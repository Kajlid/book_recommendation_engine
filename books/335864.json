  "description": "A very unique fantasy novel by Jo Walton — a winner of the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer and the World Fantasy award. From the introduction by Sharyn November: \"Lifelode is what one might call domestic fantasy, set in a quiet farming community—but it's also about politics, God and religion, sexual mores, the make-up of a family, and how people change over time. There is magic, humor, and lots of good food.\"",
