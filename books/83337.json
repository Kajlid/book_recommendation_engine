  "description": "I'm the first Mage born in 200 years. I've turned a city into an island, erected a barrier around an entire country, and awakened a war hero from a 200 year old slumber. Prophecies have marked my coming. Kings and nations have begged for my aid in times of peril. I hold the power to create and destroy nations. My name is Rhebengarthen. To my friends and family, I'm just Garth. The world knows me as the Advent Mage. And despite the rumors you might have heard about me, this is what really happened.",
