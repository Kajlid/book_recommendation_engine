  "title": "The Beautiful Ones",
  "description": "Some say we’re special, and that’s why we’re kept in seclusion. Beyond those walls evil lurks and innocent prey would be lost in minutes. Gone. Destroyed. Forgotten. Others say the opposite: we’re locked away because there’s something wrong with us. If we roamed the outside world, we might taint the beautiful ones. A species so pure, that to merely be in their presence is a gift. As for my beliefs…I’m not sure. But I do know one thing: neither of those reasons explains why it is that they come for us only after we’ve passed the age of sixteen. Whether we want to go or not, we’re taken through those iron gates. Escorted away from the only home we’ve ever known, escorted to our destiny—whatever that destiny may be—never to be seen again. The Beautiful Ones is a prequel intended to introduce Lori's newest Young Adult series. At around 21,000 words, this is a short story. This Young Adult Romance contains kissing, cursing and some violence. It is best for ages 14 and up.",
