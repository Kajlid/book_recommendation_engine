  "description": "\"I did not kill anyone, Francesca. And the fact that you wish to destroy evidence suggests you think me capable of murder.\" Called to the home of her fiancé Calder Hart's former mistress late one night, amateur sleuth Francesca Cahill's curiosity is piqued. But upon arrival, she is shocked to find Daisy Jones's bloodied body—and even more devastated when the evidence points to one suspect: Calder. Francesca cannot—will not—believe that Calder is capable of such an act. Still, she is unable to shake her instinctive sense that Calder is lying about something. The police are far less inclined to believe his innocence, and Calder is arrested for Daisy's murder. But Francesca's heart is not easily swayed . . . until a life-altering secret is exposed that could destroy their future together.",
