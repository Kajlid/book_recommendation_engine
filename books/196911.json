  "description": "They heard a loud crack, and then a tree right next to them split open, its edges glowing red like embers from a roaring fire.\"Lightning!\" Xavier said. They dodged out of the way as a blackened tree began to topple over, crashing to the ground in a shower of sparks. Evan felt his courage evaporate. If this was a dream, it was getting way too scary: the deadly lightning, the falling trees, the growing rumble that seemed to shake the forest to its roots, the ominous blackening of the sky.

He knew that this was real.\"Welcome to Ahoratos,\" said the strange little creature in the purple robe. \"Earth is but a shadow of this unseen realm. This is the real world where the battles rage, where your true enemy lies.\"\"How can we fight this enemy?\" said Xavier, glancing at his little brother, Evan, in alarm. \"We're just kids.\"Ruwach gave the slightest smirk. \"Here in Ahoratos, you are warriors. \nPrince Warriors.\n\"",
