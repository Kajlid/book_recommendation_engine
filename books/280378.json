  "description": "From Audrey Carlan, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Calendar Girl series.The tragedy that controlled my past led me to move as far away from my home in England as I could get. With a degree in library sciences and a will to live life on my own terms, I crossed the pond and headed for the West Coast. I ended up in Grant’s Pass Oregon as the county’s much needed librarian. I was amazing at two things in this life. Books and blowjobs. Men were a fun past time, nothing but scratching a physical itch when needed. Until I attended a Hero’s Pride MC party and met Tank. The man was massive, and I wanted nothing more than to climb him like a tree. Turns out he was into fiery redheads with one thing on their minds. We swore no strings attached. Until we met up again and he decided he wanted another taste. The man had serious ability in the bedroom so I gave it to him. Again. And again. The lines between our no strings started getting knotted up with every new day. Then someone started threatening the old ladies and Tank became more than my shag buddy, he became my protector. When the world around us got truly scary Tank decided things between us were going to change. Forever. I wasn’t ready to be a man’s girlfriend or anyone’s old lady. My Romeo in jeans and leather had other plans for his silk and stiletto wearing Juliet. In the end, I feared star-crossed lovers weren’t meant to be. He believed otherwise. The Biker Beauties is a collection of interconnected standalone novellas. They can be read out of order if desired. They are high in heat, but don’t forget the sweet.",
