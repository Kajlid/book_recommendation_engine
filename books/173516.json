  "description": "She was mine. Our love, unquestioned. Our futures planned.But she didn't show.All that we had, all that we meant, and after all that was said, she just didn't show.That one act changed everything. From that moment on, the course of my life was set on a different path. One which didn't include her, and there was no going back. No words of love, no whispered promises , just sex and drugs and rock and roll . No one gets a piece of Reed, but what they will get is the night of their life, the chance to let go, break their own rules and enjoy the best , the dirtiest, filthiest sex ever ... along with the other four people in my bed.I thought he loved me ; I believed everything he said, every promise he made but then, when I needed him more than I'd needed anyone in my life, when I was at my most vulnerable, he let me down .He chose to take a different path and leave me to pick up the pieces of my now broken life. I was changed forever, letting others take charge of my destiny, until, once again, I'm let down in the cruellest of ways.Love. Heartbreak. Betrayal. High emotion and angst. Everything and more you would expect from a Lesley Jones novel.Conviction is a sexy, emotional, standalone novel that contains adult content, and scenes that may be triggering for some.",
