  "title": "The Boy who Lived with Ghosts",
  "description": "A disturbing though often hilarious memoir, told uniquely through the eyes of a young child. This is a coming-of-age story of a boy, growing up in 1960s England. As shocking as it is, this is a story of survival and a boy’s desperate attempts to save his mother from the madness and the horror.“Mitchell's overview of then rundown Portsmouth, England in the 1960s shocks as he deftly bypasses all the clichéd elements of the 60s via gruesome images of destitution, a cast of unbelievably crazy misfits and the smells, local language, and music of a bleak and impoverished part of England. It's a wakeup call that not everyone experienced the ‘summers of love.’ The most amazing aspect of the book is his ability to re-capture his own voice at ages 5, 7, 8 and 13. John Mitchell's debut memoir dazzles. It's original, clever, and amid all the horror, funny.” -- IndieReader“The title suggests a ghost story, but a boy witnessing firsthand the onset and evolution of a mental breakdown is as bloodcurdling as anything supernatural, perhaps more so. A startling, sometimes-chilling tale of mental illness and familial abuse.” -- Kirkus Reviews“The Boy who Lived with Ghosts is a brilliant read. John’s story triggered a lot of emotions for me when I was reading and it brought me close to tears…I think it’s simply brilliant, I am going to recommend this book to you because it offers an insight into John’s heart-breaking childhood which will make you appreciate all that you have a lot more, The Boy who Lived with Ghosts is definitely a worthwhile read.” -- Online Book Club",
