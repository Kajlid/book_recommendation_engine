  "description": "Love Awakens Their Royal SoulFor weeks, Blane Pazu, aka the immortal demon Pazuzu, oldest Prince of the Hanbi Faction, had experienced the pull of a female essence— something he’d been searching for and believed wasn’t meant to be for years— his life mate. The timing sucked since it was imperative to find his lost amulet to break Lucifer’s curse and thereby save humanity… so he chose to ignore it.“This amulet chose you to find the demon it belongs to. If you fail, humanity will die.”Zara Santiago came to Sin City five years ago to hide from her past. She’d kept a low profile, too scared she’d be found and killed. She should’ve known better than to go to the famous fortuneteller, Madame Leilah, with her friends. For one, she didn’t believe in anything as frivolous as the mystique world, let alone demons, angels and shit. Hence, the amulet was thrown into a bowl at her entrance hall and forgotten about… until it started to glow.The day the black-haired angel fell into his arms, Blane knew he was lost. But how could he trust a stranger who was asking too many questions and knew exactly what his amulet looked like? Was the evil goddess behind her appearance or Lucifer himself? Why then, knowing of the danger trusting her held for them all, was it possible that the feisty mortal with the huge blue eyes managed to unleash Blane’s darkest passion?A Guardian’s spell had been cast but Blane was left wondering… who wielded the power? Him… or the mortal human?Forged by Twilight Paranormal Romance",
