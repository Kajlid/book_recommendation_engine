  "title": "King Solomon's Wives: Hunted",
  "description": "The two thousand descendants of King Solomon’s ancient harem have the ultimate power of seduction: Their very touch is as addictive as any drug. But that power comes at a price: Wives die giving birth. They can only bear daughters. They are only fertile until the age of twenty-four. Hunted for hundreds of generations by men who crave their touch and fear its power, the Wives have kept themselves safe by following three simple rules:  -A Wife shall have no meaningful relationships outside the clan. -A Wife’s addictive touch may be used only for procreation or to protect the clan. -A Wife shall sacrifice herself for her daughter at the age of twenty-four. But tonight, the rules have been broken, and someone must pay. In the blistering first episode of KING SOLOMON’S WIVES, we meet Sumarra on the night she plans to conceive. Instead, she and the other wives find themselves under attack from a group of male hunters, intent on destroying them. Sumarra has always broken small rules and indulged rebellious tendencies. Now that the Wives have been found, her defiance will either be their salvation or her own undoing.HUNTED is Episode One of the KING SOLOMON'S WIVES series. Episode Two, ADDICTED, is available February 2013. http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17...",
