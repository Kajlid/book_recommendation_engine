  "title": "Son of Saint",
  "description": "An old lady from Delirium MC. The president from Reckless Rebellion MC. Merge between the sheets in one hot, illicit affair.  An unexpected pregnancy. And the birth of a son – Deacon Cruz – torn between two clubs.  To be a ruthless outlaw or a charming gentleman, Deacon ignites a wild reaction everywhere he turns. From childhood with his mother, Trudy, to running away at sixteen, he remains allied to both good and evil with his own brand of spiritual wickedness. His mother built him and his father defined him, but his friendship with Sal Raniero tests his fortitude, forcing the uprising of a Deacon – the future Saint – and learning to play for one––Himself.  Standalone. There is no romance here, but there is plenty of BROMANCE in this brash look at the two young men – Sal Raniero and Deacon Cruz – from their early days on the streets of New Orleans. Lots of kink, violence, and Sami-stylings.",
