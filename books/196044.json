  "description": "Isabella Lovino moved to New York City to hide from the demons of her past, leaving everyone behind. Her troubled history makes it difficult to get a job, but when an opportunity comes up to work at an architectural firm, she takes it. On her first day of work she bumps into a stranger on the street and her whole world changes. The gorgeous Jason Hart owns his own architectural firm, but that’s not enough. He knows what he wants, and what he wants is the beautiful Isabella Lovino—the same thing he has wanted since college. When he sees her at the restaurant, he knows he can’t let her get away this time. Will she notice him now?",
