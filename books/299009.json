From the word go, he grabs you by the scruff of the neck and won’t let go, as he brings you on a roller coaster ride through the madcap but totally reasonable ideas racing through his mindThe author is nothing if not resilient, and he has suffered setback after setback, targeted with cruel and unfounded defamation, which takes its toll on him personally, socially, and financially.
