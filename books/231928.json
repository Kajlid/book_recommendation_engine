  "description": "It’s on nights such as this, as I lie on my back watching my breath mist up in the chill air above me, that I wonder.How is it that the stars haven’t changed?With everything that’s going on – the war, the decimation, the end of life as we know it – how can they still be up there, twinkling merrily away as if nothing’s wrong? As if it’s all still okay?I just don’t get it.The world as we know it has ended. Bree and her little sister Millie are two of the few survivors, kept safe thanks to Captain Brunton and his squad of soldiers. It's a hard life, even harder when Bree doesn't know where they're going or what they're doing. Captain Brunton's Rules - Number You aren't a soldier and you don't need to know.But then Millie gets captured and all of a sudden that word, that word that's only ever been whispered around Bree and her sister - \"breeders\" - is suddenly everywhere. Bree doesn't even know what it means, but she knows it's trouble.Everything's changing and Bree doesn't know who to trust. Kyle, who sees Bree only as a little sister, though she's desperate for more? Captain Brunton, who's gruff and snappish and intimidating? Or Lance Corporal Kendrick, who's made no secret of the fact he thinks a meal in Bree's mouth is a waste of precious food?**This is the first part of a serial**",
