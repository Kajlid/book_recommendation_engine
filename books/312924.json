  "description": "All I needed was a passing grade. I never expected to sleep with my Professor for it. When Ava told me she couldn’t fail my class or she would lose her student aide I made her a deal that would benefit both of us. One night of off the wall hot sex in return for an A in my class. Neither of us expected it to be more than one time, until it happened again, and again, and pretty soon we were blurring the lines between student and teacher. If anyone found out I’d lose everything, but maybe Ava was worth losing everything for. *** This is a STANDALONE novella with a HEA. This story contains dark contents that might be triggering to some. ***",
