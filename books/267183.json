  "description": "Enslaved by the memories of my past, I hide away in plain sight. Happy to be viewed as the disgruntled daughter, the storm to my sister's sunshine. To the outside world, I'm a loner. Inside my little bubble, I'm lonely. I lost myself and I'm afraid to find the girl I used to be. She was weak. A word I refuse to be defined by any longer. Enter Rocco Shay. I hated him. Until I didn't...I pushed the chaos of my life into his, begrudgingly and unapologetically.",
