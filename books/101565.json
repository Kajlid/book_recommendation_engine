  "title": "Interweaving Worlds: Systemic Interactions in Eurasia, 7th to the 1st Millennia BC",
  "description": "How do we understand the systemic interactions that took place in and between different regions of prehistoric Eurasia and their consequences for individuals, groups and regions on both a theoretical and empirical basis? Such interactions helped create economic and cultural spheres that were mutually dependent yet distinct. This volume, emerging from a conference hosted in memory of Professor Andrew Sherratt in Sheffield in April 2008 and in honour of his contributions to large-scale economic history, presents some diverse archaeological responses to this problem. These range from from \"world-systems\" through \"ritual economies\" to \"textile rivalries\" and address the challenge of documenting, explaining and understanding the progressively more interwoven worlds of prehistoric Eurasia.",
