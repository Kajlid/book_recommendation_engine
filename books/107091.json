  "description": "All Mary Warren wanted was to meet the man God had pre-destined for her and be married. She dreamed of that, counted on that and saved herself for that her entire life. Then a casual decision to walk home after church left her in line for a brutal rapist's attack. Grappling for answers and straining to keep her faith alive, Mary discovers she's pregnant and is instantly thrown into a world she neither bargained for nor wants for herself. Though never bending to the world's expectations, Mary chooses life and goes on in spite of her circumstances. Completing her education, she moves back home to begin her life's work and with it meets Brian Devonshire, also a recent transplant and unbeknownst to her, the man she's been waiting for her entire life. Just as everything is finally going right in Mary's life, the man suspected of raping her is found and now Mary has to delve into the deepest recesses of her mind to remember and her soul not to send an innocent man to prison for a crime he didn't commit. Then on Christmas Eve Mary finds a letter attached to her front door that within its contents is the answer that can change her life forever.",
